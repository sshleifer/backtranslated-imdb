It seems to be a bit in the middle way where Watch On Rhine is concerned. One loves it very much, thanks to its honesty, his attitude of freedom and good acting, or one who hates its propaganda, intermediate dialogue, paperwork characters and general behavior. I fall very much in the last category, and I got a film and played, - in connection with the activities of the European refugees in Washington during the war - bearing with crushing, for the most valuable to acting, and yet only in the middle. The author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the worthless angel. His sessions were written to people who shared his view, and he regularly realized the ideas that had not been done by the author and viewers except to describe how bad the “other side” is. Even when I get a hundred percent agreement and what he says, - like in Rhine - I still can't stand the way he says. Its characters are real, and when his ear for discussion shows a particular channel for how people say he does not have real or natural transparency. He really had something new to say. I fully agree with the late Mary McCarthy who had been a long-term destruction of Hellman several years ago. For those who think the theater are dead or for extremis and crave the good old days, I urge the Best Look of the Rhine, as bad in his way as an Angel in America, which might only show that the playground was one foot in grave sixty years ago.
