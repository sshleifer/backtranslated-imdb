My God! Please, with the love of everything sacred, Do not look at this Movie! It's 82 minutes of my life I will never leave again. Indeed, I could stop looking half way through. But I thought it might be better. Haiku. Anyone who enjoyed this film is a very sick and lost person. It is not surprising that we in Australia / New Zealanders have a bad reputation during the filming. Everything about this movie is bad, from acting to edit. I don't usually write reviews here, but in this case I will make discrimination. I just loved anyone who was warning me before recruiting this tragedy
