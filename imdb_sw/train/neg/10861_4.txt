Maybe I'm missing something because I have read the most beautiful things about the self-deceased person than I've read the bad reviews - and I don't know. I love my colors to have a little style for those who talk, watch, and act like Humphrey Bogart in Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. No characters in this film have a style or presence or whatever you call. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. Looking at him, looking-out the bed is on the far and dashing, speaking of the soft archetype as you will get. Or, take Jane Wyatt as a fatale of women as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I saw in time. He is not only to influence the role. As for the plot, it is tired and not worth any realistic or anything new for that type. I could predict the consequences of the self-deceptive person after five minutes. And the end of the cat-and-mouse follow the area is open old man. Ten to fifteen minutes of anything that happens really ruined any movie stirring may have to go for it.
