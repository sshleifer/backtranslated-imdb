I loved the first two movies, but this film was a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they did this terrible film. Something with a plastic gun and a toy car, which can go into another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were very funny, but terrorists in this are stupid and not funny. I don't believe this movie is a waste of time.
