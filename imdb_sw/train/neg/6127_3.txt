If I am from Hungary, I have heard many people say good things about Goodbye to now, but I really don't understand why all the shock. I liked the many points of the movie, some of the delights that I really enjoyed, but the non-commenting characters again, like in every Hungarian film, and the story is also very good. I liked the first half, but I started getting bored, and then I found the entire BORING film. <br /> <br /> Rudolf PÃ©ter is as good as always, Reviczky is brilliant too, but others are just there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> Is it many years still needed for a good Hungarian film?
