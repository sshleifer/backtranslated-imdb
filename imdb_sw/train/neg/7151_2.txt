I am surprised to say that I have seen both the fast and angry films. Indeed, the squares have been bad, and they might be a little cheesy, but I love the car running, and all the good cars, and midnight citizens. And the disease enjoys seeing four. Want to know what is the difference between the three and Redline? Good acting, thought out of the plot, even if it's potboilers, and last but not least, directors who have a clue. All three were made by the most competent directors, all of them took a film in different directions, similar to an exciting. The employment of Hollywood.And the script.Yikes.Its Secrets of Theater Science 3000 bad. Yes, the movie had a few cool cars, but you can't see that many are working, and the point is being turned to evil you can't get excited and evicted, d if cars don't attract you, why not go to a movie like this ? <br /> <br /> Im in the audience and a young group, and I can't stop laughing loudly. this was just a debacle. Use the F&F movies Go to the Nascar Race. Go to the karting and track yourself. For whatever you do, try Redline as bad cheese.
