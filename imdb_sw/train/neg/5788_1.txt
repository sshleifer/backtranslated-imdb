Okay, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is associated with some amazing business with the Italian Italians Silvio Berlusconi) issued the terrible chaos of Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What! I'm talking about? Well, Macek took a whole series of Japanese sci-fi (ie Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS to talk - believing in the fact that the US listeners are also dumb to understand the beauty of stories and silent crafts - much more published for violent content, he added some romantic jumbo, he called it by using some of the worst voice actors on this side of Hell (Singing Reba West was - and still can't forgive and general anger, especially compared to Ms Mari Iijima ... And the result was a series of 85 pieces and hundreds of persistent problems with the holes of the plot. In fact, mecha were cool looking (especially those in the "Macross Saga") and the parts of the plot that remained remained good. But anything worth about Robotech is not the result of Macek's work or "voice talents" he employed. It was because of the persecution and effort (unacceptable - why would I have the courage to complain of the HG preference here?) Japanese creators. All of us who eventually got the wind of the real deal and compared to the nature of Robotech now we want to have been open to Robotech. Nature is very good, usually, and makes more sense. It is worth it: however, it made something of value: it caused the creator of the legendary anime Leiji Matsumoto to start a defense campaign of the Japanese creators' intellectual property from non-approved and unacceptable for work that people who don't like Carl Macek produce.
