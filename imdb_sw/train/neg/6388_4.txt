Brother Quay is directors, based on common ideas, should be connected to make a short film. I really loved their first aspect, the Institute of Fundamentals, but based on their sophomore efforts, the Tuner of the Earthquake Piano, I agreed to admit that they do not have close to compare their old minds at the height of the element. Piano Tuner is, of course, a good film to watch, and often listen. Unfortunately, it is a set of limits to deal with its shortage of stories and glacial. Reading the synopsis of the plot, looks like a very good story. But the brothers fail to bring life. One thing you should consider to avoid completely at the future: talk. My God, it's bad here. Big garden.
