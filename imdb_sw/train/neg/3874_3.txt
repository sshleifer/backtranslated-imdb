This film was predictable, that all the time you expect a clear defendant is innocent, and there is another serious problem. However ... is not recommended. He just continues to act, and continues to ignore it. Did Mary find a good witness in her place, and still believed her? And what was "a few trap"? There was no trap. He confronted him, he said, "I am sorry. I should kill someone" He left, and that's the end of it. They make an effort to use other suspects, (like one of the last century century girls) but have never been. True, all the characters do not have developed. They don't have deep, and the settings are just amazingâ€¦ who sits on the recycling factory? Her choppy and whatever is well developed. For example: When he comes out of his place after having a beer, he gets a picture and he runs and holds him and they end up having sex in the car ... what was it? His actions were not shown. In a car he worked fearful if it was possible for rape - but then all we see is to wake up the next morning. booooooooo Can be better. sooo better.
