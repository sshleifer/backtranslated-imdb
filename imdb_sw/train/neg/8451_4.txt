I agree that I loved the first half of sleepers. It seemed good, acting was better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. Popular Hollywood film. But ... No one mentioned right now (at least in recent comments 20), when he came to the court room and Brat Pitt's behavior followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are accused of the right to murder, i felt. This movie shook my mind. <br /> <br /> Destroyers of warning! Why did anyone accept their false allegations, witnessed by the priest? If these two men were with him, why would they not say this during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a member of the jury, would you believe? Is it wise to give the impetus to the killers? <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but at the end, the story is very weak, and this tells me. This movie had great potential. 4/10
