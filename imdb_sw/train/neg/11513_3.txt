* It may have criminals <br /> <br /> I bent back to be right for this film. I knew it was Madonna's star. I knew that it lasted a week in movies. I knew it had a lot of negative views. I did not expect a thorough study of class, culture and sexuality as we had previously found in Italy. The benefit of course lasted ten minutes. Madonna has a Gorgon rich, wise, giving birth who goes on vacation with her husband who was pregnant with flippant friends (a woman of brunette is as bad as Madonna, showing the facial displays). Adriano Giannini plays the first wife of the ship whose attitude of Madonna is fun to humiliate and treat as dirt in every area they are together. Why is he such a bitch to him? Just because the plot requires so that later after they both get marooned on the Mediterranean island left a table will turn and will teach him a lesson. As it is understood how they fall in love despite having the most common thing and being abused by two-thirds of the movie. It 's removed "is an unfamiliar, simple, top-to-end movie. Madonna provides a common performance of wood. There are many dumb cases: Madonna singing and dancing for Giannini needs, a wonderful place with Madonna and many scenes where they beat and catch him in the butt. Guy Ritchie is making his "stylish" layout that is interesting here. Film has some of the worst talks I heard on a big film in several years. The end is soap and it can't. It is basically "Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" under the old weakness and feeling of last humor. Maybe a little ego is so big that he insists on continuing to show himself a potential actor. Please give us, Madge, for us and yours. This is not his bad movie however. The difference is still the "Shanghai Surprise". He did nothing more than that ... still.
