Balls, small computer pictures in the background below bring a fantastic story into this film. Anything did not take you by surprise, you can even tell him when Bryan Adams' voices come, which are at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit horse, is given to be angry when it explains what is happening. Stories are not needed, though, everything that happens is obvious. You can even tell what the horses say, although all they do is nearby. What would be good, but all horses make the same sound - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laugh, etc.. There is no difference between horse sounds. <br /> <br /> Young children can like this film, though. It is enough soppy for the family to sit and watch, and there is a small risk of anyone is afraid. If you have nothing else to do, and you want to watch movies with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, this is unacceptable.
