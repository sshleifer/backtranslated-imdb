I usually appear to watch Lancaster movies - especially when it is necessary to go to nuts with its presence of screens like in Elmer Gantry. However, its great strength, its magnetism, was constantly also its great weakness as she rarely, as ever, played a little. And this is a lack of cunning that prevents rain. Now I understand that her behavior was meant to be a kind of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under her spell is quite unknown. He should be smart but it doesn't seem so when the blarney of Lancaster is healed on the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most watched movies I have seen and in the way it is very obvious that this is a movie driven by playing. It seems like it was hit on the sound point rather than in the West as clear as it should be. Overall, the most registered film.
