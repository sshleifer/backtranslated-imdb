This is really low in entertainment. Although there are many bad movies. <br /> In the Gangster / Drug Addiction is difficult to have a convincing story (these films are not, the meaning of Sebastians for example cannot be further excluded and aggravated). This movie is not suitable.) Tristan is really excluded from his family but why was it again? What is related to his father again that he needs to ask for permission to go out during his time? A fascinating picture though asking about the lack of need for the rebellious behavior of children in a high-class family. But this film does not make this direction. Although there may be the ability to judge for random backflashes. Was he not already down and out, why does he do it again? So there are some interesting questions that are bringing here for a good social suspect (but again, this movie is not only available, because of considering the "cool" production techniques and special effects without giving characters during reflection and beyond all compelling story along the way where they want to be and not pay attention to letting the story breath and nature change.) <br /> <br /> It wants to be a drama for not promoting the misuse of objects and violence (it will not be political these days, not ? but on the other hand is nothing more then a cheap movie (if there are many out there) and set an average of executives with Vinnie Jones who can not completely destroy what remains of his reputation by doing what he does every day. <br /> <br /> So all in i .. just .. can not recommend it. <br>> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
