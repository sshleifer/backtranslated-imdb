I lost this film to think it was the 1959 sad version I saw as a child. It was not. So I was very disappointed with what I felt was the minimum, the development of bad habits, and above all, failing to show the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "Dogs of Flanders" are just "off" of the film. Get the 1959 edition!
