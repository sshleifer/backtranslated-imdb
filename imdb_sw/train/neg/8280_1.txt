Watch this I saw especially advertising ads. DHL, Strips of Aquawhite, Rockstar and more. It is the placement of one product after another. It is quite clear how this film got money. "Acting" of Jessica Simpson is laughable. Any dick should never get a job because it plays the same characteristic of the lame. "Story" is back to this very long business. I can't believe that this film was even taken for the release of exhibitions. For a long time you watch this film more embarrassing to everyone involved. The only grace to save grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who finds the time of the screen as Jessica's cousin. I'm ashamed to look at the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this.
