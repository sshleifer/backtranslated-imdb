My girl has chosen this; as a South African and raised African Africa I have seen the plot of this film and the premise without distrust. Believing that class and racism will be easier and better suspension would only be from an individual unknown to ante-bellum south. Faster! I wonder how they had a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actor like Andie McDowell (formerly well knows) to participate in this trick
