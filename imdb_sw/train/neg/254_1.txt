Ah, Bait. How do I hate them? I would count the way. 1. You are trying to be funny, but it is corny and unhappy; All jokes are predictable and you expect, and when it comes, you don't encourage laughter. Instead, I want to blow. 2. You are trying to be wonderful, but you are not trusted; The woman struggles to the horrible level, and the "bad man" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as horrible as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to think Bill Gates trying to be afraid of a gunman. Isn't it working, is it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. make me to hit. 3. You are trying to have many steps, but instead they are lighter and more often. And when the action is over, the camera journey should be lost, for the events surrounding it more than what is in the Blair Publisher Project, and I broke it, and again I want to scream. 4. You are trying to be a good film, but you have failed, you are well known, well known! I would walk without clothes in the Sahara with a full pack of jerky beef with no water, no sun, and only Meryl Streep of the company. This hell would be more interesting than one minute spent looking at everyone in Bait through their way through the story idiotically written by Bill Gates to a bad person, and we should not even talk about a big bomb that comes out of a car whose character Jamie Foxx has been taken out. of CLIFF, but somehow managed to avoid ... just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I've never watched a movie that is bad, again.
