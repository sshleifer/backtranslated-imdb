Years ago the movie goes to a friend and I went to see the awesome movie that we thought would be good because it had the stars of John Cassavetes. For those unknown, John Cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actor Gena Rowlands), who was chosen for Oscars three times, who wrote and guided various kinds of beautiful films by using his income as an actor to keep away. Until we see the Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes' earnings were given from any film presented to him. We only knew what this film is before we see it we can totally escape. But we didn't go out. At that time, my friend and I boldly showed that it was a very bad movie made. Now in fact, this is not true. I have seen many films supported on Friday night on Cinemax (did I just say loudly) that is worse than Incubus. Almost any movie of Brian Bosworth's movie is by definition of the movie worse than Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus Wins Martians is a bad movie than Incubus. However, since then I have been using the Incubus as the bottom threshold that I don't want to fall. When talking to this friend about the film I saw I will continue to say that it was better (or worse) than Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
