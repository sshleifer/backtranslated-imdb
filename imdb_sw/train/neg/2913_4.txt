it's really nice to see improvements in the Turkish movie industry, however, I would expect another creative thing from Togan Gokbakar. starting the script, which I think is not written wisdom as others can imagine. especially the beauty of the dialogue, which put the audience in a position that, if they were not able to understand the situation, which often make the movie impossible. also has an obvious end; you can easily guess the killer from the beginning. The weakest part of the situation is that it is impossible for patients with mental illness to make them like ordinary people, like experts once !!! they have ever sought opportunities for patients who are on heavy drugs, act as professionals and use all medical terms that even ordinary people can not use ??? !!!!!! also in the area where the staff were looking for the most dangerous patient, and out of any weapon of self-defense was another remarkable point of film. and the area was very suitable for "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! those are not the only parts of movie genius. there was also a lot of forecasts in the film. The symptoms of the most dangerous patient was the actual copy from Hannibal, also the appearance of Togan's last end is definitely the worst mistake that he could do in his first movie! The debate on the size of the film and interviews which the lecturers gave only to make people curious and convince them to see. Gen is a general desire. I would like to be surprised, if Sahan was not so popular, would Togan be able to beat this film, and this budget amount? I hope Togan would realize that it is not the style of play as a director as he said in an interview. he was Hitchcock who did so wisely with Night Shyamalan continued well! he should appreciate the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet! expects to be more attentive and creative in the future in this great industry!
