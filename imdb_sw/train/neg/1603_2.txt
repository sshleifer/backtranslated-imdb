If it was not for the Barry Diamond exhibition and Art Evans as clueless stoners, I had no reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> conspiracy centers around the 10-year secondary school meeting, which takes place in secondary school to leave independence (it looks more like a drawing from the flick of the budget below the 1950 budget), The student who had contempt for the class dealt with the most prank prank. The student wants to kill the whole class of revenge. John Hughes loves his characters very much, as only one student is murdered with a lunch woman (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We have been led to believe that together the horny is killed, but never see something exploded! This is a bad movie that continued to decline in the National Lampoon in 80 and 90 years.
