I was desperate. The film was slightly predictable and did not live up to the place set in the box. After saying this, the characters were well-developed, the story of the trailer was used in a unique cluster and house was a spooky beautiful but simply adapted for me. I continued to wait a great AHHHHH or BOO! But it has never come. Over and above the film was experiencing a negative picture of the special effects of the poor. So show a lot of bad thing and not use the sky and viewer ideas to create horror and emphasize. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you are looking for a small but low-budget film.
