I think this is almost completely I need to say. I feel responsible for explaining my actions though. I have never seen the production of that weapon, and I mean to be in every sense of the word. Although the function of the physical camera, MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike the exclusive independent films that have been saved by their good reputation and conspiracy, this unfortunately has a bad script, a fierce and very bad, terrible horrible characters. It is a crime for every self-independent film, distribution like the Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films that have died of silent deaths. I don't know who Kornbluth's brothers know about Sony, but that could be my only explanation of how the family of the amateur family has received the distribution. I really believe why they took this. The only part of this film that holds any self is his head. However, the reason for that is even stop. I hope this review will save a few people who can have fun with this film from going to watch it. I have seen many movies at my time, and I am very sorry at the movies, but this was too big. I can't forget the 'tunnel', by pointing to the most important thing in my life experience. Shame is very low.
