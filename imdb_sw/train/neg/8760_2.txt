This film involves non-introduction (with respect to sex) that cannot resist the basic sexual needs. Although the best players participate, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, come from a puerile script which depends almost entirely on clever negotiations; which is not. The role of Nixon consists of better lines, but often comes into them very quickly, with a temporary error that should be closed to the director. A large period uses every available item, used or not, and fully exposes this attempt on the comedy.
