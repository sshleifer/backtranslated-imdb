This movie is awesome. I was looking forward to, if I thought "Lantana" was good. <br /> <br /> The following comments may have heroes * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, good things: seem to be good, other displays are the same. Bad things are anything else about it. The story, as you may know, is about some of the blokes that may go fishing and discover the body, by losing that they are getting Friday but they are still fishing and finally announcing it on Sunday when they return to a mobile phone mobile). However the film takes time (the boy does not have time to reach this main event). <br /> <br /> Of the characters (about a dozen), no one looks like another (that is, I think, consistent, because all can not be seen). I was so surprised and unable to explain in detail how the characters are related, and not close to the end of the film that I could make a family tree. It is difficult to think about our films that are not quite good, which is a failure of the story structure, as the behavior of a character appears to be bad before a fishing trip like. Once you set the top bar, it is hard on-top for everyone to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> There is a sexual shortage in logic. The killer sends the body into the lake, and somehow appears in the mountain range. Fishermen go out on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne gets home at night after his wife sleeps on the bed. Then the first thing the next morning the fighters at the door to take him to the center. Um, have not heard the phone? At the center, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after the body report? From the bottom of the story is a debate that they really got after getting the body. This is a secret - everyone asks "how could you do that?" and the audience ask the same question. (Debate about what to do with the body is an important area in the "Rescue"). I know exactly what I could do in their situation. A person needs to walk in a car, drive a cell phone, call warriors, wait, and guide them again. If others are waiting on camp and fish, who cares? All this seems to be false. The only thing that was true was that, if the girl was black, local artists were caught by the actions of fishermen as a racist - "they did not do it as a white girl." Since there are concerns about who could kill a girl (I think it has been described immediately), and there is no secret, if the audience sees the killer in the opening area. So I am sitting there at the same time tired and confused, when there is moving - not on the plot, but the theme. Suddenly it becomes on the stability of the dead aboriginals who cause the end end and abnormal things on black-white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is an Australian film "with the best condition," according to The Age.
