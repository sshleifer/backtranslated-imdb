Dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not do wrong here, I am not one of the most affected but I was thinking that superimposition was a long-term practice, especially for 60. For some time I thought they could record this film long ago and took it forever to be cut off and released. But even if I know they didn't have a mobile phone in 60 years ... What I am looking for in movies is especially good news with a good message. Working is secondary, the effects are secondary, I don't even know a few dimensions. However, in movies like this bad act, dexterity, etc. add on to make a bad movie worse - that's what happened to me by Celestine Prophecy. My wife said the book was really good and though I am not in all spiritual things I can see in some way that it can be brought in a reliable way - the film did not succeed. <br /> <br /> There may be one reason to watch this though. If you like cheesy movies it will be right for you. If the IMD stars are chees instead of quality it must be tested for this ten-star film. <br /> <br /> The way, the three stars are for the fact that there are the worst movies out there, like "Important Mass" (see comments on one person - the hilarious one). Celestine prophecy is at least entertaining at a certain level.
