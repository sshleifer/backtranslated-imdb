1993 was a year. This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas win Oscar. Who knows I will be extra in movies with him? I was a paid bonus in "Back to My Boyfriend," which was hit in the Austin neighborhood of Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thanking God manufacturers had a change of heart!) I was in the sports area. I ran to watch the film the day released on the movie. It's more than a comedy than a terrible movie. But ... with a good laugh, you might want to look at it. There is nothing that is close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun's dead" quality, but the reason for cheese is good enough. ciao
