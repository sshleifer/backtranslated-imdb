What did Franco Zeffirelli think? Does Hollywood have the role of this efficiency, or can I find comfort in the idea that someone who did not have English as the first language missed the classic score of Charlotte Bronte? I don't think I can improve the comments I wrote below, so I'll just explain: "Jane Eyre is a very good book, the scribe should read it sometimes." It is true that these two films were sad. But worried actors, because the screen editor left all things well. Discussions that allow you to understand Jane and Rochester have a meeting of ideas and a common sense of fun ... deleted from the script. The proposal of marriage, the announcer of the fortune ... have gone. Obstacles, half interesting, half sincere, and Jane as a text sprite from Olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair ... removed. It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to renew the end of the novel and the cooperation of Jane and the Rivers family. But it was not forgiven that he had stopped love from one of the most beautiful stories written. <br /> <br /> Are you accredited and go to the 1983 series (?) Mini and Timothy Dalton.
