A fool with only a wonderful movie about a child who is injured when it gets Santa is not true (???). He grows and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes a list of people who don't like. One Christmas triggers and put out to kill people without color - dressed as Santa of course. Boring and only the worst killer of Santa's film. If you're looking for a year, it's not here. Only a few killings are shown and not good and bad effects. Many of the movies tend to Brandon Maggart speaking himself and going slowly going crazy. Script is a trite, acting is awesome and leads to the end that was with me staring slack-jawed on TV. Hardly, I had to restore the tape and reinforce it again to make sure I didn't write! Really finished the poor. <br /> <br /> If you want Christmas scary rental rental "Christmas Black" (the original version of 70s) is not a terrible remake. Avoid this at all costs.
