This film is exactly what you get when you expand your ability, it is like someone who just took a test drive and then beat it with the formula 1 Grand Prix (I can't add, US Grand Prix if everyone can pull out due to dodgy tires and you can only win ), so far this film is located. Now don't do this bad way, I love B movies, next to my half-collection of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how this movie is bad. <Br /> <br /> The first story (for B-Movie) is not bad, has the ability to make the brand of B-Movie, did not speak on Friday 13th ability, but no even less. But what leaves the film down is acting, not the second second I believe anything, is like watching QVC unless speakers at QVC have heavy tones. I would like to say I saw a bad movie, but I can't.
