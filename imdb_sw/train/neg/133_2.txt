Well the reason to see it on the movie was that it was a preview of the sneak, maybe I've never seen this awesome movie of the youth. I mean we didn't have this enough yet? Screaming and Movie scary at least didn't take them too! The plan stands up, and acting is the worst I saw. (Godzilla is the only one who can compare, which is also the only movie that competes with the worst I saw in the movie and this.) killed, and who does not. (and you don't care.) They only knew me earlier was Denise, and she was the best actor of the talent I ever saw for this excuse for the film. <br /> <br /> End as far away from this film as possible. (2/10)
