Revolution always provides great opportunities for great films since, in fact, many protests have been a major event. Unfortunately, what this film is not in the play is compensated for excessive weight. A person doesn't care who is winning, losing, dying or living - just to finish it as soon as possible. This is due to the large scale of what appears to me to use on the back technology. The events of Paris and the French country have high quality cards on them. They can be done well in an open and left way. One cannot expect the wonderful effects of the "Daggers House of Flying" or "Golden Compass," but, after all, this is a 2002 fiber production. loses a number of times to enter and leave the rooms. In my view, this film returns to the French Revolution of the 1790s in the "paper-mache" revolution of "sheets of paper".
