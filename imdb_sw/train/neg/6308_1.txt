A full indication of the content of this film, as Brit I did not know that there was an exception in the US Navy during WWII. A very bold attempt to bring this reality to the world. However, the movies are exciting, the direction does not exist, acting is wood and script is just one after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have been sitting and abolished from the beginning to the end in the worst way that this has been put together. This can be a great movie, the story for most of us out of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad reality of the issue is the way that is put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which can change the view of people, has been caused by a low budget, the wrongly directed movie. I only hope that next time, one of the great studio will take this theme and do right.
