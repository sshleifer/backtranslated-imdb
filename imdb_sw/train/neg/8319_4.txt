Do not like it. All 'Twists' are good predictable, if you have seen any movies within the last decade, and a few interesting parts (where a person uses the context to make a decision) are few and missing a lot of punch, since the mystery' has already been shown before these symptoms are explained . <br /> <br /> (demolition, type) <br /> <br /> Acting is a great honor. The story is just too bad. The whole force 'is still awake' is replaced by astral testing (not considering). <br /> <br /> Surgery sites are original, have little concern, but are quite banal. It's not scary, but it's not memorable. Terrence Howard is the most interesting role so far, so far. <br /> <br /> Type of boring, in general.
