You believe in God or you don't. You believe in Jesus or you don't. You believe He is the Son of God or you don't. The choice is up to you. Director Denys Arcand has done everything he could to bring Jesus back to the only historical, social worker, man of two men, rather than the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, Who opened the heaven to us again. Encouraging Bang Big, the world comes from evolution, rather than seeing the beauty of creation. The film shows a modern specialist bringing "a modern result" to an actor who plays Jesus in Passion Play, who entertains them with pleasure in his play ........ The sexual relationship with one of the female players of Passion Play rather than show his love for God through cruelty. More often than the refusal of the Church director is obvious. <br /> <br /> The director has tried to resemble the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion Play actor. This is a fascinating attempt, but to show the Resurrection and the transplant of the Passion player's body in other bodies suggests how the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I did not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus' seat.
