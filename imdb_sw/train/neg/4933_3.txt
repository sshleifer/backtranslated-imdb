This movie was not bad when compared to two original sequels by nature. Directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday the 13th name. Acting is very serious, but the year's and special effects make it interesting. That's one thing that I like about shouting Mad George (making an impact artist for the film), its effects are far-of-the-wall and wonderful that they will allow you to watch a bad movie to find out how mad they will get. The movie is not really all gory, but there is an EXTREMELY bad eyeball-munching scene in the middle of linking maggot toy (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes an alien appearance that probably was not too enthusiastic about but needed money at that time, maybe? If you liked the fourth unit of weirdo (all my favorite 5), maybe you would like this. I loved it better than Matrix! Enjoy.
