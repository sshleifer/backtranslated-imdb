This film was very popular. I am a great executive of the film and I have seen a preview for this film for months. When I was worried about how this movie would be true, my friends thought it would be better to make me up. Then I went and saw it, I had come down to my seat close to sleep till I remembered that I paid this movie. I pretended to laugh at a lot of things in the movie so I would like to feel bad and destroy the good condition I had, and I wanted to get the money worth the movie! I always go in to the film with a clear mind, I don't try to get into them with many expectations, but this film was not interesting. Now it was the worst movie that I ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent to see many previews for movies or you like very slow and corny games you can enjoy them, but for true fans of comedy Id they say. Maybe even look at the Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go and see parents instead !!!
