Where to start. The movie started very well, but after a 30-minute mark it took a look at the clock. Fear at the beginning of the film was good but then the story came in. It was just hitting the stupider and stupider as the time struck by. <br /> <br /> The actors offered moderate performance in this film however, I have a little bored with Vinny Jones regularly scowling in the film. <br /> <br /> Like the film dragged on, and taking my word for it, it's dragged on, just getting more and more far fetched. <br /> <Help *** *** SPOILER *** WORKING SPOILER *** WORKING WATER *** When I thought the film could not be worse, towards the last cargo if the bones looked at the monsters turned, just eating dead people he didn't really know. It turned out that some kind of eating meat and good people die at the end. Finishing really makes us laugh how bad it was. Once the lead role loses Vinny Jones, he becomes a new killer. <br /> <br /> In the closing, this film made Creep look like the best awesome movie. I gave 1 star because the female leadership did a good job but even could not save the fall of a movie trailer!
