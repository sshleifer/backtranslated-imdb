As a movie critic for several Dutch websites, you must see a lot of movies, and not all very good. Some movies are very bad, you will not be surprised that they are automatically uploaded to the video. For taboo, IÃ¢m was surprised that it was released on the video. This is a very low budget of bad bad quality of text. The youth group plays a taboo game. They write their desires for sickness or action, and later people are killed by their own worms. The question is, should we believe what we see? The film has a fascinating ability to attract, and I will not give you here. But what could be interesting is that it is an uncomfortable, unpleasant act and for no reason. Some participants have played in the big names before, why did they write on this? If you see this anywhere, try deleting it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this film.
