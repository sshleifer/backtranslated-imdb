B-off movies are going, SCARECROW is one of the worst, which is very sad to stay. A lonely high school student who is always taken by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up going to his mother of sexually abused sex and redneck drinking. Then he throws the child into the maize field and kills him. Apparently, the children 's life was transferred to the scarecrow which goes near the killing of the attackers who tortured him and teachers. This scarecrow, apart from having a single snappy fabric for each of its victims, can also make flips such as Matrix through the air and kill people on daylight routes in the afternoon. Also, why did he look like a corpse? Like two unwanted sequels that followed this, this is not even worth laughing.
