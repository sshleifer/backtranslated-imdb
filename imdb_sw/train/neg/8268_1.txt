This movie is awesome. Everything in it is done in the past. There is nothing original. I can't stand when the authors did not come with their own plots. The girl makes a passion for her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, looks much like a film in 80 years called Big. It is even more sad to be acting on Jennifer Garner. He doesn't do as he is 13 he does just as he is stupid. From that moment on, you can think the whole plot. He gets a good job and just so happens that a friend had 13 work with him. Wow, how amazing! But, no .... her friend is bad and turns on her, trying to get her job. But, of course, he succeeds at the end when he comes with a "great" idea. There is also a place to play on a film that I have seen a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I like this film.
