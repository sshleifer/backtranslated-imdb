I just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and I still don't know what I watched. Certainly I think it's a film about S star M & S "star" of CD Roms which is about as real as flash cartoons online. He was killed by a man, which causes his sister and a crack of the FBI agent to investigate death. The inner division of the capital of the Big City, the United States is also investigating, although most of its work comes through discovering CD ROMs that claims to be true "as real". I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is alone in the film that has any kind of credit behind it. She is in the film for 15 minutes, and half of it is to crush the big girl for no apparent reason. I can't even describe the end, because I really can't do it yourself. But before the last place, we are held at a 3 or 4 minute meeting of everything in the film. In fact, they could then run to the last place and it would affect the same as the cross-and-all direction. <br /> <br /> For all, leave off with this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. In fact I could spend 80 minutes for something else and I have been more satisfied. Like, play the game with a knife where you beat with your hand regularly. That for 80 minutes will be more entertaining.
