This cast together a piece of secular matter adds with many dirty incidents that are ultimately a shock of hilarity laughter. It is not as bad as the promised premise (as in many cases in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this author goes through the land. Lowe is in prison serving at the time of DUI killed by his grandmother. We see him just dreaming that we know he feels real BAD about this. Then his neighbor's neighbor depend on himself. Or he? Lowe has some doubts but leaves them quickly. His doubts are so weak that bad people don't worry about. Why then have they put him to death? Ah, this story can be interesting. That is when it falls off the railway, and once off the railway decides that it can stop and despise viewers at the next hour. ************************************************* *** <br /> I'm not born with the endless details of what is next, but consider this end. Lowe has been bound by bad people on the train. They want the tape he has, because the tape will hit their master, and them. So until the train comes 3 cops, the gun offered, ready to save Lowe. The wicked kills soldiers, in front of the passengers and then .... continue to drive Lowe to get the tape. HELLO !!!! to kill 3 soldiers to the public will bring them into a deep, deep hell and tape. However they go through a bullet shop, like the public was not there as witnesses, and at the end Lowe is taken by a bad man still wants a tape!
