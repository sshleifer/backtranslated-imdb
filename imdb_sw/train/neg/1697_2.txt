I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that has been done on the DVD except the Hotel room and 2 movie of Twin Peaks. So, when I discovered this, I immediately took it with ... and ... what is this? It is a group of black and white cartoons that are big and bad mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe this is a crap group that was emphasized to the public under the name of David Lynch doing a few bucks, too. Let me make it clear that I was not worried about the language of bad language but I continued to correct the voice because my neighbors might have it. All in this is all given too much and can be just left in deluxe box set as curiosity. I strongly recommend you spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.
