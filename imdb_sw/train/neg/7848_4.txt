This movie was just dumb thinking I was scared at all I went in hopes of shock and fear but often laughing some of the events were just fake and cast along blood scenes were so much on cg and some mutants were ridicully gay looking too sucked because The acting was just awesome you think they could get some good actors and many characters I hated just because how stupid and crippled did even though they were supposed to be military i get watching movies for free and seen many people leaving im guessing because it was dumb kinda happy I didn't have to pay for a short DUMB ASS MOVIE don't see ... but again that's my opinion
