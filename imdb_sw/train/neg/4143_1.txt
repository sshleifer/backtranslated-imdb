If I and my other half are huge fans of the garbage fear we can't resist getting out of the film with all the greats we were surprised! However for the 2004 movie and the cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a shame! The worst movie I saw but deserve to look at if you can stay! <br /> <br /> Acting is a bad impact ... well I can do well on my camcorder is really just a bad thing to bother to set up the face of the zombies and left out of the neck, hands etc. There is no story line, wonderful rocks which Not suitable script of mind and awesome! "You broke my tooth!" from a single vampire "broke my cigarette" was the answer from a man who looked like a jersey Jessie from Dukes crossed by Santa!
