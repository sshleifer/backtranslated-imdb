In fact I am angry that on the basis of interesting reviews associated with Steven Smith I lost nearly two hours on his first offering. Are all written by its pals? Groups of action together, music is offensive and used more, the script is very simple and administrators (except for the garden) is more comfortable. I think we should support the efforts of the limited player but say that it is a brilliant while not only encouraging him to make the same mistakes again if he keeps writing his own scripts and using the same actors for another partner. Yes, it's his first film, etc. The lowest budget - I get it, but there are also out of the public members to buy and not just to start.
