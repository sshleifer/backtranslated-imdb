As last year, I was not able to stay all the way. Okay, so Chris Rock as host was a good choice because he was without engaging in engaging. Or suppose, from the total number of beer entries to the theater, at least he was not on Top 10. Most of the speakers, on the other hand, were in this top 10. I was not aware that anything was done in defense (although I knew it was scripted) but it was awesome to see these have been good participants can not insert words, look away from the cue and fall on simple words (Natalie Portman like no director, she has gone). The night of Fancy Ethics and Boring Speech was long and exciting, Beyonce Knowles played some good songs and there was a very good conversation of acceptance and part. Adam Sandler will win the best prize winner. To help me write these comments I would like to thank my mom, my father, my lawyers and pedicurist for all believe me, and I would like to show that I have high metabolism and actually have been hungry for a month. I can't cry ... thank you.
