Nell Shipman attempted to plan a leading end of the 'Return of God's Land' of the previous year, and failed miserably. This time, he does well, though it seems useless. 'Something new' do not plan to sleep out of expulsion. There is a short trend, which creates a hero (author and lover of Shipman) to save the girl (played with the Shipman), then it is not an exciting thing, not surprising from there. Of course, it looks like a long announcement for the Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is very proud. It does not seem that he learned a lot from D.W. Griffith or his parodies with Mack Sennett and other partners, which he is imitating. One way of interest is that Shipman writes and guides himself in the film as the author of the film story, which has as its main author (Shipman no longer), although it doesn't work too much or too humorous, though he tries. Again, others were reluctant to write the author in the head, like Anita Loos and 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion and 'The Foolish Girl' (both 1917). Of course, the Shipman gives the impression that he does not impersonate himself or the film - nor do I. 'Something new,' despite his claim, is hackneyed.
