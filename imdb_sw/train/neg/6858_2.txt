John Huston's wise wisdom was much worse than the book Flannery O'Connor's book than I could imagine. From the most horrible exhibitions (and not you, "Oh carried out for a purpose, you can't get" me!) For the music mark which was most suitable for the Rockford Files section, this film was a violation. I looked at it without a bad will at first, and, in fact, is a good experience. But the improper damage of the southern characters, from the southern drawl of southern fraud through a fight, through their comedic faith was displayed, was not guilty. To the end, which had no sense of behavior, has failed in every place the O'Connor book shines and seen again. The actors who describe the "south" police may also have lost a hot dog from the NYC road and quoting God. One performing actor was Ned Beatty who was a beautiful and deadly representative of Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ without Christ and sees signs of dollars and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is well known because it is exciting, the lowest religion that jibes the salary of "Faith" seems to be alive. Mr. Huston's film is a shy surprise of the author's intent, as they understand me and most of his fans, if I can have the courage to say that. When I realize that I can not know what the author wanted to convey, I have enough love for him and his work for the desire to remain a fan. If I see the wise blood as Mr. Huston did, I would lose it in the trash. With Flannery, with me, I forgive you, John Huston. Don't forget .... which will take time.
