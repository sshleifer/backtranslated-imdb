I enjoyed the "American Movie", so I took the first film Chris Smith, which I thought was a document too. In the first minute I saw that it was not there, but I gave it. <br /> <br /> What is the last death film? Being true-to-life doesn't serve you if you're just going to explore inflammation, esp. The desire that we are ready to family. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it will come as a necessity for anyone that 1) a lot of work suck and 2) most of them are crappy, low wage work in the service industry ??? I knew that before I saw the film. It did not give an investigation that however, as when the film feels “real” (hand camera, no music, etc.), what's going on as hard as it could “the real world.” <br>> <br /> Would the employer be very happy when Randy had finished his check, after Randy listened to him after 3 days when the guy said he expected to stay 6 months? Or one day after leaving his job (and raising the machines he was doing), that everyone would be so easy? <br /> <br /> The main problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This boy is a failure. Not because he stuck in these jobs, or has a crummy floor, or looks like one. He is a mud. He doesn't care or even really try these works. He has a personal shape. If I had to hire someone, you should not pass the interview. I hope what Chris Smith will follow, but men, go to "this-is-important film" things. "American Job" does not work.
