I didn't think French could make a bad film, but I was, obviously, not very accurate. As mentioned earlier, this film uses its head attitude as a move to move; His demonstration of his life and man has nothing to do with the real Jews of Artemis. The script is bad - engaging, mentioned, and ash - and its renewal of truth is an irritating anger even in a form that often makes its life misleading, rather than restore, history. . With a special design of honor, Valentina Cervi's physical aid is the primary asset of this film, and it is evident from the beginning that film writers also knew this; do not waste time to develop different "erotic" settings that are more relevant to focus than to the development of a plot or character. Unfortunately, appeals to see a beautiful girl in the wake of sexuality can not, and does not use this movie. Acting is non-fail, and all the symbols are generic with an interesting or two chord. The movie is the same, and there are some good colors, but there is also a good tracking system using the most effective lenses that are most suitable for the 1960s freakout movie than the artwork. In any event, the script leaves the leaves of the camera often on the body of Artemisia, and also rarely on its painting. <br /> <br /> They all told, the closest failure. It is not mental or delicious enough to be a great film, and it is very slow and engaging to work as a soft graphic. So French can fail, after all!
