I had looked at the "Eye" before looking at this. I loved the "Eye", it was one of the best movies of the latest Asian cinema. Therefore, I have taken "Bangkok haunted" because it was the same director, and it was a kind of popular round here. But someone, it's a problem ... "Bangkok haunted" is a three-story story of love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are absolutely nervous, even sad (like "Eye" was) ... nothing. I can't even fill the 10 lines needed for comments ... <br /> <br /> 100% awesome. My rate: 2/10
