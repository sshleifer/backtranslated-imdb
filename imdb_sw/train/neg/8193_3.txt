Well, during the thanksgiving of thanks, when the whole family together everyone decided to go to the movies, and since Fred the voting passage, that's what we went and said. <br /> <br /> To start the movie with many holes of conspiracy was sad. A simple explanation of why a particular event had been missing. example; Who is trying to 'tie' the Santa's passage? What kind of organization? Little details would be interesting. Second: The movie prompted the characters who were not sympathetic to you about their feelings or actions. An example: a small elf named Willie and an old girl only in the elf village. they see each other and then they are a couple and I can focus on because this film did not make me care. Third: I think this thinks that the family film? His estimation was low for PG only. For the family film there were several articles of interesting conversation. It didn't bother me, but if I was a parent I could see the problem. Through the entire movie Paul Giamatti appeared very tired for his role, but honestly was alone worth looking at the movie. Vaughn had a short time to play but he had the same character he had with the last two films. a young boy. (nothing against Vaughn, has been good at other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone needs to produce a film and open this flick. <br /> <br /> In my opinion I will be able to pass on this flick, or if you see it saving for a rainy day.
