I just watched this movie and I've got to say that for a great Cluster and this great talent just Turkey is located there !!! A friend gave me this film and I looked for a clear mind because it had a great reputation for the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the film started with Kevin Costner as an attempt to fight with the fighters ... why? Why did they make him a pilot? He had to be employed by the behavior of Anthony Quinn to be a new attempt ... well, we can't see the cost of the money going around the plane for all the film! The child runs Texan (James Gammon) selling horses for a big Mexican business and Costner for a trip. Not knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten up close to death and Costner takes him to the meeting, which happens to have a colleague of Quinn! But, there is nothing that comes ... nada, okay! Why did they have the character of Gammam? Why did you have a sale of horses and a partner of Quinn if nothing came? Also, after the departure of Costner to the dead, it makes Madeline Stowe the habit of adultery, then visits one of the Quinn men who was paying for the return ... she injures her own knife, and something else he has been transferred to a meeting of worship! There is no explanation of why he moved, or when it was over! <br /> <br /> Great talent lost on the weak script and bad editing! I just looked at this because my friend is owned and let me look ... I will go and throw him for 2 hours I lost my life to watch something exploded!
