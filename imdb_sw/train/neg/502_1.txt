This movie is not only the worst movie, and the evil actors - thought-providers, the stimulating trend and the non-fascinating story, also copy the actual copy from the "best" "Torso", headed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the Italian psychological exhibitions and religious movies around the world. In "La Sanguinusa to encourage the danza", the director gives birth to a bed between the black girl and the white girl, with the player looking from the bedroom window. Normally, the movie's Rizzo movie is stupid and inferior to the humble and charming film in Martino. Put another black girl, another white girl and another repeat-event scene is the most appropriate way to prove that Rizzo movie has no thoughts, no natural, no taste, and nothing. I think such things are wrong with the viewer.
