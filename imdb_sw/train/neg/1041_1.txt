What? How many more fake movies "of a piece of life" needs to be made? We hope not many. <br /> <br /> Add to Victor Vargas is a very independent attempt by the director Peter Solett based on Hollywood. There is nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this particular film is that it hates the audience and each piece piles in the book "edgy" Hollywood independent production. <br /> <br /> Should be "real" so left to shake the camera "text style", unless no document would be shaking the camera for a purpose ... <br /> <br /> It "edgy" then let never lose any film lights. <br /> <br /> It's a "hip", then let's have children using words to swear as Al Pacino in Scarface ... and so on, and so on. All that remains is a very independent attempt of Hollywood which is not suitable for anyone outside the "rarefied" crowd of indie who is still admiring the sound over every bad film.
