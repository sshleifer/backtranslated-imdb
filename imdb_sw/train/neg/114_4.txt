Its not thrown. The best group of participants, you can't find. Its not settings. The director likes to New York City, and at the end of the film, all of us! All Allen could not improve on what Bogdonovich has done here. If you go in love, or find love, Manhattan is a place to go. No, the problem with the movie is a script. Nothing. Actors fall in love at first, words are not needed. In the experience of the director himself in Hollywood which happens when they go to work on a set. It's true to him, and their colleagues, but it's fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, at the end, movies are holes, and unknown, and under messages.
