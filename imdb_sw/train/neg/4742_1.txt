Wow. This was perhaps the worst DCOM. I looked at the first half hour and laughed. Brenda's words love Wendy, a famous girlfriend and girlfriend of a jock and stuck friends who have decided to become the King of Homecoming. He has to save the world as a hero, and Shin comes to his help to help him with his military art. Shin teaches the skills of snakes, tiger, etc. and she needs to learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for children who want to learn about Martial Arts and Chinese culture but acting and throwing was awesome. Brenda is a comedic actor and I can't see him playing a great role. It was laughing loudly to watch his cry on Shin. The Shin could not do exactly, and everything was not quite reliable. I watched this film and tried to think of something else, and something that I came to was the Power Force. This movie is fake and stunts were so Power Ranger-asking that it was just corny and stupid. The characters were not recommended and I can just stand to look at it. Disney really needs to take some time to make decent movies. High School Music is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, as well as other movies like Clean Fly, Friendly Art, Go Go, Read and Read, & Enter to Neighbors. If you like adventure of action and corny joke, you will love this film.
