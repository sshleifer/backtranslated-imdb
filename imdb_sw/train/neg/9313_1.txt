That was quite a bad movie of the fear of the budget that I have ever seen. I am a good person of mind and I always love a beautiful horror movie. In fact, when I rent movies I actually look for some of the best underrated movies horror. They are always good to laugh, believe I know, I have seen many. But this film was so horrible that it was not worth the beat. I was thinking to close in the first five minutes ... which must be. There is nothing good about it, first of all, the camera staff earns $$. Intro was stupid as the end. Actions and special effects were terrible. Please, please, do not show this movie, you will hate it completely.
