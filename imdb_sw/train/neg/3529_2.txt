I heard this film was more stylistic than the film director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smokle Barrels, Snatch) had spoken before, the problem is that maybe it's also stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) has been released from prison after seven years alone, and within two years he plays a lot of money. He is ready to take revenge on the owner of the casino found by the violence he received Jake was sent to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live as he dies from a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts people on hit. Papa Zan (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) are looking for Jake to pay their money back, and to do extraordinary work for them. The film is filled with Jake describing in some way, and through his last three days before coming to the great revelation on Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I think that's yes. Also star Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. This process involves a little animation, repeating the double lines in a different perspective, and changing the momentum, and all this is irritating to the point of chaos and tolerance, making it a crime crime game. Beautiful poor!
