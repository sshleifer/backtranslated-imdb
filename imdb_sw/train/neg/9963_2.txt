I love Alec Guinness. And that says a lot after this film. True, he is not bad in it. He looks just stand aside, to be an urbane and his independent self, but investment. It is definitely a girl who looks like a featherweight, even as a little French girl who does not know the experience. Sir Alec did not want to choose him when he was young and very clearly not happy about him now. Interesting behavior is the emerging brother "Suzanne", another. "Donald" deserves to be Heathcliffe of French and I am waiting for free for his secret source. What's the secret secret secret was hidden behind the page? Had love with grandmother's father? Why did she wear Suzanne's hair when she planned to arrange different parts of this Turkey together in the country? Or perhaps he had just enough for his terrible acting. <br /> <br /> The film would be charming with Guiness and "old woman" remembering and seeing Paris together. THAT would be a good story! Two people with good experience in the beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why didn't someone come with that? I advise to look at Alec Guiness in the "Card", a known but worthwhile film.
