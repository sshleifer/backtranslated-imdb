Okay, I was tired and decided to see this film. But I think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be an hour of photography, then basically the same hour was repeated 4 times. It includes 1. Collecting soldiers and discussing the attack plan, 2. Men's drop-down 3. Path of the rider long 4. Men fleeing the hill and shooting, often the first shot and 3 others rescued him. 5. Failure of the enemy and a basic base to describe successes 6. Men beat back to her and sing 10 minutes. That was a basic movie, and the process of events took place about 4 or 5 times. that man, then his wife and him. There were 10 or more people who would have a flashback so this took a ton of tons. In addition, men could not kill their enemies except the sea or the bombs. I loved music and there were many steps, although the action was repeated. In general, I probably could not see it again, but it wasn't very bad.
