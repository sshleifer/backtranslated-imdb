I think I agree that many comments here should be fake. Even if the film is not very badly below the average. The "Dark Darkness" is essentially the modern Spirit of the Spirit and the brilliance of your own ghosts and the negative feelings are offensive. The movie begins already with 2 intermediate interactions that even later are not connected. Couples lose their child who is found in his bed. They move to a country house to run their past and guess what ... the house is haunted, kind of. From here on the Night of Darkness it begins very slowly and at some point of time (the first spiritual manifestation is good and the sequence of flashes also did a very good job). Well, then ... The woman sees the spirit of the daughter, the other ghosts of people died by accident or suicide, a man tries to solve the mystery of old houses, a woman becomes sad, strange neighbors seem. All of it was very good, but the premise that their feelings are good, so you are waiting to move. No moving, confused with the story of the haunted house history, the wonderful neighborhood, the useless prison and the dead daughter cast with the idea of ​​the picture reminds me of a lot of "shutter". The latter is ignorant because when you start and finish this movie is slow and piano music is a good blind to insert some ghosts of spirit once that looks like a flick of a zombie, of course just turn slow pacing and piano music. Darkness can be a good story if the script doesn't try to go everywhere and get anywhere. For many stories they gather together that don't make any sense and contradiction in the basic atmosphere of movie. And aside ... Please do not re-use prisons. Its very worn and in this case even makes any sense. "Hey, there is this prison of creepy plant, lets shoot there". I think many links in Dark Items were beaten in this mix.
