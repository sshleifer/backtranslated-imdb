In fact, these young men were very worried that I could not wait for all of them to be killed, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I thought it was more hateful to the group. But I knew it would be a mess from the opening moment when the boy Christine was fired on the priest and the elite and Leslie Gore music backwards. It had no place to go but below. Even the genetic material was seen as a fake and "blood" was seen as bad as a Hawaiian Punch, although later it took a look at the red look of the match to match the makeup of silly halloween. they were all dressed. I am sure every moron of GOTH out there will enjoy this cow since it will appeal to the group. It certainly did not interest me. Blah ... And even Adrienne Barbeau, even my favorite child, can save this flick of a stupid boy from itself. He still seems to be hot, though. I am glad he cares for himself since we can't see a lot of these days. However, it is a high step from Dante Tomaselli of HORROR (2002) for it has a good deal, so I will give you that much. The small Boston grave called Boozer also brings a peak. I would like what Boozer does for Clarissa last. It was just a new event in a non-confidential film. The Lion's Movies should certainly be lost when they took this. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
