My complaint here testifies to the pacing of the film and available material. When using the film and documentation has blown the film into a clean and interesting view, often the chosen material to show only is not very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or disease, & tc. German). Also, the movie goes to the c. 1920-1939 and then run through years of war. In general, the film is much better than the Channel History document, except that the film player feels a little more understandable than the editor of the History of the History of History and can therefore arrange more life stories for Goebbels. However, I found it wanting.
