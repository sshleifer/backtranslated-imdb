I watched this film for a love project. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it feels to be his character, and then you can read the verses he says. My life can not continue ... I deliberately cut my own hand ... my brother was close to. Obviously his mistake. And since the happy time it is with a good man who takes care of a sad mother and alone. No closure, bad script, and it doesn't have enough extension of small characters. Close yourself, unless you have a good laugh. Clothing was done correctly, and the extra work was done. I am sure it would be a fun movie to do, but to go beyond some kind of music, I can't recommend this film to anyone who knows, because it's not a mental movie. Not flick flick. It is not bright love. And I can't show children because of sex and follow-up questions. All in all, not a good flick.
