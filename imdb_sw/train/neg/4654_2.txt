The female vampire kills women with color and their blood. He has a helper who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what he commands or turns into a blood keeper. After a few kill, the assistant gets depressed and loves a homeless girl. What can I say about this movie? That its pacing is over-slow, that has some amazing effects (never bite looks so amazing) and settings (a new jazz here comes) and that the lights don't seem to be installed on a set. It looks like a movie of "the author" of panic and quite enough inside. <br /> <br /> The program is completely stupid and as you can, I think it's a female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't 't do that; Of course, crosses, light, onions and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> Not even a lousy funny movie. Perhaps with other friends and beer, he can not have its beautiful sides (be honest, it's funny at 10 to 15 minutes near the end of the film). Don't show with Troma stickers, it's one of the bad movies they are presenting.
