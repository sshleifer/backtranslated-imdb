When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as a co-star, you expect to find a good movie, but this was quite different, representing it as I did as I will try as a first effort in false science. Karloff and Lugosi all play the scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to the extent, until Rukh will win Benet over and demonstrates his great theory. Science here was - to say the least - a little bad around the round (so false science, and the emphasis on lies) but somehow Rukh connects some kind of ray from Andromeda which allows him to look at the world "several thousand years ago." During this historic period, a large meteorite came into Africa, leaving the deposits of substances that scientists call "Radi X" - which can heal and destroy. Much of the film has been replaced instead of Africa, seeking the rule of the meteorite, which Rukh finally finds and integrates to build big weapons, unfortunately identifying with some kind of disease that also makes big weapons too. Karloff and Lugosi were two good here. Lugosi removes the role he is good at, but I actually found him very little - especially during the events set in Africa. The story also emerged somewhat, and when it would have been my mind was not attracted to them. Given that this is really sci-fi instead of flick of fear, and that sci-fi was in its early stages, I think the movie needs to cut a bit of slack. It was the same - nothing more, but also less than that. 4/10
