This film is about a Japanese woman who is cruel and calligraphy on the skin. The plan is very amazing. I can't see any "physical" or "erotic" undertones. The program returns to the old art form in photographic photographs of the fetishist. In addition, events that have been held in Hong Kong are indeed indicating the worst part of Hong Kong, such as the city center of the city, the worst of life and noise pollution. In all the films, I continue to think that the "River Book" condemns the Japanese culture and the environment of Hong Kong. "The Pillow Book" is a distinctive film, but still interesting. Stay away from it.
