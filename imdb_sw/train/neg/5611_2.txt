I've got this movie to be bad, first it was not difficult to target, and give one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as part of saying he was there was a group of people from Billy Grahm Revival. Secondly it came from his own subject. Is Jesus (Yeshua) present, to talk about how severe Christianity is, and to show events from Mel Gibsons "Passion". Finally he has a con-director of his former Primary School of Conservative Interviews, and tries to place him on teaching children there. Oh and also Techno music has made the film difficult to watch.
