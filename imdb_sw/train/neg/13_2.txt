Good plot, predictable, predictable characters only half interesting. As the author (also one of the stars?) He was pretending his own fisasies and added unwanted fantasies of drugs and killing to "fire". From the sound of rap and house sounds, for family conflicts, it is not appropriate to work, is not available, and ultimately is very interesting. Even the name has been done before - IMDb shows 5 movies and the same name released in 2007-2008 !! Note: See on the Display Show, which is listed by one of the other movies. It was half the club before realizing no one was a striker. Even for another example, it would make it interesting if it happened.
