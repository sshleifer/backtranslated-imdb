I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best time. Few have been quite good (see Dream for Insomniac), but this is just the same but less. At the right time of 100min, I expect more than 1 to laugh every 30mins. The only real laughter of the stomach is when visitors and male friends support Lee's behavior. All I can say is AVOID. The gaurentee has at least 10 other movies on a worth $$ <br /> 3 out of 10 (and only I'm a big fan of Lee)
