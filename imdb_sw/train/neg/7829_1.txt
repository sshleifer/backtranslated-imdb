The beginning of 90 years brought many "quirky" films and "off-beat" independent forms, which are a spiritual movie of spiritual spiritual crime. The rest of the note is "Wild in the Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn", and somewhat "nature of Killers Born". Good films such as junk produced as "Road 666", "Destiny Turns on Radio" with this ineptly antireal masterpiece "Under Hula Moon". It is a comedy that focuses on a certain emotional tone, it does, but it goes on to the point of anger. While tracking the spirit world and the efforts of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good film crime, and it does not look enough on laughing really to be comedy. I didn't hit the end, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically the negative impact of type cancer. This is an indie-mania logo.
