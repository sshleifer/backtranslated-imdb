This film is one of the worst I have ever seen. And I don't mean it in a good way. We wanted to see the horror / thriller of crappy, so we took one that seemed to be very high in the shop. At once, the film was everything we expect. And more! (or should I say down?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem like they read their line from the poster after the camera. The so-called special effects are made by placing the red-seeing through the front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer mice. With the script? Do not even get me started on the script ... And just when you thought it couldn't be worse, it seems that the first part of the film was the Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> To take from me, this film is hilarious if you are in a crappy horror film, but if you want a GOOD film, keep watching. This is not for you.
