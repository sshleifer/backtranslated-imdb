I don't think you can get this very bad. Keep bad actors, fake links, and three stupid stories and what do you get? This unconfirmed B error for the movie. The first story once shows the bad quality of video and acting is only real, especially when you are 25 years old as a grandmother and usually a bun bun on little ears. Plus, that person is the same, but that woman is very bad. "You are so beautiful!" Not! Thewolf in this was better than all three I would like to say, but its still not strange since it was all the worst costume. The face for a woman later was enough respect for Halloween but not for the movie waswolf. More / more stories are going on. There are two scholars in this next who have completely lost his ignorance. All "I want to be a girl, too" "How can you do it to me?" It was silly to say. You have now requested access! Waswolf will not be spoken even on ... his mouse! The third does not mean ... about forty-five minutes of flight and a fascinating story makes this story and anything to switch has not yet been interesting. Giving! <br /> <br /> Music, Yes, bad ... who could not even hear some part was stupid. The effects of animals were mice or pigs that were stupid. Could not use the lion's voice? Don't think, good movies use it. Yes, i = f you enjoy this B standards are good for you. I have found this film since I was a fan of a hardwoman of hardcore and I will be able to buy any movie of waswolf and look at it once, but that's me. If you prefer Good, don't waste your money. I beg you!
