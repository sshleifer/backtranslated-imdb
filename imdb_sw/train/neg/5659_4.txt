At the end of the first season of despair ... From part 2 and other known events were among the best seen on TV in any series, where this was even worse. Well, I don't know if it was a place that was desperate, but the cheesy guitar music accompanied by the sequence of packing was appropriate and would be more at home in the previous series. <br /> <br /> Its almost like that corporate execs did not like the key down below the finished note and wanted to jazz it up. They have failed and instead of destroying everything. Allow this hope is not a trend for the future. At least we saw the return of someone even though it is very strange and we have done it.
