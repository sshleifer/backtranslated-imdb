First off I want to say that this film is worth more than four stars rated. I gave four stars because for me this 86-minute movie looks like 2 and a half hours and doesn't have enough to stay all. However, "The Great River of Alligator" (my name on the DVD name) is better than your usual strike strike behind the movie. South Africa's tourist destination in South-East Asia is only open and employs locals while trying to run wildlife close. Mother Nature looking for revenge comes in the form of god Kroona, the great Alligator. But the creature is not just a matter of tourists and main characters (photographer and resort workers) should be worried about, locals get rubbed bad way too. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good story of adventure / fear and beautiful music and trends. But alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is clearly a fake look. Some of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see. Some of the shots away from the water make it so clear that what we are dealing with is really a toy of alligator-squeaky you can probably find a zoo store. But the locals are honest, if not true. It is probably not a movie that will give you an uncomfortable excitement, if it is, but you are shot and produced properly. And as many movies of creation, this ends with a very high calculation of the body. It also has a lot of beautiful scenery of the jungle. Working is down though, but who was expecting to be better, eh? Much, much better than a recent American counterpart "Great" but nothing can be compared to "Jaws". But remember it may not be involved in a few points.
