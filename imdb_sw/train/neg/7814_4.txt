After a long time in space, looking for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to the earth. She loses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) builds a bad deal, using crystals he stole from Solitude Fortress, creating new land and drowning the United States. After most of the great Superman movies with Christopher Reeve, or TV shows as "Lois and Clark" (with Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", great expectations have been created for the return of Superman in this version of this Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the bad story is very long and stimulating, and many unwanted parts, lack of emotion and inclusion in IMDb. In addition, the love between Lois Lane and Superman is a shameful thing. Kate Bosworth, twenty-two years old, was badly beaten, with the responsibility of a full-time journalist and a five-year-old mother. Brandon Routh is younger than Tom Welling, who plays boy Clark Kent in "Smallville". Characteristics of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, actually is a silly caricature. Last but not least and in spite of being a very strong Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, so older and older than the rest of the cast. The conclusion of corny looks like a soap opera and it's awesome. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
