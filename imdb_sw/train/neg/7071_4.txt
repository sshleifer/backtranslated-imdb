When this film was released in 1997 'special effects', as it were, were poor. They could have been dated even in the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had a similar or better SFX function. Surely no one involved in the production of this film was looking for Oscar. It is a wild trip from the director of Fred Olen Ray's common, which has a lot of the word "Bikini" in the head (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet, etc.) and it's a little more than T & A flicks, but here we have a film "U" and focuses on children. You should give him credit for mixing !! This was a small religious direct-video effort that later led to several sequels - Invisible Mama 2 and Invisible Dad.

Russ Tamblyn (whose work had been dropped since long since 1961" West Side Stories ") has Dr Wouter of the village It may be right to say that many were beaten in their stage where they would be willing to work almost everything just pay a new bills - except maybe Trenton Knight's youth like Josh. Instead of saying though he worked before this film, actress The child did not do it again after the second, "Invisible Mama 2". Perhaps the film was a curse. This film. For the baby's music, she is good - no better or worse than all of her more experienced stars. br>> As mentioned above, the effect of "invisible" can not say a little, the direction is poor, plain writing and will not do anything to write at home about. There is a lot of films out there anyway, and for anyone ch The age of ten years, this film will certainly appear quite. Most of the adults probably want to do their own disappearance while it's up though, and I can't blame you a bit!
