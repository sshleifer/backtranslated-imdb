This movie was awesome. I looked at it three times, not the whole thing. It is impossible to watch, the line of the story retires, is depression, and you hate it completely. I do not write vendors for anything, so if you want to know why it is very disgusting, see yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his conversation at the beginning, and funny places in the film. The little child in this movie is angry, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie on the cinema stations near America, so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong! Acting is all horrible, and dirt itself is disability and good. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, another great character, was not in such a bad movies like, in fact, was in some good. Same and John Savage. SUCKS this film!
