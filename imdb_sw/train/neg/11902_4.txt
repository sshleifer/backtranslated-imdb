The most interesting thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it has trouble finding a distributor in U.S. because many of them who saw it could not connect the apparent anti-Christian message to angst America. The idea of ​​anyone who sees this as a religious film in any way is delicious. Because the minister in the mission asks for the homeless or wishes the man "God" made it a "Christian" film? One can interpret that in fact they mock the religion for the "Land of Many" and its many items, a good work organized can make it out of a bowl of soup with a Bible verse. A lot of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe? Non-homeless missions? What? About a lot of vets of Vietnam psychological? As the pastor of the destruction of the pill of "pink" agent is we think America is "Land of plenty" of paranoid lovers? Maybe we have many mental illnesses? Indeed we do not have many people concerned about Palestinian politics based on the main characters of the phone conversation in the film. Of course if you are working in a non-German settlement, unfortunately there may be more concern about peace in a distant country than their own life as the world knows how Europe is a "Mainland" when it comes to modernization. <Br /> <br /> Certainly I agreed with the head finally if the United States is "Land of Much" and in this case refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur acting and deliberate film directed. Life is very short and one, even the United States, do not have "time" to lose this look.
