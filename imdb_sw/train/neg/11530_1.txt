Over the past 10 years I have worked in various national anti-indie 3, managed by many wrestling (including two Wrestling Stars stars), who worked on 2 anti-TV programs and sounded by Many DVDs to fight. I have never seen the level of ignorance of amateurish, lack of talent and skills, and the quality of production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even this list as a video fight of any kind is a misuse of time. Shot with low video cameras, are home videos of children fighting in the past. Sound quality is bad, video quality is bad, and acting is awesome. "Wrestlers" wear attractive clothes and socks and ski masks and collide with different types of objects and semi-combat action. Sometimes "matches" are located on the grass. Sometimes on the back trampoline back. ALL are unemployed and implemented for lack of any knowledge of fighting. In short, do not worry about this stinker. If you are interested in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be very disappointed.
