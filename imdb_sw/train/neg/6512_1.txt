If you have any connection to any kind of film, and the health diagnosis of the document, I can honestly say that I felt self-confused by staying all the length of "Dates 20". I can't waste your time with the plot, you can read other comments. I will say though hyper Berkowitz, Allen-style hoody was very annoying. Maybe you would like to stop coffee or swallow some tranquilizers. And it is possible to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as its parts say its attempts to finance the document. Forgive me for insulting as a compliment, but I will give you credit for Berkowitz for being able to persuade some idiot some of this awesome piece of ****. I appreciate the boundaries and purposes of the film here, but even when on the Berkowitz levels he puts himself, he exhausted and misses at all levels. In closing, I am sure many of these female partners did not easily go to date with the publishers who want to be a film, and therefore I will ask them the meaning of a legitimate film. Hey Myles, I liked your film first time I saw it ... when it seemed like part of Seinfeld or it was a film headed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
