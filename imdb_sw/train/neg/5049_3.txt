The group looking at this film is actually broken. We wanted to forgive the fact that our favorite Jo Jo was not over (not like authors / producers can do anything about it). Writing was bad, the script was small. What happened to us: 1. When the two boys realized that they were all lovers of Natalie, they did not just focus on the stupid race (and ultimately destroy) - but just because they were awake fighting, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between two young people before they meet, Natalie suddenly decides that she loves one of the boys and is now ready to marry? (and there was no example that he was a good boy, it was like the authors beat the coins and then they spit on a certain point in the film). 3. Blair speaks of how he does not want children and then suddenly when her husband says she wants to have children, she agrees with her.
