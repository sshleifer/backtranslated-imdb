This is the story of two people who received a copy of 'Funky Monkey.' This search was considered odd when ensuring that there was still a movie poster on the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing such classics as 'Every Way But But' And 'Project X,' these two guys think movies and monkeys are amazing. <br /> <br /> These guys were in a long journey when they watch this movie. There was a monkey that was changed by a Stunt Man while tracking was required. It was clear that the monkey was not taught in Shakespearean acting school. Perhaps you take the place of a monkey and Ben Affleck may have helped the guys thought. <br /> <br /> Maybe the string of the string can help if Jackie Chan or heck maybe even the Hulk Hogan. Fortunately this film had an amazing military artist and Jet Li look like Matthew-Modine. While others may say that Matthew Modine has not approached Jet Li, the camera tricks indicate that he is everything good. If it becomes clear that the unstable chimp cannot handle the film, the movie depends on Matthew Modine to be a real star. Did I mention that there is a dorky child who keeps bail with Modine and a monkey? What? Is it possible that a child learns courage and even takes a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this (using a pick-up line 'I am a second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with women.) <br /> <br /> Soon after watching this movie two people they received a call from Matthew Modine to tell 'Seven days.'
