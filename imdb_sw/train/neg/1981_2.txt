Sistas in hood da. Seeking revenge and blowing bling bling. But da hood is a western wild town at the end of the 1800s. What does Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil 'Kim, he could say, "Right!" I must admit that I have found this only to see him. Midwives and footwear cut down is not the most common cowboy, but these are cowgirls, and they are well. Now, don't go looking for any great story here, and the most common things of the ghetto crime game here in different circumstances. And, when you heard John Wayne calls someone else, "Dawg"? And, I don't remember Earp's brothers hugging and kissing before going to Corral OK. I'm looking at this at BET, so I've lost a point that got it R rating, but I'm sure if I can buy a DVD to get it but if I can be sure it was Lil 'Kim at that point.
