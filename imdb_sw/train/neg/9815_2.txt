This movie begins to give some original idea but it was a big problem later. What? What plan to have the earliest start if all the film did little to avoid the clich√©d plot? Movie itself is very impossible. I would like to know how a person who gets to the clinic actually gets to a nurse, kills a doctor, takes a patient in his bed, puts on his Chevy picture and leaves? I think no one can answer this question, so they returned to another area hiding these little details. Exhibitions are just bad. The striker is just another "angry with the opponent", no depth, completely complete character. After 20 minutes of films, many scenes are unreliable, it seems like they are just set there for 90 minutes since they are not completely opened. Does the doctor see a woman under the power of an antibiotic, not being examined, beaten out of the house and only silently? The last event made me burst, but only Mickey Mouse can do more than the truth. I give 2 out of 10 for the first to allow 10 minutes of the movie.
