I would like to give this film zero, or even less, because that sadness is what is needed. I honestly never walked out of the movie, but this was so horrible that I couldn't stand another minute. Please, please please - for people - skip this film. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can enter, this is not the case. It has an impressive trend, unappealing, choppy structure, ignorance dialogue, and doesn't know exactly in every way considered. At the very basic level, it fails to welcome. Everything about "Solid Kiss" is an array, it works more than any student film I saw. <br /> <br /> If that is not enough, the whole movie depends on a regular basis (and I mean CONSTANT) sounds on the description. The author of the script can also write a novel, because they emphasized FOLLOW everything, instead of FILL. We should assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a special relationship, although there is no development of this display. Also, this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in the freezing frame of characters and their name on the screen. No introduction, no development of characters. We can't know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I saw. I am a gay woman, who watched this film with my girlfriend (another gay woman) and we have all seen this film to be a representation of the cinema. I have started to think that lesbians and homosexuals are like a Christian rock - no matter how appropriate, people will continue to attack, making it, no matter how good it is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, let's encourage the production of homosexual and gender films by hiring "But I am a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing anything worthless that stimulates homosexual society (ie Queer as Folk).
