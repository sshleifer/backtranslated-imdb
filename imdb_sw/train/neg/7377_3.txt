Although the plot was very deep, the line of the story understood the fact that Steven Seagals's voice had been called by someone else out of a troubled film if you were sure who was speaking. There were many places where he would begin to speak in his deep voice and then the second voice of another person was telling him. I do not know why even if he had trouble with his voice during the production of the film I think they could blow up events that did not have his own voice when he recovered. I counted this 3 movie out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When a person gives a payment for a film or not on a playground or DVD this film is not eligible for the uploaded price. I have been a long follower of Steven Seagal and all his movies that he has done over the years. Now I think this is one of the worst we have seen yet
