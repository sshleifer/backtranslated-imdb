Although it has good media after playing on the Intl of Toronto. Film films, there were several reasons that are not too high for this. One - it's a low-budget budget in Canada. Two - written, directed and approaching the person (usually a bad sign, except Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two others respecting the film). But despite my looks and expectations, it was still a greater desire than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In short - a bad script, a bad acting, leading to a terrible! Don't waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I just laughed twice. Further, there is a bright music broadcast around. How this has been a warning that I will never know.
