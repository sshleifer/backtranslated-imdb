What has the world been of our loved one? What? Is this one who did Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. As AAG was a great Ramu project, he has been exposed to the top of the high-rise corridor by offering the industry a much greater job than ever. This movie is made to fall as bricks. I wanted to leave the theater, but I had to stay because I could not get away from my car before others left. Then, there is nothing that will make me sit over time. <br /> <br /> This movie does not exist anywhere with Sholay. Not even close to one kilometer. I believe Ramu really likes the godfather over Sholay, since Sarkar was a piece of classic work. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, where the respondent said that Ramu did not pay for more than 4 hours a day, that also decreased. I agree with this now, because his lack of sleep may have voted on the movie. <br /> <br /> No power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan will not seem to be scary. He seemed more awesome in a few tags and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a wonderful job in Sarkar because he had not much conversation (in fact no even if I remember clearly). He opened his mouth in this movie, and found a place in history. The new boy plays Jai's jai seems to be looking for a brash, but he didn't play the role of Jai. I can't go ... I'm worried ... my pain is so great for me to manage right now. I have pledged in all the movies that I will look at the first time Sholay so we can see that it's still there. <br /> <br /> Less Under: The bad movie. Media and critics are going to cook sweet rum. And just remind all readers again, I am one of the great fans of Ram, and even I did not prevent him from this act.
