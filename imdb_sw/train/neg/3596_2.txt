To be as faithful as I can, the Devil's Plaything (or The Finger of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or the Muslim Curse of Black or ????) is a full bearing. Movie has a beautiful premise behind it? The resurrection of the dead long vampire through the body of the seed for the help and support of a group of women dressed in black? but implementation is awesome. There is a long, long time of screens when nothing happens. Only the characters stand next to anything to do. There is no secret, no emphasis, and no points of conspiracy to keep. Acting is normal. Most actors involve a group of women below average playing naked while watching the camera. They do it regularly. And it is a small plan that seems to have been designed to get more attractive than naked women so they can join the play. When not bad or trivial like playing or plot in something like the Orgy of the Dead, approaching.
