Basically this is overlong, unfunny, action / comedy. First of all I would like to say that I enjoyed the Brother Wayans Scary Movie (1) and the series had time. Unfortunately white chicks don't even know HALF's laugh. <br /> <br /> Humor in it is very bad. If you would like to fire, delete, stupid stupidity should look at this. While not dirt is idiotic. The first minute of the film gave me everything away from me, just not wanting it, just idiotic. Still I watched something since I had a friend (otherwise I couldn't have trouble). That story is not quite good, it was in a scary movie but there was at least a laugh there was a quick and constant. I think this is one of the biggest problems with this film, the odor does not give fast enough. Some jokes are rested for a long time when they are more disgusting than the first in the first place. If you love your comedy and a few brain cells then just avoid this. If you want a silly comedy and more laughter then watch a scary movie, aircraft, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Fully unfunny, a storyline Thin, a film that seems to be the basis of one idea (ie what if we put on chicks white for the film?) but didn't have enough equipment.
