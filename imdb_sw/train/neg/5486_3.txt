First of all this movie comes from a dumb letter: a 10-year-old girl, playing near a moving car, decides that it will be covering her mother's eyes with her hands, and then causes a terrible accident that kills the mother ... duh .... Sorry, there is no better than a 10-year-old who is dumb. Some films do not get more. After the death of the mother and a 10-year-old pupil who appeared to be the worst in the world, the father moves the family to Genova, Italy, where he teaches at the local university, but here is the clincher: not the Italian word! Then the little girl has the "vision" of the mother (who killed her), and often the following night fears that are always, always ended with the holder and holder. Then we are obliged to look at this family always lost and then found and then embrace and then cry out and get lost and then found (followed by the most doubtful embrace and cry) to the point that I really want some kind of natural disaster to erase all these stupid , ignorant in the world. Do not do wrong, because I love the people of India, but people who feel (and I have a sense of silence) are just ignorance and not mean. It is very embarrassing that this film was based on unintelligent characters playing on such occasions, because the area was impressive.
