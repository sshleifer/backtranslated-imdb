If you liked the Grinch movie ... go see again, because this was not the place where the nearby Seussian movie was nearby. Mike Myers's cats are probably the worst of the "grace" screens of the screen soon. His voice / feeling is bad and he laughs with his own joke and a very bad voice, which is about the only laugh I got at the theater. Even children did not like these people, and children laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Go back if you are looking for a family of vacation vacation.
