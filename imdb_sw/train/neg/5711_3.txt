National Treasury is on more testing and on hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage have no reliable means of hero, and this film is not "Indiana Jones". People who have compared this film to the Indian trilogy of ordinary Jones have ever fallen off their rock. I can't understand what kind of audience this film was shot. Perhaps the audience before the youth will love it, but I have found it very difficult. Also I can imagine adults or young people getting this big film. Simply put: it's just the same. The National Treasury has not been considered and unused, to borrow what it does from the "Da Vinci Code". I would like to recommend waiting for the film to be opened in 2006, and to pass this important. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Freedom Declaration and run around Washington DC and Philadelphia and (without destroying once), while fighting "bad guys" and seeing what is supposed to be " The non-stop action "is amazing. I liked the area and the Resolution was hit on its tube set in the middle of the road when cars were without damaging. Oh brother! He reminded me of that part of the "Brady Bunch" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Besides, that part of Brady Bunch was better than all this film! The concept of a great treasure that no one believes is buried in the mysterious US destruction is foreign. In fact, there is one thousand of the most unknown “worthless” things in this treasure. It's true!! Helpless! The worst, speed and accuracy that Cage finds and defines what is supposed to be "hard" symptoms for old fabrics are before birth !!! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> Exhibitions and Cage, Voight, and other actors in the "National Treasury" are as hard, wood, and flat when they arrive. However, when you work and talk like a lousy, it's hard to miss 100% of the actor for it. <br /> National Treasury is a good film to see immediately. I can not suggest more of it and of course without buying it on the hunting of foreign shades of confusion. <br /> <br /> Buy it if you must see it first .......
