This would be Hollywood if it had no editing if it had a good editing. It depends on the incredible plot of America - "who will come out everyone". Working is less than average, but with the brightness of the spotlight who is the best actor in the film and is more responsible if the tension in the film comes out. The film was completely complete with empty video and sound shots and many of them looked like raw film materials. All for all, if you look at a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a watch film. I think that it would be enough to say on this film, everything else could damage the tension that might be enough.
