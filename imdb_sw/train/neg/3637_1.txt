I am amazed at the positive views of this less powerful film. Many times with foreign films I run on technologies that complain about the speed of speed and seems "absence of action" as many of the world's best films do not live up to the Western Hollywood image of the movie . I enjoy the constant skills and lack of photographs in the foreign film field. I am happy that many foreign films do not cling to a beautiful archer. It said, this special film did not give the value of redemption for the time lost. There is no development of character development, no arc stories to get involved, there is no way to get emotionally involved with any characters on the screen. Synopsis: A group of colonized emotional colonies harms their slaves, and a little girl gets pain with her friend when the "house boy" finally gets food and takes her. Even though the above verse is interesting and amazing, this film will boost when you play the game. I did not have so much damage that it took me to attend three to ask for it, and I did not yet do it with the right calculations. Unless you have academic interest in a period that I suggest for a clear transparency of this.
