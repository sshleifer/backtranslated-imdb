Following the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to assemble together and make a similar anthology film in New York. Unlike the original film, the story in this film appears sometimes goes and goes too fast - when you think it's entering the story, it's about many cases. And, often starts with stopping and then start again - and stories are combined together. As a result, there is no name to verify that the story has been completed and not formal in the format. <br /> <br /> Sadly, however, when "Paris, Do T'Aime" was struck or missing (especially hit), many of "New York, I Love You" lacked. Myths seem to be more than a sexual nature but also not less sweet - and often too scary. It was not an amazing and very unpopular film with just a few unique stories - and perhaps the most popular music often made it more visible. Now you understand, it was a good music but his voice really rounded, made me feel like cutting my hands! Among the best is a story about a young man who took a girl on the wheel to promote, a couple talking about cheating out of the restaurant (although this was also in the first film) with a couple of old age. It's all sad because I liked the first movie - and I really liked to love this film. I respected what they tried but they didn't like it much. The way, and this is not a complaint, but I wondered how many people smoked in the film. For a recent film, that was unusual in our culture more of the fight against cigarettes. Also, if you get a DVD, there are two groups that are included as an exclusion. One has Kevin Bacon (wearing fedora cool) to eat hotdog .... and absolutely no more for about ten minutes. Others include a young person who uses a video-video video - including a very unhappy couple.
