My friend's friend was working on a video store and had to explore movies before leaving, so when he was bringing home The Convent, a horror movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it should be awesome but in fact it is very bad, I can say that in another wonderful way, I would like this movie. Yes, acting is bad, and yes, it's a cheap movie that I've ever seen, but it's very funny! "WHAT, DO YOU COME TO CA-RACK?" I didn't know this film was even released ... I thought it was very bad .......... Well, so ... in general the movie is very bad (you should admit it at least) but I tell you, you will get a good cook. This film takes but it is good to laugh ... especially that the holder of the 'dagger's despair' .. DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAA!
