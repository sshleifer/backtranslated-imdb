O man, I know your thoughts: "For such a title, I can't go wrong!" Certainly you can. I, too, loved the title, but someone hated a stupid child who played "little helper of Satan" I also hated my mother, sister, and girlfriend - I hated all those people! Man, it was painful to watch this sometimes! The only reason this does not get 1/10 is becuz based on the low budget, did OK. But oh man I hated those actors, so it's stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money by using only the Halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus' dress at the end was also stupid too. Oh, bitter, don't look!
