I was shocked by this film for a few reasons. For the first half of the hour is really very good. Although acting is not much better than that which you will find in the rap video, its amazing kinda and the value of production does not appear half bad. I really thought that this would be very good like Perico Ripiao (another recent film in Dominican) which proved to be more beautiful than I expected. The program for movies is not just to deceive men but how women are treated and treated in the Dominican society, in general, which makes a beautiful Cluster especially the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately I think the creators of this film are dependent on how good the movie is about how you handle your issue, and they attacked the sheep's ward they had before them. About 30 minutes in the movie work of men and women are interrupted after the female perpetrator puts a kind of spell on her as a result of her cheating behavior. Not only is this change happening through what seems to be cutting edge, age, the effects of CGI and what I think is 70, but the whole plot goes down. Some of the movies are nothing but good to predict, and clever clever. Then at the top (and I think it should warn you now ** ACCESS TO SPOILER **) it all turns out to be a dream. Oh who did not see that coming? Oh someone I almost forgot something worse about the movie. Well after an hour within me I start to think "?? hmmmm something just not seen about sound sounds but what could it be?" ?? and then hit me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN MOVIE FROM FROM THE VIDEO KING FIGHTER OF FIGHTER 95. Perhaps the comedy similar to France's Amelie, or the opening stage to resemble Ong-Bak's Tailandi, animation as Akira was Japan, the excitement of crime crime like the Layer of the Layer was England, or a social-awakening journey as Waking Life was here it says. <br /> <br /> ... I could give 1 but I found more bad from DR, search Los Jodedores and you will know what I'm talking about.
