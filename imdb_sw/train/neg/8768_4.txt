Now please don't start calling me names like, "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this film (at 4 pm.) is its biggest mistake. No editing at all - looks like J.P. Dutta loved her project very much. Even Lagaan had 4 hours long - but it was entertainment and also provided a message. It is based on real events and real people. Kudos for it, but are the recurring events of the needed war? On top of that goal was often changed from one team / squad to another and it is impossible to keep all their tracks. <br /> <br /> Between skirmishes, there were songs about solitude, love and things related. There was a chummy conversation. At first it provided relief from violence but it became so much later that one could even predict the exact nature of the discussion. Why the soldiers were around like a lion in the jungle, perfectly does not know that the enemy was trying somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it caused mercy but it seemed to be unacceptable to them to have security for them first. The music was sound and sound was spiritual but was not good for the film. Better listen to the voice instead of the film. Working was grace to save: From seasoned warriors like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, for new children like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention for enhancing mood at any moment. The talk came from a brilliant ("From Madhuri .. and Love!") To the fake / pride ("Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). With spreetive spree with MCs, BCs, Cs and F-words are not quite needed. LOC Kargil tries to give good tax to the Indian brave soldiers, but he tries hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve the best tax.
