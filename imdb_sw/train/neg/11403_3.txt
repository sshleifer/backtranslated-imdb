I love horror movies, low budget, 50, 60, 70, 80. But how can anyone think this is a very awesome movie? let's compare the names in films similar to the storehouse. haunting, changeling, shining. or for a similar film of technology that was the best FAAAR, (though it is still a FAR from a large) Seed of Demon. Okay, I will be right. Let's compare it to the scary television films! don't go to sleep .. waaay creepier and best done. A lot of salem, nighttime, night-to-night, even to the underground or nearby farm was much better. * SPOILERS * first and foremost, having a good location as a shower area, you have an area like the opening area .. oh boy! The hose of the garden comes alive to reduce the rest of the frisky! TERIBLE. Also, only what we understand about the house seems to need to use his video camera to see what is going on, and it's a very emotional home. not a spirit, or a demon, or an instrument, is that "home", but why? we are led to believe something that does not learn to love to suzie / margaret, our protagonist? now that I am on the issue of suzie .. another area that has completely affected, this poor woman ignorant woman comes, tells you she was your nurse, throwing her heart out, falls into a hot pool, struggling for pain for 45 seconds, and margaret what does he do? Does he threaten his burnt hands to save an old poor woman who came to warn her life? No, he stands there and sees! Acting for the most part was much better than the scary film, but that's where it ends up. at least the most interesting and exciting film on something that does not kill that kill people looking at the bed of death: a bed that eats. I feel the people who tested this very much and did not look at it from the beginning when they gave it, or remember they were destroying them like children. This film was very good down.
