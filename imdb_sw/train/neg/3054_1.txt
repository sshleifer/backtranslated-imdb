NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all snoop agencies in the world should watch this film to find out how to spy on people. (If MST3k expert says ... "Sanata has every dirt! Santa's centers reach far and wide! No hide from the Klaus Federation") ears that can hear everything. It is interesting that CIA does not Santa on payment. The devil's dance system is hilarious. Call ... he is worthless. <br /> <br /> The reason for the cheese in this film is very great. The lowest budget but it's fun to enjoy. I recommend viewing the Secret of Science 3000 for more laughing. <br /> <br /> You can even get laughter in a missfortune of good children. I offer this 1 for quality production and 10 for fresh cheese and fun.
