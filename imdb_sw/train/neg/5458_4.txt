This movie is an awesome attempt, it seems, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they gave us a 19-year-old, maybe not "to do so." There was no way they could beat the age of 12 or 13 as a boy because the events of love would have been driven out everyone (if they were allowed to do so) - if they should. Mary Ann's friend was my nephew, and made her the son of pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile does not need to have many children - all you need is one. I don't care about his birth or his unhappy marriage. He was responsible for his students that he did not live up to. The reason given is that he is bipolar, refused to diagnose, and refused to take his medication. It is understandable, then, that he did not consider rationally. One hopes that he now understands his actions. Since she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she is on her medication and think clearly. All of the aside, Penelope Ann Miller was giving a full and perfect influence for this role.
