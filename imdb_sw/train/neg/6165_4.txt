Allen goes to the country (somewhere hates to go into real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which is typically a white success between the bellyaching class type that looks at his many films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something interesting in the Woody Allen comedy, but here she falls completely flat on her face. Even one liner appears to have found him. Certainly not a conspiracy (bits bits and cod shakespeare pieces) - but Allen seems to use a place to allow half of the mysterious air, which makes it more smooth and half. > It doesn't just work at any rate and it's just a great bearing. The best thing about this film (apart from the last features occurring) is that a bad review seems to make him wake up and realize that just throwing along the slapdash script and throwing your inner partner does not make for entertainment.
