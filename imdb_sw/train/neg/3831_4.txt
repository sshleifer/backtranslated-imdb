I will be obliged to resist the original views and side of Maltin on this. These are the second level, West very difficult which creaks and sadness tries to put in its main Wild Wildlife being tamed and kicked aside with a steady motion of time. Would like to be in the "Butch Cassidy and Little Sundance" culture, but it is not polite to the film. Andrew McLaglen's direction is a miner, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real botch, with an incomprehensible strategy on the side of Charlton Heston's heroes and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a holler if you can explain to me why they put that hot hill.) There was something wrong about all the treatment of the rape area, and the woman's response was certainly not true. Coburn is very good when the half-harvested seed was sentenced for retaliation, but all his fellow colleagues have not developed (they are like pinling bowling beaten down directly as the story continues forward). Michael Parks offers one of its most common, lethargic, and text displays, but in this case it was appropriate if the sheriff of modern style resembles quarrel that technological advances can bring.
