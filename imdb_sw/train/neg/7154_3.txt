This film has all the features of many cooks that destroy the hub. According to the personal information of Shielah Graham, it seems like a power that could not leave itself very well. They could not decide whether this would be the story of Graham or the story of Fitzgerald, and how much they should get to anyone's story that has ever been. So a film that can be a story about two interesting (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Mrs Graham) becomes dreary disjointed opera soap about that tells us a bit about either. He added to this there is no time to feel completely except in 1959. A strange view follows a strange scene and we don't know where we're in the story or how long it goes. However - with this film watch me - Kerr has never been seen love, and Peck is like a very good person. It actually makes a good couple, big, and I just want them to have good tools to work with them. There is one working area - Scott follows Shiela during drinking conditions, and seeing these two refined stars collide with one another and give another long-term idea of ​​what is going on in their relationship. Other than that, the movie is a lost and unprecedented opportunity around the regular Wald soap that was produced in 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, BEST OF ALL).
