In my opinion this film development no new ideas. it seems to me if you take a spear for a spear without looking at the side! The director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I see that his logic does not seem to have a chance to replace the view. I am usually on the naysayer but this film does not trust if it depends on the positive views of the woman / woman on the street. in fact now if you want to remove a reliable alternative to the belief of 2000 years, you should make further efforts to allow the other side to hear their faith. I don't know but at the beginning of the movie I felt like a Cristian faith attack, I for one person is not honest, but let me share the beliefs of others, and you don't want to ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.
