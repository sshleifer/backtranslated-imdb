This film depends on the novel by John Fante. Can someone please tell me why? I don't see the reason why this good book should be changed in this way. If you want to make a romantic version of Hollywood music by Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how would you make a connection to Asking the Dust (novel)? And if you want to make this story on the film, then why do you want to make it a romantic Hollywood film and Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? Not available. The story change is not well done, and if you have read the book and loved it, I am sure you don't want what Towne did. At the beginning of the movie you may find an odd form of making, the worst acting and the movie looks just about. But you expect the best. I really had much hope during this film. I really wanted to be good. But it gets worse, and it's as simple as: If you read a fantasy or novel, this is not a good film. Just another romantic music production film with a bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - a lot of shots of Colin Farells fabric naked. I was able to complain more about this film, but why lose my time. I have seen it. Okay. I had to see it, because I like the book very much and I was interested. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is a little bit of Colin at the end of the film. So sweet ... If she was wearing all the way through, I'd like to give it 2/10.
