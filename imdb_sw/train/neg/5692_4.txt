Removing the action film and an interesting emphasis: a young Mafia boy would like to be a murderer (Chandler) must show his master that he is a good man for the service he goes to California to take some subjects with a specialist professional (Beluschi). The first and most important work: kill a young woman (Lee) which is absolutely amazing for all. But he is a simple goal? The movie goes on and on the basis of this great idea but the result is just badly common; even a wonderful victory at the end does not save the film. Good performance and Chandler. I offer this 4 (four).
