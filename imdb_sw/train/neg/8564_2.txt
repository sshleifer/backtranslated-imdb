Movie itself is sad. It showed people of the deaf as worried about hearing people. True, some deaf people care about contacting hearing people, but they are not angry as Marlee Matlin's behavior was in the story. Deaf people don't go to the bar and play like Matlin did. All in all, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It is interesting that I would like to believe it is a movie to sleep and lose. If I have trouble sleeping, I can just hit in God's Little Children and watch. It will put me to sleep. Remember, this is a person who doesn't hear speaking.
