Jet Li, is one of the best hand combat in the world. She has been over 20 years and puts others in a kind of shy. When he is great in Asia, he is not known here in the United States. The Black Mask has to be a movie of the outbreak for it, but it fails in amazement. First and foremost, it is known. Although it may be worth the camp (dubbing is not close to the flat with sound), it seems inappropriate for a typical movie viewer. Second, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a bad job. Slows the scenes quickly, sometimes, you don't know what's going on. Sometimes the camera trembles and trembles. Fans see Jet Li movies for wonderful martial arts. However, the director prepares events very quickly even if you don't know who is half-time! Sometimes, the area is left hanging (ie Li begins to cut a hole in the jeep floor, while the foolish are guns, two seconds later, Li and the interests of love have already been under the car!) Other events are so impossible, that they cross on sure to be totally ignorant (rom CD killing? Just give him the throw! Stars!). Li, he needs a director who cannot afford to cut machine guns and more to create a watch film. The rap / techno player was added you might be good to insert. The program is unlikely but all lost by cartoonish characters who remove any trust that this film is striving. And do we really believe that the love of love does not recognize Simon, because he has half a mask? What? Not the hair, the lower jaw, or the voice that puts it away? If you want to see Jet Li's film, try the Iron Monkey or its typical Shaolin Temple. This confused component is a complete waste of time ...... 2/10
