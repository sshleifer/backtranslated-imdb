I did not like Myra's movie, I am so happy that it had pushed the Hollywood envelope at that time. Then the Miss Welch costume became a romantic picture, although I need to wonder if many people who know the picture actually saw the film and know what all - <br /> I used Myra on FMC a few years ago and didn't think she was old The best years. There is a part about it in the cartoon headings of Cartoon Tracking History, where you are given a proper loan to put those great stars in what was good production. However, IMHO, the film is very bitter to be charming, it is also dirty to reform, and so busy trying surprises that it fails to inform, share, or make it ---
