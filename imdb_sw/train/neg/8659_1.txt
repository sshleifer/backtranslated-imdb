There are things that I can't understand. Such as this film. What if I could create a really good dino and crappy look with urine polygon model in Maya and then continue to cut and put it into a video video video that people scream and get food with one thing? How can a person even believe that a completely fake dinocroc that looks completely out of place, could affect events in this film? I know that its B-grade, low budget and all but producers can do better than making a piece of skin which no one will see or sit. It's just does'nt mean. Are people so ignorant that they could stay this way? It seems so. To laugh? No, this is not even good to laugh.
