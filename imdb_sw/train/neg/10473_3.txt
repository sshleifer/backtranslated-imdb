I went to see the Omega Code and a group of other Christians about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian filming. What we were was a painful, released, and very good effort on the film. It has good production standards but also has a bad acting, weak script and lousy conversation, and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group put this film as a reeking of cheese more than "Anaconda." None of us can believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. The effects of colors and movies to watch watch can not save this bad, bad film. I would give them 3 out of 10, and the rating is only high because I used the "movie" Werewolf (1996) caused the night before seeing this film.
