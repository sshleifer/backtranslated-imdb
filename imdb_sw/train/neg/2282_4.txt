"When a small village of Bavaria is faced with a death of a mysterious death, the local prosecutor demands a response in the attack. When the police police refuse to believe the lies about vampires to return to the village, the affected area doctor begins to witness the truth about crime," according with synopsis of the sleeve of DVD. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> It is an improper, incredible, mysterious character, a vampire. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the second part of the film can easily make the film star films: stoic Lionel Atwill (like Otto von Niemann), worried Melvyn Douglas (like Karl Brettschneider), and pretty Fay Wray (like Ruth Bertin). The most enjoyable help includes Dwight Frye (like Herman), hypochondriac Maude Eburne (as Aunt Gussie Schnappmann), and George E. Stone (as Kringen). Mr. Frye, Mrs Eburne, and Mr. Stone is very interesting. Is there another movie ending in the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Magenta sulfate? Epsom salt? it's laxative! ampire Bat Bat Bat
