After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for an exciting, put it in the competitive world of computer companies. All starred was another message which this film would be good. But when I didn't go look at the first week of release then it disappeared for 2 weeks I was afraid of something that was missing. With patience I was waiting for the release of the DVD, then bought a home rush to watch the evening enjoyable. The expectation of the home was better than the film. In the beginning this trend is disturbed. No idea has come into it and the director pretends to be his own part, so he can appear in the film. I can't be brutal to use later. Secondly the lead role is completely canceled as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe usually behaves as cold as in the entry of Cruel and Guns Way but in this he thinks that the pipeline hero who tries to show by hitting while running and having gray friends, but it won't seem to be the same. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani have not enough feature but when they do not have the closest displays are close to their bests. The only film view is Tim Robbins in a role that can be made to him and it is his hot anger and strange ways that draw the film. The end is that this film is one that fills the trailer for events you don't see on the film and instead includes only a part of the DVD movie. Give us even more ambition as though some of these events are non-normal they fill the key shortcomings in the story.
