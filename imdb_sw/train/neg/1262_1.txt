This film has a weak plot, weak character, and special effects of truth that I ask why I have lost precious life by looking at it. It has random characters who do not add something to the story and it looks like the reason for the director to find his partner in the film. Robots are sad and the main botanical "hero" turns and switches a big knife. If this film was not bad it might be interesting, but nothing surprising about it. The main character is just one of the characters of redemption, and he is murdered. It is sad when the root is for the wicked, because he is the best to be happy. When it is said and done, this film was best left on the floor of the cutting room, or never fully appreciated.
