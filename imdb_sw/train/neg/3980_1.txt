No, I don't. If you ever suggest the idea of ​​a film, they should be run out of the studio. I am bad. Their movies are the same in each other, and include only travel to foreign sites, having a problem that can easily solve, hoping to be popular, and finding new husbands. Think about it. If you have ever seen a movie that attracts you to a different plot, contact me and tell me her name. These "movies" are a bad excuse to be on TV and go to other countries. There are reasons why movies are never available on the movie. I am sure that when they were young and they did O.K. The movie, the other boss of the studio bought their rights for 15 years, or something, so that they now exist, what, 17, can make movies in other countries whenever they want to use studio funds. I would advise you, Go away with MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! It's for you!
