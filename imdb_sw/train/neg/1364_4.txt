The more I think about it, there is nothing liberated about this film /> <br />. I saw it was 9 months ago, so my memory would make them <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know it's at least as bad 4 / <br /> after seeing the movie, I met the director. he seemed to have no idea of ​​what he had done or what he had done, and even if I was / he would tell him, he didn't care about the film. he even admitted that he did not know what he had done, and he had to do certain things because it was done by digit. I felt that the film was trying to tackle the form that it has built itself: "9 people should be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> we can get from the point. 'A' redirecting 'B' 'so that we can get out of <br /> <br /> the prostitute we see at the beginning and return to her last 10 minutes on everyone's relationship with another person. <br /> <br /> makes you feel one with a demo 2, the wrong attractions I remember one part of the film release. Steve <br /> Bouchemi is one place where she is amazing. it is. if I <br /> <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
