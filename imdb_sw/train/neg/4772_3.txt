Before watching this film, I could already say it is a full copy of Saw (full and a place of shack if they had a black man want someone to break his hand out of cuffs). MJH's name on the film could remove me (ugh, we could say GROSS?!), But I wanted to try it. Starting out, I longed for it. Acting is awesome and I found myself laughing almost every reaction from the characters (especially the person who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I kept watching. However, that end was the biggest cage of all! I was wondering to think "That was the end? What is this comedy?" I thought that this bunch was funnier than the "Scary Movie" spoofs and that is actually saying something!
