This movie makes several errors. few US actors in Spain, and Spanish actors speak English. English 'spaniards' is the same, but the way that acting takes place makes it all very angry. The conversation via the entire script is very weak; It can be a Spanish script but was dealt with incorrectly, who knows and cares. I can only assume that these are the famous Spanish actors are forced to enter English, they may be good, but not here. you will watch the movie within the first 5 minutes, that's how sad. then others are just bad. waste time, many UN votes. Did I mention one of Baldwins' in this.
