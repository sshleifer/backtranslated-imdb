The sectors that appear on this film are known for their claim to take the 'message' of the Bible without any change or extra biblical influence. The presence of this film is just because of the fact that there is no such thing. If you want to know what a new birth of Christianity was about the seventy years just look at the word 'rapture' in the dictionary of worship and groups. It is much faster than staying through this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Acting bad, infinite quality and script that can be written easily by Jack T Chick (a Christian pastor of conspiracy to those who do not know the Evangelical Area). It could not keep this in 'very bad is good' so its only listeners are those with a collection of booklets looking for a branch out or very much paranoid.
