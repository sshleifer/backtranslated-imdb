Yes, folly! I've finished looking and still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, "extra" unwanted stories, stupid characters (I think they want to achieve comic freedom, but I wanted to cry) ... a lot of everything. Shame to destroy one of God's stories from the "Light of Arabia" like this. Child, naive (all in the wrong way) and for many mistakes to break the magic, I don't think this can put a fifth child for more then ten minutes. Princess is beautiful, but it should be false, causing the actress not know how to perform the role. Some of the cast are worse ... "Our evil man" is really bad. Shama that "good man" is not the best. The only light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who goes unfortunately under his level with this, but at least put his / her "fighter" skills on. I am sorry to see him in something like this, but I'm glad that I had something to look at in a young girl, then thank David. Only, alone, for him, I give these two stars to this fiasco ... I would like to give him more, but that would stand the last mark for the entire movie. The rest is very bad, that I would like, maybe, suggest, but no bridge partner then 1 here, and I think that would be very much.
