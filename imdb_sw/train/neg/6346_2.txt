This movie begins! You will need two hours as well as it takes to get. Sliding Doors, w / Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda is trying to do much more. The movie was wise, confident, and well done. I cared about what happened to Gwyenths - or instead of the characters that played - and the performances to support the cast were wonderful. <br /> Where if Melinda & Melinda are taresome, the discussion is available and I might have been less concerned about any of these people - the youngest Melinda. Melinda one is not suitable to work - her first glass of wine is at 10 - and so the voice of pride says, and not in the sense of comedic. Melinda's 2 is beautiful, but it didn't forget. Woody Allen's collective movies worked because, I think, spent time on screens and executives were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay for two months: you can tell him. And when Chloe Sevigny has a talent - those around him are not, they don't have enough to exist. The movie ends with Chloe Sevigny and a group of other people you know you've seen in other movies but they can't quite remember which it is. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
