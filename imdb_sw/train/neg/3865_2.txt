This is very bad. Poor actors. You can tell them they are trying very hard to polish, but we all know they can't. Writing is obvious and simple, it's sad to see trying to sell it. Humor and walking are frustrated, it is difficult to believe any of these actors who are signed for this. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so bad that we have a hard time looking away from the screen. We should only know where the fall of the train goes. But that's just because we got it on TV. If we had paid for this, we would like to worry. It gets 2 stars for at least for exciting / exciting exciting. And the music caused (as opposed to the sound-of-the-sound sounds) reminds you of the part of Scooby-Doo ... but it's not good.
