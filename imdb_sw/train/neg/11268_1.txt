I was hoping that this film would at least be seen. The plan was weak to say at least. I expected much more to focus on the promotion line (I wonder if any of them will put this in their CVs?). At least I did not pay taxes. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but all the parts of the film are full of PANTS.
