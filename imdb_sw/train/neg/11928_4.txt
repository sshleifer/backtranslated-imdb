The Saints' life begins with the view of London as a city of busy garden, day and sun roads. I was hoping that it would maintain this situation, but it faces a story that goes pretty much anywhere. Othello works for huge fat, Mr. Karva's father, father-father-father (at least I think it is because he is not fully explained, but he leaves kittens on fresco fats, so depend , he is slick) doing little lines when his girl's skanky gives the work of the father's hand. One of her colleagues is a player, a black dude who always drives from A to B. Until the day she comes a little lost child who gives her permission to be able to stop running. The player sends the lost boy to Othello flat, where he starts to give more wishes. He wants to have his own desires fulfilled, Karva has a trap. But he does not know exactly what brings him happiness. Is it a crime to be a child again or is it another work of hand? Any way, I don't want to see a little boy give him a second permission. It takes years to go and there are repeat events. The latter tries to be surprising but with no complicity of the story on investment in any of these characters only provides as a release to the exhausted audience. <br /> <br /> Author Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to combine in some form of religious religion that ends up as stupid as all hell, surprisingly. If he gave us something that could be more accessible or at least had a good explanation for the characters suddenly doing all that was wonderful then it would be the most enjoyable film. As is the case, we are brought up by a group of loud-sounding sounds that seem to develop to mind when they are faced with a wonderful boy. What nature is not revealed. That's just anger! <br /> <br /> In addition to the wonderful time of the sky and the scary mark, this film is not available.
