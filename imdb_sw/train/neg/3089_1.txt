This film is very bad, it's fun. In fact, the Mystery Science Secret 3000, a television show in which three characters have tried and bad movies, they used this film to laugh. I recommend checking (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this film. <br /> <br /> Please, don't see Hobgoblins if you're ready to stop within the first location. True, don't see this film, time. Please. At least not by weight. His joke is not funny (you say a little), and you will have more parodying fun or look at his identification and watch the film. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick about looking, so fun yourself. Read the book. Wash clothes. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
