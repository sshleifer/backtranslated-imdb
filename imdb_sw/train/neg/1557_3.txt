Modern essence is a striking string of horrible clich√©s that does not provide a deeper understanding of culture and culture. East Eastern trips are described in a particularly offensive way: there are obviously there are bricks in the brick, dirt drops in the middle of the desert, women wearing black clothes and belly players. I wonder how the camel and palm palms were lost from the whole picture. The creativity of the two main characters is a very sketch and many situations are unreliable. The original idea may be surprising, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural knowledge, you should leave this film.
