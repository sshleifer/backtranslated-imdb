The clear b-grade finance efforts in Hostel / Saw buzz, my prospects for this film were low (actually down!) And still managed to tremble every level. Acting is so bad that it is not surprising, the plot line does not exist and just fear that I realized I had lost a 21-minute watch! I am surprised to see that 34 people gave 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34 is likely the mother of directors? - although I am sure even will find it hard to go higher than 2! Additional DVD included an "do" feature of the feature. Which raises the question, "Why?" (though maybe it caters to what you don't do!). Avoid at all costs.
