A great secret, but the film flows down the hill from there. The beginning is a promise and the collapse of the car and the woman and her daughter are burned before the police, Edward. He is suffering on this and seems to spray. A secret letter comes from an old girl asking for help to find her daughter. So Ed goes to the island of a particular woman. You just don't like. Many forms include Ed displayed around the city for a girl. That has made the film too long. Finally it gets better towards the end when we learn about the spiritual traditions that a woman makes and ultimately a bad deal in storage for Edward. Overall, it's not a well-written and very long story. <br /> <br /> VERDICT OF THE YEAR: I can fly this.
