From the way of hitting the flicks for speed it falls in a short time as the required entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and indeed the whole cast was completely destroyed. The joke of evil is full, and every line of punch is telegraphed. One dumb pipe comes faster, and almost everyone falls flat like grapes. Music numbers only contribute to the weight that goes through the entire movie. Another negative is the very claustrophobic environment within the walls of the polluted school. Avoid this and find one of the true "Lampoon" films like "Golddiggers National Lampoon" - MERK
