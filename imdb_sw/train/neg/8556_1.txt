Okay, I have been like the idea of ​​this movie. I am in the population, and I kinda identify with some stories. Even sometimes the useless conversation seems to be true, and in a different film it would be forgiven. I'm trying as hard as you can to keep this film as others did, but it's not easy when the creators of the film do not really try. <br /> <br /> The editor in this film is awesome! It's probably the worst editing I've ever seen on the movie! There are things that you do not have to go to the film school to learn, to rely on good editing is not one of them, but to recognize the worst one is. <br /> <br /> Also, shoot ... Oh my God shots, just bad! I can't even go to the details, but sometimes we see only things that don't explode, and that, in conjunction with the layout, it will give you an experience of more sensitive filming. <br /> <br /> This movie is done on a low or no budget and 4 cast and employees are not excused too. I have seen a short film on youtube and a lot of artistic accomplishments! Joe, Greta, I don't know what you were thinking, but this film is not just a masturbation of all your egos. You should feel ashamed of themselves! In conclusion, this film is just like a boy's porn movie video will be like full of 3 or 4 sexual sex scenes separated by a long and enjoyable conversation with a disgusting scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all costs!
