It has emerged, unknown, small images, bad pictures and trends ... all of them very clearly the first attempts of pregnancy in commercial business decisions with good people in TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Photo has achieved success in the past by helping bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, on the big screen. But the "Omega Code" is a bad damage. As a supporter of TBN and its many programs and who loved "China Cry", I still feel it is impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do very well with their service, but this is not an example of that. Don't waste your money ... go to rent "China Cry" instead.
