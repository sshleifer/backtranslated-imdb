You saw this film recently and were very optimistic. It is not very basic on the director, who had not made the release of the movie before, but more according to its cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (the leading role in the Body twice, Brian De Palma's Catholic) have had a star in a good movie. Not together, this fact has not been changed because of this. <br /> <br /> The film is impossible, very predictable and it seems. The only thing that can do little is the selection of areas that have been beaten. In my humble view: don't waste your time on this.
