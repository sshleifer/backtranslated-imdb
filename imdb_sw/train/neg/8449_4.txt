The story of pride, murder of murder, child sexual abuse, gay and Catholic church ..... full trip. What? How many of the UK's most basic dramas, stay etc. etc. must have a gay necessary, in fact it gets a problem now. Everyone acknowledges that there are Gay people in the community only there are a few other groups, but we do not like to be in the head under our throat (I will pass this) in every single show. In addition to the above, the game was derived from what could be a fascinating story in the pantomime, the priest was pedophile and there is a gay who runs everywhere, oh yes just that the PC's completely gay couple was black. I am surprised to ecclestone c to even contemplate this when he read the script.
