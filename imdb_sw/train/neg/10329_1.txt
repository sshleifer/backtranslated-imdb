I am trying to paint the pitch for the dark angel. "I think Matrix, I think Bladerunner, I think that a chick that has faith in an angel, wearing black black - or chick like him, leave that one with us .. just - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, conversation, behavior, A good step or budget, big huge marijuana and hot chick in red black skin run big bicycles Fanboys dig big pigs and hot chicks in the black skin of thin skin run a big bike, right? " Wonders, inferior, dreary, formulaic, passionless, teteous, dull, dumb, humorless, desultory, very difficult. Anime action anime without any action, or in fact any life. SF just how Joe Fanboy likes, in fact. :(
