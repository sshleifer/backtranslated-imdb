First of all, anyone who thinks that William Friedkin's good "French Relationship", is even better to be totally insane or female or both. The problem with this film is that, a.) It is a free film guide, which makes it always look at it with difficulty, and b.) Directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best US directors, and so I wanted to love it. William Friendkin was a perfect man of filming on drug trafficking in the ruins of a new York City, because of his style of action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most beautiful directors ever, ie "Manchurian "and" Second ", and for" France's 2 "relationship feels like someone is trying to be feeling and they have no real understanding of erasing it. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the good to Gene Hackman himself tells a lot about the knowledge of Hackman about the original film as well. It is known that hackman hated Friedkin on the set and swore never to work with him again, also known that he thought the character was more dimensional, losing weight and trying to play as a direct character. shows you a hackman, despite being a good actor, he had no idea who to make a film and a great story. The action of Doyle's plot is an impressive, but it does not want all the film. Bad error in the film Frankenhimer.
