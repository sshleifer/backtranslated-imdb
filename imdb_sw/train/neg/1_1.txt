Robert DeNiro has a very illiterate student at all times. This movie is losing talent, it is really disgusting. Script is impossible. Conversations cannot be trusted. Jane Fonda's behavior is a caricature of herself, and not one funny. The movie goes to the speed of snails, is photographed in an unofficial way, and inasfferablyetay. It also finds everywhere in the book. Kurtz Swoozie is the best in the role of helping, but so what? The offensive condition is the new IMDB rule that requires ten lines for each inspection. While the movie is useless, it does not require a ten-verse text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
