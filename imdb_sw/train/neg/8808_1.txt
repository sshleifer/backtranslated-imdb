"ASTONISHING" Screams LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They should be referring to the fact that the piece of the same pole was ever released. The film surrounds a group of girls who have a disease that makes them young, and killing innocent people just to be alive. Their skins leave the film, we see also the broken legs, the heads that are on the lobby as the Halloween set of Fuzzy Felt. There is a lot of talking b * ll ks, a bit of human food and some weird zombie hunter chapter who has bound the patients with skin disease in his closet chair, before they hit them in the head, ending them in bits ... > <br /> You get a picture. Considering no good talent is displayed all the time, and the exception is unusual, what is all this farrago? Also check the video box, the person responsible for it is "underground director". What? Would that be like those religious cults in which they incite to think of one way when it is clear is the opposite of truth? Because that's the only reason I can think of anyone getting pleasure to check this tax. Then, in the same verse he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oiache. Now you just become stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like to enjoy this film? Are you sorry with the above comments? If so, you must be a member of that worship. Do they pay your salary? What? Are you able to see other family members? What? They encourage you to watch Andrew Parkinson's films until you think he is the best director since A.Hitchcock? Do you say ... this looks like a special panorama for me. And say hello to the defendant of LA time when you return to your colony, do you? 0/10
