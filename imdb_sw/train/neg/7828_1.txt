With 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is only one long line of tarantino-offs offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere in which the movie is building is exciting for the first five minutes, but filmmakers make an unpleasant mistake to allow unwanted violence and the hip "quotient". You're better to fly this.
