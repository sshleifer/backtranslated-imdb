Since its release in 1983, "Christmas Story", Pastor Jean-reported his alter-ego story, Ralphie, has been a true session. "My Story", however, still has a Pastor as a writer, but does not quite charm, and the characters do not have a place near the original film. "My Summer Story" is essentially a mishmash of an unusual story and just a very interesting, which includes hillbilly neighbors and fighting heads. Charles Grodin, who I usually like, is very different from the role of the father (more involved with Darren McGavin in nature), and his character does not seem to be anything unless forced. Kiernan Culkin is a little alternative to Ralphie, and the younger brother is forgotten here. The mother just seems to be worth here and probably because she throws the bean manager of the movie and the gravy boat when she loses her luck away from the angry mother on "night of free dishes". they are many inappropriate and thin sheets. It can appeal to very undemanding but as a good "Christmas story", it is very poor and not recommended at most people. 2 out of 10.
