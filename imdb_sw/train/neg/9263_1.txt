What is involved in clothing? They were all dressed as something from the late 70's early. Cars even had time. The school was outdated. Muslims' clothing was lost at a time, and the hospital seemed like something from 40 years, with its wards and wooden skills and things. Nothing in the whole movie said it was done in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying "Geeeee-od! WHAT is this movie doing?" We fought "INFO BUTTON" in our village, we had certainly 1991 it had to be a typo! Did anyone else see this? However, my FAVORITE part was when a woman told her husband of the uckity, on the phone, on the cross interrupted in the mirror, and just says "Well, look, I have a congress meeting. You about it later." . JUST LIKE MAN! My favorite mom's favorite is when they give the "Spawn of the Baby Child" its very own Rottweiler. My mother said "Only what the Spawn of the Devil requires ... Rottweiler" Also enjoyed all the people falling into churches, closing their chest. ONE of its favorite parts was a boy in a school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, driving into a truck / landing truck. He had only 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he just went on, and looked real dumb about his face. I mean, how fast can you go to the school parking lot? Anyway!
