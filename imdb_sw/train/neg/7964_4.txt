"Creepshow 2" is a little more than the imitation of the original color, designed with less purpose than money in the name of the original film. It even increases the player's error, which was often predictable and burdensome. However, for the first time around, there was enough stimulation for regular mixing, resulting in poor and general recreational efforts. The view has a very good time, so the story of the story is more visible. Once in a while, it produces, but often, it stays there. <br /> <br /> As in the past, all stories revolve around the usual retaliation theme and just dessert. Indian timber comes to life, responsible for revenge on its owner's killers. Teenagers are eaten by a marine monster. The suspect returns from the dead to follow the driver no matter what. None of these buildings are bad for themselves, but they do not completely disappear. There are few surprises and no events. This is an example of unmotivated text books, and-of-the-number films to make. It is not appropriate to have this cheap movie facing a flat direction, although being honest, there was not much to work with. At the end, the second story comes out better, but not to the extent. <br /> <br /> For many places, the displays are the same for the best. George Kennedy, as the owner of a supermarket shop, does enough work, if not conversion. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is as good as a convicted driver, sympathetic to his problem despite predictable materials, better. However, many characters are generally thin. One can think that "Creepshow 2" would be better. George Romero, who led the original text, returned to write a query, focusing on the story of Stephen King. Characteristics of the artists Tom Savini returns to good work, the gory. So why is the film removed? I think Romero did not want to make a second film, but he had to do so for financial reasons. It was ten years of sequels of fear, clones, off-offs, and whatnot, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine a boy writing a script quickly, taking his salary, and running. I think he had to do what was needed to get his own funded projects; we can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Released by New World Images
