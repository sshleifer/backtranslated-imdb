This was the worst film I ever seen in my life. No, indeed. I have not given birth. All "according to true stories / historical records" aside, there is no reason to act as bad. It is a shame, because, as others have published, sets and clothes were good. The sound of the voice was the sound of "asian" music, although I did not know where "modern" love song came when Fernando slept in bed thinking Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was sent to the 1500s. N-EZ. <br /> <br /> But acting. O, sadly sad. Balls are offered as a good game to play. If Gary Stretch has given potato clothing to the 4H Ward Store it may have more faith. To the end he shouted more like a little string of Italy on the street. Sometimes half was expected to tell "Adrian!" or even "You want my piece?" <br /> <br /> My favorite line: When the queen says her boyfriend (after hitting the floor) "I'll have a baby." Responds "baby?" I expected to answer "No, jackass, foot seat! Duh."
