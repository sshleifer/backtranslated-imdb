The worst DCOM I have seen. Forever. Maybe it's not as bad as Smart House. This was very bad. Acting and story was good, but the effects were made! <br /> <br /> They were fake! Only good anti-location was among the brothers and Shen. That is probably the event that I was excited about. Overall, I have found this exciting film and a full-time films. I will give four to Brenda Song who is a very good actor and that one to fight the area. <br /> <br /> 4/10
