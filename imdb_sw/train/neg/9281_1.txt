The Antichrist can be behind the tragedy. Only one hopes that this will be the power to stimulate behind the "film"! This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMD, finally, so we could destroy it. What makes this movie worse is that it had material like GREAT! I have never seen a film where all the elements were very improper by giving less results to its pieces. It may not seem important, but I would like to start with a logo. As a proud owner of a degree of music, I must register my fury! I burst between laughter and dry weeds as I listened to what John Scheffer did for the Goldsmith brilliant mark; it was much worse than any deaths of burlesque, and almost as unknown. It was the worst mark I have ever heard since, well, I can't think of one of the worst. Maybe JAWS 4? <br /> <br /> As for the plot ... Sorry. Mysticism New Age ??? What happened to the trustworthiness of the original trilogy? In these films (more so than in the first two than the third, but still !!) the most common part was, and it was the illusion that made the film more reliable. Here we have white crystals (call all Skeksis and Mystics !!) and ban the obstacle, even if in some cases crucifux will be quite common but for the camera angle. The lack of psychological psychological damage is a natural disease in our common psyche: it comes from "face-blowing" of planned nausea and transparent transparency. Add to that the leading "actor" so surprisingly ANNOYING that you are very grateful to the director for those events that does not exist. I have never seen a little girl persuaded her since Stephanie's younger daughter had destroyed ALL WOMEN. <br /> <br /> Other than that, I don't have a strong feeling on the subject ;-) Luckily the first three film is enough to give this break the train of losing celluloid cells or, at all times, research in how not to make a film. Watch out! It can bring vomiting if you are lucky.
