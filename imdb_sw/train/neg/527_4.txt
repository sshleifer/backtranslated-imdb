Dial die for a film that is very small. Vanessa Redgrave dies but before going she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... This is one of those movies that seem to be just a good film because they have so many actors and many actors in it so it seems be on something else than potboiler that is true. Not as bad as but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all good performances) you expect more than a sad story which is less than romance harlequin. <br /> <br /> Waiting for Cable.
