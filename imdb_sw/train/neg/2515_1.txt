This film is disgusting, and its decisions should be considered as a crime of the village. One of the biggest films of filing decisions is why no one has ever made an effective film of this amazing mystery. It is a myth of the story of promoting, good of the old romance, and the humor of the English of dry. Why the creators had to change Richard Gordon from the Yard Scotland police for an amateur detective, establishing the role of idiotic and caricature of his English servant, changing part of the main story on the murder charge and the state of Gordon's fight to save the defendant, etc., etc.? These manufacturers and directors who always think they can make the story better than one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to confiscate someone else's products.
