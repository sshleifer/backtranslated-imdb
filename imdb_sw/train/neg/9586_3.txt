Following the disasterous Revolution, this film was pretty much nail last in the coffin of Goldcrest and so British Film Industry. The film is totally pants, it is full of music from the mid-80 jazz revival attempt and the book's book & the author was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sinked again into an unknown. Temple searched for years trying to find Suzette and came up with 8 Wonders Patsy KENSETT someone else who was briefly popular in time. When the film out of production after Jazz revival was over, as it was KENSETT's work and the film met totally irresponsible public film. <br /> <br /> Mediocre will be overstatement for some bad / campest / cheesiest acting for ever a favorable British screen money looking at about 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy.
