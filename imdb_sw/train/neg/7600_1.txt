This movie proves that good acting comes from a good direction and this is not happening in Asking Dust. Colin Farrell is a good actor but in this he is young. Donald Sutherland comes as an amateur. Why? Because the script is bad, the change is bad and the executives seem tired and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could just imagine when it would finish and I opened half of the way. The director has done a very bad job and though I have not read the novel is certainly a lost place. The atmosphere of this film tries to eliminate messages and stories does not reach the audience. In a word, it is a TERRIBLE film.
