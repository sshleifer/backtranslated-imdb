Siskel & Ebert were severe on this show if you agreed with them or not because of the real crisis of their professional opinion. Roeper took this show under a summary or two because he did not really critic the film and because he instead of snide for comments. Now, when Ben Lyons comes, I feel like I am looking at "Youth News" - do you know, that children's news shows, attended by children for children? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have just met enough food for the most popular life throughout their lives. The idea that these two amateurs have anything of interest or the result of saying a motion picture is difficult. If they watch a non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just see "confusing". Waiting - I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. When Siskel, Ebert, and Roper suggested independent films and were just hit-or-miss with a huge label crop budget - it's amazing what: these two like the great schlock of the label and just manage to tolerate a few indies. Plus everyone knows the age group of TV advertising targeting. Transparency of nepotism is icing on the cake. In another world what do these graduates like film critics?
