People who say this film is a real desire - I hope at least that Leonard will see $$ nice out of this, since his life savings had been beaten away from the manager a few years ago and is over 70 now. But this film is just awesome. Earlier Leonard himself says he doesn't care about the past, and then for an hour and a half of the film emphasizes all the worst elements of Leonard's songs. That is the most powerful blood and its infinite shortage of more singers. Cohen's interviews have been done closely with the video and I wanted to see between or a long shot of his whole body! I was not worried about the views of artists, especially the Ego boys of Edge and Bono more. No singers in this film has made even one song like beautiful music of Leonard and if you think about this and you have any doubt, beware. This will be a special PBS special, perhaps, at one time display. But I even hesitate to get to this DVD. When finally the film shows Leonard doing "The Song Tower" is destroyed by Bono to take a line. Even the best regular performances (the first Antony, Rufus, Martha's The Traitor) have been destroyed by the context of this part of turgid blabla. Forget this, and go buy a recent album of Leonard if you want to pay taxes.
