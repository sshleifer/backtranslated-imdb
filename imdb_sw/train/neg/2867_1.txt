I was lying on my bed, with cold or cold or anything. I think maybe I would like to kill at some time watching the horrible movies my mother bought for a while. I would never take this movie! After watching it I felt more sick and I wanted to throw it. Afterwords (when I was better) I did research on Dennis L.Rader and noticed that Dennis in the movie was not as real. I hope that no one has ever seen this film but if they have never eaten it and you will feel how I felt after watching it first. I think you would have a good time to look at Santa Claus 3. At least this movie had the best views on this site.
