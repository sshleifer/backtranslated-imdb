Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - who had been kidnapped) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). He then decides to destroy the male (or something like that) and continues to teach the film history in the acting university by John Huston with lecherous (do not ask) and break the happy young (young, beautiful, hunter Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett). yes Farrah Fawcett). They took a great novel and Gore Vidal that could not delete and, usually, tried to beat the film. They also hired an English man with an anti-American character and recruited a group of skilled "talent" talentes (Welch, Reed) and old lost professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), put it all together and .... SURPRISE !!! Full distress. The movie got X at the time of release (decreased by R), mainly because the true area of ​​Welch eliminates Rusty (Roger Herren) and the area where Welch tries to have sex with Fawcett. The movies are spreading ... events are running everywhere and people say and do things that they don't know. Not very good but I was never tired. <br /> <br /> Acting varies with wildly ... Reed is awesome ... really sad. Huston restores the environment regularly and over and over again. Welch is really not as bad as Myra but its lines don't mean to know what to do to him. West is not available on the film (blessing) and it is a type of patients to hear the woman around the joke of 80 years old. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was very young, good and not bad as Rusty. Fawcett is the same. It is difficult to find things to say about this ... you just look for unbelief. You must see the movie - believe !!!!
