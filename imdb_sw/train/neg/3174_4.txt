Jeff Lowell has written and directed 'over His Body' to evil. The idea is the very first, it's as much as my joke and the implementation is just cherry on the cake. Minus Eva Longoria Parker is hardly anything interesting in this film. Eva looks good as ever and provides good performance. Paul Rudd appears to have loved and at least interested. Lake Bell is a perfect miscast. He looks at romantic and provides a normal performance. Jason Biggs has been twisted, so Lindsay Sloane. I expected more entertainment from this film. Unfortunately, I was not happy.
