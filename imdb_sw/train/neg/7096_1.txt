It's amazing that it succeeds to be awesome on many levels. Script, acting, leadership and cast choice are all awesome. Clothing, sets and language of pseudo and medieval are also quite bad. In an unusual way I enjoyed this film, once I agreed that it would not be any good. It seems a shame that people will spend a lot of time and effort making something very bad, when they would actually do something very good outside the premise (not quite trustworthy!), But instead we are treated with a stretch and enjoyable story of dragons and knights, which is not good for any The charm that is available in other fantasy films. Let's just hope that the Lord of the Rings is much better! Oh, and haircut for David Thewlis make him like He-Man. Come on!
