First of all it is white, so I try to crush gently into the eternal lesson of the race ... however ... Europeans Hate Black People = BAD but People of the People Hate White People = OK (because it seems we deserve it !! ). Where do I start? I would like to have something good to say about this film beside the unexpected events of the comedy: the terrible scene was Ice Cube and co. get into battle with some very serious, very powerful, really very angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win !!! neo-Nazi where double size :), and expel! The track is very valuable ... this is not a film about discrimination, patience and understanding, it does not give ... this is a color racist movie that assures all the obstacles of the clich√©, a white wimpy boy who gets manhandled with his black roommate automatically changing in skinhead ... cmon just bad I sad ever see. <br /> <br /> Save your time and bad experience of bad text, non-fiction, light and clear images, if you are in the lesson, go and rent an American History X, now the movie
