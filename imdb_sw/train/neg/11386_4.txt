One of these A-God-I-don't-live-there. He tells about two groups fighting in Colombia, prisons and delegates, and the adjacent Medellin people. Guns, drugs and death have spread. Boys, who are 22 years old, are not in the middle of the war is in jail. Girls? not women, girls? always respond to the same way when one of them killed, with tears and shouting. You start your head; what did they expect, really? I don't know what was most interesting: night tanks and civil unrest, or that everyone just seems to accept things like. Or, to see that boy drink what is not his first beer, what is it, 10? If you could take any of these young people from their situation and put them where they had the opportunity to do more, to be more, how many would choose to want? <br /> <br /> According to this document, all, I'm afraid.
