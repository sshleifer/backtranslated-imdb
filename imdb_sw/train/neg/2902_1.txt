Spoiler: A group of uncomfortable and brutal people who include family. Script has them to say and do things people never do, at least anyone with shred of dexterity. The hero falls to a woman who sees as her soul of soul in a modern shop day to meet, she does not know she will show as a brother's brother in reunion. He is trying to erase his brother's claims, but he, knowing our hero is easily understood by him, unkind to him by wearing a sexy dress and pretending to be a girlfriend, playing each other because of the fraud that shows him how to stretch. At the same time, he bothers himself and finds himself. She tries to cover her eyes. His heart is breaking. He thinks it's funny, until he suddenly decides they don't want the brothers to leave the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really does. The audience encouraged and encouraged his way in a long way. This writing is useless and unpredictable. We were about to walk out, but we kept thinking about something that might happen that would lose, but nooooo. All the beautiful reviews should be written with the shillings paid, out of caring for the poor heroes like me in seeing this trick. Compare with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, authors, actors, producers, and movies by letting any bad thing do with the screen!
