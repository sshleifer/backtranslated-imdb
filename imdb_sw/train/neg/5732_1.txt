I'm on the "bad" movie of fear but this was a bunch of dog sh! How anyone can call this cool or decent movie is more than me. If you would like a flight editing to achieve special effects, acting badly and bad script then go to it! There was no emphasis on anything and the reason for the year was laughable because it was fake. I'll take a Hostel or Wolf Creek on this pile any day. My partner gave after 20 minutes, knows the stinker when he sees one. I on the other hand with ignorance I sat on the entire movie just waiting and see if it's better. No luck! I haven't seen his other movie facing and I doubt whether I will bother now.
