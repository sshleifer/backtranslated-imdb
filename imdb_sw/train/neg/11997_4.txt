This movie has very little and all that I see. it is a long and cautious pain. I could see all the audience getting patience and waiting to put an end to it. The run time is more than 3 hours that can be edited down to two hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between the story is average. Many people admit that they are sitting waiting for something better to come out. <br /> <br /> is just funny in bags. The project of pride and low selection. govinda does a good job, anil kapoor despised me, just rest as expected. if you expect anything near the babel or the real love then there is no one around.
