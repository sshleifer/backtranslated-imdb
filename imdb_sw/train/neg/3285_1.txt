While the movie as "Dukes of Hazzard" brings more than 75 million dollars makes a good statement about our social status. Maybe we are too stupid to stay away from the trash like this or maybe I don't realize how many people this kind of trash-no-quest will be appealing to. <br /> <br /> The mobile was not motivated to make good movies since it provides garbage then people will see anyways since nothing else on the screen. This is it. I went out despite passing a free film. Talk can not be dumber. Stunts can not be more advanced and higher. Perhaps this "big picture" attracts Texans but it has not attracted me to anyone else in the theater. There are no "big names" contained in this function flick, except for Burt Reynolds, which says you all need to hear. Jessica Simpson - you have to laugh. I would like to even recommend this film to the video, even if you were interested. This was all about deceiving the public to earn enough money after the opening of the day to the same or to do better than the cost through the markets. They did despite the publicity they predicted. Stupidity has increased.
