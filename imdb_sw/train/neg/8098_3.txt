This is one of the most angry rewrites I've been viewed. If they want to make a film with a lousy story, they should stop giving the title of a good book. There is no connection between Wolfe's book and this movie except the title. I don't know the change if it helps the flow of stories on the screen. At least the change should not hurt the final product. The last event in the film is very sad. Pastors are sent. The director and / or the scribe of the screens certainly cannot decide whether to perform a strong comedy or to preach untrue preaching. If you have seen this film and do not like it, try a book. If you see this film and love it, read the book.
