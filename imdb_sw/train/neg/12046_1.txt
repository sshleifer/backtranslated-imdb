I had a great hope of Troy and I've been very disappointed. The film was so badly done that it made my stomach limp. The pacing was slow, the laughable dialogue with the film - well off and nice to combat the area between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (pinch) - others were inferior. And why, oh why Hollywood always insist on writing a story to fit 'approval permit'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war reached 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris. It tells me that such a common story like this has turned into soap. And do not start to begin with 'lack of' chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was a war woman was battered and did not look like if they both cared about a great deal about another. No spark, no feelings, no hope. <br /> <br /> I tell you in the film defense Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole did very well with a bad but not enough script to save this bad movie. Is there anyone can tell me where the Â£ 200,000,000 budget went? Perhaps all the trees they used for funeral pyres - where did they get all the trees? I'm very disappointed.
