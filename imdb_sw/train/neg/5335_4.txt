It's been time of looooonnnggg since I saw this comedy, and I would not forget how idiotic it is. I would like to put this easily in two of the three worst films of Elvis Presley. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-year-old Indian goldwoman who returns home to Arizona with a broken shade where his family does not live, and where his friends love to share all night. His parents play with Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the third offers anything of the substance, basically or otherwise. The government has invested in family animals, but they have no cattle. Elvis sings a few unimportant songs, and is followed by a little-mad girl with her gun. This is a real slapdash of aggression, and the very shaking environment is caused by compost and does not make it easier. One thing that bothers you, however, is that Elvis really seems to have a good time in the film. Hard to believe, based on he was very angry on the stuck to make many movies mediocre.
