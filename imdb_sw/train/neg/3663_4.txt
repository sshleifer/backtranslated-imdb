The Spanish fear of the star Paul Naschy star in this, one of his films was the most fragmented ... but loaded with me for a while. Many people will know this under his usual TV head, FURY WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions for many years. If you want to be bad about giving a right shot though, the most amazing version I saw is going on and WOLF MAN's head is not available, and it is an endless and complete version of Europe which recurs several inconvenient shots and has no nude original shots that do not exist in the publication of FURY. It is also baruaboxed. <br /> <br /> Naschy has Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet just knowing that he contracted a lawawolf and that his wife has been having something. She takes care of her and her partner during a variety of animals, but they are a guinea pig for a good woman doctor and a female assistant. Apparently, the doc tries to "beat" waswolf, and there is a wonderful love of sado-eyeschistic area between him and Daninsky hairy and angry who is under his view, at least in the previous version. Finally we find two waswolves at the same price as Daninsky wolf war! The main problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy claims) was often drinking, and the results are actually rather adequate. While checking WOLF MAN does not waste a copy, it's not too difficult to do what is going on, although editing remains angry in advertising. Worse are rare cases that are not portrayed by the wolf of Naschy's invasion that came directly from the original film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") and confused into this without any reasonable reason! The wolf's clothing changes from the black shirt to white and back again, such as his behavior; One time the wolf is walking around in the usual way in fantastic trance from FURY, next he is growing and running very close from BLOODY TERROR. Really really.
