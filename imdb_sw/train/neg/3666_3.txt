This is one very mixed movie. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot was not found to have any meaning. Wolfman's anger was released in Spain and I think that when any film is called from one language to another, it does not translate it as it meant first. Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt whether it can count all the problems with this film. Dubbing is very bad and voices are not identical to the characters very well. These events are chappy, there are a variety of strange and useless characters that make a little more than a mixture even more. What I did about this film was looking for wolfman himself and events where he would attack. Now if they could put it all together and have meaning, they could have something. Don't waste your time on this.
