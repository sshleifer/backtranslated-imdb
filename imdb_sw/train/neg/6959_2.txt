I went to see this a few days ago, and it is difficult to forget the film ... for the wrong reasons. This film should be interesting, not, not just one laughter in the playground (perhaps by josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. They say only quickly and don't open enough to them to understand. I had a friend with over 4 or 5 times I found myself saying after the line that you should be funny "what, what said", and I am French. I hate to say that, because of the fact that I think a good film is being done here, but I apologize for the first time that all visitors who are going to see the film (shown out of France). <br /> <br /> We are very sorry for cr @ p. 2/10
