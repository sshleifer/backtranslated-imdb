Making a film on a rough spirit of retaliation from the outside of the blind and impossible tomb will also be ironical but this here is an unknown mix of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while it is still responsible for itself, it is so beaten to the player to stimulate the chuckles instead of the expected yields. However, due to the extreme situation that the British film industry found in the late 1970s, even an unusual script like this could attract 10 stars - Cliff Robertson (as group husband), Jean Simmons (in role) of the title), Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's gold artist), Simon Ward (as a strong sculptor), Ron Moody (as a patient doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's businessman), Judy Geeson (like Simmons' best friend and Jayston's wife, Flora Robson (as a house worker), David Tomlinson (as a reader read Simmons) and, surprisingly perhaps, Jack Warner (as a painter of the sculpture) - though many of them have no place, Sorry to say!
