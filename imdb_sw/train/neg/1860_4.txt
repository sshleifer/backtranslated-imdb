In 1998 Michael Keaton's comedy of the same head was guilty because it was, um, shoddy special effects, but compared with what Screaming Mad George cooked for this comedy horror they are positive mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to have made out of styrofoam and his hands looked like overvised oven mitts. Which perhaps were. Release puts on thick in this act of many movies (worst) and Paul Keith as a city doctor is particularly remembered in a small but highly hilarious role.
