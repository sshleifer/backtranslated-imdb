The film has been smoothly, except for other Hollywood names. Other exhibitions and unknown names (ie, Jennifer Gabrielle) have no uninspiring. I have seen another film with this director, unfortunately this is one of the worst. Perhaps this is an example of screenplay? For the best description, the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita was rescued by the film from careful. I enjoyed more Pat in Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to see, and in short, this is not one of them. Save your money and cellulodi. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
