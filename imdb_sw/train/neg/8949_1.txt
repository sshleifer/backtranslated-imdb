A few weeks ago, I read an old George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated by it and I thought it was one of the best books I have read recently. So, when I rent a DVD, I was surprised to see how this situation is measured. Unfortunately, the movies did not come close to create an environment or develop characters who Orwell did with beauty in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who looks at the movie has read the book, because he does not try to show the WHY characters they do and feel like they do. John Hurt, the great actor, enters the whole path, and will not do any work until the end. We do not know what he does for life, or why his love is banned, or what the political state is and why the main character seeks rebellion. This book cannot be made right in the form of the film without the correct explanation and the definition of the political system being harassed by the perpetrators, and the fact that those who are lost is a significant shortage of this film. Besides, John Hurt was a horrible choice, looking at the age of 15 than Winston, 39, had to show. For better information, however, all others were beaten well. It's too bad they were put in a very horrible film and a bad actress. -Brian O.
