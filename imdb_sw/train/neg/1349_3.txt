I got this DVD more than 2 years ago and I just decided to look at it yesterday. I don't know why it has taken as long as I like the Auditor Auditor and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. Although it may have a red color and a modern technical color of the modern animation movie, there are some old things that die with this gadget under the toilet. <br /> <br /> Before all the session of the Auditor-General Audit and music is not available. The composer tries to affect by making the same look but still insufficient. Gadget-phone is now a talking car, not a car that can turn on van. Plus looks a lot around and round instead of being clear cold. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain can't be seen at all. It does not exist. There is nothing about the form of change and Claw Doctor use for some never clear evil but that's all I got. What the plan was with a young Italian / Italian I never knew. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the name is nothing to go, its final case is closed in any way. And she sits on the power so why it is called 'final case' is also hidden. It is not really interesting. This is disgusting to a great show of animation which is very amazing on DVD, but don't let it be possible to take you to buy any DVD of the Gadget Expert. I bought these seconds after watching him. No child will like or appreciate this and no fan of old show and tolerate.
