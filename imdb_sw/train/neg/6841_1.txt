I hear the rumors of upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Shows Blu-ray Disc". For further development over the past 25 years from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be enhanced. I hope that it helps to remove the bad taste remaining my mouth and exhibit all of Magnavision fiasco. And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy Shows Betamax VCR" was an important thing in the history of entertainment. After the protest "Leonard Nimoy Shows Cassette Compact" with a transparent drop "Leonard Nimoy shows the 8th Tape Track", who could expect a piece of glory movie? I just cry right now to think about it.
