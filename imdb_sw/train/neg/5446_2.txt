For the faithful Duran Duran who want to watch a good music video, skip this. The producers decided to find innovation and make this 80-year-old video of a sci-fi story, which includes the bad village of Barbarella that the group received its name. What makes this idea fail is that between the 80 songs of Duran Duran many, the despair and horrible events are being shown to show a false competitor trying to stop the band on one of their concerts. Not only good music is constantly interrupted, but we have to suffer through a cheap story from Dr. Dr. It's very close to bear. 2/10
