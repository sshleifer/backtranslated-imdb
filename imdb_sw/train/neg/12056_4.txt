This film is a good example of how through the destruction of the media you can sell a movie that is not much more than a favorite TV sitcom. In Hispanic newspaper every day and the largest circles are written on the wonders of this film, almost all the rest. Luckily the newspaper and the second biggest circle are the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film form and content, and said all its errors, clich√©s, and bad writing. Just because the film makes part of the audience laughs with a simple and clear joke, and because one can recognize actors and settings, it does not make it an acceptable film.
