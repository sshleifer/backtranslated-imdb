FURY DEVELOPS takes a garment that is very functional Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen ... So far. <br /> It is a bad birth and no events of any interest, Seagal is not trying too much in this - he is fat and his voice is called more than ever. Co-coke stars were not much better, being a burden of more than three voters. Kee is a very poor and does not give a surprise that he is also responsible for other Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). According to IMDb $ 12M was used for this boring tosh load of old tanks - If these figures are correct I feel a great fiddle of tariff without a place near the same amount. <br /> <br /> KINGDOM OF FURY is actually a shot for remake shot of Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which should be much better than this overthrow. <br /> <br /> This does not have NO to redeem credentials, Give Me MISS! 1/2 * out of *****
