Bah. Another fatigue, unultory reworking out of the work of copyright never designed to have a film. Overall, Toni Collette is as good as ever (being a real actor, you can see), and there are some positively dealt with contract cuts between events. There are even a few funny lines, and works of the film, logo and editing are capable, except with a surprising enough in voiceover and talking to the camera towards the conclusion. But, ah, but. Many of the cast seem to be on an independent, and almost all of them are very old (and in one case too small) for their years of advertising. Then, they all speak "Austinese", that the only happy falsetto of the singing of the song that can not be more from the way people spoke on Austen's day (consider Yosemite Sam, I'm not a child). This is especially sad, considering that we seem to eventually see the "Fakespearan" financing of the same money that Olivier and his players liked to relax on their lungs. The worst is Gwyneth Paltrow. He has played only one character in his films, and he really has to create here, running through all his adult (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then repeating himself to a more advanced film. There is absolutely no chemistry between himself and any of his lovers, nor any obvious reason why they would be interested in him away. In short, there is very little reason to look at Emma. It is a perfect layout, but if you come to the full film pack of accidents (ie a thin guide that can not blow a bow or a short handle of time) then you can also do well, as well as the larger "Clueless".
