Some of my old friends advised me to watch this film but I've just got a chance. I was very optimistic to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a group of cameras mixed in a fast. I could not understand what was the message except the Hinduism. I am like many kinds of religion but I heard Kamal Hasan is a little characteristic that has made orchestrated this kind of thought. He could make the film more tragic than this trick. He tried to add a kind of virus infection and God did not forbid that boy is a mutant and he would eventually go to the world administration. This is a very good movie for the school of the public vs common public. Hate him by holding the talent he has. Starting with the story they tried the confusion to borrow ideas from the effect of Butterfly, then among the little harmony of religion at the cost of Hinduism. has made this movie of mind.)
