If there was a star mark 0 I would be happy to open it with this awesome bunch. The fact that the real summary is very good and that if it were done differently it could be just a brilliant thing. The basic task of freezing a group of people in the trial room is good, but WHY? All I see is a group of unwise travelers and blondes talking about music and culture I don't know or want to know about ... challenges are sad and deceptive. The whole thing of television truth is to show REALITY. If you put a 'challenge' don't make them play with many food shortcuts and cultural elements in 'night nights'. make them make a real challenge. And if you 'get' the prize money, that's good, if you really earnt it! These people are nuts. If only they could show the best show, the real idea would be glorious. But that's not happening!
