SÃ£o Paulo, the middle class middle class Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have joined the university and the opening night of the school, they go to a party with medicine and medicine. The next day, after their classes, Cristiano's last night comes to her home with these three friends to build a girl. The girl dies, they are afraid to decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother comes, begins with Gabriel and climbs the staircase, breaking her neck. The Trio decides to throw and burn the corpse in the dirt of dirt, but during other night disasters occurs. <br /> <br /> Destruction and shame "Cama de Gato" is a crap of more trust on abandoning young people, and it is certainly the worst movie of Brazil that I have seen for many years. Anonymous, sad and dark story is a true color player of the delicious taste. Screenplay is not funny, with stupid lines and conversations, with obstructive boring, negative and negative and interviews with young morons at the beginning and at the end. Acting is horrible, looks and many of you, but no talent, and I was desperate for the presence of Caio Blat who promised in this trash. Cameras, framing, movies and version are amateur and of very low quality. Sounds are bad and in many places it is impossible to understand what actors and actors are talking (maybe included, because this is happening). Gang bang is very realistic and is used to promote this unusual movie in poor marketing of sex. My vote is one (bad) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat Cat")
