Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live with Mad TV in one movie 90 minutes. Now, imagine that all humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced by ignorance. Now think of something 50 times more. <br /> <br /> Does it get that? <br /> <br /> Okay, now go see the Comedy Underground Movie. The vision you have will be seen as a funniest thing forever. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few few cheaper ... very few. But it was lame. Even if the intention of the movie was blind, it was also good to be funny. <br /> <br /> Just because I'm not angry with losing my time looking this was another person I know bought. He lost his money. Vince Offer has not been written or directed anything else and is not surprising why.
