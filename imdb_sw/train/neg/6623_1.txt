First of all to offer even a rating of 1 on this film (nothing less than this available). Film fails in each department to be screenplay, direction, character or acting. Starting with, the name of the movie is a true C class (though the film itself resembles the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan strives to behave in such a character but a weak script with a pathetic direction to finish make him a pleasant character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a 50,000 payment on it (which was a lobby). Here in the Aag figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but the poor man was beaten by our hero named and had only a few people to leave the bike (with all the automatic guns) Make Sholay like a movie in Mumbai kind of setup in modern time 4) Nesha Kothari, someone needs to tell her that she does not know how to act. Why did Ram Gopal Verma give him again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good but nothing for him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are major actors are lost in the film. 7) The role of Lila Misra (Basanti's Basil) in Sholay is converted to cheap in this film and some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow and understand that there is a need to have some intelligence in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) It should not say anything about Jai modern and Veeru..pathetic in large quantities. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this film because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of classic nature. Please don't waste money and time on this film. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this awesome bag of stupid characters, bad songs and improper patterns. Thank you, Saurabh
