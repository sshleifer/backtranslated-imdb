I am a great fan of war movies, and, like Vet Vietnam to fight, you have experienced and technical details. I worked with bomb boys once and had nothing but respect. Other vets, and non-Iraqi vets, in particular, summarize the accuracy in this film very well. Poetry license is one thing, but this film is a perfect fantasy, and fails for that reason. No bombing unit, or any unit, could withstand this tolerance for more than 5 minutes. Military sessions are given comparisons and discipline because, they save lives. The opening area was very hateful. A boy with a cell phone could be beaten immediately. Right, "Stop imitating" is not blocking efficiency. It was worse from there. The sniper events were too big. As others have realized, your average EOD boy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and thinking any Arab sniper is that good actually puts thoughts. Grab the Arab trader in some form of revenge did not happen. One can beat him, but this kind of risk taking is limited to movies. I would like to continue, but, as I said, some have explained these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it succeeds any prize, it is a reflection of why "La La land" is called so.
