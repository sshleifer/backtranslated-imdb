From the line of conspiracy caused by the destruction that makes almost no sense to the evil talks and events that have occurred to the last downer, the worst acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) "Get John Christmas" is better left lost. Mrs. Bertinelli's work is not deep or emotionally like her stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as the love of Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the father of one father Noah is almost failing to look at himself listening to the singing. But who can blame for such material. Michael J. Murray's script is the best for the best. Every year at this time I am looking for TV leaders and waiting for some of the latest Christmas and interesting movies that appear on small screens. Films like "Miracle on 34 Address", Ernst Lubitsch enjoys "Shop around the corner" and, in fact, the 1951 edition of "Scrooge". There is a classic Frank Capra "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classic. What about "Home alone" or "Holiday Home" by Holly Hunter with good performance by Robert Downey Jr? My way to you is through advice. Your time is better using these films than finding "Finding John Christmas". Christmas fun!
