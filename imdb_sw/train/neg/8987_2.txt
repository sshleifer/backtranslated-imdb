The only way to release this film is a real story ... Otherwise, this film was bad. Acting was ridiculously bad, and the design set was cheesy and very tacky. The story was good, but it was very difficult to watch from all the terrible act. I can't suggest to look at this ... The only quality of this liberation of the film is that the actors were very impressive ... especially Ryan Bauer, a man who plays the opera's soap. Some editions were done well, but there are persistent mistakes everywhere ... I'm just getting sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Is it? Can we find one good soon?
