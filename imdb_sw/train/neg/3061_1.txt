This film is bad. Give me a dentist at any time! What? You believe that one of the main television stations in Arabia had this Christmas film! I can only assume they expect to invite groups with Dudley Moore instead of this. At last I looked at my bottle of hot water had more acting, good plot, another game and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Don't look even if you're drunk!
