<br /> <br /> "aside along the hollywood warriors?" (Wayan 'brothers were asked') is what was needed and what happened. However, as many recent decisions this was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> The director cannot communicate with the audience today, trying to restore physical and moral preparation instead of good discussions is just a COMPLETE. I knew, the audience knew and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing, why did they feel to turn the directors? Not only the Wayan brothers played as two primary characters, without being farce and sad. <br /> <br />
