This movie is bad to stop completely on Friday 13. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around camp camp training. He kills people because the camping training camp is on land that belonged to his father, and when the police came to power to take his father land they killed his mother (F13th another leave). The intro is to see Bernie kill its first victims. Then we are taken to the family to the camp on the trees, after they arrive and join a wonderful man who likes to talk about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he is tied behind his caravan after he broke him from a mental college. He puts Bernie after the family so they can pick up his things and then monitor it. This movie is only recommended for those who enjoy the 80-bit Slasher B.
