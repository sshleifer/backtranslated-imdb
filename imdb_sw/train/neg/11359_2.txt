When the 3-D animation (display of the show) worked well, many other things fell flat. It was like the artists thought "well, it would be 3-D so we don't need to work hard on the development of the plot or character." And the fact that it is a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. The community is interested in three characters (Shrek, Nemo's Father) as they are attracted to three patterns of direction. The only dimensions of the main characters shown are two regular scooters that surround the plot regularly and are forced to eat everything before. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the end of the post (after watching the cartoon version of the historical data for an hour and a half) comes to the screen and destroys everyone's good time by calling the main characters of the "dirt" and announcing that the situation is out on the screen was really impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? What? Do you want to tell Easter Easter and Santa Claus does not exist when you are on the table?
