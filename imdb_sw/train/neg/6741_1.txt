Hardly, I am for a romantic romantic talk and I can drink in Miss Freedom as easily as Goodfellas ... but this film? It doesn't mean any !!!! And I have not talked about the suspension of unbelief. Why does his family live in the UK? Or, at least, why do they not have Britain's emphasis? He is sure to be good with his father and he is amazing to forgive because he was not close to two years ago. (In this case, no one does a lot of deal about being away for a long time). And what was the goofy dress at the bachelorette party? I can not even enter into the fact that the escort paid to fall in love with him - which would win the best decision of the film. I only say that the characters, the environment, and conspiracy are not open enough to make even the story of cooperation. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the use of a more concrete film that is not available for Deborah Messing's nose - I would encourage the filmmakers if I am! I mean, honestly, I am all for women who they are, but why, in seven years of obedience to Will and Grace look, I've never seen how wonderful his nose is amazing? Oh! Because the producers are good to him! This film, like my little favorite favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of filmmakers, not actors. I can see Messing and McDermott in these roles with the best author, director, and producer. <br /> <br /> This gets my vote easily as one of the worst movies that have ever been lost. I am so happy my friend gave me his DVD, so all I used was time. If there is a way to do this assessment ZERO, I would like to do that.
