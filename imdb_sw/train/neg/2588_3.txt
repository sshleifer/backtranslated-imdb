Band Band was bad, Mile Naked was much better, and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise looks the same quality as the player. Essentially Erik Stifler (John White) separated from his partner after losing his daughter, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining Erik Dwight's cousin (Steve Talley) at college. For many parties, many small, and enough fire chicks in Beta House, they have five jobs that are designed to make them a member of the official. But the threat appears by the opponents, GEK ("Geek") House, led by the nerd of a strong hunger (and sheep sheep) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offered a much bigger and better than what Beta has. To solve it once and for all, Beta and Gek go to war and banned, for forty years, the Greek games to fight, along with a man who cannot go out. The ultimate champion of the games, Noah Levenstein called Daddy Jim (Eugene Levy's usual) runs a show, which sees people who have no bras, a gladiator player around the water, taking a pig pig, Russian Roulette mouth and cartridges of age spunk The horse, the wife carrying and drinking keg full of alcohol (and puking is not mistaken). It comes all of a sudden death, with a boy playing for a player, and should resist resting, the Beta House is winning when Edgar's girl has a girl dressed like a sheep on her string. Also played by Christopher McDonald Flubber as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac like Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert like Sarah Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris like Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The level of dirt is very small, such as the weight of the joke, and I would think it was rated one in five, but I like it. Enough!
