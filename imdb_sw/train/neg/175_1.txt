I looked at Cabin for Lake this afternoon of the United States. Considering this film was made for TV is amazing enough to watch the end. So, I look at shouting this evening and I was very disappointed. I knew I didn't want a movie, but I didn't expect you to worry about the use of DV (digital video). Movie would have been enabled if it was not of these digital juxtaposed shots that seemed to happen anywhere. I expected a line of conspiracy to connect with these shots, but there seems to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION! I can only see the return of the cabinet and Lake being able to be like the movie was shown against anything, but it causes at 4 am in the morning.
