I just lost (yes! I paid money to see!) This film. MY GOD. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. If another auditor has put it, Without Colagrande, leave the film, PLEASE! Please don't make or enter another movie! The woman has a cantaloupe charisma. No, that's not the same for cantaloupe, which is probably going further. He doesn't know how to act; he affects the hateful look at all times (he reminded me of my sisters always desperate from Europe). He is not charming; he is not pretty. No real story. And editing! There was no, that I could see! It's too bad when you watch the film and, to get to it, you insist "forward ahead" in your village, and HERE anything happens! I mean! ..... I kept shouting, "Cut! Cut!" What were they thinking about? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a film with getting PAID to do love on the screen! A good plan for THEM; A bright deal good for the viewer! I think I'm going to go now ....
