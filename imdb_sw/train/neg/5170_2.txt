Wow, it would have such a beautiful film, It starts with Brittany Daniels tied, Im thinking cool we're going to get a flash, but no, the film begins to re-publish and publish the child. This film would be better if it was not to act. I mean acting was even worse. Although with poor characters they had to deal with and I think they did well they could ... However, I have the damage to the movie to me. The twins were alone to seem to have some professional skills. The term of a surprising conclusion. In all I found the worst budget movies but considering this was a hype and 8 movies to die for I was very disappointed .. By the way, they were some investigators said there was a gore and stuff. I saw the same film. Well this is 4 out of eight, and so far just one has been good.
