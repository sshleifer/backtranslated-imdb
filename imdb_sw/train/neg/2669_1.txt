I rarely move to make a comment online on the film. But I can't understand how this has been done. Who did it? What? How could they think that they were able to make a feature film? What? They made a weekend course in the school of film, getting good checks from the father and watering the family of David Badiel directly until he agreed to be in it? Or did he have any chances of family friends / distant relationships to do so from bad, improper? I don't care, they don't want to know. He even looks so ashamed to be in it, striking his line and hiding his face from the camera. At the same time DOP should be a gaffer from the Neighbors, there seems to be absolutely no voice of design, script, direction and editing were all silent, and quite a flawless fact that overwhelps me now means that I can't be worried to spend most of my life thinking on this film.
