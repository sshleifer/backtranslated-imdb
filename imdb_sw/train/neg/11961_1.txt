Anyone who can get the precious redemption in this piece must find out his head. We have a foolish wife, a heroin of heroin, who loved during part time with her whole body, exercises generated by constant beatings. Now, she gives birth to breast milk on the kitchen floor, given it in some way to Helen Keller putting her hands in the water. We have had a man who starts to run away from a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (he is angry with her because she came too fast) and ended up killing her female partner, having sex with her dead, and then provoking her. We have a child who has been attacked by classmates and who comes home and beat her mother. See, it's all rounded. Deep, huh? The only moment of respect in this horrible bunch is when the father kills his son's torturers. It is a good thing that Turkey was shot on the video because otherwise it will lose the expensive film will be. If the person who thinks artists should be interested in this slop is very bad, it is not surprising many people think artists are mad. We saw this movie of pride, then we put on "Woman of Zero, Defender." O my God, it was an inspiration as to who was worse. What is going on in Japan today? Patients, patients, patients.
