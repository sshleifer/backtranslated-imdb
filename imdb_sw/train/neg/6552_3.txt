Money (Now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) has walked on the back of the apocalypse (after her protector has died since the age, said the protector played by Elias Koteas, a very good actress) and now finds that people are walking on chest looking for cyborgs of metal scrap and money. He causes a group of burned cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and the humanitarian scientist playing with Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screenshots as a Lynch employer. Cyborg 3 can be better than the other two but it is still a very big feature. The problem at this time is that strong ideas have never been used properly, the process of action is normal and the name as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given less to do. Haje is really a white-colored hero and Lynch is very high (as usual) and the film does not inspire or desire to be as happy-bad as a hilarious predecessor. (One of Van Damme, the second is just a little.) Also the desire is a false theory which almost opposes any reasonable idea. If the action of this flick is normal and with the B-movie items and things are done efficiently, that's the only thing I have been able to say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4 (Poor)
