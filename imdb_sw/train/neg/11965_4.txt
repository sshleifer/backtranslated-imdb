As a nut of history which is particularly attracted to this historical event, I was very disappointed with the movie. In fact, the dress and staging were real, but the Hollywood photo of "Great Horn of Great Britain" was real. The amount of films that have been presented for migrating or fighting soldiers has never occurred in the history of the film. Eveytime I heard the first victory music, I knew I needed to be prepared for another area perhaps to fill without meaning. Obviously, the producers had invested heavily in "staging" and were willing to earn their value. <br /> <br /> With the best cast, their conversations were, again, stirring and their characters were not developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished the area, I would like to despair. Their founding line was weak and meaningless that I could not believe that these were two good characters who showed Lawrence of Arabia and the Alcatraz Bird respectively. <br /> <br /> There are bad events, but this is not much better.
