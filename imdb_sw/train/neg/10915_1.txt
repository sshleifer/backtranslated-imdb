I believe that war films should try to deliver the war terrorism, avoiding the idealism and respecting some of the military military principles. Zamazda difficult to do first. The film is a Russian film of war, I expected patriotism, feelings, beautiful pictures of poems, amazing symbols, Slavic and cheekbones of cruel Germans. What I did not need is a romantic romantic love, the incidents of non-romantic warfare and the misuse of voice sounds in the film which avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) just to stop passing but even so our sense of history has confirmed the "release of Poland". Missing space as a film but not as a definitive propaganda.
