Just another film that uses without the male weakness of the front; A bad job, as well, the love of love is the most incredible I have ever seen (and this is not about me not connecting the idea of ​​the two young people who do love, as I am gay). Again, as in Mil nubes de curtain, Julian Hernandez inspired a very promising film and story that makes enough motion for a five-minute film but it can make a 2-hour film and ... at this time, there is no question of discrimination and discrimination in the Mexican gay community to talk about! May the merciful God be merciful to us!
