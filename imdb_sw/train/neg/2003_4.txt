For all the fun of the visual, it is better the Renaissance would be in a live stage. Animation is amazing in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cool and holes, like the story and style of this film. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not have heard the living. There is so much interesting here, but at the end I have found that all I could do was interesting. I did not enjoy the film very much, and it describes something that I have not seen before: that the visible features can describe the positive feature of the film, but without good news and powerful characters, it can be without anything. I will not even say that this movie is not lost, but sometimes it comes to danger. I love the wonders of Sci-fi dark. The Runner's Blade and the Dark City are two films I thought were good. But Blade Runner had his bad villain and the City of Darkness had his story to stimulate thought. Renaissance has shade and light, but little. I would love to love this film more, but the weak stories and uninformed characters stood that way. The Renaissance was a burst of historical and artistic color and life. It is, therefore, surprising that one of the many movies and non-life that I have seen this year takes its name from the Renaissance.
