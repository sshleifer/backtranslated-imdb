Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in what he called a sci-fi film, Nemesis. As we have looked at this, we found ourselves quickly through the BS sports section to get to the amazing stage of action. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! <3/0/0/0/0 br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br> in the Mexico group that continues to torture his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight (against the group and also things). Gruner has the most common character of Van Damme who kills everyone (or beats them very well) and works to remove its barriers to these groups. The plan was very fun and easy to imagine. Gruner is probably not known because of the selected script if this film is anything to compare the possible choices. This ghetto is a hell of hell and I was glad to see the staff of the motley characters go through it if they have a chance against the Gruner behavior. Music was a typical music working (pianos of thumping and timpani, guitars of swelling) which really was not as bad as I made a voice. The director really needed to put such a step instead of taking every 5 minutes for a family time. Finally, I gave it 4/10 because it tried to be an average movie for Oliver Gruner for stars, but the overall feel of the film lets you want more closure on what you just saw.
