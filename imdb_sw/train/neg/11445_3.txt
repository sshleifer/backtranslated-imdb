I've got lots of lots in my day, but good, Hot Rod takes a cake. I saw a free observation in NY another night. I can only hope to show a funny version for customers who pay. Great laughter was a little, the plot was not cheerful, and the characters were directly to the best. One view is the play area for hilarious and Adam Samberg. It was worth it and it was just a place where I had a heart laughing. Other than that, I can only remember the randomness and the air to die. Fans of SNL & Samberg can be disappointed. I know I expected more from them. But it's short, I certainly don't recommend a free trial or pay to watch this film.
