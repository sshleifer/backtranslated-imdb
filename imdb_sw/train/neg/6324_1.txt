I spent eight years playing movie movies in the 80s and 90s. That was, far away, the worst movie I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad is that it makes the air try to be a great, stimulating film. Even the largest Gregory Peck could not save that terrible piece of leakage from being much lower than normal. Jamie Lee Curtis, in the first role of the fearless film, made it clear that he had not yet learned to act (he is still trying, but not more available). , and here's a spoiler, a global nuclear weapon can never happen because it makes kids afraid to play a little league baseball! It even shows on Nick and the Disney Channel is not enough stupid to make us believe that it has fallen. This is not the time value you can watch on a cable TV. Not worth the movie rental; Your dollar will be used well in an extra microwave popcorn bag with another movie you took (because it can only be better than this).
