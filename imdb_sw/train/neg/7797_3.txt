This is one of the worst movies I've ever encountered, but I want to say that some of the complaints I have heard have been considered legitimate. She is saved by a small budget and a VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera cameras and staging area is a good professional. I have seen many movies where "leading" was very bad. At least the flows flow in a way that does not mix and has a few clever shots here and there. Also, forest events were good. There are just so many things you can do with the VHS camera, and it does a good job far away and technical. In addition to the features of the art, no. The area that the camera gives us down so that we can look at this man for plants for 15 seconds is the epitomizes the artistic style of the entire film. This is a clean garbage ... Total garbage. <br /> <br /> Gore is good for film in this type of budget. , it is obvious fake but there is a lot of it, and it is abroad. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version and dubbing the purpose. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to do it through the film) ... Unfortunately, it has gone too far, especially towards the end. It is really a terrible film, but I should recommend to the value of the camp. It is difficult to find a filthy film than this and it puts it in a unique category.
