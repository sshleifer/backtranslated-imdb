Don't worry about losing your money on this movie. Do not even enter your car and think that you can see this film if others do not accept it. If you should see the movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> Script was awesome. It is fully written from the horror of the fearful movie. Given: the place of restrictions, a different armed man, a curious man who can identify all the signs that faithful officials cannot put together, and a blameless and courageous woman, but good and powerful that most viewers would like to be able to call her boyfriend. Combine together, add better to hang the gore, and what hell, let's put some freaks there for a little "spin" on the plot. <br /> <br /> Acting was awesome, and the characters were unacceptable - Borat was more reliable than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** with someone who can please please tell me how vest the catcher can make a ricochet shot from someone after being beaten without even making someone who was flinch ??? ??? I'm an army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves. About 1 out of 10, I will put it in circles to get the lowest score I can.
