I tell you first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I enjoyed it then. I bought a DVD soon, and after a second look I wondered why I liked it. Acting was very bad, and as usual we have a stanso-common clansmen in their fake dresses. Acting was very bad. Tim Roth did a good job as did Liam Neeson, but I don't know what Jessica Lange was thinking. The plot of the plot was good, but the murder was only poor. I am tired of seeing Scotland shown as this in the film. Braveheart was worse though, these films are just saving grace. But for weight, people did not talk like that in those days, why all the executives should have accents of Glasgos? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already aggressive and aggressive. I see only people here who say this film is good Americans, and be honest I can see why they would like, I know children and the image of men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking about buying a DVD, I would like to spend your money for something else, like the best film.
