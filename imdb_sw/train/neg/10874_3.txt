I finished the marathon of this series, and it became difficult to look as it was. From the fictionalism of the historical elements, to the adverse reaction of O'Herlihy in later periods, the show falls just further. If you are looking for lower production of less WW2 production, then I would recommend the 1st season, but to avoid anything after that, it weakens that one step from the soap opera, and the line of the story is getting worse and understanding. The former B&W film is better than any kind of entertainment and Colditz's name is connected with it, and even that is not what one can expect.
