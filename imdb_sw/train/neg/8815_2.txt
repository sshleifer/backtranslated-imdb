Yes, I'm going to tell you about this so don't read if you want to surprise. I found this with the title of Christmas Head. There was another Christmas fear on a DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. At night, the Night of Blood (non-confused with Night Night, Night Night) was very likely and was very close to being good, this was not very good. It started to look at the madness (if you could call him) look at the neighboring children and write in books about who is naughty and good, but over time you are looking for action and this film is not recommended. You need character development, but this goes on board and you have never been sure why you are taken by a guy. About an hour he killed three out of four people while all people are looking for fear, and boys who kill are not his goals laugh at him. This is one of the many attempts that the killer tries to knock naughty. Then he tries to kill another man, and he tries to get into his house with fun in the fire. She climbs fast and can not manage. Then he enters the apartment and then tries to kill the guy by slapping the apartment inside his bedroom. He cannot be seen to kill a boy in this way so he takes a star away from a tree and hits the boy's throat. What was the tree even doing inside the bedroom first place? Oh, a murderer before this killed stopped at the party and was happy too. This is about it except for the people of the city chasing him with light and a place that is not his brother and that he loves to play. What was it even? He continued to talk about something that has never been explained. How did you ask, since since I was with the vendors I will tell you. He runs on the road in his car and keeps, well says just blind !!!!!!!!!!!!
