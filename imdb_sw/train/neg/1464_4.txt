I expected this to hope for something that I did not know about the most modern man of history and I can help to think that history is rewritten in HITLER: FROM THE LIFE. Hitler was very concerned with his grandson that he threatened to have one shot of admirer. Hitler turned a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking but haven 'of the authors combining Adolph Hitler and Tony Montana from SCARFACE? That is very bad but what was very interesting to me is that there are all the barriers to the history of history that are not in this modern series. Germany lost the first world war and the power involved with Germany to pay a great price for doing so. It was the economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that's why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the colonial power seems to be totally unimportant so there is no way that HITLER: SURGICAL EXPERIENCE can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I have never said that Himmler and Goering are open to their lack of <br / > <br /> There is one good step on the mini series and that's Robert Carlyle in the role of head. Significantly some of his character is correct and his voice is very small (Memory records show that Hitler had a soft voice sound) but Carlyle is a shadow actor and can communicate his own charisma on the screen. The comments in the British media that Carlyle resembles a synth player from Spark more than Adolph Hitler has no foundation and gives the best Hitler interpretation. I liked performance with Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was first place. There is nothing to suggest for fans of history
