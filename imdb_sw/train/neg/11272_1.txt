... the first film I had to walk. And it was testing and staff before the investigation (Not that I engaged, I quickly add). I made it for the first hour, so I think I had a good reputation for commenting, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how this got through any type of QA. The collection of very bad talks, the success of wooden actions, very casting, all locked up without a plan. <br /> <br /> From Tara Fitzgerald was wonderful, close to comic. He has a very bad feeling of Russian in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> I left the investigation, the director and producers were drinking on the bar outside the cinema. They couldn't sit back through. <br /> <br />
