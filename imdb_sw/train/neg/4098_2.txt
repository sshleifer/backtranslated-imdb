Although this is "better" than Mulva's first (which doesn't say too much, I would like to look at the dry color) is still coming. Make yourself a permit and avoid anything from these Photo Gallery budgets. I was made to buy a few dvd to help some of the indy film writers and a young man I felt. Others have not been officially "released" yet (not bootlegs-purchased from film artists themselves) and I can't even write how they are all bad. Avoid anything with Ape A Teen or Bonejack in them as they go into other small Indy movies that are friends. If you are friends of these boys, it was likely on their movies and you were glad to make them. But for those who had to look at? No. Bad video, bad radio, bad act, good plot ... etc etc. These are not funny even. I gave him this just because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's about it. Maybe it's not even good 2. About 1/16 stars to show that it was better than the first (which I wish I could be tested in badly). If you want an inappropriate budget budget, go to take something from the "friends" of LBP on Freak Production as Marty Jenkins or even Stake Stakes. That's really respect.
