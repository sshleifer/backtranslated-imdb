Anurag Basu who led the direction of KUCCH HAI made first in this film <br /> film was in front of the way through though it had a different story and came close to HAWAS which was released 1 week before and by chance this was better to do business better. /> <br /> The movie starts well, Malika's case is well shown when starting the Emraan-Malika area is very soft / vulgar <br /> <br /> The exhibition between Emraan and Malika is handled properly and when it comes out of the story The Ashmith faces Emraan is a brilliant / knight / speed that goes to the viewer and the keeper keeps on the side but the second song of Emraan's partner did not fully convince them. /> <br /> Finale is also a film too <br /> <br /> Instructions by Anurag Basu Music is a winner, all songs were Fab Camera-work was stunning <br /> <br /> Emraan played its very bad streak , this was the role that he had at the stardom and though he continued to play these roles and was angry at this film was good Ashmith was also good at his role once, he did a good job with one of his only good performance and he seemed good too Malika was brilliant in his esp position in the second half. but frequent phone calls are not a mark. Unfortunately she has expressed the same possibilities in another film Raj Jhutsi is the same
