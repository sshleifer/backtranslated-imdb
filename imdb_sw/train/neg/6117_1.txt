I can't say this is a very bad movie made, but my soul is thinking about it because when it was first released on the movie, (1) the original buzz was so good that my girl insisted we go to see, and we actually used it to get a ticket to get The ticket, and (2) are still the only "bad" film I remember when the audience started playing on a certain stage and basically laughed on the whole film. Once we came to the place of fighting the useless snake (and impossible), I think everyone has refused. Just fine I can accept is to beat the lush area. Oh, and there are also Bo's breasts, although her acting is a timber which is worthless and no more than a picture of Playboy <br /> <br /> "The tension" in this film is Bo Bo bad act and husband's direction his. Snake fighting should be one of the series of "action" that has never been done. However, this is one of those films that are very bad, may be worth looking at the level of improper humor. Certainly the worst films I gave to see it.
