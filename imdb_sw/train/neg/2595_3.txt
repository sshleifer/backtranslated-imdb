Are you dealing that was tough !!! But still I have been given this film with 3 others and all were on DVD. The movie begins on a very good movie but it goes down from the top. <br /> <br /> And just last let's just say it's the last one of the last weather in the history of the film. Time to go in the last sequence and if you like the level of fear of schlock then this is your film.
