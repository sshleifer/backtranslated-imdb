No, this was not one of the ten worst films of the 1980s, but it certainly covers less than 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was installed on a shelf for two or three years and then it was released in 1981. How would you describe the special effects before getting "An American Werewolf in London," disco still seems to be cool, and Ronald Reagan was not 40 President. of America? When we are, let's not miss the 1970s hairstyles in the 1950s and '60'. I've seen more of it here than in "Happy Days" & "Laverne & Shirley" together. One woman lifting this film to a "bad" group, it was good "was late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but just hard. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, a high school teacher, who has died and is still being carried out by Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" keeps its reputation. His request for help is proof of this. It also looks very good as Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in the room of beauty, shoot at hell." She had no child. This does not mean that there is no good place elsewhere, only a few and middle, and not just saying because I love Hartman. Unfortunately, "Wolf Wolf" was better than this. "Young Wolf Too" was better than this, and that was not very good. <br /> <br />
