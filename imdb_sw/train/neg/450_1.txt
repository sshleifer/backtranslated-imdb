This view is painful to watch ... It seems that they wanted to beat Amanda Bynes in something ... but they did not know what, and came up with this wonderful show. They took him as a young man, surrounded by twenty-thirty months, and put him in many adult situations by attempting to repeat repeatedly. Recently, they realize that he needs to "clique" and throw people in their last 20s years to try to adopt as young people. <br /> <br /> How this show lost the season 4 is more than me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show, and throw it in the daylight lineup on ABC Family.
