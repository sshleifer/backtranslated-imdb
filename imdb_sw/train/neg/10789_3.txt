If you expect to see a lot in the Altıoklar bath, as promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie is nothing but the style of Altıoklar about popular issues like sex, marriage and cheating. With a lot of dirt, which appears to be from anywhere and does not have anything to do with that plot proves that Altıoklar was not able to "try something new" as he quoted. Many sexual jokes have been shown that Altıoklar has fallen in popular words which are "selling for sex." I was hoping to see a very good story told by a very good way of writing. However at the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and looking at Altıoklar observations but still focusing on people's work.
