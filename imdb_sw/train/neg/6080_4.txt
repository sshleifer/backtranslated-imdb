'Maladolescenza' has an air of dark story, with its characters, forest landscape, and the discovery of the ruins of the castle. However for its foundation, the film is basically learned for tribal girls. The opening of a series of dreams by using the subtle example of Fabrizio to deal with its terrible hoing, the film describes his psychological suffering of Laura, a girl who has promised her love to him, and her last romance with Sylvia bad. The psychological problems of the film give the film the right, but there is no doubt that the non-affected film is in its direction of dirt and sex. The appearance of the film depends heavily on its good places instead of certain movie skills, and no doubt the most wealthy film material is an interesting voice of choir children. With its extraordinary quality of the dream, the film is more attractive, but it has a side of Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same time. Indeed he deserves a debate on sex, in comparison with many films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark 'Ken Park' for example, the film is not particularly good due to the artistic view. Cin√©ma seems to have an amazing ability to gradually, so maybe 'Maladolescenza' should be interested in maintaining the power thirty years after the release. Yet the awesome value is one reason alone the film does not remember. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. However Nazism also.
