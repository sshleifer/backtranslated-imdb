Oliver Hardy wakes up and hangover and soon learns that her uncle comes to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is, they are not - Ollie seems to make them! Therefore, it is up to her and her to look for a woman who has a child who will accept it as her family. This is not the only idea of ​​the story, as I have seen at least another couple of silence with this real plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon's NOT KID ME. It is better than MANOO MONGO - perhaps a lot of these were made for ten years later - when the comedy became more modern and depends on less slapstick. Now I have no objection to the physical comedy, but in other slapstick films, people start shooting guns, blowing and colliding, etc. with little stimulation. Sadly, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, so do they. There is not even a trivial matter and it was like they would lose the story of the story. Overall, it's not very important in entertainment. There is only enough benefit to be eligible to watch unless you are a quiet silence of myself as I am.
