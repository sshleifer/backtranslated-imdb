Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy which is very fun in many places, but it is always very funny. This modern course was much better, acting is awesome, and some of the most beautiful events make it difficult to watch when, but the concept is amazing, and it has a good short time. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1991), the game displays have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) attends a game show called "Live Or Die", where prisoners sentenced to death have a chance to play for their lives, and for money. Candidates who fail, are made using a lot of different techniques, such as guillotines, electrons, and other extraordinary equipment to be implemented, followed by applause from a happy studio audience. The show is, of course, more controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is very strange and crappy in many fields, and acting is bad, but it's of course fun in many places, especially if you're a fan of dark humor. You don't miss anything if you haven't seen it, but it's definitely funny and waster a good time. 4/10
