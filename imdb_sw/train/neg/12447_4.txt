Sondra Locke photographs this film, but she was a 'bad actor' though. Unfortunately, he pulls someone else (including then = real friend of the young Clint Eastwood down to run with him. Why does Clint Eastwood think when he agreed with the star in this? to be a real story, it's a strange story, basically no story or plot completely. Add to the exhaust, the worst act, even from the common Eastwood. Can the film be worse? I think watching the color is dry or grass growing can be more fun.
