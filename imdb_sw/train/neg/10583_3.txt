Sorry to say this, but acting in this film is awesome. The discussion seems like they have read their verses for the first time ever. Maybe you've got a "practice practice" dress for a mistake. The top-director uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the bad performance of the actors themselves. The story is very good written, and the fighting system is better than I have seen in many practical films. Fights seem really real. But all this happens when two administrators lead the time and occasionally live wonderful miracles of uncertainty-empty blank firearms, bombs, rotation morter, and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are obviously some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they have a run car in their stations from 30 meters, and every shot of bazooka is wide for at least 50 feet.
