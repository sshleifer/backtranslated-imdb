"The Gentleman game" uses a golf game in the club's landscape to show youth discovery about honesty, hatred, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this film was going to be, just a bad verification. Unfortunately, I don't know very well that the creators of the film knew when it was moved, either. The time to elaborate on this film is probably the area where Gary Sinise has said "Karate Kid" and builds any ideas that will be a mentor for a young golfer. It is comforting, somehow, that this film refuses to follow many of the simplistic and more films of the work. However, many of them still come out as they came out. With the decline of caps, people leave all the demands of freedom, or fail to cling to the things they believe, or are shown to a lesser degree of respect than their position in society takes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution at this time. And except for the fact that the club is serving for them, there is no real progress or merging. It is embarrassing that the authors and director could not save the best film, especially given talented and capable administrators in establishing.
