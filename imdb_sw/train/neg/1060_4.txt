Okay, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give a little credit for being worried about terrorists and the idea that the director of the CIA is making a conspiracy to hit this flight of punishment from heaven before bringing punishment to the world, it's prescient. That's right. That's good things. Acting ... right. The plan ... silent. "Moving" ... is not recommended. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody ever thought of what to do when a bird gets dirty. Do you think journalists have a "disaster" guide and how to submit? The proper implementation of the program is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. Not taking them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is released in heaven, why is the bird's door opened by "fighters" standing there without protection? In fact, have you ever happened to anyone to kill his feet? I am a sucker I always watch the movie to see the end, once I start. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a record so I didn't watch all the ads, which was included. It is a good example of why I watch a very small TV network.
