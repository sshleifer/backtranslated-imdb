The book is very good that at least the opening of this make-to-tv film will inspire, but then, as it varies more and more from this book, eliminate all religions and love and mathematics and put in the clich of cotton candy, it becomes boring . However, because of the comments I have heard, people who have not read a book like to love it, and if it causes even a child to read the Publisher for a while, it will serve its purpose. The most disgraceful change is to make the center of the Uncle's Mary Poppins' Fun (I love to laugh). There is no great thing to look like characters on the screens laughing on things that they don't really like.
