This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says acting is good and cast is very good he has never seen even lighter movies. Acting is very obvious in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel like all other "growing" comments should be made by people linked to film artists. I was not very interested in the story, but I wanted to see the beautiful country of Oregon, and there was a good movie - but making it was anything revealed. I think this movie also makes the embarrassment of common views that something great in American culture is ignored and perhaps lost and that recovery is important, and it is possible. It makes jokes in the wrong and all-open areas, and makes me think it was written by the Government Department or something. Go back to the drawing board. It even suggests that this film deserves a place in the same places as classic as Harold and Maude are quite late, and with this line of prayer and play and "hate" as it spreads in this film.
