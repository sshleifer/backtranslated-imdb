There is no light of sunshine in the "Sunshine Boys", which makes the name of this time called Neil Simon alone. Simon, who changed the script from his play (which goes without funding), compares the old age with abnormal behavior - and, worse, genius, galumphing, meaningless meaning. Walter Matthau is sympathetic to us to play the old actress vaudeville talked in reunification with former comedy boy George Burns for special television (it was said to have been a team for 43 years, which asks the question "how long last vudeville, however ? "). Burns, who conquered Oscar's support, has the chance of coming to the movie thirty minutes, after the time Matthau has already broken the equipment to hell and back. The film player finds, cannot be interested in watching. Director Herbert Ross just worked hard when he was not with one of Neil Simon's screens; here, Ross puts gags like amateur thudding, hammer off in the belligerent routine which fail to pay (such as half-incoherent Matthau show on the mechanic garage for inspection for TV trading). At this point, Matthau was still very young for this role, and he scores more by hitting and screaming. It was on Ross and Simon dropping down the habit, to disbelieve his character of giving "Sunshine Boys" some sun, still Walter continues to make a project if we would like all the deaf. The picture looks very vivid and crawling with no ghost; one loses hope for the first time. * 1/2 from ****
