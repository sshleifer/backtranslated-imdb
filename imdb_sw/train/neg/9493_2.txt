This interesting film provides a "hippie" rate of the 1970s in the shell of nut and gives us in the process. His attempt to prove the wonderful marriages of young women, innocent women who are sexually active have a washing. Young Hippy plays with a waif-like (Kay Lenz) game and sleeps with all the wrong people, and then one day he meets with a ridicule (Holden), already an old man, drinking alcohol and drinking as an actor, and decides to be "in" and "love" him. If you think it is high, the whole film is facing these events. He goes on to say "he likes" and just meet him, dresses thin and very fast. I couldn't help just laugh at all the film. It is obvious that he uses him only as a food ticket but the director is enough to think we are going to buy that there is really any love taking place. The disgusting event is where two are dressed and have sex, I had to develop quickly because it almost led me to vomiting. The 70-year music offering has also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
