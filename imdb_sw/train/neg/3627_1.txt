I am not very much in classic movies. Style like Patton, go my way, how Green was my Valley, Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone and Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane carried me. However, I would like to watch one of these films at 3,469 when I was tied to a seat than watching an American in Paris once in a very prestigious result forever. If I did last, I would like to sleep at all. <br /> <br /> The color color and music direction does not matter, Gershwin or not Gershwin. Playing and singing can help fall to sleep sleep. The conversation is not like Singin 'in Rain. Basically, this film is boring. The only film I have been looking at is Butch Cassidy and Kid Sundance. But you can't blame me. I slept only 5 minutes a night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can't give zero.)
