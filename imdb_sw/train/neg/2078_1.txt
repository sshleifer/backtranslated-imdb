I went to see this film yesterday and though I didn't have much hope for this film, I was desperate! In fact I don't believe I have spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film ... it was so bad! The storyline was shy and acting was bad (though it had great names like Uma Thurman in it). This film was very dependent on its special effects ... but they personally had no effect on me. I wished id never looked and I warned everyone against this film. It is a total loss of money and you will only get desperate later. I advise you to save your money, go to shopping, treat yourself, don't just go and see this film ... You will have to live with sad lol!
