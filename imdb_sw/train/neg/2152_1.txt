This film tries to be very clever, and Tarantino-like <br /> <br /> before trying that though, you need a solid film base. these include good voice, editing, device set, etc ... <br /> <br /> lets you talk about sounds in this film. quite angry. I have never been more confused with the sound of the voice, ever <br /> and before talking about the low budget, the film made in Chile etc .. allows to carry in mind that the right sound these days can reach more than ever ever been. anywhere. and more information on techniques are available then never before <br /> <br /> sound in this movie is very bad. The foley is mainly out of place and valid everywhere, the atmosphere is very similar. I've heard at least four big clicks during the film, which is the result of editing the bad sound. The inner sounds inside the cars are bad, the sound of closing the car doors is bad. The voice of the singing woman is correct. foley is either overboard, or just not there if someone sounds just got bored and gave. The position is correct. everything about it is right / <br /> and yet, not allowing the shortage of creativity to be on the way, while the movie tries to be bold. for example the aquarium sound is used in the following road. we hear the voice when we shouldn't. The voice editing is preceded by cuts. every trick in the book is used, and yet the foundations are not just <br /> <br /> editorial editing we have events using cuts for heavy jumps, we are surrounded by time line etc., yawn. All these techniques are followed by a minimum of royalty <br /> <br /> total mixture is crap, sound is crap. and so, the film is facing. What? The film may have many basic errors are considered for awards and great features? The cinema of Chile? The best result of creativity which Chile should give? I don't hope, and I don't think. My theory is that Chile's most selected and best talent has avoided this film as a blow because of its dangerous content. the same, the film is likely to get the improper reputation of the so-called 'world-cinema' for the same reason. they may have trouble. in fact the critics of the film rarely concentrate on technical details and quality <br /> <br /> this film is trash. it is both mouth and no pants and you have never been eligible for 6.8. The film has the best quality of Tarantino production, a new wave-driven porn!
