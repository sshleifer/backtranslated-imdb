this became a devotional film in Chinese college students, although I did not look at it until it was broadcast on channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> full of giddy fraud, plot is mediocre and unreal; The 'spirit' wants to convey how the independent artists refuse the music industry 'and' keep the spirit of art 'and' they could not sell themselves for money. That's true and high giddy; The diologue is very pathetic. Acting is poor. sceenplay is full of preten art. is a fantasy movie for children and that; s all <br />
