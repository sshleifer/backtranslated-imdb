Looking at the beautiful women around, playing fighters and thieves is one of the scent of the films of the middle film makes me happy. So the Carroll Street House was not quite a waste of time, although the story is released and the screenplay is not infected and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many tips on different Hitchcock pictures, not the choice of Kelly McGillis in the role of star. She is dressed as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But his behavior does not influence. The way he presents to the audience, should be a person with political beliefs and a purpose of life. After all the films are concerned with the period of time, clear real events and specific issues. But the story decreases within the first minute on the story of a run-mill-off-mill crime with wonderful coincidences, great predictions and a set of two dimensional characters. This is more sad, as the performers performances are good, such as photography and design set. <br /> <br /> Last in Central Station, New York is taking a breath. It starts in the underground section and then goes on the roof. Movie can be praised for its good use of architecture.
