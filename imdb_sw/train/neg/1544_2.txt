I think I laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about being from the street. And then I forgot sometimes I laughed. It was perhaps at first. This should be one of the most interesting movies. Hollywood does not realize that this kind of humor is destructive and sad, indeed. You can only hate yourself very often. <br /> <br /> 2/10
