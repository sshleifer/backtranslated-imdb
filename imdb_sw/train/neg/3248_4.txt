Why did I go to see this film? In fact, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that made me cry and laughter, so you blame me for expecting again? Additionally, the premise, a wonderful trailer, the cooperation of his star Jennifer Aniston, and the truth was a huge area of ​​hit hit. However, as "Summary of my line" suggests, I was an error. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In the movie 2hour, I laughed for 5-10 minutes ... all together, all the time I sat examining "I really had to have ice cream". I admit that it's probably wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he expects when he does Gem as 'Truman Show', 'Liar Liar', and myself and Irene ',' Dog and Dumber ',' Mask ', and' Ace Ventura 'film producing, in the words of Bruce Nolan himself, the same film? <br/> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminal. I mean hello! He has been around the public eye for ten years right now, and in this film gets four lines to say. Suitable. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One Word - Cliche <br /> <br /> Reason 4: A common referral to American Reference - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'week of cancellation' - is a clue to appeal home home growth. "The boy says no to drugs and yes to Education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be a miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavy feeling that has already been dealt with in the United States, but it can tackle strong resistance in markets that takes ink to craft. In addition, I am still going to school, and those words show me and my friends all the miracles ... or maybe it just means having a mind? It is a long time for Carrey's time to make you a great deal of restraint and prevent Bruce General from having a full stress, but you are advised to resume your expectations below.
