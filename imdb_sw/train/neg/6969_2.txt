The Blue Monkey (1987) or the 'BodySuckers' invasion as is known here in the UK was a beautiful movie of horror about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse with an amazing plant of poison! Someone runs out of the hospital, where this bug as a creature comes out of his mouth, this course changes in this monster of insects and continues to go on the rampage! Despite Steve Railsback and John Vernon being in the movies, I found that it is boring, and the story of a predictable flat, indifferent characters, a special impact of cheap and lack of action! Horror fans don't need to track this unusual film, you can't lack a lot of faith in me! I offer this 2/10 film.
