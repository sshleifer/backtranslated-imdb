What to review a movie like this? It is pain and shame, even in a way that allows you to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Movies like "The little man" will reduce me. They represent the film for more extinction. This film was done by a group of boys aged 18-24 who are 18-24 years old who had the prospect of coming and seeing the opening of the night before the word emerged on how bad it was, so that the film could quickly return investment . Other film partners with good ideas were probably not able to get their films developed because resources were moving towards making this breast side.
