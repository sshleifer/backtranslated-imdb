I didn't think it was possible, but I've got a worse film than 'The Melt Body'. This movie is so bad! And what is even worse is that his Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Shot on what looks like VHS, and with the awesome rock of the 80 rock, continues to get worse, which is hard to believe see how the beginning is bad (the cracked-down-down male in the sauce of white tomato sauce room?) <br /> And why do their voices continue to change? From a bad bed of New York, in English, then a clean Aussie! And it happens quite cast! This film also says it has won a film festival on the cover (I believe it was a Utah film festival). This should not be false because no one in their good mind can appoint this for anything (perhaps the Rasberries of Golden but I think it's very bad as well). Come boys! This film should be a number 1 less than 100 !!! It should be ten times as bad as those films are already there. It has done well for the filmmakers of this litter, by proving there is a reason to not see the film ..... 0/10
