The most uncomfortable and very beautiful music that the characters stand next to the rooms or the rocket ship and talk forever. You can think of things that can be lost when exploring Mars but these events have been done through a large red / orange filter that makes everything very bad. Martian / vegetation environments include drawings and creatures do not accept. There is an echoes of 'Mrs. Monster' when the heroine carefully winds the ocean as an obstacle to eating meat eating around him before the weakened decline, that being Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. Slices of earplugs well when you look at another 'sci-fi' music, repeated over time, will expel them. If you find yourself unable to sleep only one night, play this on the VCR and your sleep will recover at any time.
