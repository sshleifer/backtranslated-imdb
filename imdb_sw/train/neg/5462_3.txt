This app gives you bugs! No humor and it is so great called "fun"! It's just a very knowledge of my love! The characters are highly recommended and are not available. Plots are wrong and values ​​are repeated again and again. What is the joy in it? I also feel this has been on the BBC for a long time and is widely advertised. What? Really needs to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a new show of brand comes out of events? I think it's a time when the BBC begins to restore some of their old performances as: Gadget Inspection, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Count Duckula instead of continuing to offer deals for these new exhibitions! I thought the BBC would bring the Mouse risk, why is going on with it? 3/10
