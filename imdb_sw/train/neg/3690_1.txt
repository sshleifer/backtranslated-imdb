Father - Rajinikanth never forget this name in his life. This is the film that has led to its fall. It was opened largely but was badly damaged and put a severe financial loss on its producers and suppliers. Rajinikanth had to pay for the losses involved. Immediately after his release, he tried to get involved in politics but failed very much. It is a very bad movie and acting a terrible, effective and efficient image of pathetic. In the same movie, Rajinikanth looks like someone who is infected with a certain disease. I am one of the unfortunate spirits who saw the Father, the first day of the first show in the theater. The audience was very tired and many of them left the playground before entering. Sorry, I won't recommend this to anyone.
