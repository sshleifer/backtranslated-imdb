Is this hell? It is one of the dumbest movies I have seen. I don't understand why people on this site love it very much. Its useless and weak for any reason. His worst worse Resident. I do not give too much unless you want to look chessy, a bad act of acting. See real horori movies like Stephen King's, Shining, Jurassic Park (kinda horor), JAWS, etc.. Leave this hip to lease when there is nothing to lease. It's as bad as Crudy vs Gayson. Attack of the Tomato Killer is better then this trick. Oh wow meat eat zombies. How many films of films are we need. Skip this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
