I looked at the Inspector Auditor. It was, and is still, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my favorite. I learned many geography and history from the Auditor's Journey Inspector's Journey. I wanted to get out of the banana leaf and become the biggest detective. <br /> <br /> But the film has destroyed the reputation of a good cartoon. Matthew Broderick, a capable actor, certainly not the role of the Auditor's Gadget. The first thing - in the film, the Inspector Store is smart. Not in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves more secrets with himself. In the cartoon, it was almost every Penny, Brain, and an amazing book (I still want his book!). If Gadget came secretly, it was for an accident. The gadget in the film appears to be a potential detective, but in the cartoon was a dumbly beautiful, which was where humor came from. Something else is that it's very "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the film. It's not just meant to be a cartoon of Saturday morning. Also, Gadget should not have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots. <br /> <br /> I also missed the real gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie was a chic convertible. In the cartoon was a police car sedan and could turn on the van. It also had any gadgets and was exactly there to find him from place to place. But if anything, one thing that was awesome about the film was that it was a film of elements. The Gadget's Auditor was a cartoon of Saturday morning. The movie was so bad, it was too long, it was very conspicuous and it was not too far as interesting. Tip for those who have not seen: Do not see. JUMA. Check out the cartoon, it's really realistic.
