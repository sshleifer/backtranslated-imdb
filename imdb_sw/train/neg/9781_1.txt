I don't think I am too far away to say that this is probably the worst movie I saw. I have been working on my favorite movie list: "Long Day," "Hell and Back," "River Kwai Valley," (both black and white) all have good plots, rich characters and good acting. I have seen a better conversation and I work in a single student's secondary school. The plan, however, is not a bad premise - just implemented badly. It's kind of a traffic accident, though, I can't seem to wipe! The film does not need a big money or a big set of "twelve men angry" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is not the reason. What were they thinking about?
