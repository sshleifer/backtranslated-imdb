Wow what a good cluster for the film: Keep close to the film manufacturer and block the author who decides to take cucumber lessons. Hey and what better idea has placed the main role for the film manufacturer who is interested in cucumber. Gosh I would like to have that knack for genius. Yes I have a shock. It is interesting that this type of zero power for making movies is being done. Come unless you are a fan of a rabid cucumber (I accept when they judge themselves) or a member of a fan club of Sally Potter (?) There is nothing in this film that will make you run to the movies to see it. Even if you have entered the cucumber a large part of the film is taken up by trivial events as the house is being rehabilitated or the person climbing the wheels will go on the road. write a notable but a review of the film's entertainment. Surprised as Theo Robertson put a boot into the latest of the blockbusters of Hollywood, cried for sympathy if he gets another letter of refusal from the film company, fall in disappointment if he takes soap and shower on his good body. TRAINING DISCOVERIES will soon mention the movie next to you if anyone is ignorant enough to finance the movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not available by Harry Potter
