I am ashamed of this movie, not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was not amazing! However, under Disney's expectations it has been, I have never thought that they could do something they didn't think otherwise. There is no respect here for any Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of military art. The young girls - especially the Asian girls - are not too young with the poor things of life. And from a cultural point, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are bound to fame and fashion, but they are very few. And even those who are still an honorable scholar. Another example, perhaps, but one of the real justice. Because that's what Chinese parents do. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to go legally, they could make Wendy a slick girl and glasses with a love and hate relationship with her family. It just adds to my confusion with American movies. Asia's culture is not about meditation and mysterious words, which originated from the nature that seem to be wise. We do not walk all the time, and we all know some kind of military art. We are PEOPLE, and I would like to know if someone wrote a part of Asia that doesn't show us as a sad caricature.
