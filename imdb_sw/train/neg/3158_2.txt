This is really the worst movies I saw. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks quite bad through the whole movie, the hair is bad! They say in a voice like a voice and there is no chemistry of nooo. DVD caps did not come away from what the movie is true. True, the truth itself. I had to develop quickly through some of it because it was very painful to watch. I really want to know how I here on earth anyone can think this is good? their real hhaha like chat and say "yeah" with no enthusiasm. I couldn't tell them exactly that they were in love. Sorry but this was a sad reason for the movie I think I saw.
