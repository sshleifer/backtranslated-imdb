For this evaluation, the list of good points and bad points. Evil eyes: Making choice (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), said badly cast down, story, idea of ​​filing in modern days, trends, editing, voice sounds, and top of all, any idea of ​​making a film on a television series that has not started and, despite popularity. Good luck: Jessica Simpson in red bikini ............ yes! One can make a comparison here. In the area where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke takes the way to Michael Weston like Enos, and asks the question, "Enos, where is Hogg and Roscoe?", in his judgment distress, where to tell him. could also if he asked, "Enos, this is a good movie?", a red bikini would have closed its sentence to say yes, though in his good mind he could say, "No, it is not true." As good as he looked in bikini, he could have been naked, and even that didn't keep this piece of awesome text.
