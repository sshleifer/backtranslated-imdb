As the author I find this bad film make it a complete production to complete in the face. Talk about insulting. I wrote a better story than this in the 8th grade. The worst job, the bad writing, the bad lead and when added all together the result is complete and total failure. The only thing that this film can accomplish is cheating users who are not sure to lose their time. Who had the green light? It's not artistic, clever, intelligent, anxious, wonderful, awesome, wonderful-NOTHING. <br /> <br /> Anime is flat and interesting without any development. The program is like recycled as aluminum can. Somehow they were able to hit very few actors who should all be desperate for work or expect one of these independent budget movies to come to the next Fiction Fiction. This document should be used to be used on aircraft, not a movie. Request and last but not, 5'2 105 lb certainly has the ability to kill men and women its size twice without a fight with a single blow. Avoid this bomb if it infects you with STD.
