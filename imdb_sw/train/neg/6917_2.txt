Once again the story known about the man (the author here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his desire for more life: success. The secret of unfunny (we should "go home and write the best"), ignorance lines to understand the message of "power" "Kristomanish" (only our own in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long attempt to the area Hopkins agent hits the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or bad) for all the bad things he has done for this unseen character. It is not a bad attempt from administrators (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in "Gender and City" role again, Aykroyd and some funny lines in its small space). P.S. Try also a very unknown film from Greece called "Alloimono mad mad", a priority change of this story (an old man gives his soul to the devil to return his youth)
