The most horrible movie due to James Michener's novel. It was even worse than the performance of Marlon Brando. Its southern drawing was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when she was speaking as a young woman coming home. Brando, very good in past films, was reduced here with laughter. Tyrone Power, in the "Witness Prosecutor," would have to be appointed for the best actor instead of Brando here. The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando had met with stones in the movie. His move from this interaction with pro one happens when he gets love with the Asian woman. His feelings and conversation were difficult to see how he could focus on such new ideas. <br /> <br /> The Lord only knows why Buttons Red and Miyoshi Umeki received Oscars to help with their exhibitions. There is no performance or either interesting. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without anything shown on its side. The best performance in this film was carried out by Miiko Taka, who did well as Brando's love. He expressed a great feeling as an American player who found love and character of Brando. His market was faced with the anxiety he had lost his father and brother in World War 11. He found that his play was not his way out of his existence that he was living. <br /> Martha Scott came from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in the "Ten Commandments" for the great mother of Brando's first time. His work with one of Ricardo Montalban was lost. Patricia Owens, as the first love of Brando, demonstrated the depth and faith in its performance.
