My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney works for damage that she loved. That's the problem with the "Buddies of the Air." It is a small children's film that is filled with careful census calculations, two proper political values, and a good sense of alcohol to avoid the shocking rate. and done better before. Consider "Dalmatians 101 They Come Home" and you get a general idea. I have a suggestion that the good story of children is a good story, period. "Sea Air," which is like the original paper as planned paper, can not reach that level. It is not the worst video that your child can watch, but there are better tones.
