(Some possible attackers) <br /> <br /> I do not know how the Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $ 80 million under a very flick fatigue and animated flick. Perhaps they thought the interesting animation would be more enough to bring the audience (especially family) to see it in groups. Well it seemed to work at the opening weekend, it made $ 26 mil, largely and made $ 38.1 mil. The total (average weekend). But I think the audience who came during the weekend felt the same thing I did, when I saw and spread the word. This is one very great movie, except for everything else's animation, especially the script seems to be done at the age of three. <br /> <br /> The movie is only 80 hours. for a long time, but it feels like an epic of three hours. Little notes to me are, the offensive subject is one of them, and it is very clear written. Sometimes he saves from immigrants and even if you see horses are clearly afraid, up pops narrator (the voice of talented Matt Damon) to erase any imagination (which would just happen in the most simple of the mind. /> <br /> Another is often the songs of Bryan Adams, now I am a fan of his music, I think he's good, but coming to make a Dreamworks really think listeners will be able to handle 8-9 of his songs in such a short movie, surely I can't. finally and here is a spoiler, a horse shot at an empty level and a member of calvary, even less, he (horse) then gets into a bright river, the Spirit (the aim of the movie) tries to save him, but both go up to the waterfall which it must have a 50-foot drop, later on the film close to the end we see that this horse is alive and well. I know this is a children's movie, but even a small amount of reality will not be accepted. conclude, this is a very crippled life, I don't say children will not enjoy it, but someone else will be looking at their waiting hours for this last trip. Certainly on my list of more than 10 of this year. - ** among stars 4. <br /> <br />
