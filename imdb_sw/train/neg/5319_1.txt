One of the worst films at all times: a woman who seems to have run away from WWF, has an amazing goal with a gun that has the same effect (the first woman takes the fish out of the fire but when it strikes someone else they get lost) and takes time out for animals. Then you get unlikely characters, 30-year-old college students, an attempt to lose to finish the surprise and vote, lots more. Avoid at all costs.
