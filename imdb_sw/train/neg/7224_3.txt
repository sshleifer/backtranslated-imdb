Movie remains in the gray for a very long time. Very little is described as the film grows, and as a result it is a lot of extraordinary mechanisms that seem to have a deep meaning but because of the way of writing a story becomes just wonderful and unnoticed to see. It's the kind of power to watch the film again but there is no way to do it. It was that I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure that if I watch this movie in the evening I would be sleeping. For me the movie was like "poor woman" poor. Movie leaves too many and inappropriate questions. It makes the movie leave a sense of meaningless and non-permanent. <br /> <br /> Also the amazing look of the movie does not help much. The movie is half CGI / halve real life but it has not been done for half as beautiful, amazing, interesting and imagined as for example it will be a case in the future movies like "Sin City" and "300". They did even half of the film and computer characters, which seemed like an unimportant and unfamiliar choice, also considering that the characteristic animation is not very good. Certainly the futuristic landscape still seems good and the movie is definitely not cheap to do but its style on substances and in this case which really is not a good thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also very bad and not recommended. The great God of the movie always says such lines; 'I will do this but not your concern for what I want to do'. There was not just saying anything at all Mr. Horus! It is offensive and very easy to put on the film, if you don't care to explain anything about the plot. Also the most comprehensive questions and the meaning of the movie finds the problem in the shade of the movie and its script. <br /> <br /> Vendors still did better. They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure that what they did would be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> Stories and movies are far from nature. It reduces from the most common and semi-classic elements, especially modern, false movies. Maybe it is also why the movie made the biggest feeling about me. Try and unsuccessful movie attempts. <br /> <br /> 3/10
