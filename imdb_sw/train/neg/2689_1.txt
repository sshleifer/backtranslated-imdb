Now, I am not a film critic, but I really hate "September 11". This film was, in general, bad. Apart from Alejandro González Iñárritu, which was more effective and straightforward on this issue, short films were very boring, and very bad. Worse in my mind was part of Youssef Chahine's part of which he compared Palestinian suicide bombings to American soldiers, even to date so as to suggest suicide bombings fought for greater reasons. This part was far from the topic, and focusing on the lack of any good Chahine, wasting my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven directors from different countries to make a film with their views on the tragedy was good on paper, but with practice, it was not available.
