As noted, this form has been published several times, as soon as "You Found Mail", and Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of several versions, this is my favorite favorite. The problem I think is that the beach studio on the charisma of Stars, which does not quite cut here. Chemistry between two guidelines does not provide boiling on this film. No real spark. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the old donuts, beautiful but bland. And when existing ones lose all the film can only follow. Judy is especially disappointed. He looks like he has no neck! I don't know if he had problems with pain or nothing but he looked like a turtle trying to pull the head into his shell, both hunched up with everything. I didn't know what Van Johnson was getting very hot. I would like to make a bee line for the best violin player. And Van was not even big. I've been thinking of him as a typical Hollywood to lead someone and didn't do anything to remove the picture here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of a star or early 1900s then you might like this film. But there are many entertainment activities out there, and they give you more than a stale mouth.
