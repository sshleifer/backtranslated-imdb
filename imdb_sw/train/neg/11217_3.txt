So my wife and I just ended up despite several threats from us all to close. For the most part of the endurance was the worst part of this film, there was very little excitement. Acting was very emotional, until we beat it several times during the worst of times (the church woman for example). The deceased sister was using interesting ways to communicate with her twins to live, although instead she sent out the important information she had tried to fear from hell instead of her that looked much like Ring. Rather let the police get involved - which I'm sure that those earplugs who got it will have DNA on them - he instead of the terrible plan 'get' someone who covered the death of his sister's accident. I will call a terrible plan because at the end he allows him to kill him, which the movie is becoming black. Negative talks, bad acting, bad end.
