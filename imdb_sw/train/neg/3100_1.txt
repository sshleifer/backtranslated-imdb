Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where do I start? This movie offers Manos - Hands of Fate and Future War to run with their money as the worst films made. This is fun to laugh, where Manos had a very bitter look. Hobgoblins ends at a certain time to hit somewhere like a perfect movie to describe the word: "80 of cheeze". Acting (and I use this word freely) is angry, hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will see, and the fight with the garden tool should seem reliable. Movie was the perfect car for MST3K, and this version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and many bombs to shoot some of the funniest pieces that they've ever done. If you are trying to look at this without the help of Mike and bots ... God will help you !!
