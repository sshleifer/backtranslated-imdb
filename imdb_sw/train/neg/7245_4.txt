I don't have to suggest a player, not too bad, but it's very slow time. As the film continues, it gets more interesting, but no brilliant. In fact I like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I didn't tell him sometimes and he's right here. The seducer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the direction then you can please it.
