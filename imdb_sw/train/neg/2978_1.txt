I am a great fan of flicks, and a zombie film is especially my favorite. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst films I've ever seen. So it is not necessary to say I am very happy, it's the best movie I have seen for a long time. The story has the same difference as the "Return of the Living Dead" of Dan O'Bannon, but when the film was deliberately funny, this is the opposite. It has some of the most surprises I have ever witnessed, especially from the main character of the scientist. His performances and the Great were common. Also, the effects are emerging and in most cases they are not recommended, and the deaths are often just stupid. This, in fact, makes it more fun. SPOILER INFORMATION - The worst is the place where a young man opens the door of the refrigerator and sees the head of a cut zombie, which opens his eyes and somehow FATHER IN FRIDGE (open to wind and a little string), leaving people in the neck, killing him. Zombie leaders are able to float air now? It fails every law of physics known to man, and is one of the most remarkable things published. That's just one of the most beautiful moments of interest in the idiotic mess. I can't believe it has found a rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, make yourself a permit and borrow this sucker.
