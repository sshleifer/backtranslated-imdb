The film takes over the last years to fix and the military to set up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where attacks in the first film occurred. Employees are killed shortly before a group of soldiers in practice exercises show even getting someone close. You can fill others. <br /> <br /> This is a paid image around. There seems to be no interest in any show, nor anyone behind the camera. This is a film made with money and anything. For some degree this would have worked, it would have been a South African Opportunity (where the National Defenders run some people into the ponds), but instead of a lot of nothing. For the most part you can complain the script, it is written of course in part by Wes Craven, which is faced with the former regular goals. Add to the confusion the fact that the trend is slow and the introduction of the series thus reduces the desire to remove any natural tension in any area. It is not as bad as it is, but it is done badly. Let me put my feelings in the context: The reason I saw this film is for many local reasons came and run this film instead of the children to get rid of Mimzy Last and I wanted to see what caused the outcry (I mean films have been so usually-says sarcastically). I am sure that this film will only frighten those who like Mimzy's last.
