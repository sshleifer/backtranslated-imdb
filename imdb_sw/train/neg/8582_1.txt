Feeling like a series of Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this film is fake. As a person born in Sheffield, and still with links to the city, I was very disappointed with this film. Someone said that would have been installed on Oklahoma, and that is on my account for me. This seems to be a romantic view of northern Britain conducted by the US market. Perhaps many Americans - and many southern people of English - do not realize that Sheffield is a large metropolis of nearly half a million inhabitants, and modern urban culture. Among the Giants was shown as another rural town, where everyone in Sheffield appeared to drink in the same old pub, and where the idea of ​​the party was playing in a village village similar. This was a very small community, not the capital city. Sheffield class men who worked were very different from their real life counterparts, who generally have taciturn and contact with sand and in short speech. They do not talk, and certainly do not sing in the rooms. Even rural settings, allegedly in Peak District, seemed like a stranger to me. I realized a few places I was walking, but some of the pyloni-like airplanes that started on the beautiful scenery reminded us more of Wales. Indeed, in the last features I saw the memory of Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, during the summer, crawling with tourists and tourists in cars. It is between two big cities. It's not kind of desert. With the idea that a young woman may fall in love, and desire, Pete Postlethwaite, which was hard, and could be just a male dream. His reasons for being his partner were not made clear. None of the men shown to have a partner or family; they were in a void. Anyone wishing to see a film about Sheffielders who are unemployed could be led. This Sheffield was only in the minds of its midfielders and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a big fake! <br /> <br />
