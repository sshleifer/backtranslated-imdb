While some training events were true, many of them showed military teachers like the former Nazi forms. In fact, people who wrote playing screens were either anti-military or writing films for the audience. I'm a vet of Viet Nam and, even now, the military teachers who worked in some of these would still serve while in the military prison. And I have loved the area where the "hero" and his friend (all of the privacy) are sitting at the Captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and meeting Captain as if they were their friend. The same thing has never happened in the training or the official state, as it was the area's goal. At the end I wondered, "What was this film?" as it seemed to walk around that place without any purpose except "I hate all authority." Thank you God I got from the library and did not pay him to pay taxes.
