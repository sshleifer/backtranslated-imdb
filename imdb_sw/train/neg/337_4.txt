Well, what you say. GOLD's son enters the "bad, good" group. Eddie Murphy has some lines (and quite another time to hear), but you are still welcome. The Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as Sardo Numspa hosted (what is the name of this name is this?) <br /> <br /> Who should watch CHILD CHILD ... hm ... it's hard say, but I think my best would be people who love shameful movies and can be accepted with a bad act, a bad plot and a more embarrassing discussion. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
