The study is bad. Bad work, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad trends and bad idea. The pieces of schlock did not come any cheesier or funnier without pretending than nothing ... nothing. At the end of the "movie", you are left wondering why they worried the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he financially slow or something? Still thinking of seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you die in laughter in the first thirty minutes, when you will see the city of cyborg people called "Cytown", you will be. Avoid this, my friends who love film. Avoid.
