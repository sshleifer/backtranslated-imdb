This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past week, The Gravedancers being the first. Traders were excellent. I can just think for this look that production must be very limited. I accept the story started interesting but really fizzled me to the end. We were not given time to hear or understand any of the characters who just made all their improper qualities even more angry. I have to mention that there was also a bit of a muscle and a 12-year-old boy who works as a Sheriff. The only reason I lived through all the film was to know what the main secret was, which was not all interesting. Some more history about the family would have helped but they were not seen as a family at all. To me, this film is very old that I could not even see it on a DVD. Four variables are likely to initiate the original story. This was one of the jump for the worst fears.
