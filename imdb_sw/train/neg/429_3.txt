I was cast to see this film for its strength, but ultimately it's all that it offers. It includes more than the Greek catastrophe than the modern excitement of the big city corruption. It is the main fault is its predictibability and the greatest lack of doubt. We know who evil men start from the beginning, and just follow along with them as they fall like gold. His credit film avoids the free and sexual abuse, but has forgotten to replace it, clean or excited in any way. All the delicious cola, flat decaffeinated cola food. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, like "Hidden".
