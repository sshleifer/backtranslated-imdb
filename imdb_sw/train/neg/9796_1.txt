Okay, I can't imagine anything more than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But with weight, Power Rangers has GOT that under this list. What? Do you think anything more stupid than five and six young people (who do not even like a normal boy) play around the same suit as COLOR. Dear friends, have you ever met a real person being beaten against the mind wall and is coming close at once and continues to fight unscathed? Power Rangers are for boys aged five, and I believe, I have never loved this show even when I had five. <br /> <br /> I think you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. True ACT ACT as young, and Tommy Oliver really does as a consultant, or no, teacher. It has a young player, though fighting is lame, I am a Thunder of Dino. Many people say Power Rangers decides, but I don't want. It will be a shame to stuck. Therefore, his face, five-year-old, Power Rangers are trash.
