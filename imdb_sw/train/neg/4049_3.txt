I did not like Bill Murray's car when it was first released in the 80's, so I tried to look again to see if my excitement of this film was under my flavor of film in the 80s or was it "Reduced" is just a bad movie. Indeed, the decision entered and "beaten" is a bad movie. Now, "Stripes" can be a new comedy in the early 80s, and can appeal to people who have gone to basic training or who are fans of Bill Murray, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Especially because "Stripes" should be comedy but not just funny. There are some laughs, but it's a few and middle. Most of the films are used by a wonderful plot that has grown so much and not very interesting. This comedy deficit is especially seen when used by more modern comedies such as "Anchorman" which tries to laugh at every part of the movie. "Stripes" faces more by Bill Murray and Harold's lack of Ramis's ability to act. Bill Murray is a good player but he was not a very good actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are not enough as executives carry the great arch of the movie. Finally, the most comedy that is in "Stripes" revolves around Bill Murray's self, smart-alec character of man so if you do not find such a funny character (if I haven't done) you will not find a lot of little comedy there in "Funny Stripes" either. It is a very old movie, it has never been a good old and it is not good to watch. If you want to look at the 80-year-old woman of "comedy" I can suggest "Make Crazy." As "Stripes" humor in "Crazy Stir" is not as fast as in the modern comedies, but unlike "Stripes" has a much better age and its results still seem.
