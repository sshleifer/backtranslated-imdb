While it's not as bad as it has been (I have seen MUCH worse, this is still a very crazy movie). Essentially to restore the "Bluog Coogan" of Siegel, and the main difference that the Clint Eastwood hat has a more charisma than Joe Don Baker, a non-dynamic actor like one. However, Venantino Venantini is, however, great (and great fun) as a bad person, a kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to go through this steampile, as all others have sent to make a very bad statement, especially a girl. Elder Elder Rossano Brazzi, hardly believe he was once in love (see "Mondo River" to see him flee from women). Look here as Ben second Gazzara, he's given anything to do. All is a show of Joe Don, unfortunately. And it all got a "generic" brand of generic generic that cannot be more boring. Graydon Clark can make good B movies ("without warning"), but here he travels, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, the Malta sites were good, and there Venantini will try to save the day. 3/10.
