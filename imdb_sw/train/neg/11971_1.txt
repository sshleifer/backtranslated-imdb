Although the film and Bruce Willis is always worth looking, you better fly this. I watched this on television, so I didn't need to make money for it. I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The program goes slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are actually reliable, it gets more and more unreliable towards the end. It is very doubtful, like a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters do not follow the direct command. And even if he would like, if all around it would be. They know he puts them at risk, and they know that they will surely die if they follow him, but what is coming, he is our Lt so let's do what he says (despite the direct command, note). Still, there are some beautiful pictures in this film. They save the village, where the population is killed by the rebels. They, they save several villagers or so, others had already been killed. A wonderful part, that they took the trucks that the rebels left. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the road is safe, but did not have an explanation for it. However. I think this was the same one that I had given the film. What made this movie a contempt for the brain and so it is impossible for a group of 7 soldiers to kill many rebels to hurt or kill themselves. Just close to their free loose comrades. And that's because they have to fight with an army of about 500 or more. Can you believe that? They fight with a large army of people, they kill hundreds of them, and only leave a few of them. And they have rounds and rounds of ammo. Never run away. Bombs and claymore mines, M60 guns and even RPG. Where are these things. Take it around or what? They found even the distance that shows them the activities of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has an ongoing battery for the day. True? Who think of this trick. I think if you turn off your brain completely and accept that rebels are a group of idiots, you give this film a high score. If not, skip this. It saves you time.
