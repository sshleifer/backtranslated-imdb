I felt the brain died, I will tell you. This is the worst movie I bought. (for my ignorance I thought this was Peter Jackson's film the same name). These displays are very awesome. Special effects have not stood the test of time and look bad. Script promotes the kind of TV film, look at the middle of the acting form. Observers check whether they have been using lessons from Joey Tribbiani, seem to be direct, and are holding. Plus I've never been confused with the film until I sat this look. That's a plot or no plot is so bad that frustration puts within a few minutes. Avoid as a blow.
