We can start with wooden work but this film is a catastrophe. After growing in NY I can tell you that this film is insulting to anyone who knows the community or people. I am not even a patron of culture in any way and I've found this to be part of Hollywoodized litter that fits his own fiction, presentation of ignorance culture and language that anyone who looks at Seinfeld knows it is right. This is a great waste of time and, even worse, is not very interesting since the results are obvious and the events of the struggle are getting worse. Who does it? Nothing. The author's name appears to Israel or something of that nature but it is obvious that he has no clue about the issue that he writes about. Looking at its bio, it's amazing live in New York and wonder how the real relationship was with the community. Even the most popular movie like "Alien in our midst" is much better and closer to the truth than this dreck. The readings of this person is unfortunate that he has written texts on all C-grade movies that somehow show stars. amazing. Maybe he knows someone because this script is down below par for the bad movie Dolph Lundgren.
