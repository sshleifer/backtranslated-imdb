I've never been angry with the leading performance as I was with Ali McGraw in this movie. God is the one who bothers or what? He says everything in one voice and it's terrible, so it's terrible for that, on the contrary, Ryan O'Neal is a brilliant. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of stories. He is rich, he is timber, both of them should offer sacrifices for Love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, he is called by his first name, if he did not see the difference in the Two that He won in the Name of Love. <br /> <br /> Oscar's selection for this movie shows that it must be a bad year. John Marley is as good as the father of Wood, but the Assistant Assistance? At least Ali did not win. I still think Katharine Ross would like to play Jennifer, but again, if I am, Katharine Ross would be in most films. In fact it is an excellent actor than McGraw. Even when he was sick, he never came to me even to feel sad. It was good to see Tommy Lee Jones looking as if it was around 15, and the score is beautiful. But this is in the past it has a long beard for a long time, and the sin of it is not old, but it feels.
