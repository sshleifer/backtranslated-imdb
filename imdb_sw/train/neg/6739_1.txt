Someone is wondering why anyone tries to fix the best movie plots that have already been seen, just like this movie. "Wedding Day" is one of the best examples of why you should not even try to fix it, under the example of a new story, something that should be unique. If such a project goes on with a large license label, then go out with a great star and the wonders of production, in that way, people will come to the stars. Alas, it doesn't happen in this improper attempt in comedy. The problem seems to be that the way the screens have stolen stories in London, while basically, this seems to be a common American situation that even the environment will not be able to fix. Then there is a problem with the star. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have many chemicals like oil and vinegar! Since Kat and Nick have no collision from the beginning, the viewer is not asked on the film how the creators thought they would be. It is clear that Kat will fall to Nick, and vice versa. Amy Adams, who was the best in "Junibug", comes as a little girl who has kept her from going and has not been clean for someone she loves and will go to marry. For anyone who is attracted, the end of the film is running for about seven minutes!
