Here it is not enough here. There are few funny places, but not enough. I was shocked because I love stupid movies. I expected this to be a secret gem. NO. It was a hidden loop. All the time I was watching I was thinking, "Geez, I could do better than that and I'm moron". Don't believe a few good ideas. I liked them. At any time I laughed. Perhaps this was a pleasant or cutting edge in 1987 but someone, fell flat today. This film had a promise, it just didn't give. Maybe if they wrote again a few more times. I convict the actors. They were not good, but they didn't have much to work. This film has failed because of writing thread. SORELY WANTED.
