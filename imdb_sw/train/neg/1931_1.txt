I went to see this with much hope. Unfortunately the talk is totally stupid and generally the movie is far from fearing fear or interest. Even a child can see a sense of lack of behavior. Today's children need creation stories that inspire them, which would make them 'dates' about events. That's what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many children thought about being Jedi Knights and burning their own lights?) Do not waste your time & money on this.
