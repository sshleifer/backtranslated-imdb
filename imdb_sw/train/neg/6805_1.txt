I have finished the last 10 minutes of film ... I still don't believe what I have explored. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie EVER. If I would like to list all the errors in the film, this review will give me many sentences (very serious errors, because of the bad even though) \ t they did not know how to move. Ice-t is a bad actor ... and something that I do not understand, is how productivity you wanted to be like a hero, but he is zero. for 747, they need only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in the land transmission airplane ... wonderful .. such as bodies that had no blood at all. see how something bad can get
