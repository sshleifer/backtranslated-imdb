Well this is normal "straight to the toilet" of a few films. Summary of a long story, a young group of young people / young people are beaten between the creepy trees and are reduced by the nymphomaniac of honey. This movie has all the basics of the slasher of this slasher: The women in the water, â€”a young or young people are being beaten in other parts of the death, the last pastor is a well-built woman who will ever show his midriff, but does not have a low bra, - angry, a man who knows about the place of evil,-read, - to be a murderer, not a conspiracy <br /> <br /> Yet for a cheesy slasher film , it was very frightening. The sky is completely dead. No, even gender and pollution incidents, were enough to keep male and female gender concerns. Watching it looked like it was being looked at by a damp head of cold or cold head. 0/0
