Let's just say in simple words that even the creators of this film have the opportunity to understand: This is a dumbed film with even a dumber script, a limping animation, and a story about as natural as thumbtacks. Don't worry - unless you need to find a certain way to attract a group of lost mind or very slow children. They can laugh, especially if they have left their medicine. There is a special type of insult in this stupid film - not only the filmmakers think that children are intellectual who can be accepted by the claptrap which takes approximately zero quest, but they have no trouble breaking the gag in and out that an adult can get amusing . This film, in fact, took me royally. Shock on you for a very low drop.
