This movie was very written. The characters were not detailed. They should never make this film. My 11-year-old can write the best screenplay then Shiung-rae Shim. The only actor who was not the sand was the keeper of the zoo. He was just one of the most wonderful and reliable one of the votes. I love movies and try to give them the benefit of doubt, but this was above my list of blind numbers 2. Number 1 to Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in great need of brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Many of the creatures in the movie were 't even dragons ... why did they call D-war?
