It is not as bad as others do it, though it is obviously pathetic compared to nature. In my opinion Amitabh was as good as the Baban Singh hosting the army - try to liken him to Gabbar in the original if they had no similar effect. More than some instances of abnormal animation however, all parts of the film are wrong. The development of character was poor and the development of the story had no hope, and many obstacles, and pieces of information that he did not want to know if I had not read back to the DVD trial. The worst part of the film was the support of Nisha Kothari and especially the new dude called Prashant Raj. I am just angry from when his first lips opened. And for Prashant Raj - who is this boy? where has he come from and why on earth he was in the film studio for anything except serving drinks? His ability to act is zero and he has the same voice, dialogue and strong expression in every area, whether action, comedy, or even an event when someone has died. Ajay Devgan was moderate, at least his words changed which are more than I can say for his friend's mistake. In general, the AG of RGV should look at the solid performance of Amitabh, and also Urmilla Matondkar very much for special appearance.
