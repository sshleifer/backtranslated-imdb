I am quite surprised why this film is even proposed, not to be left alone in a very high position, especially for many critics who, for otherwise, are very concerned. There is one important word that describes this film on its basis - irritating. The most easily illustrated example is the use of the director - or, precisely, the abuse of music. In the first half, the real reggae tune is actually played three times (once it is very often). But in the second half, Mommas And Papas "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually with the highest amount. Godsakes, if you liked a song or not before, you would be completely sick and end. Imagine, some people claim that they have seen this film four or five times. This means that they have listened to California Dreamin 28 times or 35 times. if the story had any way involved. <br /> <br /> But not. The only way I liked it was Bridgette Lin's payment around and still playing for Asia not getting in rain and sun rain. Even this is fast fast. I am sure this unsuitable title of the film will convince many poor recipients to go and see it. I can only warn you - if you have never seen a HK movie before, start with this. If you feel forced to watch it, try at all costs to see on the movie. Moving links and links are useful tools to live here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
