I have seen and loved the original film, and is expected to be more due to remake than this. <br /> <br /> Good: Effects and makeup are beautiful. There are no complaints about symbols and pictures, they are appropriate, and the performances were the same (Tim Roth was the best, other officials were better, and a few of the "helpers" did very well with very few tasks). Action events were exciting and fun. BAD: Escape from the ape city was terrible. The characters are going to the circles, then suddenly somewhere in the center of the city there is an escape route. In addition, what is the most avoiding way of walking through the bedroom of everyone? The story was set down to insert as many steps as possible. I like practical events but the original film had more meat and it deserves more respect. Finally, the end was quite nonsensical as presented. Without seeing the inevitable monitoring, there is no right to it. <br /> <br />
