This movie is one of my list of movies that don't bother. He saw 40 years ago as a young man, stayed at the end of doing so, was very angry to see that it was about romance of 95%, 4% everything else, 1% history like that. What is called bait and change the film, one with an interesting head, a real movie is a scandal. This is a matter that deserves good cinema treatment, this film is close to insults to those who have served. The real members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not under the law and they were not the abusers of abusive houses, they were in reality wanting to do something to help France. And I think most of them came from a higher history than the behavior of the Hunter Hunter. A flying school is not a smart alecks and it all knows, someone like the one shown here could not live two days, would either stop or babies. The punishment in the French Army was often very strict. In short, another Hollywierd version of the historical section that deserves proper treatment.
