"Bat people" is a very bad film that deserves MST3K treatment as well as the other "Creeping Terrorism". In it, we're in some kind of mountainous area full of bats. We see a lot of things happening, if rats come out and attack with things, a car car, it fails in the emergency room, and much more! All this, with the preference of the 1970s (hey, consider "Mitchell" here!), And make "People's Bat" is really one of the best of "The Secret of Science Theater 3000" made in the series! Attitude, it's bad. It should be avoided as a blow, except Tom Servo and Crow look at you. <br /> <br /> "People's Bat" - more like "Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!
