Pathetic is a word. Acting evil, a pathetic script, cheezy dialog and hip hop music & fashion ... hell was up with that? The guide to this movie works as bad as the film he did. If a person could take time and effort to reconstruct one thing, it could have an opportunity. Bet studio still tries to figure out how it can pull too high. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... The Asian chick was not so bad neither. These gals also carry the entire movie. If it is not for them I would like to destroy my copy of this film. If any of those who haven't seen this yet have an idea, don't waste your time ... you'll just hear later.
