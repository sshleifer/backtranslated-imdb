This was terrible. It started very well but as it continued to lose every opportunity to increase, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's work is awesome, it never seems to mean what she says, or even know what she says until she says. He had no real feeling, not for his beloved goy, or the story of his mother. While being with Lena appeared to have a professional interest in Lena's story. It has never been found true between Lena and her mother unless her mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The expected characteristics of Hannah's "mixture" of love and the relationship of her mother and father was as clich√© as they come, and failed miserably however. The wedding was not quite complete and was dumb. The demonstration period was not strong, and no matter what Lena did or did not influence her outcomes, of course she would show the difficulty of feeling at that time, looking for haunted, uncertain ambitions. In fact, there are no characters in the film with deep or spark. It was very difficult to care about any of them, even Ruth little. Everything with Luis was a barrier. (Why did he tell her when she was on the phone from a hotel? There was no context or explain anything to it.) If every reference was removed it was not recognized. A simple story made a mixture and a good development of character (who was his mother, again?) Who works weak, and leads that everyone seemed like they did. You can almost hear "quiet on the set!" "I began to think that this was fair to 7, but if the film decreased on it dropped to 4, then received 3 after the silliness of the wedding area. This was on a movie as cold and reproducing as I saw. good.
