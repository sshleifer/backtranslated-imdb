Well, I didn't have a great expectation but this film was going down deep that I can't imagine. <br /> <br /> The plan, as it is, involves a 2-member priest of the secret command to investigate the death of the founder of the order and the Singer. Eating Sin enables Catholics to save salvation outside the Church's mandate and is still an endless film in the film and loads of ennui. Do not let this mean that since the Baptist will give you salvation .... we will continue. <br /> <br /> I'll keep the w / o to give away: the priest will go to Rome with his friend to investogate. He brings with him a psychiatric patient (I do not do so) who burned him during excorism and who loves him (not one lick of this BTW is defined), an Irish priest broken by Peter Weller as a cardinal. Arrive at Rome, they find the worried children who do nothing in the film, to meet the S&M prison to fight the shark that the Ukrainian boy who was aware knows (not told) and who gives information to kill people (oh, BTW, he The bad guy so has the sound of the industrial / techno) and then ... umm, seriously, I don't know. The preparation of the plot about. Heath tend to Eat Eater, jumps to New York and Eat Sin for overnighter and then other things happen and then (all off the camera) to fight the sharks and the film ends. One hour in a single film appears exactly when something happens. Finally something happened but you can't be sure that it is important and since most of this game takes place before the move or leave you hear you actually feel.
