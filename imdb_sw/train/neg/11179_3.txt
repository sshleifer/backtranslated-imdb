As we all like Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. The advertising scandal at the end of the grubby of what appears to be a merit and deserved work has been seen as a bed of unmade and accusing everyone with a deep sense of south. it comes out in this way and with a lot of endless destruction that the mind causes (and then repeats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, not doing much. Its events with Pacino are flat and does not know. Hard to believe they had many meanings for each other. There is no power there. Leone's tea, on the other hand, reveals the screen. He was electrified by his events and Pacino were very interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from shame.
