This was one of the worst films I ever saw. I often pronounce any film for a certain aspect of its production, but the most offensive behavior of more than half of the characters has made it difficult for me to understand any part of this film. Many was the explanation that the bloke that he built the building was the fault of the gun break. Er ok. <br /> <br /> Also, try to fly the style of baharlom slalom is not working. Run 10 feet in some trees is not working. Woe is here. As described before the dumb of the senseless and the ignorance of certain characters is ridiculous. In a closed space, a four-year-old oxygen can tell you to start the fire is not a good idea. However, around 5 minutes of the movie emerges and thanks. However, if you have an intelligent inquiry you will also find the most difficult of this film to endure. It is wrong that most of the quality stories have not been generated yet someone will pay for such things to be made. Oh, have I mentioned the last five minutes? Well give you a hook you have to keep so that you will see soon in the design of avalanche. It is completely useless.
