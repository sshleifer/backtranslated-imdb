First of all, what is good on the film? Another good player? exotic background? The fact that participants do not laugh when they act (I would like to be in their situation)? I don't know. A short story is simple: a Catholic priest who makes an artificial painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his younger brother, male (male priest when he was younger ...). I'm afraid nothing here to learn or allow to think a little about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst part of the worst season of "profiler" (ceremony) and actors rather than untrustworthy partners (uncle is a police who, a girl who lives in another victim's house may have a child and a priest, etc., and so on).
