I had the opportunity to explore this film as a member of the test audience, and the only thing that put me on my seat was the opportunity to fill up the post-investigation inquiry. I felt the biggest problem of the film was the lack of a great plot. Instead, it included (also) small-scale contests for screen time. As a result, no one character has been developed enough for the audience to create any kind of attachment. What the director and producer could not do is show us why we should take care of what happens to the characters. Certainly any small plot and characters linked to it can be eliminated completely without serious consequences for the film. (The time available could allow for a major development of the remaining plots and characters.) Just set, the Plate of the Hunger of the Bachelors Club is the largest and the side dish and appetizers while the middle medium is desired.
