This film lets you identify the invention of the fast button on your remote control. It's a good boredom in beautiful pictures. At once Hamilton goes easy on interesting shots. However, what I found hard to take about the film is that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when she was shot the girls are shown as younger than they actually. This whole thing of Lolita especially if there is an old man concerned is leaving me rather surprising. Heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area to make him look younger than he. Come, sex is a good old age - among adults who agree. Another thing I found is common is that Beart nor Schüte have no nude area in the film, well, not at least right.
