So far, the worst movies I saw was Ben & Arthur. In fact you should check the check for the movie instead of this. The review of this film has been positive for the push without interrupting and uncomfortable with some people involved in making it, evidence that is easy to open online. At least people who did Ben & Arthur were respectable enough to stop him from standing on his shaky feet, rather than promoting without promoting so fighters as I would buy. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad, script, story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else goes into the film? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it gets. If it wasn't too bad it would be a concern. I kept looking to think it should be better, because I had not discovered that there was no good opinion so it was believed. <br /> <br /> Not worth much money to make a good movie, nor a low budget does not mean that the movie should be bad. My proposed model of the basket of the budget is amazing for Van Van Sant Mala Noche, but there are many others. Secrets of Sideline? Cut Director or Background? Not bad because people who made it had no money, but because they had gostic egos and no talent for anything but self.
