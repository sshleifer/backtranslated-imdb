I am a great fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this film. Haim, now dry drug abuse of children of 80 years is bland as usual, and comment on the back from small characters / actors without meaning; they don't need to say that they were all very average. It is a good movie as a low-recorded trip in the 80's - with beautiful clothes, some nice shots to the Colorado and no sense of sense of numbing plot. Please don 't waste your time looking at this unless you like 80 movies, Corey Haim, or like me, like Porsches of the old school (this seems very suited) because life is too short to watch the worst movies.
