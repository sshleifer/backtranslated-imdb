The normal rate of 70s of Italian films, original music and good, but for some quirks, interesting but not interesting pictures, poor and sometimes the story of confusion (for example the role of wolves, and where does this boy come? ) and poor conversation, much beauty. The reason is still (the amount) known and translated may be nude events (including the size of the 70s pseudo-coitus) involving a girl aged 11 and 13 and a young boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from the social and political perspective to see how these youthful representations are very common and common in the whole Europe and the US 30 years ago, while it is now more taboo. The story involves the bullying of a single girl (Laura) and two other characters, with her sexual discovery, the most accurate representation of young life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not change to the end of the film and already looks very much in contemporary art - no "come to age" for her: she is a very young girl who already knows her sexuality, but eventually used to finish the film it sounds like a little girl she is still. The boy is quite abusive, while Laura comes as a very vulnerable and weak.
