This Hitchcock movie is similar to its later suspended films and looks more like an old moral story. Young couples get an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend money to travel around the world and live a very hedonistic life. However, over time the excitement begins to discourage the lost and useless in its existence. However, no matter where, during a prestigious journey, the ship dries and loses everything - and ends up happily at the end because now they enjoy life! What an unfamiliar, false and preaching film! Of course, I would like to inherit all these money and know if I am happy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are poor compared to future production - bad films and non-sound quality and instead of amateur acting.
