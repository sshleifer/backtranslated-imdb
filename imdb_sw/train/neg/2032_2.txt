I awarded these two stars with an amazing explosion of the DV shot, which gives a cool and dark credit for its character. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This film fails in all accounts. I can't recommend this, since it is not a poetic, nor is it the same. Neither is it wonderful, nor do they accept it. Do not worry, nor are they common. It is just a piece of trash that no fan or striker uses can recommend for good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this, whatever you are. . Please, leave off with this bad product. Thank you.
