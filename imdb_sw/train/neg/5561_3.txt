I saw this film under the title "Closed". I generally enjoyed Dolph's movies, so I gave this test. Not worthy. I have read some of the previous comments on the audience trying to box. Don't show it. This is a bad film for the best. Acting does not exist. The plan, what a little one, is predictable. Movies in places seem to be cut off together. This is a clear view of the place. There is not even the value of rental price at low cost at night. As a bit of a Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him working. At the end of the film, you will continue to wait. Better avoid this film, and use your time to watch next to anything else.
