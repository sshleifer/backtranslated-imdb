Right now two weeks of "One of the Beauty" I am a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are good, as long as we are but just a game. <br /> <br /> I don't know how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is a "source" coverage of "Thatcher" years - it's the same as a game, but I see a winning award book is still better. I wonder if the BBC will take us to follow up with the next game of games and the following years and "Things can only get better" to finish with 2006 and the Truth that we are still waiting for! and the promise from the Government full of sleaze.
