Except for Brady Type, this was some hokiest television I saw on time. The behavior of video production was not very bad, but the look and feel in general was in the early 80s. And Marie Osmond looked like she fought with Lady Avon. WAYEERINE very. It was a shame to look at former defenders Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid to participate in this. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talking about the Pavillion Africa in the World Showcase which would open up 'in almost a year.' Like this writing is 17 years later and still open yet (Unless you count the Kingdom of Disney Animals.) However, because of all limitations, this is still an interesting piece of Disney history.
