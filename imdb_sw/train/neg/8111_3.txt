Another good movie with Costa-Gavras. It is a great witness to the situation in South America and the US participation in South American politics. The truth may or may not be correct but it is the fact that the United States was very involved in the beatings and support of the South American dictatorship. Even though this spirit of the movie follows the usual left / communist propaganda during the winter war. Kosta-Gavras is a famous Communist artist and all his movies are proposed. For example, he shows US actions as bad and wrong, while representing Tupamaros's activities as something positive. It is a blessing to Uruguay and all parts of South America that America are involved. Europe is filled with poor eastern east Europe. I have never heard of poor Uruguaya or Chile girls who are busy themselves because it occurs in many Eastern European countries. The United States was fighting a godless war to bless us all the monster of the Soviet Communist failed. It is unfortunate that the United States did what it did in South America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not a moral world like Kosta-Gavras and Matamoros as believe. It had Matamoros coming to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in South America. <br /> <br /> All in this movie all follows the ideology of the corruption and left of the past and tries to adopt as idealistic and ethical.
