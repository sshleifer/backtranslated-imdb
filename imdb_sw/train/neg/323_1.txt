This movie was so bad I couldn't sit without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was very tired and with a film about a player to stand up, I could not remember one dragon or a beautiful line that requires details. Politicians who do not have charisma talk to the technical journal can not be less than entertainment. Is there no quality control in the film? Watching girls in bikinis there was only disruption during this terrible experience. It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has been famous and seen in good comedies could survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny at least in this movie so it proves that writing is important in the comedy efficiently.
