Every new show of collapse of the line deserves, at least, my policy "3 and you're out". I give the opportunity to comedy 3 to make me laugh, that is, 3 episodes complete. After Session 1, I actually had spoken to the TV, "It's unlocked tomorrow". It was bad. Now I look at the first 4 events of "Cavemen" and I haven't managed to manage even smirk. Not titter, guffaw, chortle, as a matter of fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by looking at every part of the future because I am sure I miss something in this show. I just do not "get" that, but I believe that the comedy on a large network of TV in the prime time, just be funny; but no laugh from me. There is no only way the ABC would put on the smallest funniest comedy at all at 8:00 am. I KNOW there must be an inner joke that is not only with my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, I "get" the social aspect, but, JOKES JOKES? I will continue to harass for at least 30 minutes a week, even when I have a light and I will scream to the "Eureka" head.
