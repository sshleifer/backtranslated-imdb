The author Robert Taylor (like Terry) is "dizzy, happy-happy" and can't see directly on the otherworldly Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "He makes the sun shine, even when it falls," Mr. Taylor explains. But, Mr. Taylor gets a nose in his throat whenever he approaches Mrs Shearer. Finally, in the freelants of Shell Palm Palm caster, Taylor declares "I love you!" Shearer dismisses, as he is concerned with George Sanders (like Tony). However, to deal with gambling debt, Shearer asks Taylor to be a "Card Card Card", to make Mr. Sanders look jealous. This title of the film welcomes the third and clear wording: "Movie Card". It is more important as the final appearance of the film by Shearer, one of the largest stars in the world "She is beaten" (1924, playing another Consuelo) and "Women" (1939). In order to be fair, this is probably the kind of film Shearer MGM believed the audience wanted to see. However, that part is not recommended. <br /> <br /> Drawn by force, Taylor and Shearer were the best in "Escape" (1940). If the Shearer was going on, she could be a better actress than "the leading lady"; apparently, he was no longer interested, and certainly did not need money. Taylor has a great place, reading Christina Rossetti's "When I Die, My Beloved" and threatening to fly from the Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. **** Card Card (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
