After seeing and favoring the Post Office (yes, I liked the Post Office), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and pick up the seeds because I missed you in a local DVD store and should be one of the best films. When the 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and it seemed to be the beginning of an unusual psychological thriller, it soon came down from there and eventually became one of the most common common films has witnessed so far, including a large amount of conspiracy holes, emotional emotional responses and a small statement. It seems like Boll struggled to come up with a good plot but after a while he stopped on it. Maybe she should be connected to the comedy? A few good things about this film are that they can create a common sense, that special effects are better than I expected and the sound of the sound goes well with the general condition, but the unequal speed of this film with natural nature makes him half an hour changed completely to stimulate the look, which destroyed my experience completely. There are amazing pictures very well, but they seem to be there for a special shock. And let's not forget the work of a camera that was very good at other times. I hope Uwe Boll will have one day to learn what makes a good film, because among the most awesome films it seems to have a decent film every time and then. Seed is not just one of those.
