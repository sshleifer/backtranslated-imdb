Well well. As well as the John Carpenter season 1 entry into the "Masters of Horror" was, this is the complete opposite. Indeed he showed that he was still a master of fear and "Burns Burns" but "Pro-Life" is perhaps worse than I have seen from him. It's stupid, without quite a horrible situation and tension and approaching is welcome, in spite of the time-hour time. Script is false, characters are angry and unacceptable and the conclusion is more amazing. And for those revelers who bought a DVD (one of them is me); Have you seen how Carpenter describes the film? He really boasts and talks about him as his best job for a long time, and honors the script. And in the commentary, where he recognizes a clear shadow that has made the last rejection, he says he did not have the necessary sense to fix the mistake and only allows to exist. I'm afraid of the old master who completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I have found it wrong. I want to leave the good news and mention that the effects of creation are amazing, though. Speaking technical, this film is a high sand, and highly efficient lighting systems and making effects.
