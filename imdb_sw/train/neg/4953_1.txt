I've never commented on the IMD before, but I feel I must after watching the animation of Batman. Its trash! Warner Brothers had a full series of animation in Batman in the early 90s so what does hell try to combine with the winning form? I feel like writing a complaint to the WB. The original animation was dark and appropriate, just as Batman had to be. WB had to destroy this with several future Batman. Now they produce this drivel. Joker is not recommended away from the Joker from the DC Community. DC should accuse him. I encourage everyone who agrees with me to write an email or write to WB and use the power of people to return to the original formula.
