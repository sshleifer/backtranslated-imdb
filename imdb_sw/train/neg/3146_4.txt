The author of the book, with the same head, should not allow his name to be used for this film. if you have read the book, this movie takes the interpretation of the freedom of real events in the book and its spirit that the movie and the book seem to have little in common except the title and other advanced details. The film does not add anything, to the issue of artistic qualification, for the success of this book itself. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only that the plot moves faster, does not give anything more while going slowly (like character development, for example). Other viewers may be interested in some of the pictures of lesbians later on the movie, but you can also look at the specific time to show the things they show in it and isabelle - its right tame and not just think.
