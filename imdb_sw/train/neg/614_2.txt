I'm looking at this at the Sci-Fi center right now. It's so terrible I can't stop watching! I am a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this film. Some camera functions are good. Many are very worried. There are few good actors in the flick. The bad are surrounded by what is the relative of the director. That's the only way they could be in the film! Music was better than acting. If you are about to expect this I hope it is because there was any option! Good river (yes good) is coming now .... I think I will decrease! Jason
