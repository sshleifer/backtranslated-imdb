About 15 minutes, my wife was ready to leave. Not much because of the material, but its lack. They decided to fill the buttons where interesting things should have many languages ​​and common discussions as they could. When this would stop (not very much), we would sit back and watch (not laugh, think) and we would go back to the second (s) remark or to reject. After 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we can read said how great this was. The trailer looks good with Roger Ebert actually called it "mind" and said it was not a sex comedy free. Did you go to the right movie? With Being Cool, it's just the only movie that I've ever gone out ... and I don't know. I am sick to try to go see comedies in America.
