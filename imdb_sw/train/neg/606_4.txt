The possibility was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'No, this is interesting' several times. But somehow the rhythmic lines of the funeral are harmless or ignored, if it never happened. The leading behavior was irritating during the movie, and when one of me and I both shouted that we wanted to die. There are some awful / horrible moments, but these are the biggest shadows and times that have accused the spirit out of me. It is one of the awesome movies that grow and attract you for a while, but eventually it leaves you confused and a little confused about what filmmakers are trying to achieve. One thing to save this movie is a bad person, but when baddie is better than a leadership character you know you're on a loser.
