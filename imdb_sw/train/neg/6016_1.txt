This film released directly on the video should carry a warning label that is dangerous to human health and may be subject to the viewer for the terminal problem. It is still another good cover, announcing the movie "rapture" and good people (believers) suddenly disappear and the bad (non-believers) left behind. It is a fascinating concept, especially because we see it occurring in an airplane that has been found by an unbeliever who has sin and courage inside (no need to say that a sinner cannot disappear!). Sadly, all non-believers travelers, the plane did not fall or the movies would be sympathetic. Although this may be surprising without the spread of a great religion, generally the movie's plodding makes a single gag, acting is awesome and simulations produced by the computer is a very fake look. Plus is still another picture of a film in Canada which is likely to be New York City. Give me ... I'll just read the Bible.
