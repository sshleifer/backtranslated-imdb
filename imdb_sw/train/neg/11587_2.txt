This is like a movie 6. The movie is very bad. It does not provide anything in the death department. One Liner is bad and is something that should not be on the movie NOES. Freddy comes as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this precious time. The characters are very poor. All for better than 6, but it's still the worst movies of the series. My 2/10 rating
