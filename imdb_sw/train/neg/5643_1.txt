I have 2 home entertainment and I have seen many bad movies in my time but this was too bad to force me to register here and comment on it. Was it so bad? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved Oscar for its performance in Godfather III compared to the Colagrande Giada in this film. It was robotic and not updated. Her boyfriend died a month before he arrived at the 'Ball House' he gave her. Once there, he finds that he has hated him in his relationship but none of them seems to register with him. One day, he begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) a home guardian. Even though she was married to David on the screen, her events with her were cool and unusual. If there was a plot, I missed it. Even Willem Dafoe could save this movie from the amateur, the cinema fall of the train which is.
