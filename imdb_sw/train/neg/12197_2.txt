Animal War is a show that is over-hyped, overpraised and overrated. Let's meet the characters of this awesome show which designers should be on the acid trying to make a show like this. Cheetor- To a large extent, they need to have censor bars on this person. What? How do you not know outside the audience they have the same sound as a child Taz? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is displayed by Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want a line of show that you run, get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron- A show that you must go under the toilet. Beautiful creators (Sarasm) Show-lost & slack (at least Super Mario games are best) This show had many sayin 'followers bringing back, but I believe it has been deleted for its own good.
