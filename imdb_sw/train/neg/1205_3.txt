What is this? A Canada produced a zombie flick that I had never heard of before. The vendor works on the body of a young man who recently died. This allows an extended flashback which shows how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to the grave on Friday 13th and raised the dead to his silly thanks. Cut back morgue where our dead body returns to life and kills a moral professional and owner (who reduces his eyes). WTF last? The shot has the owner of a funeral home in a straight jacket and shout, "I'm not mad!" Amazingly, he has his back eyes. <br /> <br /> Walk for 58 minutes, this is definitely direct in the zombie movie. It feels a long time, but give me some sort of vision where I couldn't stop watching. The film also has one of those "if you see this picture, off the screen". An example of an old sick person in the theater (prophecy?) And when he comes (just twice) blood begins to circulate. These events are good for a while. There is a great gaffe where the zombie takes away the right hand of the girl and the shovel, but - while pushing a fake hand on the hitting shape - it's left hand.
