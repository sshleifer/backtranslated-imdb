Why is Colin Firth in this unpopular film? What? Has he really been beaten with money? <br /> <br /> An unknown film about what it wants to be on, sad?, foreign places?, ghosts?, car for Mr Darcy? It is a dirt of clay, clay. There seems to be some kind of idea that Italy must be good, itself, and that Italy has something to offer as a language - but the end of the girls just want to return to the country of who. <br /> <br /> There are trivial events on the beach, in churches, on many roads - but what is, or why one should care only unknown. There was also a yank woman in the film. It did not define what the job was, but it seemed just to be there making ash, improper and maudlin views for a girl. Was it necessary to be on the paedophillia? <br /> <br /> A terrible chaos, all for all. I paid 2 instead of 1 because it does not charm the suddenly a film.
