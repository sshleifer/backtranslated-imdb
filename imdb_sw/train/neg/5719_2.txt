This movie is as much as a hostel of movies, except for * Acting BAD * and not a lot of trouble. The year things are, but you feel anything for the characters, and violence is not very effective. A certain part is just amazing ... like forcing snakes under a certain throat. What is it with that? What? That should be terrible or bad? It's just kind of stupid. For suffering, there is really no (except the guy getting blow-torched at the beginning, which don't show any). The worst person keeps saying "make them slow", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. All deaths are fast. Yes, I looked at the "irrelevant" version. So, in general, it's not the worst movie I ever seen, but it's not good either. You can't miss anything flying this.
