I had no experience with American television stations, when I came out of this on my wife's cable, first I thought it was just a film under the film's film, then after a few minutes I started thinking it could be clever satire on the worst of a Christian the base, and then it started to me - a good sad, these people are bad! It has been a time since I saw anything so optional. I was worried about writing this review for fear of hurting believers, but then I saw other ideas and ideas, hey, they could use it. Conundrum bad philosophy: how does the film reject movies without showing real criticism? Answer: do so in a way that only people will be grateful for people who hate the kind of movies you are criticizing. I think some independence (when you spit it!) You may be worried by the movie artists for those listeners who are uncomfortable with J **** C ***** story, but I don't mind - it was so darn funny !
