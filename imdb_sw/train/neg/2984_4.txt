I agree that most of this film was not strong, but I was still accepted. It has a good sense of enough energy, on the usual music, and women in the film defensively, no prissi here. I can reflect on some films that were worse, at least this had an exciting system with some social definitions. They all describe how terrorists are involved with viral diseases, destroying everything in sight, even if it means people must be safe. Also, the law of military risk may be since then democracy will cease to exist. Fulci appeared to try to combine his original work (zombie, more, hell doors) with some effort to improve in some way. He failed, but certainly not sad, as the population would think. I have a soft spot for zombie films, so I admit that I am a preference when it comes through them. (I can run with their best) mattei took over) it would be better and more targeting. I'm going to stay in my collection if the fulci of the zombie swan song. see you will be amazed.
