If you have read the book - don't put your hopes up, if you're not going to read, and never look at the movie. It was amazing to learn that Toby Young was really involved in writing the script (as he claims himself in the script post book). Because the film is very different from the book. What this film seems to have to take - a piece of thought and entertainment that incorporates philosophical and fearsome thinking and making it so that everyone would like to understand - it succeeds with perfection. The film is full of cheap and cheap cheap for sitcoms, and has lost any relevant message you could have. <br /> <br /> You're the best you don't see.
