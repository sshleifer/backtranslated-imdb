Despite being a movie of 2001, the trend is a type of style of the 90-style house that seemed to be "old" and out of date a few years ago. Reduced cheesy and effects were painful to watch. The script is a great honor, and a few events made a kind of beat me (as when a taxi driver brings him to a bridge at night). But the story of the story and the investigator who was killed himself and how he was involved in suicide was just terrible. The performance with the actress who plays with Selma Blair's boyfriend is very bad. I sat all the way, though, which is typical for random type, what-is this movie just get on TV and decide to look.
