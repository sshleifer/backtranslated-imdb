Just because I found Dalmatian 101 is his selection for the original song and design of clothes for Oscars. I must admit that I was under the impression of this film. In this line, Cruella DeVil (through Glen Close removes this role very well) is given from hospitals due to its good behavior. He loves all kinds of animals and locks all of them. Since then, we only wait until he gets problems. Recently, he does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for himself and from fine Dalmatian's fine. Apart from Glen Close, I have seen it all thrown completely but from the eye of a funny baby. That's enough if its market target is, I think, children under 12. It is a good entertainment for children and family, but it didn't have much for me. * from *****
