That is really a change of god of the novel of Jane Austen. Compared to the US version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written in order to match the possible book. But acting was bad. Apart from Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was a true example of Emma in the book, all other actors tried very much. Mark Strong was not a "gentleman" he had to be. He was often angry, he had no feelings, and in all the film he could not see his love "growing" to Emma at all. This had a negative impact on Kate Beckinsale, who appeared to be trying to "put" her role as leading as her lover. In addition, there was no chemistry between the whole cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, appeared to have no real relationship with Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, he was not found like the heart as shown in the book. Film settings are also very poor. Dress is much more. I would like to imagine Emma Woodhouse wear in a more fashionable and elegant fashion that she does here. The latter is too long. It is good that it resembles the end of the book, but it is a killer living in the film. And again, I can't see the feeling of joy in the face of LordKnightley. In conclusion, I believed this situation to deal with being honest with the book, but with poor actors. It seemed like the film was released without any budget. I would like to see the version of "lighter" by Paltrow and Northam, even if it was clear that it was made "blockbuster", than to watch these actors (except good Olivia Williams and the best Kate Beckinsale) destroy the entire script.
