Kurt Thomas stars like Jonathan Cabot some kind of fans who learn for a special game that involves hunting by a ninjas group, but those with ninjas will not take part, especially since Cabot is a trainer! Taken as a whole gymampire is a movie one of the rough helluva, the worst acting, the script of the evil of God and the infinite conversion to make the quality under the human standards, however this movie is awesome it becomes real, realistic. I mean and talks like "I know I will sleep!" or "Ha!!, through you!" only increase the value of the shock that Gymanki more finds. In addition to (wisely) the movie alone that has a trainer hero who finds things to turn on the time temperature.
