Remember for Horror fans. The only fear here is when the road you just passed 95 minutes of your life on the movie that's so worthless is insulting <br /> <br /> I saw it because: <br /> <br /> Cluster has said a bit promising : Not. It is an excuse to use fragile pieces from other low-budget films that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded good even if the movie turned out to be awesome: It is not. Not so. Distributed amateur makes sure "fallen angels" is about as sexy as average man housing <br /> <br /> name Tom Savini has a long history in the genre genre. He is the king of the lowest budget impact and acting under the budget. Come to think, Savini must be the reason for not watching this film. It's not that bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His role just well was in the sunset to dawn, and he has been curious that in deals fear since <br /> <br /> But do not focus on positive. Forest damned is a great example of how NOT making movies. Other everything is negative. To clear the author is allergic to nature. Script is awesome. That's all given after the first 10 minutes. But clueless pacing; method director treats "conspiracy" and "Character" as the discomfort thinks no one cares about anyway, and driving long and stimulating, walking, and natural processes (of course added to increase the time to make the film worthy of distribution) show a complete lack of the film's capabilities and stories in general. This is another good example of how one number you can know if the movie will be bad: If it is written and guided by one person, depending on the desired.
