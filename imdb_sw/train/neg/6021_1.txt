I can't believe that they could spend $ 17 million on this film. Very bad work, bad scripting and effects that you can do on your average PC, details of the mysterious plot ... The author who can get the courage to work great in the UN? When? Not only, but the message of this film does not really know that you are feeling like they have tried to hit you on the head with a full size of the size. All this movie will make you do the preaching to the singers and make everyone stop losing for the money. If the creators of this film wanted to persuade people for Christianity and to show the true meaning of the truth, they could spend money to help people who really need it. Now, / that could persuade some people to listen to them.
