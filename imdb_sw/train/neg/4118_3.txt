During the termination of the center, we have found this film with its promising security. We were upset in the acting acting, and the story of the formulaic. We got an exciting car crash events, out of the amazing shot, and sets the bottom under the weight of foam and cards. What more hilarious was to see all the recycled scenes from "Dante's Peak", where the front of the church is located on the school bus, the boundaries of the shop leave the main street, falling sharply, and the red car dropping down the road as the bricks fall on it . It was a good cook though it was unlikely, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not previously released as a low budget budget.
