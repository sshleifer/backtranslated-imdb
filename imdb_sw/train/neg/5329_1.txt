As a true fan of Elvis, this film is a total disgrace and script is a catastrophe. The movie opens with a beautiful baby "Stay away" by the Grand Canyon landscape offers the viewer hope of something special. Elvis gets a picture and his talent has been lost for a long time, especially in all known songs. I am sitting through this film twice, to make sure it is a piece of junk !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
