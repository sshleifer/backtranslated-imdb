Whew. What can say about Gymkata which has not been? That's nothing but a halarity fresh from beginning to end. If you want a film that will put you on the floor laughter, this is the perfect movie to find. From the style of Cabot / sweat to Parmistan (and it's four billion ninjas organized), everything about the pictures of this film. <br /> <br /> Guided by Robert Clouse, a bad mind that brought you to the mirror area In Bruce Lee's Death Game, once again shows its complete lack of leading talent. A few more fragments that you know will happen to your happiness as well, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you can't remember or care after the movie will take place. It usually depends on a book called "terrible game," which, if I could get one mark of its existence wherever I would like to read it, to see where this thing is not wrong. Instead, the book seems to be the thought of Gymkata. Probably something to create is to sell his evil idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this with Yakmallah yourself. Easily one of the worst movies I have seen, and it says quite a bit.
