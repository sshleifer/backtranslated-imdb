A friend told me about John Fante the summer after he got in to talk about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was the famous author of Bukowski - a sharp writer like humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask P dust' was the first Fante book I had read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. This book was a piece of text on a little, fearful writer who appeared to himself and the outside world as more confident, an experienced writer who did not know how to write about the real experience of the world he had not. In the protagonist protagonist is a virgin, without knowledge how to win the reputation of women she wants to write on newspapers. The story of his wonderful relationship with Camilla, how he puts up for his first sexual experience and 'wounded' admirer, and how he finally left with nothing but his story of his failure in love is right and true, and no Hollywood The touch ends. The exchange of the film remains true to the book for a while, but people fall into the trap of ongoing love of movies through racism, disease and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is jerk and Camilla is f-ing things, and their love has never never been a real thing, no matter how many they wanted to find it to each other. This film removed the real meaning of the story and changed it to the schlock. I can't believe someone who wrote Chinatown can read this book and make a film on it that has found it.
