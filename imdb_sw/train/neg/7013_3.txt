Unfortunately this film, 54 was an awesome attempt of the true story of 'Studio 54.' The only thing that was good about the image was 'Mike Myers' who was happy to enjoy. 'Neve Cambpell,' although his role was very little unfortunate. The main thing is that this film did not have a good performance from executives, except one and that the conversion of a true story was a desperate attempt for a good screens.
