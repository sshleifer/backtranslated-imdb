I have to finish watching the movie just start, no matter how bad. This movie was bitter to stay. The "spinning" pieces, a journalist and "ninja" as a step, how bad people beat hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to simply defeat the innocent, predictable results and all bad practices were wrong. As a girl who finds a journalist in her friends and goes from "what you do here (with bat)" and "hey, you're good, you want @ # $%!" in 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dogs)!
