I was born into a "Christian" family since birth. I was saved before seeing this film and a series of sequences and I was forced to look at it in my youth group. This movie was very disturbing. I saw when I was 12 years old and in fact I had a dream about it for years. I was lying in bed and listening to the sound of my mother's feet upstairs. If I did not listen to his footsteps, I would hit up to make sure he was not published. I was praying fervently every night for salvation because I was afraid of Jesus to forget me. That is definitely not something I will show my children until they are older, if they are right. It took many years to shake the fear which this movie has given me.
