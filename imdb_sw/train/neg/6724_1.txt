When you choose the film I hope one thing you will consider, are the filmmakers who use their popularity to influence the fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement that is a moral issue that is harmful to society. When a player / actor makes sexual views and racial discrimination about the boy and his father we should ask ourselves (do I want to support this attitude)? In this case Mr. Foxx behaves in a social fabric that teaches our young people right and wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx should remember he is just entertaining and there's a lot of out there we choose. Saying mercy does not stop the hook. It cannot harm damage or eliminate bad habits that spread to our young people. One way to stop this habit is to stop being his fan. They don't see anything that they are part of. We cannot change but we can leave the character we give.
