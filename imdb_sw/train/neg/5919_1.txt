I lost this film yesterday and I can not express my disappointment in Laura Ingalls little by participating in something well produced. I don't know whether it was writing a terrible or a bad lead or both but it describes a very desperate viewer for having lost time to look at this swill. It had a simple story line, very bad lines, and only dependent on good conditions, and good people to sell. Unfortunately this was not enough. It would be better to hire a perfect tape of static than wasting your time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a very good role as a ranch owner who seems to be working very hard, anyone who has ever been near the ranch knows that this was written by a young person from Los Angeles and not a man with a great understanding of the world.
