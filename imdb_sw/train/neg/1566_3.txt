For a fan of the Beatles, the great value in this film is just returning and determining errors, accuracy, merged events, incidents, contagious obstacles, stopping people, time line errors, inappropriate restrictions, incorrect clothing, out of songs and (shy shame) unwanted instruments and other boners that I now think of. Rights come quickly and anger so you will need to be on your fingers. I have not given this "1" especially to the fact that it is photographed in Liverpool and administrators (Rain Rain) to give it all (Lennon's character is reliable and it works fine). Also, the "Right Shade" song you hear at the same time and that counts for SOMO. Therefore, look for fun, but please don't take it as a historical signature.
