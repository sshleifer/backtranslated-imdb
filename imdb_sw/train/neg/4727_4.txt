This film is something of egg curate, good in part. Unlike other critics, I have found that a big mistake and that is the inability to draw the interest of the viewer to the characters and conspiracy. I am sitting because I am attracted by rock'n'roll and band trends, but if I look at it properly on the basis of his reputation as a movie, I would like to give them to the fingers, and a few buttons: Jason Behr is a good part of John Livien, and quite persuasive. as a rock singer; The description of the problem of her childhood is unknown, although we are given ideas in the relationship of Livien well for her parents, but her character is finally wonderful for the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using action to resolve internal conflicts is interesting, although it is not a novel nor fully reflecting as a headline in this film. John Lennon's comments were offensive, but confess that it is not a fan of Beatles. At any rate, Livien and his band reminded me of more than Oasis than Beatles, for there is something that gets on them. Another interesting thing about the film is a way that was opened by some interesting - though middlebrow and secondary high level - philosophical behaviors of leadership, but left the fibers of its thoughts there, just taking it back in the middle of the film, briefly, when Livien says, "in the presence of God, there was a music" (you have ever seen it to be a Maria for the 1990s, "Before time, there was Tia Maria?" it seems the idiotic conclusion, and the observer does not know how she came, but she is sure. Fortunately his bassist and friend, played easily by Dominic Monaghan, seems to accept the illusion of these ideas when he responds "You do not know that". <br /> <br /> For all, limited leadership and plot may go any way up for future projects, in the most insignificant or in a more interesting and more mature way.
