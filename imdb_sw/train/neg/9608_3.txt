Man, hell are the people who made this film? And most importantly where can I get some? The opening part puts the tone on the film: a woman blowing honey in a circle of fire, switching to waswolf. And this is not the Rick Baker 'American switch' change, people. We say some of the worst evil sent to the film here. I can only imagine some Italian stones that propagate Independence Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the main character of the film (is the word?), And ask him to get out of the feathers. The minutes are lost as actors of interesting seekers about Daniela and the situation or something (I can't remember, but the discussion is bad if you laugh it will call). mentally whenever there is someone close (understandable, if she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a wolf as her grandfather (open the area). Daniela when she meets him and loves a buff partner who does not know her "events". See the montage here, one of the cheesiest you see (laughing and embracing after the first diving through the window). Lucky Daniela is not out as the film takes a brutal turn, he is suddenly struck by a broken band of robbers who kills that man. Remembering "I am abducting your grave", Daniela gives blood back to his fighters. It is 100 minutes of my life I will never come back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a geek of the film.
