And I thought Beach was bad, and the difference in which this movie has one of the biggest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not accuse him of a bad script, if a person can make a sense of what hell was the action of the movie, make yourself pat in the background. His cross between the Village and the crappier script. It begins to kinda catch your eye, and then it goes further on the plot, it is not worth it, nor do I ever start about the end! What was it? The only thing that makes this film is Nicolas Cage is usually a great humor, and its ability to be funny in a bad situation. If you are going to blockbuster and this is just a movie to watch, put five bucks back and go back to something and while some of those who ask you why, just say a stupid thing that comes into your mind, and there you go!
