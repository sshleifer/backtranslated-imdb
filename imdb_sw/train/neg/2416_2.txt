2 stars, and I have to be generous. (small vendors) Look, this is a small movie budget budget set in Oakland gangland. If the plot goes, the scientist wants to bring his dead brother after he was killed in the car-by. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: What are the zombies? All "zombies" make it a gun (which is not even heard far away) and causes red blood fake from their mouths! No horrible eyes, no decomposed body, just a group of people blowing pingtically and running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> Insurance also loses. There are only 6 applications in the entire film, therefore not like the "hood" whole facing the zombies or anything, only a few, and is not available at any time. <br /> <br /> Acting really bad is hilarious. No one can act in this film (except one of the members of the group) and it looks like a group of friends gathered together, has decided to throw their families, and make one film at the weekend. Remember the last: Since the time doctors are wearing abbreviations! Skip this, please!
