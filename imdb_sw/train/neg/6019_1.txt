This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. Acting is bad, even what some people here are thankful for, Carpathia's behavior! Script looks like it's written quickly. In one place, a black preacher left behind, when asked by Buck what "dan7" on the graphic of the computer, means, "Daniel 7, * Chapter * 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers lacked this entry. Perhaps the worst part is that the position of the modern film is uncertain. Although many Christians have emphasized the translation of the events of the end-time events, the interpretation, in my opinion, is an error. In order to understand these errors, read "Christians Will Go through the Pain" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, the Second and Secondary Bible Study" by George E. Ladd.
