Amateur, no budget films can be amazing good ... this however is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. Acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows the promise. The direction of the camera you need a great reworking. And there is no longer “hold camera and run” gimmicks either; it doesn't just work. Specific effects have not been considered, there is a problem when the effect can be identified at real time. If you take off your ear, please do not let us see the real act of the actress under the blood. Good conditions are bland and boring (such as Mr. Sykes another project), and music is cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar-driven steel (see the scenery view). <br /> <br /> Do I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, that mandate was not. Anyone is giving money to this person ... please stand up. I have seen some of his "home movies" (which I do not wear) and also bad. Usually, "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this person. It's one thing to become an amateur actress, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Of course even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on kernels popcorn will be less painful than this quest. Prize: From most of the military push-ups in the film.
