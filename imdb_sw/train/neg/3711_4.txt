I didn't see the trailer of the film when I went to see the film, instead of I put my sentences on a friend's opinion. Now I love Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on his face. <br /> <br /> When the movie movie announced a few jokes of funny, but unfortunately the movie does not miss much in the comedy. The movie seems to want to integrate all the laughter with love in one, and that effort fails. The story of love in the film is straight ahead (for luck), but it strongly prohibits from films to make Rock strong and bland. After all, the movie is the first and the most appropriate to be a comedy, where laughter should be a fundamental thing. It's not much in the film. <br /> <br /> The program is also not common. Some parts were completely destroyed. If the support used was meant to be funny, it certainly did not work well. A couple of angels from heaven tried to make a joke of a few, which was dry and unstable. The first rock rockers were bland also. If there was one thing they did well, though, they made the Rock appear to be funnier in comparison.
