There have been many unknown movies or movies provided bad reviews that I liked. This was not one of them. It was taken to use camera techniques that made it feel like I looked at the soap opera. It was very predictable and it took a lot of films to move and leave you asking "is it?". Once you decided to take the film seriously and look at it from a corny view, it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would have appeared in MST3000 if it was still.
