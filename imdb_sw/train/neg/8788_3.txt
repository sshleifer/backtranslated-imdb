What embarrassing when an interesting and interesting story of the key below will be able to enter your interests at first and then gradually let you go down and continue until you start cutting your head notified when you reach the conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE. It was not the fault of Michael Keaton; it was a pleasure to see him coming back as a star of a new movie movie again, looking at a little wrinkled, but still can give a steady and real performance. As a person whose wife has recently died, he has been busy with his lost soul after a life (not a new idea), it seems to communicate with him through the electronic fuzz business you see on your television screen when nothing announces. The spirit of communicating through airwaves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in them, so I can't make any comments on what I think about it, or they. I would just say that I'm for the suspension of unbelief when it comes to buying a fantastic film like this, but what I can't bear to understand what hell should be amazed, which is about where I was left when the credits finally began to roll. In fact there is a real static. There are regular movies like this that I have been so worried about, but if the film can't make it clear for me, I tend to think that being a film manufacturer, not my own (except I watched it when I couldn't focus on or something. In fact, by GIVING a WHITE I was bright, bright-eyes and eyes-so I think who is complaining?
