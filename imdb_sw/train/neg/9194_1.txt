Ok, first of all, I am a big fan of a movie of a zombie. I loved all of Romero's flicks and enjoy a completely renewed look of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard everyone who was accusing this pride I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated the Resident Evil, and when it may not be a very big film, I enjoyed it if it was not really that it was just a shot of a fun-em zombie and a half-honor plot. This, however, is a fresh crap. Awesome conversation, a minute-minute plot, and video game events are included in the film. Who in their right thought thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the wrong time) I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). When his name throws us out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he is in a very bad film and can also do better. Everyone else does as they do Shakespeare. And very bad I would add. Basically it's just because anyone should see this monstrosity is if you are.) Is a big buff of a zombie and you must see every flick of a zombie or b.) If you play MST3K, a home game. See it with friends and be ready for tons of laugh without unintentional. <br /> <br />
