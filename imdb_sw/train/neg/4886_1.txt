As a result of budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (also played with Priscilla Alden) has been released from a mental institution (although he killed six people) and was taken to Hope Bartholomew's house. Immediately, once again he repeats his criminal ways and kills anyone who gets between him and his food. Does this film welcome! You know you're in trouble when clear features start with just a credit card from the first film, it seems to hide the TV screen. Nick Millard (under his name of fraud Nick Phillips) decided to turn to the world of Ethel Fat Crazy over a decade later and with a budget that is possible to cover the cost of an empty tape and video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that the unique Millard style does not translate properly to the video. Hardly, I have made home movies more valuable than this. And Millard tries to pull NIGHT SILENT, NIGHTLY DEIGHT 2 and padding half-time running with footage from the first film (which looks like it was removed VHS worn out copy). Alden is as good as Ethel but the film is not suitable for you to feel sympathetic to the star in this waste. I mean, at least the first film tried. Here we do not have music effects, and effects (if possible), a shaky camera function, a horrible sound and editing which appears to have been done by two used VCR. Avoid this at all costs!
