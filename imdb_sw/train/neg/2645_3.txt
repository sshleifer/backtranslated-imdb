The last sketch of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire.The script is weak and has been presented negatively. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better to do just a concert for their last integration. There is nothing wrong with their singing, it is nothing else in this turkey that is cooked.
