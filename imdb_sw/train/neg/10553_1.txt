I bought this film for 1 euro, not knowing what it was. I thought "hmmm, a person called mutilation should be like not very funny at least filled with a year". It was not very funny. It was troubling. Very violent. And I don't care about films but this has no meaning except that child abuse is not good. hmmm ... The quality of the image was awesome. Acting ... had no acting. Fcker some of the fcked-up mutilating yourself for more than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this. Not suitable for your time. It's just bad. I would never have bought this. They should put the young man who did this
