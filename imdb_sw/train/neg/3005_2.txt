Main Slaughter is in accordance with your 80 color slasher. Prank comes from hand to stop the boy's geeky savings. A few years later the boy comes out and starts killing people who hurt him. Now the story may seem exciting and very entertaining, but what makes this awesome film compared to all the rest of the 80s flicks is that it has other non-emotional and error errors. Acting is awesome, however, it is not as bad as a person who will be a suspect. Although it is not appropriate that every character in the film is interesting and unlikely. Leader, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is a great torture of all of them easily and he is the one we deserve to share compassion and roots. Of course, the geeky boy is very close to me and I think that even the geeks of the tribe themselves would gently maddened and just plainly adopted and how geeky it, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a good laughter. The lack of Munro's talent of Munro is quite clear, which puts him down to the same level as the rest cast. However, many amusements are easy when the film is trying to insert Munro, who is 30 years old at the time, as a young man among young people. And then when it comes to future life and Munro is playing around his real age, all others are not seen as adults. All this goes well with the theme of the theme which is hilariously pose a heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and shrieking sounds "I'll find you." Since it says, the Great Slavery is not very good, but it has a bad value for it. Maybe it's important for fans of hardcore slasher, but don't expect trouble, doubts, or any trust from him. Horror!
