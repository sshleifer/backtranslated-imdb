Should every good story be "improved" by the added music of Corny Broadway? It seems those who cannot come up with their own plots think that the most common books are just there for stealing. I confess that Oliver Twist and such stories are not my favorites, it is indeed true that Dickens often wrote things that leave them too much, and this was a good example of that only ... In fact, use this great story and add nausea his camp and every character from preparing the boys who have no grandchildren and clapping and raising up suddenly? Argh. Give me sex. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my rating are from the cast, which I could be similar to that of My Righteous Mother. Each of these films had been dubbed that the play version may brag, but then they must find and call them (see the above complaints). Unlike My Lady Fair, those who sing here can really do it and with pity they rescued us the voice of Oliver Reed (forgiveness as I am wrong, it's been time). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint I 've said. Why do you humiliate everyone except a real shame for keeping silly songs to be a good story? This is usually done with good effect. It generally damages the story. It did with this. Jury is still out if this information has value to save, but for everything around it, it is impossible to tell.
