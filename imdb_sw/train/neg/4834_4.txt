I expected a movie of Kathryn Bigelow in anticipation of a great post after the last hype and 6 Oscars which was awarded. Unfortunately it's really not a good movie. The display of the situation seemed to be accurate and reliable for all the calculations, but more than that the story came only if it was not full and the direction of the movie proved to be unknown and unfamiliar. The actors put forth a good effort, but for me I did not really find the film that tried to be. It's not like the sky and inserted as Full Metal Jacket, not as an epic like the Band of Brothers, not like a packed action like ... well, nothing. Of course I can't see why it was so much selected, and why people 'insert it' to these epic numbers. Recall, due to the caliber of the cinema in the last few years I think there is not much to choose.
