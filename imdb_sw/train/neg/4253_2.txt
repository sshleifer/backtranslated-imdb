This must be one of the worst of the cups created by men. What? How can one turn this mesmerizing subject into a less interesting story? Work is not a hard task like that ... First and foremost, the conditio sine qua non of vampirefilm is a dark and black sky with a beautiful sexy touch, this does not have all things. Very light - advertising! oh my god, why in Christ / Jude's name was it? <br /> Every time Dracula came up she was eating with light (in the script to make her weak, with a record: just a weak) There was only one event that made almost look, near the end of the film (beautiful dancingscene and Dracula and her victory new). I enjoyed the first, Judah's problem was natural, but this is not good, not in any way. I hope the third person will recognize the signature of the vampire that I love so much in other books such as Nosferatu's Herzog, Dracula's Coppola or even interview with the vampire.
