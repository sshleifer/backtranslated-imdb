I saw this for two days before the official opening, and I must say that I was very disappointed. And we must put a lot of trouble on the decision to beat Claire Danes in the lead role. According to what you think about Danes, he was very worried, or he is on his head that he should be very popular with Razzie's 2007 for the Bad Executive. I think we should have compassion for him. Rather, he is quite different. Other traders "chiefs" are doing a good job, but certainly do not put the screens on. Of all the "good" actors in this film, I would say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. From it is very difficult to photograph, and only appears to the end. <br /> <br /> Screenplay bad as well. It comes more like they read verses than actually being "in character."
