Wow, I knew this film was bad but not bad. Publishing comments have been installed. Roddy Roddy Piper is a good patient for retirement (cliche!), Helping everyone - exciting as a patient with a laptop after an op-out and lament on his dead child. His restored child returns from the Army "Special Ops" and because "he sees things" - is shown by connecting his teeth if someone says anything about the past. The time to clean the streets from someone who once knew Piper and his dead son (whose bad boy was killed) and his adopted child. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love of love is a beautiful woman who decides no reason that she wants to fly the skeleton of an old Army. This happens in 2 minutes of area 1. <br /> <br /> Action could save this film, but it is worse than the story and act. All has been done before, all has been done better (Ong-Bak is a great example). This is the worst movie I have ever seen - and I have seen Waterworld, twice. Erm, the film is called HONOR (Wrong for Americans) and the line of tag you have "from Bloodsport makers and Kickboxer" - see Director David Worths films and you'll come to find out why they put these two films there , although they have more than 10 years. Elite such as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - says it all true. I will give Â£ 10 if you go to see this film. <br /> <br /> PS - Permission because it doesn't know the names of the character, tells you something yet.
