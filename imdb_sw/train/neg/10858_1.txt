I didn't know if I would laugh or cry for seeing this. The only fans of the dung of the danni dirt can have a taste for this. This should be a terrible movie but there is only dirt in this. The most cool area is a car accident, with real real effects from the best of hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. Look at this just for the worst surveys that can be film ................
