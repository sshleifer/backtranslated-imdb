The year 1955 COBWEB is the whole star derived from the shadow of the shadow of the LILLIAN GISH for the generation of Studio SUSAN STRASBERG. Setting a special psychiatric hospital, what is this film about asking yourself ...... the top game? Doctor and patient relationship? Treatment of treatment therapy? No, who is this advertiser about who can take the hospital clothes! Do you think I give birth? You can't believe your eyes when you look at this unpredictable story to the film! Growth head reduces Dr McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have all hospital patients linked in design, selection and implementation of new clothes. McIver's wife played with marble mouthed GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents in this great job as well. So it works long Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Guided by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if you really did this work in detail for its minutes because of her marriage to worry Jarty GARLAND. Talented artists like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER, and JOHN KERR have lost in this hokey story. What were they thinking about?
