Ten minutes worth of story is mentioned in the best part of two hours. While there is nothing of importance that took place in half the half I had to leave. But, I was optimistic, I stayed. And left with a sense of guilt for having lost time. Working was the same, but the story line is transparent and weak. Script is almost as crippled as it can get, but again, considering a ten-minute plot does not give the whole part of a good conversation.
