It's a bad movie, very bad. <br /> <br /> Well, for real people the real movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life can also be predictable, evil, evil, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say that this film is real. Most common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are punished and cursed, whatever you do will be able to end up with a shot or shot by someone; do not let children play with weapons, may be dangerous; and then there are those going to church, and then they're good, very fine ... Before this, I didn't see that bad movie. That's probably the reason that I've never seen how important to photograph itself is important in the movie. In this one, each of the shooting area was daylight, outside, clear and reduces blue. They don't even care to fix the color of the color. Oh! I have "tested" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is the lowest.
