Many will die so that Eddie may feed this uncontrolled desire which cannot turn off. Soon he can even threaten his father and boyfriend. Eddie Monster must be suspended. The one-on-one flick of a video of fear is experiencing a huge lack of budget, acting, and general talent. Cluster, which looks like a fest-fest-fest, fails to provide even if the flick flicker.
