The last two weeks in the life of the dying woman is told to stimulate. As a damage, the film rotates gently and instead of the point. Mona, the head of the skull, smoker, and drug addiction, does not like Bonnaire should not make it interesting. Although there is a defensive conversation trying to explain why Mona has chosen this sad life, its mobilization is not quite clear.
