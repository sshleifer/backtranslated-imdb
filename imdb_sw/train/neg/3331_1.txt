Dreck about three beautiful women in California who are going to reach a certain festival (or something). All parks are written so that they can spend the night in the old creepy house. Nor do they know that there is a angry host who likes to kill ... Yawn. Decay, without meaning, completely film "fear". Bach and his two friends are good but the movie itself is very bad! Bach and his friends have no executives - their faces are completely empty. The last "revelation" is predictable and there is no blood or cloud to keep you on the way. There are some expectations of female deficiency but not enough to save this. Decay, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
