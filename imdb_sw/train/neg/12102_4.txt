This film is the only version of Bill Maher's religion. There are several interesting moments, and some interesting points, but do not go in as you expect a religious discussion. This is what it thinks is the worst kind of document - Everything is planned ahead of time and in edit it to give you the opinion of the director, rather than letting your own decision. It has been cut off, interrupted and interconnected from pop culture and media to strengthen the point. The respondent does not have the opportunity to end the sentence before the editing. The only people who were given the best opportunity to talk about their ideas are those who say Bill Maher wants to say. Once a person is lost from the gospel according to Maher, they are changed. They are meant to represent the most religious religion. From the evangelical television to the last position of the Jews, for TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously. TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He has chosen more money, more aggressive, and those who have no budget to say no. And when it gets a good man to interrogate, he edges hell from them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are shown as exhibitions. Especially hard is Muslims. During the part of the Muslims, he gives everyone the opportunity to speak before stopping himself, or to edit the pieces with suicide bombs. All Muslims are portrayed as gunmen by means of editing, and none of the respondents are corrected. <br /> ENDING - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY handed out, and when it is interesting, it has not been presented to the right of people who are not very religious. Bill Maher tells himself when the parts of destruction are playing ahead. This gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also says that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the error of the film, it has some nice points, and humor, while very unfair, it's really funny. But know how to get in, it's a special view, the view of Bill Maher, of religion. We don't lose anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some of the best moments, but they are very dedicated to the style of an indirect document.
