Who am I? No, I don't. That is the truth in the video case. <br /> <br /> Plot; short: Beautiful woman stands around. This, for some reason, makes all people kill one another. <br /> <br /> "Get Ariel ... Ariel Where ... You Can't Get Ariel ..." She is right behind you, you idiot .. <br /> <br /> The amount of what can be mentioned above of this Opera little Opera has already been said, looks like. The Corny's most active group of prisoners and the prisoners are coming in after the first appointment of executives has been banned very quickly. Then they are caught in the same way. Each area is announced fifteen minutes earlier. It was probably a drawing of the leaves to see executives who had time to screen more with large pay checks. Alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch looks physically without power and does nothing. Why can't he just sit on the computer instead of provoking "teleporting vampire"? (Actually, it would be more interesting if he was a vampire, or do more than stand next to look at the people, which is all he did. So it's enough to make all people kill one another.) <br /> <br /> This is not clear space . There are more shots than the former western elections, the 1950s of the Rider Simple Rider, the nightclub of the nightclub of the film, even the jog on the beach in the country of fantasy, which no one has a real depth or even makes any sense. The nightclub area is black and white, of course. It worked with the "Wizard of Oz". It doesn't work well, here. Perhaps it is a good thing, such as a few shots shown to space are despised. Probably you will cry at that time, especially when you see that the "marine ship" spinning ", which looks about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is visible to the characters, not because they are prisoners or they have no personality , but because they need very much training to act, except for Billy Dee Williams who looks looking sad and losing, maybe for that in this work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, while watching with friends, will lead to the stability of the "sound" very, especially when the nerd loses his attempt on one-liners liner (including a line about the French-kissing meteor ...? Have I heard that right? Maybe not ...) Real-time girls get "killed", which doesn't mean anything, because they don't really start. Well, the "characters" are not, either, but it's on the move. br>> What kind of funny is that the area that likes the video case is some kind of thing The discovery-mess-thing of the stranger (the green filter was added to it, to give more. ..uh ... green look), which is actually android after he killed and finally does nothing to do with anything more. <br /> <br /> Another odd program noticed. Whenever there is an explosion (at least for my copy of the DVD), everything becomes very pixelated. I don't mean pixelated LITTLE, referring to ONLY blocks about 1/16 size of the screen. Wow.
