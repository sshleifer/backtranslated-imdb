The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" was surprised to be the worst movie that I have seen up to this date. I didn't think it was possible on my bad list of bad b-bongo but this deserves gold. It's not funny. It's bad to do, It's bad to close and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the three girls in it. I really believe that flick has the ability to knock another Danish movie "Stjerner uden hjerner" like the worst Danish movie ever done! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
