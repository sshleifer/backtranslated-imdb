Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger to do a good job of making a statement, this was one of the most horrible experiences I have seen for a while. Logic is thrown out as young 4 young people harass this woman out of the supermarket and then shoot bullets. Yet no one appears. Then, instead of shouting for help or running back to the mall, it leaves and ends in the middle of the trees and boys by following the fire. I can't even describe how evil you see this woman fleeing from the lost 4 pigs, carrying a red tool box, shouting to God to come to help her, and then having sex with one of them after they have killed them with other violence. Please hope, this is bad and little not available too.
