There are just many things caused by this film. Starting, the first minute of the twentieth minute of the film would have been stressed by only five or maybe ten. The whole movie is (compassion) a short time, but this could be done by giving more attention to the lion means (how did he not miss the “Wiz” on that?) And doing his small work closer to the main plot. In short, the script had a seed of good idea, but it needed a bit of reworking. Second, it could be done without unnecessary humor. Origin also had some that would be made without, but at least there was almost afterwards - here, ignoring and running there is plenty. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is very little self-aware. The previous series was very well, such as the first film, but here's the only way, many ways. The Brendan Pastor Fraser was a little higher (and why not mention "new Ursula"?). Other pieces and painter, especially close close to the end, also exceeds a good feeling. <br /> <br /> Fourth, little attention may be given to CGI's work. At first it was difficult to tell him that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for character, of course), but here CGI looked like a big finger. Specific effects especially should tell stories if they are good or bad, and at least they are successful with that calculation, so they are a small problem, but still there. All that said, The performance of Christopher Showerman as George deserves. It is not worth the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher fails only in a specific comparison - even able to give George a detailed depth of personal, which should be a great disadvantage in the Jay Ward-led movie and not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula was surprised that it was better than Leslie Mann in the original. Many other displays were high, not standing in my mind as good or bad.
