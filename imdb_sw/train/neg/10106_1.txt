Well, I'm sure it can be a nation. . . if four of them all stood on the four corners of the earth and the other two stood a few billion times. Man, I am so happy that I have seen this movie on FEAR.net instead of leasing. I am a great fan of George Romero movies and I am sure that if he saw this film, maybe he would throw it when he was laughing too much. I mean, what were the raccoon girls playing like zombies and around like Charlie's leaders? It was also helpful that the musician chose a crappy style to show music at the time when the zombies were going up to their killer, especially where they entered the questionnaire as a furniture shop / police / apartment / flat / whatever room back, and the woman who lived was discussing the shop closed. I couldn't even tell him what the national government was, and the fact that his emphasis showed that many nations did not even help them. Oh well, how can I expect from a film where they throw us into a random fighting area for good reason in the warehouse where it appears the shipping boxes of air around the world. So, for all those who worship the Mystery of Scientific Secret of 3000 or if you like to restore bad movies C (C for Craptastic), then this is your movie. . . or not.
