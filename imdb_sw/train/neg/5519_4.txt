Okay, so the preview on this film just tells you that the little girl is going to live with her grandmother for the summer to eliminate. That's not true! It's about a 17-year-old girl who reveals the secret and is about her mother to believe if she says the truth or not. Being honest, I really enjoyed the idea of ​​this movie. They had a very good plot and a very good theme of love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I was unhappy to enjoy Lindsay Lohan's acting. In fact, this film would be great if they had someone else, perhaps the best actress. Rachel's character (Lohan) is a very sexual person and is a kind of reminder of Lindsay realistic so it takes a lot from the film. I do this, imagine that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this film. The latter is very good (and sad).
