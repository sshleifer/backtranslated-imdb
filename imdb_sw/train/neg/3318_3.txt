Gwyneth Paltrow is very good! This is a good movie for her ... very bad she is completely out of space. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I can't believe it is high and characters are not more than caricatures. It was not easy to be easy in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but I expected more than to see old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I was taking a pardon every time I saw an actor who had not gone through a revolutionary score (several times).
