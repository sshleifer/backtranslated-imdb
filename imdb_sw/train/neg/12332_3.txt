Film looks super on paper. The romantic comedy which a lover of a lover finds on gold derived from fraud should be the gold that produces a gold cross, especially for the cast of this romantic voice. I'm afraid of Lawrence Kasdan only gives his two very string stars even though they go and depend on. Adam Brooks's document may be blame but you would like to expect better from Kevin Kline's Fish called Wanda. Instead of two ping-pong and another with the possibility of burgeoning romance has never been reconciled for the sake of one reason they are in and hitting around around France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno star stars as cop cop and -a-heart and I think the disappointment was a star-and-part. Mind he continued to do Pink Panther Pink (s!) So maybe he was the same with this ... 3/10
