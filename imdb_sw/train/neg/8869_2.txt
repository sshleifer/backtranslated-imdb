With the release of "Farligt förflutth" the Swedish film industry has erased the truth under the rock. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day Stefan's old friend came to the favor to ask him. Stefan is working on a small courier. He should bring a suit full of heroine through Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately things in Germany do not work as planned by Stefan now has a serious problem. It is always good to see a Swedish film that breaks the normal family structure. Unfortunately if people involved in production do not have a clue about how the film should be written, closed or cut the result can only be dangerous. Content can be concluded with: a bad act, odd plot and idiotic conversation. The only perspective on the film is the unsafe sex area, Regina Lund. This takes only a few seconds to stop approxamitly 90 minutes of cleanliness, let's say what it really is, you are decorating.
