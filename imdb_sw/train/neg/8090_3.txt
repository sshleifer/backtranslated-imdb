I am a fan of the work of Miyazaki. I say "part" because many of its films are coming into two categories: brilliant, and interesting. Sadly this film comes in the next category. This movie is experiencing the same basic problems as the latest Miyazaki "Castle's Moving Castle" film. An exciting cluster has been created, but once it has been slightly reduced than behind the unforeseen events that serve to combine the plot instead of explaining it. The third part of this film reveals a post-apocalyptic world-based story, and it really looks like a very interesting story is about revealing. From then on things climb up the hill. The middle part of the film is comprised of eco-propaganda with thin coverings, and the latter is bad for depending on the incredible spirituality that destroys a large number of Japanese animations. Overall the film hears if someone has broken every page from the script before passing it on the animation. What remains is something that looks good (though sadly the version I saw was a copy of the Nth generation, and the bad color - which leads to a common story that Nausicaa shows down at the time of flying), but which is useless and eventually left me confused.
