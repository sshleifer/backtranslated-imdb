as a good director, this movie was exciting to watch and resistance in mind. Shot with a camera under the digital camera probably with a 35mm adapter for DOF. The editor is good to act, sound effects are not higher. I would like to give it 7 to an indie film, but the story is not interesting. It's more on the side of the race, the development of the character than the flick of the fatal. It's not for those who want to get scared, or sit down with just a popcorn to enjoy. <br /> <br> for this film will be good if we were still in 50 years
