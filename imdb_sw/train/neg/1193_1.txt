You know how sometimes you can watch the crappy film with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was more than that. I bought a DVD on the Tower Memory because it was about $ 3.00 and I'd like to hear this was a movie that you can laugh. In fact it is not a pathetic thing. About 30 minutes on the movie, my friends started asking me to turn off. About 45 minutes they asked me. After an hour, we refused to go quickly to the end, so we could see how the dispute was resolved (and because we have been looking at all of Matt Walsh). Hardly, don't watch this film. It is more painful.
