I recently watched the first film of the Giga pig, the Devil's Trials, and I must admit that I have a desire. <br /> <br /> This movie is always included with any list of "elegant" films and maybe I expected more because of the hype. The fact is, I am not the standard. If I were looking to believe the opening text to be true ("I saw this tape ..."), I would be a little bit upset with it, thinking it was real. Even without the benefit of knowing it's not true, I think I would do the job that was not true. In all films, the girl's impact on what is happening to her is not just they should be. He should shout like banshee for pain. The fact that he does not mean that it is definitely not true. I don't want to look at it if it is true but if she could have the most influence in her act, the film would be more troubling. <br /> <br /> And then there are bad events: nothing has affected me at all until the head is on hand. Hot fat, dirt and grass did not bother me. I can't say I am "hard"; just because I couldn't stop my unbelief, because because of the lack of a girl's feelings. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me a little wince but the hammer only supported the hand to watch the ball. And the last area with the eye had a little influence but nothing more. I didn't need to look away and I don't feel cheaper. Maybe it's because the movie is twenty-nine years old, or maybe I've just got it. The fact is, I haven't seen this film all the time. <br /> <br /> It is a kind of thing that you can expect to play on the loop as the installation of modern art and as an exercise to delete characters, stories etc. and just leave the suffering, works at a certain level. As a piece of filtering film, he did not work at me at least. I looked at the Guinea pig and my wife, who is the "only film" that was hit and wondered what the quarrel was about. We should talk about why I watch these films and my reasons are many but include the desire to be affected by the film. He said he did not think any film could have a great influence on him and forced me to do so. I played with him the fireplace from the opposite of the situation and he was really troubled. I do not know I am sure, except that we were all worried about a non-threatening film type than any film so far that makes it disturbing.
