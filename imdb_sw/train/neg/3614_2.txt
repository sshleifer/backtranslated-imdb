Schizophrenic has fled from NYC's psychiatric hospital and soon teachers begin to avoid University of St. Petersburg. Trinity. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) needs to tackle the red skeleton. With a 78-minute race, this cheap slasher is caught up until the person who is resting when the person you are judging is the killer from entering is revealed as such. Director Richard Haines breaks the sweat and some of the loss-n-slash limbs but provides crrue's early 80s maybe he was interested. For all of our anthropologists out there, this was done in New Yawk in the early 80's so that you could explore the culture, beliefs, and practices of the living people from that part. The film does not get a loan to betray "the last girl." You rarely see it. Also, it's always good to see a terrible movie where the priest is a killer. Do you believe the representation, my favorite film industry? Amazingly, this is the phony priest and gets. He still works on the ground ethics though.
