The DVD was a joke, a voice for the first few minutes was awesome and an uncompromising sound with the voice of Segals even even her! Pathetic! When sound synchronization was better than 5 minutes the poor issues, lines and executives should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be. When Segal had a good movie in the early days it was a joke and you should be embarrassed by him and the company it made. If Segal is responsible for this better return to have another party to run the show, because they do not have what talent in this. This film is a complete shame for all involved in its production and shame for all who looked at it. I wished for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask my money back in Block Buster!
