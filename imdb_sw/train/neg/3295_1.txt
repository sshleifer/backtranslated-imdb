... then you would like to watch this film. They are completely destroyed by the column of the show. In the film of the Duke boys are stupid, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is a sinner, Lord Hogg has the ability, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... Only Cooter and Flash is true for original characters. At least Enos is very close. One time they open doors for General Lee - nuff said. The original exhibition may not have been a big television, but it was entertainment and characters made sense. This movie is like Dum & Dumber meets with Simple Life.
