**** WARNING: here's the vendors **** Why do I lose my years quickly run looking garbage like this? This film is a good collection of clich√©s, writing poor, leading more, and then we have never worked yet. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. The hero's fight against the ignorant, corrupt and powerless people. One hive goes, beat all the heroes who somehow can manage out despite going to all kinds of cliffhanger risks. A bad partner who has done the whole thing is supposed to live with her money. The second basin has emerged boldly and an expert expert's experience. The wicked who live in the end also have a heart. The troubled young man falls into the hands of his mother after he is saved by her. Etc., etc., etc., etc.. In fact, there is little reason for warning to vendors. You may be doing a good job if I give you the basic links. At least, I had no more score when I expected what would happen next. Then we did not discuss true errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with the original advertiser that even though there are some typical features of the liberation of the bad movie. you would be hard to find anything in this. I think I gave him 2 out of 10 for some beautiful shots of scenery, but that's it. It has been some time since the film has made a murmur, but this has done.
