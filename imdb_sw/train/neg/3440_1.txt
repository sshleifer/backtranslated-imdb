never look at this film ... it's a huge bunch of sh * te I've come into all my life. and that say something. acting, storyline and pictures were very bad this is FILIA WORK IN WORK! largely even gives you a hit to see if my 99p cost from sainsburys and was made only in 2005? hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera on the corner of the screen .... although if you want to look at it you have to look at "scary shark scene" ... maybe the best piece of acting I have seen in my life ... ha. I mean this is a great waste of 2/2 hours EVER !!
