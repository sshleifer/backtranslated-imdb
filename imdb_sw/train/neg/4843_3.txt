Well, I also heard reading all the breathing reviews and comments about how this film could deserve the Best Oscar Picture so I went to see it today. It's a great disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews you will learn from the U.S. who served in Iraq how it is impossible for the events of this film. They expressed my own thoughts; if the movie played me - a full citizen - I kept thinking about myself, "what does it mean? there is no way that will happen like that." 2) There is very little that happens in the form of conspiracy. The new bombing boy shows the position of the person who was killed (the death that is not clear). The new boy gets adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. That's it! 3) This film is not close to insisting as it said. If you want to wait for one of Bourne movies. If you want to see a movie of the war that is emotionally strong, try to hire Go Tell Spartans, which is about the War of Vietnam, and the star Burt Lancaster (who told me is the only one in the serendipitous supermarket which was a film that had great pride and one that he saw as some of his most beautiful works, and which was still angry was largely ignored after the more-hyped apocalypse Now, or the former WWII black and white sink classic Bismark, which mainly for English Film, is disturbing for an unresponsive heart. Don't miss your time on the Locker Pain.
