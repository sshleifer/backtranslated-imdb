The disinterest story of wonder kills "The Psychic" again and again. Participants and conspiracy are not quite recommended (such as the normal function of Fulci cameras, which is usually the reason for liberation in their films), and any awareness of doubt is not available. It has reached an unbeatable level - at the end, you will not be excited and excited but are suffering with patience (and, like me, maybe you want to dominate sleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance should take place in the best movie. Fulci gorehounds caution - there is not just a very progressive in "The Psychic." <br /> <br /> 3/10
