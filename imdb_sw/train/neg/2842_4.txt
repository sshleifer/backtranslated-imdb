I wonder! Wow, prepare to be beaten away from the mysterious ways of the ninja. Watching when they are running, crawling down (on their backs or abdomen) like an animal, flying in the sky, climbing buildings, hiding and spring from trees, throwing ninja stars, replacing blue mats, disappearing in smoke bombs, make a lot of sounds swoosh and their eagles and blows fast or go on their fingers. What you see! I really could continue on many traditional practices, but I will be here every day. Oh don't forget us even get Chuck Connors stories popping up from time to time, and watching she sends some ninjas with her shotgun easily. What class! What badass! However ultra-cheap 'Sakura Killers' are some stupid, but fun of ninja fun just a fun that fanatics of genre would get anything out of this shonky b-grade debacle. <br /> <br /> The genetic laboratory in America has a very important video stolen by several ninjas. Two Americans are sent to Japan by Colonel (Chuck Connors) to get it. <br /> <br /> Opening feature sets well. Already ready to laugh! Later reduces the speed, but soon after the two main characters learn about the ninja and goes through the train gets the steam head as they break the dress and run after the stolen beta loops that has a very useful formula. This is when the fastest action and aerobic art of marriage comes true. It's not surprising either, or (like text text and daft displays). Final damage to the weather has been done well. To stretch slowly there are two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) looking at the case, sharing brain talks and meeting minor problems. What made me laugh is how ninjas were left and how bold and clever these two were. Were they supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ('The Effect (1989)' works hard with what he has and what it does. He emphasizes the screening activities around Taiwan. Mark is a chintzy layout.
