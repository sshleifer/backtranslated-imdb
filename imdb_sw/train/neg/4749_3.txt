This movie was written very badly and led to sleep for 30 minutes through the movie. Jokes in the movie are corny and although the plot is interesting to certain corners, it is far fetched and in some points - ignorance. If you are 11 years or older you will forget to write on the film and despair, but if you are 10 or less this is a film that will take your attention and be surprised by all the stunts (which I can add are not made) and you wish you were a hero. Giving in this film was not very good, and the music was very misleading because it was like they tried to create tension but it was not really good. At the rate of 1-10 (10 to be the best, 1 is awesome) acting in this film is 4. Brenda's words are talented in comedy, but for this type of movie, in some of the greatest scenes, its acting was laughable . When he made some of his "war" possible, I started laughing loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely describing, for example, the part that his enemy turns into being a villain evil villain, how his voice turns dark and evil, I think it was stupid, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song) teachers they were all his teachers at school having members, which was pretty ridiculous for. So integrating all, a desperate movie, but the same if you're 10 or less.
