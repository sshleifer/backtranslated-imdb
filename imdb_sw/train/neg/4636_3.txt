The "secret" section meant to go back to the rejection of the lurid newspaper of the same name, while the head of fraud was associated with the headline investigation of that day. However, despite the A-grade B-cast film and good ideas of the script, the movie plods for 73 minutes. It is a cheap production for all means. What is needed to stop-setting good productive values ​​is thought, especially from an unsolicited director by Sidney Salkow. The location of the day, for example, would have helped to overcome a series of dreary studios. A stylish assistant like Anthony Mann may have done something with earphones, but Salkow considers it another exercise to pay day. It's not so bad that Brian Keith's basic style doesn't work here, it comes just like wood and lethargic, for the same example of Elisha Cook Jr. it goes up like a drunk of wild eyes. Obviously, Salkow is not the director of the actor. But, it is needed for a small number of subscribers Beverly Garland who takes its responsibility seriously and dedication. Too bad, he did not charge. My advice - skip, unless you are in the ignorant girls who have nothing else but knock whiskeys back in the usual style of 50 dresses.
