I love the last movies. I love B. movies I was hoping I would like this film. I could ignore the poor effects, often the impressionable music, an interesting line. I could ignore the inconsistencies, and the fact that the movie always depends on the deus ex machina is valid, due to it. I could ignore the fact that people who fight hunger and try to achieve world peace are evil. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's very simple and easy. Nothing really happens; almost all events in the film are designed to push the values ​​of the creators of the film to the audience, at a real cost of having a corresponding story, or any kind of charged. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
