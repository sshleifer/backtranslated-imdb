What? You can say "All shock, no plot?" There were many unknown instructions in this film. There was no history of the room except deaths. * WHY was it so bad? What made it that way? Why the "clock" to count? Then, there were unknown things that said; for example we * saw * camera in air air, which he described. But when he climbed up he said, he had no camera. <br /> <br /> What! About the fact that all ghosts were seen "Digital", and the "things left" before the ground to make the noise of the static? Hmmm ... when you put all things * together, it makes the 1408 position look like a high-tech home. Except he did not monitor on that. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electricity does not work in 1408. Well, except for TV ... mobile phone does not exist signal, but the wireless network performs well. How many more can you add? Sorry, but this film was nothing but "shock after shock". It's all done before. Meditate in the mirror. Things just outside the site. Changing painting. Disposal of walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... nothing was not." And, if that room was "bad", why would our main character agree with the death of his daughter, if it had prevented him again there forever? It was not wise. Besides, there was no natural information about the "first book" that he wrote. Just anonymous information about "dad was jerk" and so on. Speaking to the father, what was it and a little about his father? "You will be my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie of HORRIBLE. It was an adrenal phenomenon of 100%, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no past stories, development of behavior, etc. .. All my feelings are that the whole movie was made to "Cheap"; very much use one set with a couple of location, and was nothing but the result of the printed film, cheesy, "appearance-that-before" effects.
