I must admit that I am very disappointed. This version cannot compete completely with the 1995 edition. The reason I looked at was that I was not very happy with the Ciaran of the Carnival like Captain Wentworth and thinking that Rupert Penry-Jones appeared more like Captain I thought when I read the book. And he was too. Unfortunately this is the only quality of film redemption. Others are like un-Austen-like as possible. Miss Elliot can never go through Bath like this. It was not in his character and was not made by the woman of those times. Anne Elliot's book was a woman and had respect. There are other good pain but this was worse. Although there are 3 key variables from the book, they are very unpleasant moments, those who know the book that is still an important part of the book is probably not available or completely changed. Even though this version is not shorter than it is, it feels like everything is running away. Careful attention was taken to establish characters, display their values ​​and purposes. Important events were removed. What? How could they beat the last events in this way? Disasters! And it was too far as beautiful pictures like the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, then don't waste your time with this.
