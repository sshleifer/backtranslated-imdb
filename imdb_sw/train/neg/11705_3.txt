This highly melodrama solution is quite easily the worst film that appears by Ingrid Bergman which I have seen. Even its non-saving screens cannot save this non-stop and beautiful film that is impossible to stay without a broadcast. <br /> <br /> Only for fans of Bergman's grandmother; others are more likely to sleep. I give you a look for "Who Bunduu Beat" instead.
