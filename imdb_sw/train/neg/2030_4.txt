Comments of "eliz7212-1" hit the nail "nail on the head" for this Turkish turkey. But it's hoot to look at William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "the mark on the word drum is important to what Bill does.). This display will be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and does not rate a few stars for one look, or so, see Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" to a new height - like in the role or as himself. But the boy is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls who are in the cubicle areas and books of the game's game, will be very good luck when this turkey is deleted - unless there is a revival of whiskey-go type, and the demand will rise to shapely young women dance in the elevated ponds once again <br /> <br /> I looked at the first candidate, who was annoying, and the real "dumber than" post, "but by chance, they walked away from a mil or so. The second, most intelligent winner, but who will be lucky to get $ 1,000 for Risk!, Got laughter with a card that needs to answer a specific question - which he did not know, and so left with the Zilch. <br /> <br /> This shows the game displays, which gives them, and sometimes awards, large amounts of everyday people, it is obviously affordable, in general, trying the audience's efforts. Even if the army is well compensated, and they give away the six figures in the average period, I think the income versus the cost may be good - since you do not have to throw sitcom where several stars are getting six or seven figures, in part, and large residual deals also. But I testify even the best ones will wear thin before long. This has already reached this point. I think his offering, especially for James Spader, and others on the "Boston Legal" should give us the amount to satisfy Bill Shatner versions of <br /> <br. Again, the highest rating is only correct to see Bill hoot and prance, probably one time; which should be enough.
