Check out one of the worst films of the nineties. The plan is of no value; his loneliness is sweet. What? You really believe a twelve-year-old working as a personal assistant to millionaires who can complete everything in this film, like buying a home for just $ 300. The concept, the only trade-bottom price, will be trusted only by the most impressionable audience. Please, respect your mind and do not look at this bad, horrible film.
