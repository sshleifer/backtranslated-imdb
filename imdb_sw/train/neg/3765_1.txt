I've been attracted to anything about Bigfoot, so when I was looking around the film to rent, this has taken my eye. It was US $ 4.50 I've spent and I want my money to return! Please don't waste your money on this !! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so very boring and I found myself rolling my eyes and I even even look all the way through. I've been given food. Acting was bad, the effects were terrible, everything was so bad and incomplete. It has all been added to a bad movie, sparking with time and money damage. I hope that one day they will make a good film about Sasquatch, but until then, I will need to stay through the cheap duds like this to get a real masterpiece.
