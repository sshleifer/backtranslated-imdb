You know that the feeling of hilarity finds when you look at a movie trying to be hard to be a big piece of movie ideas and it fails to fail? When you can't help but knock out the laugh when the terrible nature of trash that reduced your screens? "The House of the Dead" strives to achieve even the lowest level of the movie. From the beginning to the end "The House of the Dead" will be able to restore feelings if you have just got to find that the cat has placed a well-designed business with your forehead while you sleep. It is clear from the beginning that female actors have been beaten by their identical size (who use shamelessly) when men with their view of the hard "ass". I honestly did not care for any of the characters for any time of the film and I found it really wanting their destruction to keep me from a good hour of suffering. Be Boll must take into account two hours of photography from the real game as a movie. At least we will get better practice? However not all blame can be placed by administrators as it is indeed difficult to produce an attractive film when facing the script of this film. In fact it is the worst part of the film and actually has lines like: "These are zombies, clean and simple" and "No cap'n, we shouldn't go!" It's bad! We know that Zombie movies will never have a stimulating or full-minded idea; for better they are innocent two hours of action, blood and panic. It is not a type of rubbish that comes out of your bin pocket and is playing in the room and reduces your shoes on the milk milk and leather boots. There are no Danish movies that buy films. If we had the same opportunity. <br /> <br /> Last Score: 1/10.
