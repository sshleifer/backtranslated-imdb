This film represents times that were done as before, I think. Which is very sad, because at the lowest level, the 'Vanishing Point' original, it's amazing. I am sure it had no intention, but the nature was in 1970, and released in 1971. The "TRAINING" TRUTH was the end of the era, which ended in the late 1970s. In this remake, all cultural elements have been removed, and have been made more PC in an attempt to reach a broad audience, perhaps. "Cleanliness for your Protection" is a free, and the idea of ​​'acceptance' for the trip was an addiction. I am so happy I looked at it, it made me understand the same nature. The original is the classic worship and gold. This remake is awesome.
