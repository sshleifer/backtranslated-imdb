Well, I would like this year in this film - it's mixing. Anyone who has been to a dentist will know why. The story is not bad, the attitude of Corbin Bersen's behavior makes more sense than many awesome movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen more act, lead, script, etc. but at the end of this day is still a bad movie of fear. So it comes down if you enjoy that kind of thing or not. I tried to look good, but it was exactly, one thing like this film. Just remember if you like to enjoy people being treated by a dentist, then this is the film for you!
