This film is very bad. It drives in the city of 70s / 80s and incorporates it into the school environment. I do not say that the crime of cities was not a problem for most people or that the school is not / is not the problem areas but this bad piece of exploitation takes biscuits. Violence is more than anything considered but in this case it is not a case of social issues but a white, high-class student uses to turn himself into a king of his high schoiol. And of course he knows how to play the system. Does that seem normal. Yes. This turd is a brutal abuse, a very poor job. It is brutal violence that is wearing as a social opinion. This is in the same category as trash as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only thing is that Michael Fox had broken the time when he had to do such things.
