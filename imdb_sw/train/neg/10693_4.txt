Maybe it's dubbing, or maybe it's endless events of people crying, crying or otherwise going on, but I've seen Europa '51 being one of the most advanced films (and so angry) I ever saw. The movie begins promising if it is known, as mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend her time with her damaged son (Sandro Franchina). When the mother and father (Alexander Knox) ​​love their guests at the dinner party, the young man tries to commit suicide, changing the life of a series of events that uses Bergman's time to show compassion for the poor and needy. He was promoted by the editor of the communist newspaper Andrew (Ettore Giannini), soon spending more time and more energy than he does with her husband, who has recently been bound to fake stocks for his problems. Bergman has the responsibility of holiness to hilt, speaking of his role in 1948 as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini performs a wonderful job of lighting and publishing it with the best effect. Unfortunately, the script pays his home for the deception of ham, like Andrea and Mom when they turn to announce Marxist and Christian values. For the last tear-recorded area, I had more filling with these awesome characters. The actual action under Rossellini as he came out of neo-realism and more to accept the historical and mysterious themes of the St Francis of the 1950s.
