Of course, this is one of the worst images I have ever had to pay for money to see - the flick type you opt out of despair at the cinema during the Christmas holidays when you missed the first time for everything good but you are still dead! And that's how I came to see this powerful bomb ... <br /> <br /> In addition to the most beautiful places over three decades I still can smell the scent of the scorching fish. Uncertainty - that the kill whale takes hate against the non-sea - it is laughable. And that's about all, except for the "absolute theme" of love that plays on the end of a non-fiction film. At least Charlotte Rampling is good (in two role roles) but Richard Harris only seeks the environment. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not "Jaws". Compassionately, I have put a lot of mind and when I fight it on the air of the TV it immediately removes you. "Risk, Robinson What!" See t.v. The current business depicts the husband and wife of the whale watching ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it's more than sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never come back.
