This Drummond entry is not in progress. Many of them have their own silliness, postponed wedding, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events occurring in the dark almost as the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol who is a clear suspect who no one looks. She is a guest and a desperate rather, but Drummond and people don't seem to take anything. However, it is a good and beautiful step. I know that Algie should be an example of comic, but as Nigel Bruce in Rathbone Sherlock Holmes plays flicks, he is buffoonish that is hard to imagine anyone to taste or mind being around him. Is there a history behind him that will explain how he and Drummond were partners?
