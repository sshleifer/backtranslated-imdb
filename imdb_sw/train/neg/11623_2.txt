From everything I would like to read on the film, I was glad to support a Christian film. Everything about the movie was done very much. Especially write! Without a well-written movie they have no chance. The author / director said in an interview that he did not want to give away how the title relates to the story. I don't believe, it wasn't a great surprise. I kept waiting for the story of youth / youth to be opened, but it has never done it. As someone who has been divorced, I was very disappointed. This movie would not be a comfort to me when I first experienced the emotional problem that divorce can bring your life as a Christian!
