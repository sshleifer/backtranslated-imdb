Buck's role as Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (the Price is correct) to run the country in the same way he runs his show. But there is much more stuck and overturned through this turkey. Kurt Thomas as a "hero" with the face of a child shows a great skill of acrobatic, but not any talent to act. There are a few spiritual moments (in the village of Crazies, in particular), and some of the martial arts of interesting art. But any movie "Ninja" will give you more entertainment, and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
