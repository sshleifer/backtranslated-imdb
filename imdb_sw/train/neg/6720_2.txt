Now here is a film that if made in Australia would easily comedy. For sad and pleasant, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the player get worse? In fact, especially to have a great job on such an amazing job with a trick that no one in their right mind can take it seriously. Unquestionably they were lonely lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute) ... or is that the cliché piled on the cliché. There is no value in the story that almost looks like a prequel of Gus Van Sant's GERRY ..... and to the head like the SON how are all the leading weight? Well, the author must have soooooo effects that he did not find Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to do himself. It has come out and has not been excluded from the "loveless" theme from the Faded Streisand fridge, we have only a beefcake and a serial level remaining. The fourth important action of this turgid game on gold is very frightening if the film runs like Gerries to stop and stuck there. In Oz at the end of some 90s somethings made some similar film hilarious named MONEYSHOT. Originally created as VENUS FACTORY also suffered from more striker than Orson to make it half of it, he got a bad television editor to beat it down to less than 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! The lesson where the bad film goes good by shining. I think FUFFI who stood on release and after seeing it doesn't work, I can understand why.
