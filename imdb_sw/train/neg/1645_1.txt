I just watched this movie last night, and I had to warn anyone else to consider watching this film. In a word - not. I feel like this is something that a screen reader would write in Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, ie every other word was a curse. I have no problem with a severe curse, as in "Good Consultation Hunting", you have helped help more into characters. In this case it was just an unprecedented banner and an attempt to draw * * feet * or laughter from the audience. The three leading actors are their unique displays, wall wall, coffee house, and "I-Si-Gay-Tu-In-Touch-My-Feminine-Side" little bit-of-jerk. You are not just giving him knowledge about any of them! They are all inferior, unacceptable to whom you want to lose. For those who are looking for, this film has a momentous time, very early, and very late. Part of the toilet / vibrator is wonderful in the sick kinda "Uh, yeah" way. However, I would just recommend this film to my enemies more.
