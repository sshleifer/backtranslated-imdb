I read a few reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface", but for anyone who has not been identified in Italian films like myself, the picture would have very little meaning. In fact, after introducing the first ten million scandals of the lira, the picture was done in the revenge of the retaliatory revenge and a slight decline in the character of Rick's character (Al Cliver). The whole battalion of the gang found me for me and the entry of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as many other observers said, he is about the only person who gave this picture any life and his experiments often effective in violence. I found it impossible to go that the Moons that drove him through the streets did not hurt before Tony even laid his hand on them. By building them as the title of the title, Jack Palance was lost instead of transparency to close to the finale, making the job name of U.S., "Mr. Scarface", instead of moot. I've seen spaghetti enough Westerns to know that they're not all working; I think in this case, my first look at the flick of the gangster's spaghetti did not really do either.
