If John Waters has written and led the "House of Corpses 1000" after being beaten on a regular basis with something big, the result will probably be something like "Shed Blood". It is for the first half of the hour, but then defines it in a non-frequent type of noise and people do things with each genitalia each with carpentry knives, spaces and intervals. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is very amazing and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is very bad in anything she does in front of the camera. Maybe the best thing about "Shed Blood" is that it will not take many viewers for too long to forget about it.
