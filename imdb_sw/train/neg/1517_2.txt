In the head I write that the story is wonderful. below I will explain and tell you why, in my humble opinion, it destroys this movie. Gere and Danes are doing their work, and when it is not their best work, it's exactly right. Some of the cast, though, are doing a very bad job. Remember, this is not the absolute error of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones with characters who even a little room in the movie provides an absolute depth. All other characters tend to have a very small room in the film to create a deep, or character is a cliché if it doesn't matter how difficult executives try. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of Se7en hard, but just look in the direction, I think he does a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is a kind of script which is bad in two ways. First of all is a bad script of the movie. The characters are inferior (except the Gere and Danes characters), the criminals are the clichés and the actions of the characters do not really believe. In addition, the authors should have an agenda where they want to bring our opinions and values ​​for one hundred years. It is a type of film that says that other criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they have paid the price that the community has given them. It is also a kind of movie that says, although only between the lines, that each type of gender deficit should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, everything that is not sex in the missionary position and a married couple is a lack of sex. So, if you are going to a film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you write the scriptures yourself and want to add power. See. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
