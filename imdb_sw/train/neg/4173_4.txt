I must say when I got a trailer I was happy. Futuristic soldiers, take bad ass Vampires headed by vet Michael Ironside .... In Space. I mean I wasn't expecting high art, but it seemed like the movie's B might be. Certainly it was a television experiment, once again made on film, after it was not taken. Certainly I will start with a few good film points, the action was the lowest planned film, and CGI and the sites used were approved. Now on the bad, first Michael Ironside was barley in this, and his performance here ... well was not cheesy in a good way. But as I said he had no way, so I can't blame him. One thing that was stupid, was the PETA group for Vampires', no I was missing, it is very impossible that I have seen at that time, and is taken seriously. This film also makes one of the major B movies, forbids the lesbian area, and does not. Most of all this film is not something that happens. Since it meant that the script experiment is almost nonexistent and does not end the end. Even the main criminals, just come towards the end. If the movie is required to lift Sleaze and the reason why, it's the Vampire Wars. In closing I will tell the chief staff on the spaceship, they were all the most capable actors and they could put this mess back to them, and continue with great things and better. They had anything to work with here.
