This is the worst movie I have seen for years! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. I thnik when something going to happen in this film, ,,, and acting is even worse. The latter raises a little and saves the film from the total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this one tries.
