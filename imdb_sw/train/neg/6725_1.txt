What could be a session of behavioral and emotional involvement that is faced with the most likely thing. Fox is similar to Nathaniel Ayers, a Julliard trainer who has a dream of playing with Walt orchestra to his mental illness to take him to the street and finally the player. Looking at the good news to increase his voting career, journalist Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Downey} gets to know him and tells his story. Take every element of the classic "how we hit the skids" movies, very boring from the "Mind Mind", take a bogus "feel" view of the film as "Rocky"-and choose a good-to-hit list too 1930 style melodrama The rest of the screen is a burnt shell of the movie. It is corny, predicting, quite predictable and plays many times over our feelings. I hate to say that, but this is a kind of movie that, if you say you like it, people will give you bad warnings. I wish I could say something positive about this film, but I can't. Acting saves it somewhat, but it is not enough for me to give more than one star. Made with TV film elements. Not suitable for your time.
