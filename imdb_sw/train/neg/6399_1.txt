One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big sessions have turned into a column for a brutal child. All have sold themselves in this one, worse than the behavior of Pryor. Two: Horror, a delightful script that would be used in the movie of Harold Lloyd which was chosen. Third: The choice of black actress as a toy; The ethnic lesson of this cannot be interrupted, if it has not been addressed. No message here, part of Pryor could be played by any comedic actress. Fourth: The child ... I wish I could go back and stop him from working forever ... which would mean movies like this and Kid Co could be not ... and my childhood would be free of their power of mind. So if you want to watch a few beautiful martial arts championships in a tasty little flick religious, continue. If you want to see them in a good thing, look at the old act of Pryor and Gleason in something better, like Traders.
