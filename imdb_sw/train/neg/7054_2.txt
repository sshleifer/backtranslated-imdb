This movie was quite sad. The sad screenplay and the lack of any stories left me looking at the three lost on the babies. Sometimes I felt like I was looking at the part of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the entire movie. Emran Hashmi lust, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not quite surprising. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only part of the film is spoof on Anu Malik and its vanity of shayaris. It was very good. Songs "Sin Ne" and its version of the remix was very good. You can always focus on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching chatibusbuster. All in all, it seems Emran has no good script from Bhatts to bring him back this time.
