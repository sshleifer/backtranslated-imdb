From the emerging text that made Keanu "I have been a wood I can be my Plank" Reeves looks like the winner of this Oscar film (pun is not intended). The best thing about it is the RATicate box in part 2 (which of three was considered to be the most powerful piece of story and 'misleading'). I would have spent Â£ 3.99 to give me something else, like kerm .... natural killers: Directors County. If you buy this, you are ready to desire, put yourself in your hands and avoid the blow. If you are looking for something of an amateur and for actors who are more wooden than 2x4 then go ahead. However if you want a waswolf stage of quality look elsewhere, like dog soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: hunter of waswolf.
