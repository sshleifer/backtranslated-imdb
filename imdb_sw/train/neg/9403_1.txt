This movie should not turn it as a movie. Although it is more than 10 years now, it should never, never have earned money, and is a problem in the Australian Film Industry, which now produces such brilliant films as "The Dish" <br /> <br /> Actors cannot act, music it's .. to be clear, not music, storyline does not exist and it's hard to stay. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this film. It's a perfect waste of your time.
