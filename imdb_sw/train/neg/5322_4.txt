There are two types of 1950s. First you have good MGM products and great names and good music. And then you have a small league and thrown down, popular music and the leaders of the second level. 'Girl Can Not Help' is the last category. Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien were not known by Jayne Mansfield was famous for him ... well, never mind. It seems like every ten years has a part of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The mark itself is thin as a razorblade and one cannot help the defendant is an attempt to sell records of Fats Domino, Little Richard or some of the 1950s rock action on the film. If the music attracts you, it is important to watch. If not, don't worry.
