:: WORKER WORKERS: Person, this film was bad. The Catholic / superstitious / insistent scandal goes on the ground already spread out from the original film. Sex and priesthood. Politics and religion. The hypocrisy of the church. A plan involving the church. In the morning of the new age of evil. All kinds of voodoo magic battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> A good and disabled fool with a weak storyline might be enough. This story is about two ideas: Absolution, known as the Sacrifice of Patient Procurement - the last rights that one can ask to cleanse someone's sins during death; And removed, the act of cutting someone off the Church. Basically, the person who is released cannot receive Absolution. So it comes in Eat Sin, and I leave it at that time. Throw in all dopy items that I have already listed and you have the "Command". I have seen the sex scene and the priest photographed pictures of the Virgin Mary rather than mock the Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I paraphrase) "I am a savior and sinner, living without love blah blah blah" / seeing him going into a black rock and a long coat of "Matrix". <Br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 not only to be stupid and ordinary but also because it has been able to quake the whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better I say "Prophecy" by Christopher Walken.
