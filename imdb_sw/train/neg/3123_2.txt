I was looking at this time ... but it seems to be the reason why the family runs in this film. It is not that it makes a lot of sense but, as some have mentioned, this was one of the last Karloff films and it is only its own presence which gives them any credibility. It is sad that all the scary films of the sound era were reduced by stars in lower class garbage like this. There, Boris got far less than the Bela Lugosi poor but not so much. Boris does a good job and gives him credit to try to keep this mess together. The music behind music has no value and differs from any good time. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is a wonderful name, clipped, English monotone which is reminiscent of the varieties used in the porn movie of the late seventy years. I think I think it's the 'House of Usher' of Edgar Allen Poe that this has been taken but it will be hard to find the Poe's great problem on the finished article. However, there is the best film out there with Boris Karloff for all its potential, search them out and give this wide, unless you want the curses of "lower brain" too!
