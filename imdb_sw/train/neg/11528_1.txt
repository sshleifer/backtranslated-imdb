Anyone who wrote a "good" post about this should be a friend of these. This is even worse with the city war. In fact this is not even behind the city of war, a few people are fighting on a trampoline. Every boy is around 45 lbs wet and none of the entertainment value in this. Only a few bored children who even give tard yard bad names, if possible. If you want to see some of the city's recreational purpose, taking back the Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It is the two biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These are good. In fact they have gone since closing and getting professional training like "real" wrestlers. They went legit and they got well. I recommend checking those two boys. MDogg is insane and extinct. So don't waste your time or on your video on this crappy DVD, there's a "best" back video back there.
