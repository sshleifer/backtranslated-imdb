If you enjoy the film like the American Pie, the Road Travel and Van Wilder; avoid rejecting this movie at all costs. It is unamusing, highly-spirited, contaminated material that should not be discussed in a voice; much less recorded and sold to non-viewers. Easily the worst films I saw in the last 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of runtime. If it's a long time, I couldn't write these reviews without using dirt. Imagine yourself warned!
