The Red Planet of Planet (Review of Quickie) <br /> <br /> As "Man From the Planet X," this is a fantastic story of fiction based on the time when fantasy and science fiction was still not the same thing. Meaning, we have some special effects of laughable and pseudo-science that spread as science fiction. And yes, it is "ethnic" another given in the transfer of high quality and crisp pictures and sharp sounds - and Midnite movies. Therefore, the main reason for watching this film? Oh, it's obvious when all our staff space is on Mars. (What, did you think the "Red Planet" is known to Neptune?) Before that is some of the poorest people riding the ship's shipping ship, into which it smokes and blows around the chauvinistic flag of the target for a member of "puny" of staff. It would be sad for today's standards if it was not very strange. But Mars is the real reason we look at this. Usually the film is black and white, but Mars, together with Mars is the sound of red blood. It has been done in this wonderful red plastic offer to give the angry red planet a spectacular look of the red wind. It is absolutely true to see as they see (ha ha) visitors viewers are witnessing. Better to be "ratbatspidercrab." What do you think is joke? That's what they call it in the film! It is a big cameras (a little bed) of something that combines the characteristics of mice, bats, spiders, and crabs. It is packed with an impressive and destroying sh * t out of our "confident staff." There is some better, and wrong to think, visitors appear, but someone takes a cake. Finally, after their hurt experience on Mars, the board of their sex workers "ship" and return to any planet that they were from. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Fiction Science of Science and Pensioners of curiosity, and some of the buffs of the general film. 3,000 Hidden Science Fans will have a day of field with this (if they are not on the show) <br /> <br /> 2/10 modern score, 6/10 score of Nostalgia, a total of 4/10. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
