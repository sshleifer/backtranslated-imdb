This movie is very bad, it's hard to find the right words to describe! The original story is ridiculous. The thin mind can write the best plot! The vendors are so interesting and unapproachable, perhaps they had to play in this cheesy film. <br /> <br /> The recipient of the National Forest Camera is only good in this movie. I have to feel awkward, because I paid this lousy picture. I hope no one does sequel or make a film like the worst story :-)
