... I would like to count the way. The only head of 'remake' that draws each piece in the slasher book. The score is predictable that it becomes completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Full implementation of all experiments for suspension or exciting. The PG-13 estimation of uncertainties, abuse, or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. The offender who is not fearful or even amazing. The source of the characters that have been widely taken and checked that we cannot care about them. <br /> <br /> 7. Lack of any effective condition (very different from the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. The script of dialogue which is more than the poorest - is mental numbing. It is a series of worksheets (don't assure if you are accusing the actors or script described earlier). Trying to look at the slasher caused by young people who have not yet been trying to try to have ideas - or even to show the blood puddle. <br /> <br /> It's fans of fear of worry, secure your money. <Br /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
