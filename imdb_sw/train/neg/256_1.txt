When? Should Jamie Foxx be funny? Does he believe that he is funny? Yes, it is looking to look at his confidence to be funny. It is a person who does not have any identity ... I mean you can see once his images are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries to copy them in his many films. The only problem is that he does evil, indifferent, and what comes out is a place that looks like Denzel, and his eyes ** t and then suddenly goes to be Martin Lawrence, comic funny and clumsy-silly. There is no personal touch for all, I mean it does not give anything to the person he is trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say for himself. In fact it's Mr. Dull-boy in person. I was with Hollywood hope, and the black community in the United States could look for a better man to launch in a great skill, such as Don Cheadle for instance, but maybe the best Jamie represents a generation that slows down old.
