Satan Hunter became aware of the fact that it is on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it should not be. Many movies on the list where there is God (and DPP) are known only for the reason, and this time is not the group's group; there is not much here that allows to ban ... which is a shame because I could never stay in such a way that it is not actually that it is on the shopping list. The program gives them the best film - or at least more than the best cannibal films - and follows the actor who has been deported and deported in the Amazon desert. Then the hunter is employed to find him, but on the way he has to be brave to the locals, and led by someone who calls himself “the devil” (hence the name). The film is only plods for thirty-five minutes and there's really not a lot of interest. It is a real shame that Jess Franco has finished making this film because the person has talent; as shown by films such as Dr Z Diabolical, Venus in Furs, Faceless and He Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately its fine films are just gems between the crap of the crap and Devil Hunter is a great part of the crap. I saw this film correctly because I want to be able to say I have seen everything on the DPP list (just over two go!), And I think that's why many other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you look at Nasties; there is really no reason to bother with this.
