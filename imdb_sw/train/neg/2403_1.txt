Whack !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was shocked to know that he was in two short events. Other than that I was blowing the button fast forward at all times. Another young man travels to Romania with his father and gets wild dogs and turns wild animals if there is a full moon. He kills his father and friends. Almost 30 years ago but does not have age and enroll in secondary school. There she meets a shy teacher who ends up right and then has children with her. This film was hit and I did not recommend anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Mrs Hartman just did a good job. See Bob Saget very limited in this!
