I am a great symbol for Neil Young's music, and so with a popular films of the film that receives in many media-indie circles, I saw the first show of Greendale I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid story and the slow sound of the film left many films sleeping or broken. Neil says the film started as a sound of sounds, and the characters lived just a lot of sounds. It's not the best way to write a story. There is no characteristic with arc, and when "important" events will occur, the viewer doesn't care, because the screening rates of the film are very high for that point. The film is all the song, and to the end, the last characters are sounding the sound as they sing ... The technique works for the first stanza is done, and gives you the nerves after that. It doesn't feel or feel, it just feels unacceptable. The terrible act, and the characters get the same situation and play it all. Bad lights sometimes. Just a sister can give a film on several shooting scenes like newscast, but the technique is used in the cinema today that this film did not have a bit to continue. Voice sounds, but nothing that I am quick to buy. Bad movies.
