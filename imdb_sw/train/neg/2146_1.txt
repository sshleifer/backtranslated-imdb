I'm going to put it out here, that was the worst layer on the old Disney film that I seen. In 1950, Disney was given what I take as one of the largest films of all time. Now take a great song, add a bad plot that looks like a lost TV show. "Put together and what do you get?" The great burden of the Crud I have ever seen. After seeing this, I thought it had gone to Disney. Cinderella should be ended with, "and lived happily every time." not this garbage. This movie was not eligible for this sequel. I thought it would be like "Moving on time" which was moderate but better than this. Also, do we pray for Anastasia? He changed it as Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.
