This is the reason why most people do not have housing. . . because stupid fools pay their money to make a bad film like this instead of giving as they can eliminate! <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than white chicks! The little man has a good excuse to ask the midget of the behavior as a child. The story is bad to consider was written by six people. The concept is still not very bad though, if it was original and not the end of the cartoon period. it has a good time but some of them are the way of completion and some are foolish. Acting was bad, very bad. So it was leading. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. is a racist and highly offensive for midgets. I mean, instead of showing them compassion for them, the creators of the film laugh at them! It's really loving me the way they do. They see the midgets as babies. And for the character that is a midget, pretend that the child is simply abandoned to get diamonds from a certain family. That's his excuse to beat them to show something like that. Not only helpful. Don't watch this film. It's a great waste of time and money.
