Anne Bancroft has Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her self-sacrificing son (Ron Silver) to get a movie star of Greta Garbo's first time and set up two before Estelle tries well. It may have the name of "Bancroft Talk" as an actor who is attacking this unknown comedic / strange / sentimental material. Director of fire or cold Sidney Lumet can not get a permanent rhythm, and the constant failure of Bancroft was not completely opened by the film manufacturer - keeps his presence higher: cute, eyes combination and relax. Estelle becomes drag on this situation (not a thin-pregnant plot has a lot to go out). Money and co-starring Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks take a very small step but they support the stars, and everyone is beaten with his hamming. * 1/2 from ****
