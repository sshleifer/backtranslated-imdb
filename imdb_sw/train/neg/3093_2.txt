If you look at the common version of this monstrosity or MST3K version, you can only be surprised by GALL completely embedded in this production. The authors of the film insult the observer's mind from one end to another and certainly do not care less than they do. Everything about it is the lowest price of the rock.

Kyle is a freak of mobile phone in short red who is dreaming of a night with a variety of spandex-clad dominatrix, but she does so that she is more likely gay than not. One of the girls is bright and the other is sleaze. Do you like hobgoblins? Finally they all return to the vault where they have lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Look at this film and wonder how modern films in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, improper trends, worst actors will be rejected from high school production, and deserves Edward D.
