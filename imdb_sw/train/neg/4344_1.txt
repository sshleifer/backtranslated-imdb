If you hit your head with a shovel, put the script on your feet, you can come close to the mental level of this film. There is nothing in this film that has not happened a thousand times in the other flicks of the gangster and has made it more comfortable. Those who think "Scarface" were a kind of hero appearing on or seeing "Goodfellas", "Menece II Society" or "Minister Minister" and MMM thoughts "That's life for me!" you will love this film. I thought I would give them a movie space, as the premise was perfect for prequel. I would like to know more after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone who is on grade 4 education, see nature and Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
