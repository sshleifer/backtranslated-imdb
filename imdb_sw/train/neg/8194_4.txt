How difficult is it to write what can be named by Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? It seems very difficult for authors here. <br /> <br /> I still don't know how Santa is less and looks 20 years older than Vince (who has a BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in fact, it was useless. Many events were seen outside and reflected; A kind of "fantastic theory" which is a drug out of WAY ​​far away where any sense of comedy disappears. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go to the "jerker tears" end, which would have been suitable if anything leading up to that point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, great desire. I can see how other people can enjoy this, because most people will take any trash they give, but I will strongly encourage you to wait on this DVD. Not worth $ 23,978 takes it to make your family on the movies these days.
