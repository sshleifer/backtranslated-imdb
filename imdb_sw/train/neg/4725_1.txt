A good opportunity for the director of Indy to make an interesting film about rock rocker on the edge of the skill. It could be a good film if it had been dealing with John Livien's old problem and how it caused his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to recognize the life of John Livien and John Lennon's. The mother of suicida's mother of John Livien was John Lennon and desired to be strong and strong like Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on the creation of John Lennon's music, and his amazing ability to give birth to others to learn something about their lives, it showed Lennon's legacy to be confused, addictive, which should appear as God rather than man. I am a great fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of another "mad" who was with Lennon, Lennon murderer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a person who was brutally murdered by another person who had an identity crisis with Lennon. What? We need to be reminded of it? John Lennon gave much to the world and his music and honesty and trembled to see another distressed person, like the main character in this movie considered by Lennon, and not to show his good contribution to the world. Yoko Ono respectfully respected John Lennon's memory, by making a record in Central Park to give his fans the opportunity to pay their honor, and remember John. Instead, the director of this film chose to use the site to have a suicide attempt. I saw this very sad and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a peaceable man who died a brutal death, and saw such violence around this site felt like to fix a terrible injury to any Lennon fan. Destroyed the movie completely for me. It can be a good film, but it has left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his evil murder for this irresponsible movie.
