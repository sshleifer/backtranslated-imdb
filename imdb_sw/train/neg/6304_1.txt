As a buff of the history of the WWII, and a person who is not proud of the country's history of competition, I expected to see this film. It is a piece of despair of schlock. I did about 3/4 of the way, but I had to turn it off in a small attack area. The idea that the U-boat would fire torpedo on the DDE, if there is hope of hitting, and then being able to “run” from the DDE if it has been reinstated, is moving. And that's just a little explanation. The whole movie was well written, not well-written, and not recommended to work. I agree with others on this board that this can be a good movie. It is as if they decided that, since WWII's WWII's marvels were made by all white hair, they needed to do one with black people. And as bad as those old movies, this is even worse. And it's close to false advertising to the headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out they had very little responsibilities. I believe that two good actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I have finished. I have given so many ways of my movie this decoration.
