The only feature of this film that saves you from the bottom of my cellular piece of garlic is one line used by an agent trying to get into the tomato for someone to wear in tomato dress: "Is there anyone who can pass ketchup?" I strongly encourage anyone with sleep disorders using this film as a sedative; it works better than overdose of demarol.
