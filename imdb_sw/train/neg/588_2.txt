I have to write a review of this IMAX feature as a way to warn others to save your money. Nearly any part of Desmond Morris "" Human Animal "or David Suzuki" State of Things "would benefit the information presented. Not only does the director fail to use the 65-year-old film with an amazing IMAX camera and large presentation screen, everything on the screen is sufficiently available for the availability of the previously mentioned programs. The audience is brought by Heather pregnant, her husband Buster, and grandson and nephew. We follow them for forty-four minutes as unusual as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to events within a follow-up of human trafficking and learning about the children of natural diving, do we really learn anything more than many school graduates the bridge? Are we even welcome to the Rem-Atlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this film at all costs. If you want to see the IMAX feature, I recommend a good photo "India: The Kingdom of Tiger" or "3D Wind Disaster" technology. Believe me.
