This movie is, in spite of its "independent" status, the stupid version of the stupidity of mother and daughter's disgusting relationship. it was not bad at first, but somewhere during the film - near the time when the daughter came out with the man, I think - it turns into a movie of the daughter that connects. Sorry, but I don't know any mother who has that kind of relationship with their daughter ... it's probably better in that way, though.
