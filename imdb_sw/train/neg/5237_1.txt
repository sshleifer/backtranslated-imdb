One of them, if not a very bad film from the UK during the 80 years. posh have nothing to redeem. <br /> <br /> It turns free, losing, unpleasant and untrue, this film decreases in depth if it fails by its attempts to be funny, stimulating, intelligent and confusing. Maybe the worst thing about this film is the way to cast the power of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran completely moved to such a crippled script. It is not surprising that this was the late Andrea Dunbar just working on doing that on the screen. Complete with trash of each level.
