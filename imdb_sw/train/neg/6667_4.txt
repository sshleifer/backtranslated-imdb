was kind of enjoying this movie until the hair issues of Ed Norton. Without revealing any details of the plot - one afternoon he was whistling on the beard but that evening the beard had gone with a very precious mustache. It was more complete than a mustache. Later, during the dark night in the open mustache he had gone and he appeared clean place. This was a time when standing to shave without being an option. This continuous explanation had completely prevented it from all the films and was destroying any trust that had previously had. Also, I have seen a long area of ​​cowboy alone in his bedroom was also a way to remember De Niro in Driver Driver. Even if it meant that the cult was installed too thickly to this viewer.
