I am a great fan of the lowest budget movies like this, but come! This should be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've seen! I ignored the comments posted on this site and made sure that it would be facing my taste, but I got tired and wiped out. Masks were made from what looked like a sheet of tin. Gore: Gore was good, I must give it. But the Burning Moon of Ittenbach was ideal for a small movie budget. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was awesome! I had no thought of dubbing. I enjoy this as "Premutos" of Ittenbach (a great movie). Fighting plans and action was $$ poor. Under / below: Don't see any Schnaas film. There are the best directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach and the same year movies and the issue. See Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and nekromantiks.
