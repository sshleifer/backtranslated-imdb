This movie was awesome. It was incomplete and cannot. While Alec Baldwin attempted to prove himself as a full prosecutor and defendant (without naming the producer), the movie has never shown any protection advice or try to resist the audience with a real sense of meaning on how the country could be led to the worst way. Of course, no one wants to defend the Nazi perspective, but that was the issue of Nuremberg roads! Four hours of just dropping on Nazi ... c'mon! It's done already! I think absolutely Alec Baldwin should join the husband of Kim Bassinger. <br /> <br /> Right after the movie was completed, TNT showed the 1959 film, the Nuremberg Way. The movie is the head of FAR.
