This movie is just an apology for the author to make the film from 2 failed scripts. Its characters are a collection of characters with tragic or comic characters total of the neurotic dialogue as long as Allen can write. The woman likes this because it is like looking at the mirror so that they can enjoy this film maybe it is / was <br /> the movies did not like me but because there was no tracking drive and no film had no fight. there were drug lords or gang attackers. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This film had no snakes. It's not my tea cup and maybe not your ether to think about what I said before I found myself watching this film. Without a doubt it is similar to a woman who has serious issues about people who enjoy sex with the city and the partner of the partner then this means to you.
