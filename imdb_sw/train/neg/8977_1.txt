A female country named "Big T" - heavily, they call her - jeopardizing her music and life by falling into a drunken company (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also drunk, and he is very angry. You can imagine where it leads. At the same time, there are many music, like Parton, and its talented voice sounds, closing the song after the song (at least half of them all over Texas). Apply clear of this mess and look out for NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
