It has never known that the film was there until I got an old VHS copy, hidden inside my dusty panic. The head of the box “insects” and the backslides have shown that it is another non-productive movie of 80 of the horror. In fact they can be happy, of course, for as long as they do not expect a sense of mind and as long as you do not sin by seeing a lot of the effects of making haste. Almost every important feature that is causing a horrible movie to look at is a small here in "Monkey Blue"! The plan is ridiculous and uncommon, acting acting is painful to explore and there is a lack of doubt. Tracking the standard trends of the "big-bug" movie, "Blue Monkey" holds on a new and unknown species of insects that cuts doctors and patients from remote hospitals. The creators could not be more evasive on the real nature of this critter of gigantically on the size! All we know is that it did not come out of the sky and began to crawl into a tropical plant. Other than this, there is absolutely no explanation of where this type of insect suddenly comes! As I said, do not get your hopes for a mental screen. The first half of the film is enough entertainment, as well as interesting and the introduction of two female characters (80 years of blind and drunk woman!) But the second half (when the whole hospital is put in quarantine) is very scared. It is also near the end that "Monkey Blue" begins to stimulate older films (and much better). Approaching the climax, it seems to have come out of the budget too, since the light becomes very poor and the boy in the monster suit is not found properly. "Blue Blues" is a peek value if you are really bored or if you want to see every 80 movie horror ever made. Fans of B-movies can recognize John Vernon ("Killerns Killerns from Space Out", "Curtains") in a small and insignificant position of Roger, who manages the clinic.
