After coming off first you think that the wayan brothers can come up with a new joke. Although I think not. If the first was not so bad this is just bad it hurts to see. With all the actors they had in this film you think they can come up with a little more cunning. Although they could not, they had to take the same radical, not an extraordinary joke from the first and somehow they put it in this film to think people would hit it again. Although this is not the first time it has been done. They tried to make these movies hard though they failed each level. It is often just a joke that is randomly entered, which is so disgusting and very interesting that it is difficult to watch and enjoy. Then as they try to make scenes that are film gifts they are about to make a 20-minute leisure area and maybe one player in the whole area. Also for people who say that it is not for the big and true listeners, well I get into the age of which should be wonderful for. When people say that different people have different views of a play or not, if this is a funny one then it may not be one of the mature or most intelligent people around. It is not worth the great skill to write that kind of script, although you want a more clever and funnier movie to see the movie Spaceballs. It is a tragedy of a film that is true and has done well and had no use of hateful and radical jokes to make it funny.
