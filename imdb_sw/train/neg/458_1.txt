What is this? My little brother took this open for the top art of the girlie's art and head ... I decided to watch him with him so he was not tired, and I am sure he was angry with the terrible quality. First, acting was wrong. They seem like amateur actors to read cue cards. Delivery is small and par formulaic very. The reduction of events was awesome. It seems like they took it directly from the storyboard, if there was one. Second, jokes and desires were not original or played at all, very formulaic. I can't count the times I could predict the second joke. I have had a few few out of the good "sex" words of sex. Cat, Patch Beaver, Hung Wong? .. C'mon! Just .. stay away from this movie. Not good, not funny, not even funny-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It is like a PG movie for children with unwanted sexual feelings, dirt, and voting for MPAA. Leave. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to plant my bike?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call now?" <br /> <br /> "You can climb my dingy." <br /> <br /> "Oh! I think I've got blood on my stool!"
