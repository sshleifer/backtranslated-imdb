Left Back is a kind of "we know what we know why we know" a film that Christians (and more than any other stupid person) need to help them feel like "they think" and "believe" (not "know") is right. But, at the same time I feel bad for young people, because this is not a well-made film. Not supporting any messages. I work in a video store, and I know the only reason people went to see this film was because they were religious and thought it was. Anyone in the world who thinks they know what will happen in the future is the same, unless they think they know they do not know. I've had enough (but just after having so much) of these people around with their heads in the air to think that the movie-based movies of a talented TV player means something about me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you like yourself you will be away. I refuse to enter any information about this movie (not because AI didn't see (because I did), B-was too surprising for anyone who didn't believe in God (because it was not), or CI actually we have anything to say bad about that (because I). The reason, (which is the word no one helped to make this film understand) is that I want this film to leave my head, I want it to be my head, I want to watch ALL EVERYTHING AND SCIENCES ON MY HEART, I The message that Kirk for the trick and cunning gives the end of the movie from my head. I just want all the things that were in my head before watching these movies there, anything that is directly connected to this film toward my head GET OUT! .. Sorry that someone in this world came to the theater to see this film about what might happen in the future (but not) when they were to give more than seven dollars for any human equity, Animal, or Rain. that then they will not be able to "believe" in the fact that it is true, they may have the truth. HOW TO DO ZERO (out of ****)
