This period is dull, blind, and basically breaks all kinds of items to make it "original." First off: Animation is very bad ... Johnny's hideous ... and everyone is angry. Twins appear to be the Dexters of the young girl from the "Dexter Lab," and Johnny is close to Dee Dee's most intelligent male (also from "Dexter's Lab.")

I saw only two events, but only those who fled. <br /> <br /> Three-way: All the theme of the theme begins with the dancing of Green Day's "American Idiot." And, when I'm not a big fan of the port, I find it true that they could take the same opening songs, and then change the trick, to make it. for sure ... it's a huge weight of bad oil. 1/10
