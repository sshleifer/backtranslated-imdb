This is a bad remake of a small movie, but very popular, since the beginning of 70 years. I have seen it at least 6 times. Cheesy's story, which by the way, is quite different from the original. Most of the government's participation was mentioned. No flow from one location to another. In nature you can go to get a beer or hit the bathroom and still continue. It has taken only a few hours of movie time to switch the oil pan into the car. It takes more times than that in real life. Car people see these things. Also, the fool or stupid who chose to lose the 1968 brand and the abuse of the Challenger 1970 should be beaten with a lighter shot. The fact they are not 'people's car' is obvious, and their passing will not be frustrated. The actors had no feeling, everything was cut and dried. One step on monotone. Barmitzvah is more exciting and more powerful. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not the least, the radio DJ announced that Challenger is experiencing tablets at 180 or 185 (??). That's the general waste. Can you say aerodynamics, or its lack? Hahahaha! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time looking at this.
