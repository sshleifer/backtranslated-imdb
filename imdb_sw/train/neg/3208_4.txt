This movie was a great disappointment to me. I was waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they lost it. Not only did they spend half of the story stories, but they changed information. The statement that Lucifer is the Father of Hope is true. He despised his father, but he himself was not his father. The voice also does not match the characters, and as soon as you hear the voice of the beloved character, the voice you have heard in your mind cannot return. I can't even remember everything about this film that was correct. The bottom line is like you love the death of Lady Do not watch the movie. Didn't make the comic right at all !!
