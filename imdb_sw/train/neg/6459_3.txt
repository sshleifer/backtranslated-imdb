Traders also desire. Marlon Brando has a bad character, the movie is not quite good, an unfamiliar message can be seen "ITI IS A WORK OF THE WORK!", "IT SUUCKS SO BADLY !!", "FINDA YOUR TV TO WINDOW", and so on. It's just disgusting and unsuitable. In addition to the plot of folly, the sense of humor, there is something else. Ways in which decorated rooms, colors. It makes me sick, everything is very colorful that can cause epilepsy. I usually don't care about the decoration in the film but this from the "Money Fund" has given me anger. Avoid at all costs! "Money Money" - probably with Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer has nothing! One looks at the cost of sanity.
