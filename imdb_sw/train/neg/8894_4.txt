This film is the body of life, automatically 11/10 on the wind level. The lack of accents as well as the sleep of the spandex pants of cardigan is simply amazing. Yanks, although actually Scotland can be as colorful, if you ever go do not expect to be given a lot of space "dance out" controversial with locals. Also, do not try to adopt local views through the beautiful art of tapdancing. There are several cases of infectious-and-play, but the plot is very good and common, and discussions are often very weak. I am also sure if anyone would like to be stuck in the Scottish island village organized during the 18th time of livestock instead of New York City gay. Perhaps it was not a great sacrifice for the priest who left Brigadoon, perhaps he was just trying to get out of the dump. <br /> <br /> Looking for a good-effective approach to what Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like LSD. Other than that I would just recommend to the actors of Hollywood muscial.
