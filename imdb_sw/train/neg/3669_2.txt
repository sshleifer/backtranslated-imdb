In fact I don't think anything to say about this film ... it's not one thing. The script is a dream. The author lightens the line between chemical and biological characteristics and does not seem to understand the difference. You think they could get a technical consultant. The exhibition was bad for many of the cast ... although I don't really blame them .. really stinks material. The editing was too bad. I will stop now .. all bad 2/10
