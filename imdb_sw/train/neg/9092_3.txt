Friz Freleng's 'Speedy Gonzalez' was the second cartoon of the title after Robert McKimson 'Cat-tails for two'. In the same cartoon, Speedy has become a little bad creature with a great golden tooth but with his appearance to the second popular design has already been taken. Despite a very good look, Speedy has not developed into many habits. The great cap, the great speed and the negative impact of Mexican is not the usual habit of doing and that's pretty much every Speedy ever was going for it. However, a little cocky mouse seemed to be very popular and continued to star in many cups including real bad movies from the last studio days. While the original shorts of Speedy are much better than the future evil that was constantly (rather odd) linked to Duck Daffy, they still leave a lot of want, depending on the predictions of predicting the same type of expulsion. During this period, Speedy is employed by other mice to steal their cheese from a local factory that happens to protect the Sylvester cats. Although he brings the extra weight of the stars to turn on the cartoon, the role of Sylvester here can only be filled easily with another cat's cartoon cat. His humanity is beaten and forced into prediction. the responsibility of not being responsible to follow. This was always a problem in Tweety cartoons but but Speedy makes the enemy even duller thanks to his cockiness of hatred and disappearing clear of his capture. Young Sylvester would have to appear with Speedy for many years to come. Despite following a good formula formula with a little laugh, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won the Oscar and the most unsuitable star was born.
