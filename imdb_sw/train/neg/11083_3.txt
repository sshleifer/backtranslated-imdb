This film was the night at the end when I saw it. It was interesting at the beginning but did not satisfy it in general. I'm not a fan of Tyson. I really don't like boxing at all. It is wrong, wrong and double faced (by society) that others get money to fight. However, I felt the start of the film was the same. Staff is the same, especially George C. Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I don't know how flick is believed. I have never read books and books about box or Tyson. I don't know anything about that person, but it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> As the movie continued I felt a little lost of charm and I also lose interest. I could stay awake though the last hour was not very good.
