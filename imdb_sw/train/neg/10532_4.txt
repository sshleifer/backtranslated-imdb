Madison is not so bad - if you would like a convenient fare, non-offensive, "family-friendly" and, more importantly, if you don't know anything about unlimited electric racing. If, like me, you had a game with your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare to be desperate. Expert experts have long explained on the nature of the film and its penchant using every hackneyed clich√© game in the book. I don't need to repeat what they said. I felt unhappy is any feeling of genuine excitement of unqualified water resources in the "years of glory" (which many would say were already in 1971). Yes, it was good to see the old tribal boats moving around six exercises, although it was clear that the revised versions (hostage to Volunteers at Race and Race Pirates) were fast tracked. But where was the voice? The most fun of the ancient hydros was the sound of all the Allison or Rolls-Merlin engines, affected by the RPM which were never thought by their designers, hitting the first line in front of you. You didn't hear it, pay it. The real water of water knows exactly what I'm talking about. Nothing in Madison. Instead, every racing area is placed under what is required to be a symbol of the "hero" of music. <br /> <br /> Then there are close-around shots of drivers, riding well and comfortably in cockpits if they were resting in the recent luxury limousine, some time taking an exciting time for evil as they think how to convince the poor hero home-city. Or, for one shot of ignorance, take the time to see Jake Lloyd giving a greeting of "Rocky" from the bridge. In fact, some unscrupulous drivers wore low-cost vests to reduce their strikes they took as boats floated on rock water at a speed of 150 mph. As one auditor said well, "The game deserves better than this." Finally, since another user brought unchronisms, I will add one: the setup of Seattle shows Kingdome and Safeco Field. Nor was there in 1971
