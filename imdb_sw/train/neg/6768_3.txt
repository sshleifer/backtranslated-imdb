Herbie, Volkswagen who thinks as a man, is back, now led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who expects to be NASCAR champion. The only thing that stood his way was the current champion, the Murphy Journey (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> Besides the original love was not good. Even as a child, I remember not very much. I had some hopes for those who followed. I mean the cast is good and the trailer makes it look like a beautiful beautiful movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is not better now than he had before. The film is weak for people over 12 years. It is possible to convince children but that's all. I know that it's a children's film and all but they could make the film more interesting. There were very few dancing and it became boring near the end. Many of the characters seemed to have died in their roles as well. Lindsay Lohan was similar to Maggie Peyton. It usually provides the best displays as on Friday of Freaky and Women's meaning. Matt Dillon gave the best performance from everyone. He was very good as a bad man even though he didn't have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and don't do anything special. Angela Robinson leads and does a good job. She tries to put an interesting film but it works with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote a screenplay and would surprise you that they were also responsible for Taxis and Pacifier? These two make a light film still unable to make the story interesting or enjoyable. It is not their fault at all but sometimes they will try hard. Finally, Herbie is a safe, predictable family to look at if you are a child. Everyone else is better to fly. Testing 4/10
