This is the worst film of Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a good director. But this film is a black mark on its work. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both of them are actively involved in a beautiful film about a girl going to the army. Very fool. And there is no one condition that convinces you in any way. It is very difficult to make a film like this. Everything staff makes can be just anyone's idea. The authors had no greater impetus; a lot of foolish conversation that was not quite meaningless; and non-brain activity. I strongly recommend staying away from this litter. I hope that the most talented people involved in this project know this kind of film is not good for their attention, and that they will later work on more decent and intellectual movies than this unpleasant mess.
