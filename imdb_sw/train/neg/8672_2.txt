Many practical movies are a crass of Hindi movies, especially of Sunny and his family <br /> <br /> Movies are typical of sun and bashes, big talk and melodrama <br /> <br /> film also has Rajiv's most common Rai links to many people and strange inhabitants. Starting is the same and then Kenyan changes are good but then the film continues with <br /> <br /> The sequence of events migrates at a slow pace and nothing big happens. br>> <br /> They are a lot of stupid things like the Kenyan police are shown as the jokers especially Sharat <br /> <br /> The highest level is also going to do the job. 1 only works and that's the last of TOOFAN camera-work beautiful <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, the actions of Chunky as a monkey during its magnificent scenes are laughable, Naseer is real heroes of pure Amrish wood Puri is not half the horrible if he was in the TRIDEV others is the same
