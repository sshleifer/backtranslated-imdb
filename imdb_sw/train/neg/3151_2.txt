"It was You" is another sign that Hollywood is not worth thinking. This picture is about Charlie Hudson former police officer turned out to the Author. When a lover of Charlie comes out of the city stuck with all the wedding plans. She uses a week in a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn teacher who just happens to get married. Both of them become friends immediately and prepare their own wedding. That's when the plot is misleading, Charlie loves Anna and she needs to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie grows off every romantic comedy created and awaits the end of the film so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge offers a realistic exhibition that makes this movie possible quite a gutter.
