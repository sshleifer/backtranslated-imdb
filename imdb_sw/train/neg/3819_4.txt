T.Z. The post, a university professor, receives a false letter stating that he has earned $ 750,000. Now financially, he deprives his life savings of $ 4,000, and decides to eventually go and live. After having his cargo sent to the train to Chicago, he meets a group of veudeville that travels, and decides there is good enough to put on the show at Broadway. On the show night, Prof. Poor Post should hide from its creditors, dealing with problems with the relationship between Pansy partner and the eleanor floozy, and still ensures the show must continue. After looking at Keaton's many gems, this is the pain of staying, but I felt, could be worse. Help Durante cast, Todd, & Selwyn come off annoying many times, but it still looks. Charlie Chan Toler's plan is as good as the director of the shock show. 90% of the script is written badly as MGM tries to pass this as poor Marx Bros. where many eyes eyes fall flat from the beginning. Connected to Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this movie is a sad time in the life of Buster. Measurement-3.
