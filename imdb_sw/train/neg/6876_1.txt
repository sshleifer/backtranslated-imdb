Yes, this was pure and untrustworthy babble. We know that the French often has the concept of the US, it is puritanism and views on sex. Like the United States (Hoosier) in France, I have a great opportunity to explore this view. And while some of these preliminary ideas can be true, NOT ONE of the western middle cities shown in this film is realistic. A person who has never had sex because he was told at high school 20 years before his penis is too big? Where did you get in the world? The juke box on the bar that has only blue harvest? The city that probably 16 people less than two hours from Chicago, but they don't have a big gas station, no home tvs, no McDonalds, no children ... The number of people who know the closest details of each other still get together as one big family that hates . Older men climbing cushions that are in the local cafe, they have farms but do not have a harvest, they kill a person who does not like in front of everyone and seem to be far away, and all have the same feeling? A saved French girl who will beat a 17-year-old girl because of her romantic hospitality, a very tall man who goes from a corn field to a breath of a breeze in Illinois to help this 17-year-old boy's deflower field? HELP! I am very surprised and surprised by the absurdity of this film that I have not explained clearly how stupid. Go see for A-to-Z primer on what to avoid. Bosh, I hope I didn't destroy you!
