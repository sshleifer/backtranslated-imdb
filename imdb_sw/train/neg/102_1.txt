My girl once brought close to Zombie Chronicles for us to look like a joke. We knew little that joke was on him to pay Â£ 1 for him. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would like to do than watching the Chronicles. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Exploring sand in my eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-fixing civil war in the US 5) Tax return 6 ) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old woman. Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? This could not dig well. The best he did was cut down the door (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I saw, and I saw the white Noise: Light. Never the film has many errors in it. My girl left here, so I now live with the shame of possessing this piece. News here: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to commit suicide. The truth. Don't see it
