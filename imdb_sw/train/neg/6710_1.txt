I have seen more than 1000 movies and this looks like one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a shame that they had to involve this garbage for the 1963 Angels song "Back to My Beloved." If you have to make a choice between watching this film and a painful dentist, I would like to recommend the dental work.
