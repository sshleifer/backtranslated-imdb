I saw only the movie in the theater. Movie has a few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and several songs can be. That's it. Movie is the perfect desire in all areas. Anyone involved with the film will be confused, even the Indian Indians also (now Chennai has made it the last half). <br /> <br /> But I feel more about the movie are action scenes. Now sound days try to record action scenes from Hollywood. But they have forgotten that Hollywood directors are very affected to make it as real. But unfortunately the Directors of Sound do not have much time. They spend their time on songs and films. Now, too, stupid acts can do South Africa as the listeners pay only to watch their favorite actors. But this voice will certainly not work. All events of the works I would like to submit. At last even some Chinese people appear from the hitting place of Akshay Kumar. This is the height of folly. The audience does not get to look at the evil. I think the voice now should forget about practical movies. They can't do that. The last step I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon in Khialdi". The current event in the voice is really sad for fans of action action like me. Do these people see their film after completion? What? Can they not realize that the slower action (which has been done with the string) is a non-fiction? Better not have action events if you don't want to handle. I just want to return to Amitabh's time when the movie like Zanjeer and Deewar had terrible events. Sound effects were not very effective in those days, but visually is better than current events. <br /> <br /> This movie now should open the eyes of the film directors. Please do not perform any practical actions, until you get the art to make it real.
