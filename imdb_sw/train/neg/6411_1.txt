Return is one of those movies for this group of people who love movies and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar has a good player who does not buy a pirates or get naked at all in the movie. I had agreed with this, however I was unwilling to focus on the worst reforms ever connected with useless flashbacks. Finally he turns his car into it when he was young. Or maybe I am wrong and that's just a flashback. For this movie it is impossible to tell. Can you believe the same dude who made the Dark Army produced this trick? The best idea is to stay at home and watch the Dark Army in Sci Fi channel. The same was all: sluts, zombies and dude and chainsaw by hand. Forgotten did not even one of these things.
