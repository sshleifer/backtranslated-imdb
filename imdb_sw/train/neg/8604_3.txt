Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a small part in the classic "Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are murder slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, interested in you, but the most prestigious killer, slipped by slugs toxic waste (which still goes just as fast as a normal slug, which is not terrible, but I digress). No one will believe him for the first time, but they will do it. Yes, they will be. Well, the killer slugs are the same on psychological items and under Johnathon Winters as a child of Mork in the cause of beauty. So the perversion of all is quite clear from getting to go. Flick is fun in some way and is of 'very bad' that is good 'range. I am grateful that they said that this was Slugs: Modern versus Slugs: Game Children or Slugs: Other Good Meat. Maybe he should not look at it more than once and immediately forget it except by playing an unfamiliar game of trivia. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is well-known for his original "Pod People" films (which MST3K trembled indeed) and "Peices" (which is quite possible the worst movie ever released) <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> <br /> My bridge: D + <br /> <br /> Additional DVD: Especially the trailer of this movie's show
