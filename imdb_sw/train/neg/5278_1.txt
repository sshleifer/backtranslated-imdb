When the comedy movie has its amazing voice on the back cover you know your not dealing with the high film. I lost this film with friends expecting to get tips but generally to get more of us laughing each other and enjoying the film. We could not choose the worst movie. <br /> <br /> Movies can be similar to a few changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gags are not well done and placed. The newborn in the movie made us want to commit suicide, thank him for trying the scene and appearance but he was like a puppy praying for love. If he had been shot from the film everything could be carrying. There was an amazing joke, I believe one was when a group of boys stole one parent's porn movie and it became a sex image. But considering more comedy I just tell the gag opening for the fat kid. He is wearing a purple shirt and speaks about not knowing when something happens. <br /> <br /> To finish, the film editor could save the movie by removing the baby's oil, cutting 20 minutes of school scenes and making the end which is more than thirty seconds of random quarrel. OH, BTW, there are two beautiful things that the movie has. Kadeem Hardison has his role in amazement and makes his joke so that no one has missed or dislikes. Another feature of redemption for the movie is Mrs Ali Landry. His character has been overlooked by the film that is embarrassing. Do not waste your time even renting this. It was not interesting to me and I was part of the target audience (husband 18).
