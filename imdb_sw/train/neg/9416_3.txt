Steve McQueen has certainly many loyal fans out there. In fact he was a historian, one of the most charismatic screens he had ever known. But even McQueen can not save this turkey film, shoot with what is seen as a brownie camera in real places in St. Petersburg. Louis. Mr McQueen who has no criminal record brought to the bank's shadows and one of the other groups. There is more than a broad indication that there is a gay relationship between Steve and David Clarke. He does not like the most powerful members, especially due to his lack of crime. Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and blames a trivial thing, especially when he starts hanging around Crahan Denton and James Dukas with Clarke, all the bad characters. That will certainly be my desire for the resurrection. The Great St. Louis Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made many documents and Stix did not do much. One of the two officers decided that Steve's performance was best made by doing the evil of Marlon Brando. This movie could drop as the worst made by Steve McQueen. I am interested to bet that Dick Powell and Stars Four Stars were already signing for the Dead or Living Dead because I can't believe they will have if they see this. Or they could see something people would discard except for Turkey's clothing.
