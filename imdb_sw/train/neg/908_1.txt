After purchasing a DVD in Bargain Bin due to an interesting amount of items listed on the lid, I hit it on the DVD player and everything seemed good. Beautiful animation themes and many additional items ... but when I played the movie itself, what is leaving. It's the worst thing I have seen and I have seen bad movies in my time. Comments that love the movie here on IMDB are actually from people who have made a film. So don't believe unless you want to lose your money!
