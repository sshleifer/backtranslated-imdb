Can I give this small score? No? Yes, I say that this is the most angry film I tried to look at. It was of pain. Boringus Maximus. Plan (?) Is hidden in several low-nebulosity levels. I lost this film with a friend and, after thirty minutes of hope would be better, we decided to "move forward" a little to see if things would get better. Never available. This film about other trophies excluded by these two girls, looks attractive, but, in fact, is just bearing. Not even interesting even when you happen. If you have a chance to view this, make yourself a permission, try "PLAN NINE FROM SPACE OUTER" instead.
