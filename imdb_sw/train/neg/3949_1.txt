I have a "Bogeyman" DVD and this stunker was an extra feature. I thought it was "Boogeyman II" because it was connected to nature. But you know what they say about those who "think": makes "money-" from "u-" and "me." I had read it before I saw that BII has many pictures from nature and that it is a star actress Love. When looking at the "Return of Boogeyman," I decided to stick to the original image to see the location of death-and-toothbrush. Before I knew, the film was over. Open. I think I thought this was BII because this has the same name as one of the alternative BII names. Oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? I would like to stop talking about my mistake and start talking about film errors. Many, many, mistakes. What is this person Ulli thinking about? Does he really think that movie will prepare for different types. Nothing originally holds Part III. It is basically a flashback of nature for the psychic eyes, who gives us a gruelingly boring-by-playing play as everything happens. That's the movie. O, with a single death-and-stereo area, but you can read it away from someone else's inspection. My intention in "Boogeyman II" has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Last Update: This is not a series of films to look back.
