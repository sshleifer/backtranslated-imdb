Alex D. Linz takes Macaulay Culkin as the main figure in the third movie in the Universal Kingdom alone. Four industrial explorers find a system of computer missiles and incorporate it through the airport into a toy toy toy. Because of the freight chaos, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets a car. He gives his neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the detectives turn. The explorers rent a house to house each neighbor until they get a car. At home alone with chickens, Alex calls 911 every time he makes a robbery, but the spies can't escape the police while Alex is sentenced to make prank phones. The investigators eventually turn their attention to Alex, not knowing that he has had the trap of taking his whole house seriously. Home alone 3 was not awesome, but maybe should not be made, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. At home alone 3 had some interesting places, but I do not like when characters are changed to a series of films, a dangerous view.
