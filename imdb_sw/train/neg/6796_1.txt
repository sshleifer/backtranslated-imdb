Linda Lovelace was a victim of hate hate woman, Chuck Traynor. I don't know how to have sex with a dog (which is an animal abuse, too) can be found to be entertaining or interesting. Linda Lovelace was a regular prisoner who had to make these films. I know some people will criticize these views but I feel very much that these types of films cleanse the flames of hatred and feelings of concern towards women. This community continues to show women as sex objects against human beings. We call ourselves "civilization" however I feel we have a long way to go before we will create a face of civilization.
