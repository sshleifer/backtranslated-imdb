Almost from the word to this film is poor and do not trust but again many people will strive to show a commitment to the script as this uninspiring like this. Negotiations do not flow and sometimes as in this case more are smaller (or should be). This is also supported by unusual events (eg Cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think could cause somewhere but it seems to lose a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The program is a wonderful mix of gangster / comedy situation that I'm sure I seemed to be a good idea at the time but if there ever was a case for someone who needs to be honest with the author then here it is. Martin Freeman is the same but then he seems to have one character that continues to always so I've started to ask if he was given a script or just closed and told to touch it as usual. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This reminds me of 'Python (I think) quotes on Shakespere, his' comedies' - If he had said that humorous could put a joke in it. Well I haven't seen one. Do not waste your time - I did it because I was going to look at a friend and I was hoping that it would succeed. It didn't do.
