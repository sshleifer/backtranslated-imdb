How do you deal with Italian oil that can eliminate military art without needing heart medication? In this film we see Steven Seagal at its lowest level of success - since his work began to be a sharp decline in enough behavior that led to his work. In this film it looks like a lot of his training was to fetchcil alfredo in his restaurant every day. He is fat, slow and very old to look at this movie, difficult karate action hero, more like a clown of shaving stock. It's the time of Steven Seagal's movie this is about two reasons why. Plot: fat guy Italian with a great reputation on power gets the wind that a crime group can play around a drug designed by an army to create a final answer to the hero. This persuasion, though attractive and simple, provides an opportunity for some of the above combat events that include stripes through walls like comic book. Did I mention this film that is completely drinking and Steven Seagal is a full joke? yes. I did.
