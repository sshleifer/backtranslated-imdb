Finally I got up to "Starlight" last night on television and everything I can say is. . . wow! It is difficult to know where to start - special effects of hokey (see the laser beams out of the eyes of Willie!), A bad acting, good conversation, misuse of stock photos, or air of great courage takes the whole production. That's a special experience of the kind, and we should all thank you for it. I choose Kayathon Kay as a true successor to Ed Wood!
