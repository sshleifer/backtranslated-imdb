I was very worried about the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick with my stomach and ended closing the movie. How anyone can give this film more of the color of my 1 baffles. I know that the intention of the movie is amazing, but to show the real picture of a dog that was locked the skin (make back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I close after the event with the lost child. I had my eyes covered often until then. It is not surprising that this film was found on bin bargain in HMV. I have no desire to see any movie with this man of Uwe. Anyone who enjoys this requires treatment. Period.
