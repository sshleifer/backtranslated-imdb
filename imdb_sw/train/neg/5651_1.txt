In my life I have seen many great and awesome movies. I am not a professional expert specialist, but I am sure to say something about this. First, these actors are the worst I have seen ... Their work is untrue even you want to throw a DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these participants were not interested in quality. Another bad thing is about these conversations - they are disabled. Sometimes you feel worried when you hear them. It seems that your 14-year-old child can do well. I feel that this film had a budget equivalent to the cost of my European 14-year car. Please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.
