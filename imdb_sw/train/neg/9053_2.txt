In fact, I've got a TV show "Mash" trite, preachy, oh however "proper politics", repeat, pride and bigger of all, and that ,? that is (was) very strange. You have Alan Alda as a great guide, "(star)", who loves you so much by himself and his cunning, that actually makes me feel uncomfortable even trying and staying through part. The preliminary series was McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, who would be glad to admit that he had a certain place and style to present their behavior. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, all together and together are like eating caviar and fresh oysters and Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also got quick, was also not guilty of any incredible looks, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the film when she was tired looking and acting like the show was wearing. See one show a year showed it to me. Jamie Farr was a low shadow "comedy" and not even worth mentioning here. Because I have not given (one) rating, which anyone reading this for now would be wondering, is that the ratings of any kind not only call subjective, but one relative. Television, except for a minority discrimination, is very bad. Talking to them, Mash had the quality of production, (by television standards of the time and today, and so it deserves two. Rob Ritter
