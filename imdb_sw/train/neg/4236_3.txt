Well, if you would like to pop / punk, punk, ska, and a little tad of modern psycholy, then see live performances is on something special to look at. This movie has tons and tons of bandos band, as well as the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as the role of the big half, and many deaths of goofy deaths. It looks like it might be good, right? Well, deaths are coming, and often on many Warp Tour bands and fans in the event. Some of the first stylish deaths, but then used frequently, for a definite repeat. Almost everyone has died because their head is diminished, or the intestines are raised from the womb. Gore looks like it was from Andreas Schnaas' "Zombie 90: Bad Disease"; and this become a "blood type of underwater", but now that movie is decent, and it provides humor-something that this film does not exist. Indeed, the film has been made by Doug Sakmann from Troma, has great budget capabilities, and tries ... but it's very difficult. Everything means being funny in this film, and that's what brings it down. Everything tries to be very good and dirty, using the wrong act, the misuse of unnecessary deaths, and doing the same thing ... from time to time. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board", or any film you have made with your friends: it's funny for those who made it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Great ability, great idea, great use of the effects - but the same ... from time to time: The band has, the dying band, the fans die. Everyone dies, blood is poured everywhere, the process is repeated. The question is for these types of movies - which are 'bad stick' - they are trying too much, or not at all?
