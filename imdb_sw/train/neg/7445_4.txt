A very beautiful drawing with young Roddy McDowall, who teaches wild horses, Flicka's head, and that's the only reason to watch the movie first. It is covered by screaming, widespread music and observation of schmaltzy discussions, this is one of the films that are not available that enables you to achieve headaches. The player named Naffly, Thunderhead, Flicka's son, where McDowall teaches the next generation of nag, is much better than nature but speed is slower and score continues to keep you from presenting, although there are at least one or two scenes that are not available.
