I saw this movie in my international movie class and I had lost from going. This movie is nothing but one event worth a terrible after the next. The 4th man is about the alcohol writer named Reve, who has a vision of his ongoing danger. She meets a woman named Christine while giving a lecture at a local book club, and decides to stay with her when she finds out how her partner is attracted to. To make it clear, Reve likes Dutch column. Therefore, make a plan to mislead Christine's partner to have sex with her. But later he found out that Christine had three older men, all of whom were killed. Now Reve and Christine's partner can be "SON 4." The storyline means with holes no plot. Editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is very good. The movie is just great and I felt the need to vomit in a certain place. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. The movie is opening with Reve getting out of bed in JUST t-shirt. So at the beginning, you see a delightful pecker of the Reve around it while he was moving around his small apartment in a hangover state. Later he has a dream that his pecker is cut off by the second scissors, and they show with the blood source that comes. Reve fondles the image of Jesus and you have homosexual sex in the mausoleum. Plus there is a lot of blood. Blood more than all the Freddy Krueger movies. It's not that I have anything against the "awesome" scenes, but this film is very clear when it is worried. The whole movie spinning the value of shock. If any of this is your cup of tea, check out this film. Otherwise, stay far away from this. My motive is still bad.
