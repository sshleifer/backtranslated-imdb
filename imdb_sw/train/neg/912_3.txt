... for one of the worst Swedish films ... you forgive me for being slow. Before all I did not see first (I was bored is my reason for looking 2 before 1 one), well I hope the first is better than this, was filled with despair and incredible changes , for people who have seen this and think of 4/10 is high (belive me so i), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so strange and still laughing to think a punk that came with this idea, what is "Detective ". Searching is not based on a novel or book is not available often, and this is a perfect example of one. I am going to be honest with you: I laughed a little, You had a good joke in it and a humor of slapstick. But don't give it, rent it. Just let the other idiot do or download it. This movie will be remembered by the director may laugh already ...
