First of all, I am sure that Norway's movies are getting better. From the exciting and exciting emotional films of the 70s and 80s, the local movies began to be a little humorous. Think. The real comedies were made! The movies had begun to get interesting and interesting, as opposed to long, dark, sad and interesting. At 90 and 00 of the most beautiful movies were made by the 'new generation' of film authors. Movie after the movie was proposed by critics and played a lot of money. It was a common thing! <br /> <br /> Then they met ... <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS MINOR * It's just not just funny. Not immediately. It is not forever. But the thing is ... We think its funny. Because we are used by local movies to be funny. Especially and cast like this with a few really funny comedians. But .. They don't say or do anything funny! Do you shout? Show me humor! What are the awkward clerks played by Harald Eia? Is it to abandon the football coach completely uncertain? What is the opinion of Arne Scheie? The movie is not just funny! But that's not my main rant about Union. That's the prediction. (And here I am afraid that the local comedies have been standing since I have seen this in many other movies too.) All the time you know that it will continue well. All characters are similar to those presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets what they deserve to end. There is absolutely no chance of surprise! Everything in all I can say is that I have a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was one movie that made me realize that maybe we need a new blood in a movie to do ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
