The scientist (John Carradine - sadly) knows how to raise the dead. However they return to marble faces. Finally all of this causes disaster. The worst, predictable for 1940 years. This was very scared when I was a child but just buy it now. I had to strive to stay awake! For one exception, acting is bad. Uncomfortable executives! You have no hope. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, in spite of the script, actually provides very good performance. And there is a short time waiting for the spirit of the Great Dane to walk through the walls. There is also one of the most significant obstacles in the history of the movie. However, there is nothing that enjoys living in this way. Avoid.
