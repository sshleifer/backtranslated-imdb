This film is predictable; it's beyond predicting then Vinnie Testaverdi pass, when he scoops the ball to the Jets. One saw the end reaching half through the film. Politics reminds me when I returned to the east. Most people know when the adjustment has entered. I have given this four for acting, but the story is lame.
