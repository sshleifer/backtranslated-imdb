Ben's daughter out of town has confirmed his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring her killer to justice, but she is close to Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of waswolf worship. So Ben, a good friend of his sister and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put an end to these evil. <br /> <br /> This is a bad thing for B-grade very much and I wondered how it was released. It makes the original 'lament' looks like a jewel. What did Christopher Lee think of, as this is his worst work I saw. There were many errors with this real cheap film, compared to hammy and wood exhibitions from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forget Lee), the style of cheesy (those sunnies), cheap and special evil, misuse of lighting, humor ... if there were any, the music of the 80s (and some films just redirected to an unknown band play), waswolf's having orgies that are seeing it and the tiresome story with flat and angry conversations. I thought it was so bad that it would be strange funny, but I was wrong. Life was a place and the layout of the film seemed to be good, but that's about ... I will actually add a short-term withdrawal of Sybil Danning as well. At the end of the band, they sing their house song during an extraordinary scene of the film from the film, which I deal with why? <br /> <br /> The worst animal, however, is not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
