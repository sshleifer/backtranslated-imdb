Penn takes time to develop its characters, and we almost care about them. However there are real problems and stories here, we do not see the real incentive of the bad conduct of the poor, and the time line is hit. It is said to be set in 1963, the music is 60s / 70s early. Reference and dialogue are 70s / 80s. The strength of the power comes, and Penn allows to avoid. But even with all these problems it is worth looking, but it's not good.
