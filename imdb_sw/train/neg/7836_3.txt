The first period put the bar on the way I thought. It had a star and William Hurt as a sick-infected person to kill a toymaker. We are given very little information about his behavior or who is paying him to kill, in fact the part is known for having no conversation. Returning to a modern modern house he is offered a bag with a toy soldier, this gives him a smile but he rejects it and goes on his business. But he is the night of hell, the soldiers are alive and they are going to fight, drive jeeps, gun guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters. Special effects are good for the TV show and it becomes as long as he dodges around the apartment using his live wits, sometimes getting the upper hand and sometimes not. I will destroy them but they should say that it was a little wise. This gave me hope for a series of successes but I was in a desperate situation, all other events were garbage and I lost interest with one fourth. Stephen King changes are always a mixed package and these are not discriminatory
