If you really should watch this film because your girl is in a romantic relationship, then be a young man. But prepare yourself to bring your hp if it comes with radio. <br /> <br /> After watching the best movies such as Arisan (2003), it's scared to see what they come back in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is money, but no one is so visible by working in the shape of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. That is the world 'international' does not seem to come in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian community gives everything that has been presented as 'Made Indonesia' with the western flavor, they leave. Well, the story is good to start. And it can be developed in a good flick. But the director did not think about the fact that the music you need to first all the music or at least good play, and second good choreography? In this film, play is BAD SO that makes you want to cry right there on the movie. Every single word you hear is followed by LATER seconds with an actor or playing player, and it is very scary when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Publications are if they planned to arrange a film about morning exercises, but eventually they thought it would be nice to turn that music ... They forgot to simply change the choreography. It's hard to play when you see, jump here and there, throw their feet on the air, and that's up to it. <br /> <br /> Well, there's a fun end .... But if you can persuade your partner that good candle food is more romantic, do it!
