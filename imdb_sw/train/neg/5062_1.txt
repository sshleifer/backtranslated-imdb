This movie is wonderful. Better set, is "freakin 'weird". I could give you a summary of the plot, or another analysis of the hoity, but I would consider losing your time. Anyone who has to know about this film is two young sisters, good killings, suicide, after abortion, and actually disgusting. At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go to the bath to wash your dirt on your own, but it's not a good way after the "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It is if you are a young person (or secondary school being myself a teenager) and I have just done something A: you want you to do, and B: hope for a Good Heavenly Lord and a world that your parents don't know about. And no one likes it. My suggestion is that instead of undermining your mind and looking at a piece of filth of movies, then waste your time on a little bit of horror and look at "Kazaam" (yes, I'd like to watch "Kazaam" than "Murder Murder", read it what you want).
