If you have seen the film and preview of Rodney Dangerfield, you will discover several of the jokes made in this amazing dreck piece. Written as sitcom, this film fails to attack anything interesting around, from an independent doctor played with a sexy-like-chopped Molly Shannon liver to 'I am fat, and so it's funny' John Linette. Its own 5 seem to be enough, and if this was done as a pilot for a series of action-adventure, it would have worked. Rather, it comes as a male fantasy that strives hard to be incorrect in politics.
