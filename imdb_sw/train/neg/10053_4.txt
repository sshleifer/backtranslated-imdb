The death of a young girl is found to be lost all possible means of identity. When it found that one foot was longer than the other, it is thought that the body of the daughter is not there. After this sadness, the couple divorces and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and causes an amazing presence. All these changes in one day, many years later, gets a phone call from his daughter! With the help of an old striker and a journalist, he makes a trip to decide if his daughter is alive. "Los Sin Number" is an aggressive theory, it goes at a slower rate, and is not quite suitable. The grace of saving is Emma Vilarasau, who works best as a desperate mother. The best part of the film is the end, but I do not know it is necessary to strengthen all the film. Beware of the headlines for English release of the most recent R1 - they are not very accurate.
