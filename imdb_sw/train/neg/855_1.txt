It's not the best of the films today. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and I was expecting to be very good. But this film was broken. Sounds and surroundings were good, but there was no story here. It did not have one time of fear. I expected to be a lively exciting movie, but there was no thriller of fear. The only part I was afraid was during the change of the chapter showing "Wednesday". There are many pieces I movie. Many things have been left unnoticed by anything to connect with anything. The story does not tell us about women or other events shown. It is possible to be a good movie to look at 80 years, but not for the 21st century.
