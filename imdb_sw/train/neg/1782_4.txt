A good boy and his mother move to the center of any city, cat and death soon follow them. That's about making it. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I was a bit given by the cat after seeing this movie. But with all the weight despite many things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is a lot of that going around, generally it's a very enjoyable experience to see. <br /> <br /> Anime is more like caricatures here and just their natural nature of dependence. Fear, lust, lust or anger seems to be all that motivates these people. Although it may be observed that it seems to fail, in fact, it uses the story of the story. The original cluster is the fact that it is Stephen King screenplay (not that I anything special against Mr. King) is quite well supported by some interesting FX function, makeup and music quite suitable. The full Gem of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldworld mother. <br /> <br /> The King can take a simple outdoor story, or people who are a little different (the same - a lot in this case), trying to get in and make it into the campy on the top of the awesome gem that should be in A collection of any fan of fear.
