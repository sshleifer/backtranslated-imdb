In general the most desperate picture. Very humble builds a basic story. The role of Maria Schrader to find her family hidden behind. (Every take it seems to last forever. No sound in the film.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is saved from the Nazis, and the German woman, played by Katja Riemann. Ruth's entire character is direct, so it is normal. *** SPOILERS END *** The film reduces and returns between the current day of New York and Berlin and Berlin 40s something. Please when you do, make the audience an indication of how long the story is done. There is no clear indication of time? very angry. The bad part is, the end. *** SPOILERS *** The show both and jabber over the Jews have so much suffered, just for a monopoly accident! Give me a break. How did the Jews go from Rosenstrasse? The question of who gave the Jews no answer. What is the Goebels released? Lean Fischer slept with Goebels? In Venice film won the acting award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I don't know. Is it a Jewish theme?
