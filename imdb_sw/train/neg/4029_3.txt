The story behind MISSILE LOST is not so bad, but unfortunately the story gets very little in the middle and the misuse of stock photos as well as the poor special effects of this film are low. <Br /> <br /> The movie begins with a missile in the world. For fear because it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviet can erase something. This is not very good, however, if this trick seems to be unlikely it has a steam way that destroys everything in its way. In other words, and every pass makes, swing of death follows - one that can possibly kill us all !! So, it is for the good American scientists (led by Robert Loggia very little and unknown) to formulate and plan a plan to save us - and especially to save New York which is located on its fast trip! Unfortunately, they can't save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't say if this is a great loss) but because of the old American know, they can finally destroy this barrier of destruction! So, as you can see, the idea of ​​a story is not bad and instead of nature. But, many parts of the aircraft fighters and manning radar scopes get old and it seemed like padding. In general, a very decent but realistic film which the extreme fans of the kind can love - all others, see it for your own risk.
