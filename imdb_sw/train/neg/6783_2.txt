It seems to be an amazing number of 8-10 stars here from people who have never written the IMD inspections before or since. Due to the very low level of the film given by others, I think you can implement your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad film. I will accept it, I thought this idea was kind of good, and I was glad to see the actors who played Eve and Harmony on Angel getting a job, but it didn't take long for the film to make itself known. Action: Leadership seemed to have enough power, but everyone else? Horror. <br /> <br /> Plot: Chock full of big holes enough to drive through. <br /> <br /> Trends: None. <br /> <br /> Humor: What do you do? really think people are going to laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Okay. there were very good women in this film. It's not just three female characters, but it's similar to the board. It was as if the producers expected an animal environment that would prevent them from finding out how everything else was wrong. If yes, they have failed wrong. <br /> <br /> In this right hands can be beautiful but classic classic camping. It wasn't too close.
