"Farmer" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's a show: Solid is another contest, faced with hatred, etc. Maybe maybe the idea of ​​stupidity created; almost become worthy at the prison for authors. One version showed the product to the club, trying to pick up the girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of the 22 minutes of Andy Rooney, followed by death and steak knives through midget cups. For those who haven't seen this show, here's an example of the conversation: "You are sure you are right to go out with a caveman." "Yes, that's good. I've been like 10 - a thousand!" Hilarious ... The possibility of writing the best I ever preached. <br /> <br /> 22 hours of evil cemeteries, dealing with difficult social issues ... Sounds like a night of entertainment. I also love the recent wrong ideas that they have decided to make sitcom out of car insurance ads. I wonder if they are going to do the next Gecko, so I can have a new name for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say that this is worse than "Viva Laughlin." At least "Viva Laughlin" was broken from something that was moving. It seems like this makes me hope that there is a winner somewhere that has a World goal. <br /> <br /> (Unable to trust ...)
