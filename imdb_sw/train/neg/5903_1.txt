I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, why did I give this movie? Well because I live in Utah and I think it would be nice to see the places I knew on the film. I really knew to go into it that I was not going to get a local joke so I was not surprised when I sat down with an effort on the heads of the head. What I was surprised was the incompatible Mormon acts that were placed on this film. I know it's a Mormon film, which deals with members of the LDS Church, but I've found it to hate because of the example of people who are not of their faith. None of them are Mormon, who were not many, drunk, smoked and had a fantastic perspective, why? That actually took me off this film, made them in Moroni being very clean, but some of the state of Utah I think it's filled with punk psychos because they don't follow the LDS Church's literature. I can understand that there are squares around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was Mormon 100%, which is not close to reality. And as I said, non-Mormons in the film were shown as drinking jerks, please! I think I can't find it because it's not their faith and I think I've never been a love.
