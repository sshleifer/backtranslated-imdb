Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. The film tries to cross the Heathers and bring it to failure. When I saw him last January I was so hated by the film that I walked and talked on my female phone to my partner for the last half of the movie. I have heard that the DVD has a cut of the director maybe I will look at it, but this trash movie of PG-13 is s *** and the worst kind of ***. Maybe if the film had a T&A that would have made it right. But the gags are lame and acting is awesome. Worse than Troma film.
