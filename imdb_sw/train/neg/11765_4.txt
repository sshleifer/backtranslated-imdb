You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Sophia, a good line and that would be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same as the movie Hallmark. Here we find ninety years old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, she is not dead as we thought. Ernie, she is a bad person who married Ethel Merman a few years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps first feet and shows Mrs. that the buttons and her grandkid will lose long. We've seen it before. You can enjoy this film but please do not say that you did not warn.
