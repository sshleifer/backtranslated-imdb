Karin Mani's futility project (Who?), Like Charles Bronson who was moving around and removing the 'blow' which he made his parents, grandparents or something, and impressed a few with his Karate skills. In the usual area she intervenes to stop rape and moron custody of her jail, so after two cool swimming events and another prison-dyke fraud she needs to take the law in her own blah blah blah. I think there were many movies like this? Script is dumber than usual if you can believe it. Mani comes as a kind of showbiz that could produce the death of the necessary death, and I see that it is very appealing, but the movie is improper material. Strong workers will be destroyed in laundry duties here, and will completely destroy the incredible DA and the judge who should be the uncle of the producers.
