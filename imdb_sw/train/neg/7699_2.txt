I expected the comedy as a movie "Big Mama". Instead, the film was a wonderful mix of comedy, drama and love story. <br /> <br /> This movie has three squares: first involves Madea and she will take a little baby. The second involves a woman who is linked to a rich person who uses her. The third involves the relationship between one mother and 2 children and one father. <br /> <br /> There is really a little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of lost messages in the film. For example, Madea hits a grandson for the corridor (through comedic), to convince the child to remove. The child does, in fact, turned himself. It seems, you pay for hitting children. <br /> <br /> There are plots involved with child rape (with mother's permission). There are cases with older people who use young girls associated with them. (Ogling takes place in the reconciliation of the family.) Movie jumps from the plot to plot the plot that always has balance. Is this comedy, love story, or drama? In fact, there is nothing ... except waste time and money.
