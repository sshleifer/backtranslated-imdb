This is a good idea for the film but, unfortunately, does not come to be a great movie. What begins as a sweet romantic and almost sweet taste of Fluffer with love and her vines of Fluffee out of control in a wonderful mix of forms and hub huts, and by voluntary borrowing from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS , FRISK, and even the curious "dash" of BLOWS 400 has been thrown to the end. (At least the director did his inquiry!) The result is not interesting but, at the end, this well-planned flick is not quite clear. However, all actors are working on the game and the material and there is a good baby to laugh at the back of the sex image. <br /> <br />
