I saw this movie for several main reasons that Mira Sorvino. And he on the cast could not be too bad. And it even looked like it was secret and Olivier Martinez was his partner at the time and was good at 'Unfaithful'. The story has been put in Spain so that it can be an entertaining film with one of my loved ones. If you think about one thing I would like to warn you: this is very bad, not interesting, boring movies. One invention that comes to mind is wrong. The story is included with many plots that do not add anything to the description. They are trying to create a slasher / thriller to look at fascism in Spain but they are very defeated. The elements are not trusted and the observations are called cause. <br /> <br /> Anime is a thin paper! I don't care about anyone. In addition they are angry and hateful people. <br /> <br /> Act is angry. Mira what is wrong with you? Why Mira? You are the winner of oscar! Keep respect! His behavior was weak but that is not the reason for the worst. He seems to be sleeping for a long time. Come to think, I really think I saw her eyes slowly fast in some scenes. I used to think this woman was sexy. Well he isn't here. If you want to look at some skin try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And the same emphasis? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is the worst. It's very painful to remember his performance to describe here. Sorry but I can't. I've had enough suffering and this waste. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is facing! It's so bad for every way it is wonderful how it was done. The lousy team produce a lousy script and make money on the name of the actor. Don't fall for it. Avoid! <br /> <br />
