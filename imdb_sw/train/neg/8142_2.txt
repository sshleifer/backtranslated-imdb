After being bitten by a donkey in a cave, a doctor named John Beck has a dramatic change in a male creature. he thinks John is responsible for several gruesome killings. "The people of Bat" and Jerry Jameson are one of the most horrible films. so mind-numbing boring that you will scratch your head to a total of unbelief after suffering through it.
