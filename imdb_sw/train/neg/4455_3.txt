Where to start? Okay, compare this film to fight with the club for start-ignorance. If it was a patch of club, violence, blood, etc., it would be more obvious and true. Second, this film is not a football factory - which is very real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like a disgrace). Well enough, the story of the story is decent and the events of the fight are well - and the end I can add. But the film is generally poor, very poor. If people have been saying meditation should not destroy the film - unacceptable - or a simple mistake of giving, or lack of teaching a voice has caused the film to persuade them all the way - it was clear from one American / Geordie area playing a role. Do not do wrong, a good person, who seems to have a head of the skin - but no soligan of football. I could go forever on how ignorance of the soccer area was - a 'fake' situation. Also, when GSE is going to play in the North Union, it may go on the train just waiting for 3 of them - it doesn't mean anything - this is the real sticks of sticks and strokes, which are shown in the film mickey rats for 5 people. Have West Ham and Milwall not played for the last few years have been in the championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would just waltz on the company's Milwall pub. Basically, the worst films that people would like if they have a little real football, and terrorism. If you really love football and you are interested in the world of destruction, you'll just feel like this film has criticized your mind. Ross George
