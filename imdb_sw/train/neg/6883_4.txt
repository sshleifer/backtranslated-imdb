I am of Puertorican origin, I had a mixed mix of this "document". First I was angry that Ms Perez compared to Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. It is also just a fact of truth, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not a native of Puertorican. His parents came from Columbia. Whomever did research on this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race depends on education. This message should be improved in this film, Education is our road to freedom and power I think any future efforts of this production team should do so as their goal. In my opinion, this film was opposed to anti-US feelings.
