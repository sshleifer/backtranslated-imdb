I watched the film recently and resembles that book. I blame this on bad screenplay and direction. Some parts were developed effectively (the area of ​​rape) for no apparent reason. I mainly read the book after watching the movie and 20 years or more after reading for the first time. I found it difficult to read and much less. Many different views are provided for any benefit at all times ... except for the best places for a while. If it covers things that seemed 'sensitive', say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination produced at that time. That is no longer the same or maybe I see different things now or less of both. The film tries to cover many things from the book, the result is a combination of events that can be meaningful to the person reading the book. However this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should not be made.
