I enjoy watching western films but this film takes biscuits. Script and talk are delicious. Acting was bad, where did you get from? Music was the same as saying. Luckily I didn't buy or rent a movie but now installed. I was created at the beginning when a stranger (martin sheen) began to tell her story. I agree that I enjoyed the struggle between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong had touched the Tex and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But that's where all that was mentioned after that. I had to watch the entire film in the hope that it would be better, it had never done.
