This was a bad waste of my time. There is no plot. Acting was far from the bottom, it should be used as an example in the act of doing without doing. It is only a shortage of the original Universal Army, which also drives down the acting barrel. It is sad that VD needs to confirm ego every few years, and still sad that people will pay good money to stay. This kind of schlock offers movies of Martial Arts bad name. For comparison, it makes Segall, Norris, and Arnold look closely talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should take Leslie Nielson tracks and send-ups of its kind. At least then we can laugh at him instead of seeing him.
