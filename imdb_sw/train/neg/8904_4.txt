I myself loved the "prophecy" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as it was always, good, and though the film was not innocent, it was an awesome and original film of Horror / Fantasy. This end of 1998 still has to look at, but especially due to Walken. Walken is one of the largest actors, in my opinion, and again is the best in the position of Gabriel's Great Fall, who plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between the dead and faithful angels is brought to the earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of the baby, ie the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could be a decisive reason for the war of heaven ... As I said above, Christopher Walken has been as good as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, however, "Prophecy II" sadness also includes a group of terrible characters. Valerie's behavior was terrible, and Danayel heard me even more. The great pain in the ass, however, was Izzy's behavior (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicide girl. Still, Walken's performance is not only the quality of film redemption. The whole film is completely dreary, and is shot in dark colors, which contributes much to the atmosphere. The vision of Gabriel's resurrection at the beginning is far more amazing, and one of the most cool moments in any "Prophetic" film. "Prophecy II" is still the most weakened in three films of "Prophecy" and Walken. Certainly Christopher Walken-man-show, entertainment, but no more of it.
