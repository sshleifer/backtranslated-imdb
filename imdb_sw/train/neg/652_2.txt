I think it was an overrated crap overrated! Of course the performance of the SNOW BRITTANY was good and other others like the ELBA IDRIS were also good, but the other young people in prom if the leading friends were not so persuasive. The murderer was dumb and appeared to be stupid too. Deaths were stupid, miserable and abnormal. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It was not quite stressful, I almost slept. His second PG-13 view, is really an amazing movie of IMO. The end was stupid and the cliff was running very fast and it was disturbing. The movie is pretty slow too. In general the only good thing about this futile foot is maybe a BRITTANY SNOW I think he gave a good performance with the ELBA IDRIS also, but rather that it was the worst movie and bad remake. That's just my opinion. I paid 2/10.
