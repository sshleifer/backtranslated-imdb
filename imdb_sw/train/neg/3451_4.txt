Frank Sinatra was far from the best actor in the west. He was a good actor, From Here Forever and a Man with a gold hand is proof that, but he did not have a physique of the western hero, you know him to be a man of cities. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame the two things: a) The story was very unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra lives more like a stupid person than a hero in the movie. In the kind that people expect a particular model, stop off the film should be very good. b) The story cannot convince, it is hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do whatever she wants just because they are afraid of her brother. Also when someone shows a special holster that will open the side so far it is not good to pick a gun that is surprising that if that makes him fail, why did all the fighters not accept it? I think this film should not be removed, because any film and Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its limitations it is still fun.
