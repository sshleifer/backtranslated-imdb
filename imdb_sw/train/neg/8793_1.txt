For those who decide whether to watch or not watch this movie and read these comments with insight, I first give these four words: Don't waste your time! "Chungking Express" was photographed, stuck together quickly and looked like though it was created in full with someone standing on the Hong Kong Burger King line. I can't remember looking at the film and ensuring the characters of the same type are trying to work through this mundane script! It is an incredible effort and discussion of ignorance philosophy (one walks in his flooded apartment and gives a wonderful revelation that "tears can be dried up with tissue, but water takes time to wipe"). Such behavior seems to focus on deep relationships with greedy, soap, animal stuff, dirt, etc.. The old shaky work, which walks by hand, was another thing that I heard that I could do without. And if that is not enough to make you pop up on your popcorn, we hear the old 60 "California Dreaming" and Mamas and Papas blaring on the sound of constant voice during a long sequence. Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through its Rolling Thunder Productions Company, although I can't for my life know what a person with his talent will suffer. He was known to have said, "I am happy to love this movie very much." However, most of us, hope will have the attention to make his listeners happy and more valuable in the future.
