This movie showed more hatred of the Jews and David Mamet than I have <br /> <br /> you have ever met with American film. Sterotypes are more advanced that my ability to keep looking has died. I was so desperate for Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna called the men's call, sitting in the weapons of cleaning between the Jews in New York, heros that common sense had won and I finished. I am a deep-knot / thought that the Jews are not Americans and "different". I advise that Mr. Mamet is one of the reasons for hate is not the nurse of the same.
