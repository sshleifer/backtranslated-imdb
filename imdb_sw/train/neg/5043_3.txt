I am a great fan of Ziyi Zhang and I will go to any film to see which is what took me on the Purple Butterfly. I also wanted to love this film, agree with many others who have told it. It is very mixed and also very slow. Because all the films are seen with a hand-used camera, much of it is not out of focus. <br /> <br /> The movie has very short conversations and what does not tell you a lot. There are endless cases of people standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room waiting for a chat. The way to change the film is also very mixed and hard to follow. Even after reading a number of reviews before and having a general view of the film, I still had a hard time understanding what was going on. I knew before the film was not too far from the old Ziyi Zhang movies but it was hoping to see him in something different but unfortunately I was desperate. He never screamed in this film though legitimate at all times he has no exciting thing on. I could do without sex incidents as if they were not having sex and without any obvious feeling among the participants you would like to get.
