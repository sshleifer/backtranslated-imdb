Yes, I'm sitting in anything, God knows why. It was daylight, I had nothing to do, it was cold out, right, all of it is excuse because they are the only one I have. I gave 4 dark stars out of 10 possible - I saw the worst movie, but this is definitely directly in the old old filmdom bad - poor script, bad acting, bad lights, and special effects cheesy. <br /> <br /> Story story, which will not be quite meaningful, refers to this very simple family, Daddy, Mother, and little girl - that I think the viewer should be "identify" and, all three were interesting and stimulating. You just want the dark side to find each of them. <br /> <br /> Dad is a cook who hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who also owns that he was bought in the "wonderful" East. Rubin puts it on the plane and describes it as "Darkling". At the time of the film, the darkness is described as 3 or 4 different objects: the shadow without a person, the deep darkness that exists all of us, and the devil. Therefore, choose any of these notes to suit your face - because you believe me, you are worthless. The biggest problem of darkness seems to be a desire to have a friend - it gets a friend of man - and ultimately not worthy of man. This, of course, leads to enormous wealth, followed by disaster, for man who joins The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for some of us - it only leads to a very long, stimulating movie. <br /> <br />
