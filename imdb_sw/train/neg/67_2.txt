From the beginning, the political topic of this film is very obvious and extremely handed, that the result is quite predictable. Any textbook for writing the screenplays for the design of the characters, inserting the character's instructions, and the form of the three action. In this film you will see yet. Police are baddies, and therefore are shown as inferior, powerless and worried. It does not seem to happen to the creators of this film that the police can be a decent citizen who feel to join the police as a good way to contribute to social welfare. The viewer has no opportunity to create his ideas on whether Ned Kelly is a good person or a skeptical woman. The movie opens with him when he is caught by stealing horses, but we can't get a clue about guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the door of Gaol, but just knowing that he has been in for three years when we get this information later in other discussions. This movie has many Ned shots that look at the camera with good words. I have seen that film is a real job of watching. It is a trend of modern films, and this puts me off looking again.
