I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's very strange. The woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has broken the front of the real estate office. What happens? Office manager comes out and gives him a job! Hilarious! Another thing you know two women go there. Yep, they are elite! There is no real ring in this "Life of Women who have nothing better to do" movie. Clunky's discussion as "I don't want to use all my life experiences if I had a chance to have fun and not take it" did not help. There is a rich woman, far away who rejects her new daughter's new relationship. The red girl of sassy - unknown that in 2003, the film available where there is a beautiful girl of sassy. Hattie McDaniel must go to her grave. The woman has a husband who leaves out and wants the protection of young children. Sheesh! No cliche is provided.
