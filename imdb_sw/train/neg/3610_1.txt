The patient avoids from a mental hospital, killing one of his guards and then a university professor after making his way to university. Next Saturday, instead of late prof and a new group of students should deal with the murder of a new murder. Talk is so clich√©d is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. This is one of the cheapest movies that have been put together in the '80' slasher era. With killing the heroine away, this is just junk down. Worst horror, bad script, terrible effects, terrible terrible awesome! "Splatter University" is just a gunk set in your VCR when there is nothing better to do, although I recommend watching your head cleaner tape, which will be more entertaining. Skip and lease "Girl Nite Out" instead. It is tested for Rough Violence, Violence, Shortness and Sexual Offenses.
