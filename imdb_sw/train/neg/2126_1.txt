Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to throw him as a romantic sexual leadership. The fact that he plays so well, he believes effectively, and throws us into that very part just to make him more obvious. In more time (with the girl at the train station, in the last number with Rosie), I could not take my eyes because she had so much refused. You continue to expect to stop the good-guy act and start playing. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. different in different situations than any other music I've ever seen.
