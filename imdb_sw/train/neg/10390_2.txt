I just disappeared and watched this film to see what is being discussed. So here's what my opinion is. It seems easily that this is a small film budget and poor actors. The main mark of this movie is about a woman to take revenge for her fighters. This concept if well done can be easy to be a stimulating film. However, the film does not accuse or bother me completely. Just hit me. This movie can be reduced to less than 45 minutes. Most displays are particularly filling time, like scenery events and some scenes I described below. ************ It has a spoiler ***** ******* I find rape cases. I don't know if I have checked the cut or laptop version, if there is such a version. I have also found many holes of conspiracy within a written plot. Here is a list on my mind. Why the fighters did not build Jennifer at night when he came out of his house to find out what the noise was. That will be a good time. Why not just community members ask him, instead of delaying some pleasure fighters and expanding Jennifer's problem for a long time. It may be more surprising and offensive. I thought it was too ridiculous that the fighters left him in the forest and returned to his home. Perhaps to show that these fighters are true. These casualties should know at least that if you want to do the dirt work, they should not send a malware to work. <Br /> <br /> Why did Jennifer not call police when the fighters finally left? Which should be the first thing that comes into the minds of many people, especially to the person who is the author. Why did these fighters not feel angry far away when they saw Jennifer alive? I find it very strange that a young woman like Camille can fetch a tree and trust her. ************************ Ends spoiler ************ <br /> But hey, this movie is not eligible , Camille Keaton is good and I get to hear one of the funniest line that I felt when Matthew protested to enter home and kill Jennifer, 'Why me? Why me, I've never even !!!
