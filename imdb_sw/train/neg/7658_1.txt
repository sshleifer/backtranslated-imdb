Own in Darkness is a kick of Uwe Boll in nuts for Hollywood after the Punch House of the dead in the face. <br /> <br /> If anything proves how much manipulator master Boll. After imposing Artisan out of business on the flop which was the House of the Dead, one can only assume the most reliable Lion Gate Film only released AITD under the obligation of the contract after obtaining the property of Artisan. Because AITD is the most outstanding example of the lack of the film's ability, the representation of the compound and stealing completely from other movies because it was supposed to appear cold rather than being locked into the film system. But that's what it means, it's not. Boll does not try to do the film because it does not try to lead alone in the dark. He just tries to run Hollywood. Alone in the dark, like the House of the Dead, Siege of the Prisoner, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and other 3 or 4 projects that are "advertised" or "production". <br /> <br /> These are not directed movies, but investment portfolios. Each of them rushed into the lowest production assumption that the tax laws Boll and its investors use could be closed within 2 to 3 years. More bomb projects that can be released into that frame, more money he and his investors can get. Why are you bothering to make a good movie when bad movie makes you mint even though? The result is the cinema as the evil of its own in the dark. It is only in the dark, as all its other movies are the shameless exploitation of Hollywood's current films. And for those who support Boll by calling him not to be heard or Ed Ed next, he thanked him for making a statistical figure from that person, making it easier for him to find investors but to give him an understanding. <br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s= & threadid = 21699 As aside, don't just ask how she gets her list. Unless the participants enter the investment scam somehow, the mystery is still open.
