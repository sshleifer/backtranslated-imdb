A very sluggish film is filled with a bunch of stupid and external Jewish records. It was a great movie but could not be taken seriously. A known movie route ... Be the right place at the wrong time. A small way of concern, involving Kim Bassinger. It is very robotic and also replenished. I have found that al Pacinos's ability to work seems to be falling. Troubleshooter and trouble, but nothing is more important than the Atlanta catalyst of Pacinos. Control of damage you need to fix this damage to the film. Well my single one is bad, but it's not as bad as that in this film. This film is not only boring but it is also a challenge. Usually a rebellious film appears to be wrong. This movie is unknown. I could stay this way. The plan, if well written, and, perhaps the best work to remove the terrible chaos, and even the dumber joke, would pull this excitement from the houses. What we are left is a light, solution that ensures that it is locked in our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. It is a shame for all the good Jewish people everywhere.
