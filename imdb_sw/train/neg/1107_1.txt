I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "amazing! This would be nice!" I wasn't right. All stories were closed. Actually I haven't found it yet. I only appear that all the actors did is drinking, smoke (opium?) And having sex. Not that those are not good features of the film, but please! Where was the story? I made myself to finish the movies, and yes, it was gone to the end, but at that time the movie was close. Buy if you want. Don't just believe behind the box.
