I really hate this show! I was looking at one place, and I knew that this show is awesome. The story line was not written badly by the joke is very bad ... I mean it's just sh ++ removal of the Dexter's lab and Johnny Quest, '' the obnoxious boy and the hot hair with his tooth sister and the dog talking ; The father of staying at home with a mother, very strong ... Like oh-my-flippin-God! Their father is a mother-f ** k 'crazy-maker, not that so gay! If my father is the founder of the home, I would die! The same shame is ... I really would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else about this ... this travesty but only 3 word; Count the three words to describe: <br /> <br /> · Fall, · Clash, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say people, it's definitely making my list of the worst series of EV-ER series! If I had one that is.
