DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I like good movies (not on a lot of baseball, but hey, sports movies, right? I expected more of this film. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {who I don't really know} is as good as a damaged star. The role of Barkin, to me, was the same. He is a good actor, but he appeared out of place in this role. To me, he always seemed to rush into events, and then he drew a little place. It seemed just that I wasn't right! I scored '4', and I was generous ~ I am tough with numbers!
