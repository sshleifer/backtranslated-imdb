The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only thing about this movie. Unfortunately that's quite positive I can say about this western movie. I should write another eight lines in my opinion will be sent, but there are more than 8 rough lines in this western. I don't know if the film was rent for Along Blood, or just spoof. Brave and villain in this movie were also plastic. Not really. Many workers who helped in this film seemed to be correct, but the shooting scenes were joke. The original advertiser thought that this film was good, and in the opinion it took a cheap shot to President Bush. This was not democratic or northern. It was the only western western movie that can be sold to business. I wonder if it has made money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by university students. If so, then it was a great movie.
