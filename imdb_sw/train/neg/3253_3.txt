I actually saw China O'Brien II before ever seeing China original O'Brien. And we must say that the first body is worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = best. If you are a fan of bad films like me, this is a good material. If, however, you are looking for any meaningful program, ability to act, or the filming skills, this is best avoided. The best part is how they have published all the order of fighting in a fast forward. Hilariously bad. Look at laughter, look for unintelligent entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on TV.
