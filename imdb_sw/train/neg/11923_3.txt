Illegal immigrants reject the social support system that results in many consequences. It has been done and implemented well though the story is a little forced, but pacing slower actually puts off the conclusion. Feeling lost in the big city has been done successfully. A little lost person in a big community is something we can all involve, but I can't approve it out of your way to see this film.
