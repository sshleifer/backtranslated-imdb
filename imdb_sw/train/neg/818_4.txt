This film is known for three reasons. First, it seems to have the potential of the two serial achievements of 'Superman', this feature of the planned and released budget at the exhibition, indicating George Reeves 'and Phyllis Coates' previews as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. The opening part is used again in the series. Outside of the city of Silby, the deep fuel of six miles goes into 'Earth's holes' allowing 'Mole-Men' to come up. Forget about other holes (what is on the plot). Secondly, unlike most of the SF's massive fifty-year anniversary, the hero has great power (and control) in preaching and strengthening endurance and accepting differences against a large group of segregationist defenders. No 'good journalist' here! Clark Kent, a skilled and independent, takes control of the situation ("I will handle this!"), Even help in a hospital coat during the removal of a shot from the Mole-Man! As Superman, he is much better than Clark towards Lois a decent, but it is also a voice of reason and patience as he drives against vigilantes as "Nazi storm troopers." Third, you will see that the change from Fleisher-like cartoon flying animated to Superman in the two serial for 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of Superman' has never been made.
