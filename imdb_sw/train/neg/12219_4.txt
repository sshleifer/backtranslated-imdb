This was a wonderful movie. It started very well. The sound of a strong voice behind pictures of the cloud and the violence as our psychopath did its thing. Here comes the "drop" Here I can say that I was in a real "B" movie. The worst act, I mean is hard to hold a gun and act like a soldier? These could not. After the death scene of our psychopath we find the opening of the opening and the movie begins ... <br /> <br /> From this point it is bad to do big boobs, regular blood buckets and bad death scenes. <br>> <br /> He said I have given four movies because despite his mistakes he kept a kind of culture that I can only shake completely. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie but I must admit I seem to be worse.
