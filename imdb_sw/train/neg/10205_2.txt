So, I am wondering when watching this film, did the producers of this movie save money for the Sandra Bullock wardrobe to dismiss her clothes "before" from Miss Congeniality? Did Mrs. Bullock also get sleepy by opening "before" Gracie Hart? Many viewers have previously noted, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the experience of viewers of the deja seen by the character of Cassie Maywether as Gracie Hart a little lighter and more stories back and quickly become snooze fest. Two bad guys have been done before (and better) in other films. If he has "a good partner trying to protect his partner despite evidence" the behavior has been shown earlier. In fact, none of the characters in the film had more than two tests or try to be anything but just. Kill one person - even if it was an earlier murder - it will not make you a serial killer. You may be able to become a casual killer but not a serial killer or even a murderer.
