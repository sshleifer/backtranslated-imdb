... then they will have a good chance to open this trick. Sorry, not "secret" as it said, is a religious-jumbo-jumbo. I continued to wait for "unintentional evil" that promised me, but "evil" in this flick would have been unthinkable for five years and learning disabilities. I can't believe that they actually managed to get a bigger name for the characters who want to participate in this shame. Unfortunately, it has changed my opinion about them forever, and I will avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also being tested a little now that I now have the name of the author and the name of the director to consider if I will have to avoid anything they do as a blow since now. It is really lucky that all religious artists put here and say that this film is 10 out of 10, etc.. you will get their first feedback. This can cause many people to be misled, as I was, to believe this movie was nothing but a religious preaching. Well, it's far from the video store to get my money for false advertising. Unfortunately they can't come back to 105 minutes I lost this look thinking that it was really horror Hollywood / odd film.
