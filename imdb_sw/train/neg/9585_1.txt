I remember watching this film behind 86 'when it happened first & it's a bad film. Acting was the rage of the plot was flimsy or would have to be lost by the breath of the wind. I think I sleep more than one incident and I wasn't tired that I remember. Please avoid at all the best cost you still have all your teeth taken without cos anesthetic which will be more entertaining. It's just a pity I can't give them zero or negative marks. I would never lose my money to get this from all the video store I can say is that the tape was still a new product without surprising if the film was too bad. If I remember the right sitting and looking at the girl I had loved to go out and the fact that she was sitting next to me still didn't have enough to keep me awake that is this bad film was.
