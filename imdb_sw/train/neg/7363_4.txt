The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that Erika Eleniak in it. She is sexy as always, but she plays the second fiddle to lead the Wolf Wolf Larson. It's compassionate, because he has more power to act than he allowed to show here. Much of the film has endless barriers that are very fast - especially when you see bad guys with machine weapons always straying Larson and he is just armed with a refugee (which is not available outside the bullet) removing all of them out rather easily. The effects of an earthquake are decent, but there is also a lot of blurry and low explosions of CGI. As a spiritual leader "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman tries, but the religious-religious jumbo-religion that should have spout is just boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (they think he has any) producers may want to give this, because others do not have the rental value. (* 1/2)
