WOW! Why can anyone make a series of ready rancid film? Half of the dead was a bad movie but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 does not show what it wants to be. It's just on the screen for reasons I explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: From (play with the Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where there is a box full of golden bricks. In the prison, the friction comes from the opponents of the opponents, one of them being shot by a young man named Cortez and Cortez has a plan to escape. During the visit of the widow, the pastor of Twitch and Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) is taken by Cortez and takes place in the killing room. Burke's friends are concerned with their worries and end up in trouble with the idiotic prisoners when they know that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is the most necessary layer from Universal Soldier: The Return. Script is awesome, acting is awesome, the conversation is joke and everyone in this movie is caricature. Look, I know it was a small budget but not the reason that these boys do not put forth effort in what they do. No one in this "movie" believes in characters playing. No one in this "movie can be taken seriously as an actor." Kurupt should be ashamed of yourself. "His character" From "is very pretty man who spends a lot of time being beaten by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends all his time playing a movie as he should take PHD (a very good dump). for movie action HPD2 is good boring even when the action happens! Don 'T then anyone will tell you that this film is very good.
