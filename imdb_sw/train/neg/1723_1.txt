Man, what was this a scandal! It was not because it was not good (since I had no expectations from them) but because I had been wrapped by a DVD's sleeve that was foolishly beat his "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. In fact, their names were not found in the opening of the film, much less in all! As has changed, the only movie linking these three actors is LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) that is not identical? but what is involved with the MONSTER of the rock is the guess of anyone? However, since I paid $ 1.50 for his lease and I was in a movie monster movie, I have chosen to watch the movie regardless, and stop! Apart from the fact that you had the name of the person and unknown delegates, an unknown air air was visible from miles away and more that I could do with laughing with JAWS tips such as, and deliberately, in the soon antics of two owners of The boat-boat-boat which occasionally emerges between them and the sheriff who is anxious to look. Creation itself? plesiosaur i.e. half-dinosaur / half fish? is not fully known (usually) but, as was the GIANT WOMAN (1957) that I just saw, this did not seem to bother the film makers even if they like it as they could, especially during the second half of the film!
