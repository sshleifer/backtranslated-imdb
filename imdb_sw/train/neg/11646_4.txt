Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those people from the past that seem to be easy to forget. I've never thought that his show was all very good. This is its typical character of the criminal boss, and the predictable results. If you take a car to drive out and run in general, there is not much progress or action. I see the films of mafia being lighter because I have no respect or intention of ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, Italian movies, recognize these people as heroes. I saw the film and in a few days I will not remember much about it. Lots of ammunition, non-innocent people, trafficking, and loyalty of the sick. The film is very good and acting is good. But the dubbing is bad (due to the sounds that could not come out of the bodies), that almost I began to seek Godzilla approaching the bay.
