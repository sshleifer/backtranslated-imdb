The bad plan, the bad conversation, acting evil, leading to the sound of the voice, the sound of the groove of the porn that runs constantly on the confused script, and the VHS copy can not be redeemed by drinking alcohol. Believe me, because I have come to this turkey to the end. It was pathetically bad that I had to think it was the fourth spoof of Springtime to Hitler. The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only despair of interest, and that was just because she could sing better than ever. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at one thing but a thousand times better, then look beyond the Dolls Valley.
