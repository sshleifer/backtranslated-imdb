I could not believe how lame and impaired this was. Basically there is nothing to laugh at the film, there is no exercise to please you on all the films. This scenario has produced many stars but has been destroyed in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves should be taken several lessons of acting a few years after this film before looking at The Matrix. Uma Thurman appeared very simple and humble. Luckily I've got this movie at a very low price because certainly not a movie to remember for any good reason. I can't write anything about the movie story, but if you should know that it means being a very popular player in the United States because of its great seat. I would like to give this film 2 / 10. Before watching this film I was wondering why this film has only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very awesome movie. Don't pick it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
