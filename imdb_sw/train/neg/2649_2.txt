My wife and I started looking at this film in anticipation. It seemed to be warm and touching. It started well; but, soon it became boring and honestly idiotic over time. It has been so bad we prevented The movie was legitimate and honest, we can't understand or want to understand exactly what it is or how hell they can put with this woman! You lost sympathy for him after being sharp and making wackos singing and cleaning. I would have done it. And, of course, like many movies and a series of T.V's made on Hollywood we should give a mark of "gay" character! This movie was awesome. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
