I read a man who runs from Kings' books as Bachman and I felt the character John and his family. This movie can be SO more. Trouble? Placed during a great film festival. I watched the movie and I had pain during the whole thing. I don't feel anything for the character and less because of it. Yes it was interesting (or laughable) events although I think that it didn't keep the movie inside me. If you read the book you can feel the top and the fire in John's heart if he gets revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this film a low number. It may not be as low as I did not read the book.
