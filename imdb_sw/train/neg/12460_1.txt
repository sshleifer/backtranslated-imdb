We left the time when George Clooney's character had nailed to his finger. We did not dance - when we sat for one hour of this shadow we only knew what it felt. To say this film was unknown, boring, the desire to devote will be over-praise! How could people stay in this corner of confusion, slow, pseud's trouble of films, not alone to put it to Oscar? Clooney appeared as ill as we were seeing him. What did he think? Oh .. and what was it with those heads? - do you? we just had a DVD or an original film made like that - a left sentence hanging in the middle of the air? The film was difficult to follow without it. I am sorry for the cast, who really made their success with the available material.
