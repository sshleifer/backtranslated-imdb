That is one of the most shocking and frightening accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a good actor, but throwing him as Hitler is just plain. To give Liev Schrieber as a long-time Hitler friend and aid, Haefengstal must have a desperate noise and pain from Simon Wiesenthal Center. J-W plays the Nazi assistant, the worst casting wrong. This was not a family of fun and historical history. This was Hollywood garbage in a more favorable way, giving money to a strong force (but much less consumption) to help players who seemed to be all but lost from acting radar over the past 5 years. German fiction words (ve vill vin v var) are abusing German people everywhere. My mother is German and sat fuming in the sound of developed sounds from America / English / German all in the same sentence. Support support makes the cuttings of the paper in the local video store than they do on the screen. Jenna Malone as Geli Raubal, who was hated, had a princess however, was convicted and confused by this ugly woman who eventually ended her own life to avoid what her future would be like Hitler's shade. If you would like a wonderful historical and historical history of Hitler's early years leading to war / sheep, pay "In the Third Reich" 1983 with Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi like Hitler. It was good and it led to wise then this baloney. <br /> <br /> If the Third Reich's historic researcher can tell you honestly, this was with me to reach my books to prove much of its accuracy.
