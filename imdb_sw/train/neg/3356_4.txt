Shirley Jackson's report 'The Haunting of Hill House' is a story of terrorism, which provides the most common events in the old house. The atmosphere is well installed, and the winter is well organized. Haunting laughter. The 'Haunting' sits next to the book, but it also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the fear of the book and sores are well performed even on the screen. Black and white image only adds to the fun of the movie. Better! <br /> <br /> And then, Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting struck the movie - if you could call this remake. Why were they required to restore the movie 1963 is the secret itself, but now, it lets you watch the film itself. It starts off completely, as many awesome movies do. The set used for the House of the Hill is beautiful, and odd, and for a few minutes, it looks like the film will actually be a fair reference. And then, the first fear comes: the free wire eliminates the woman's face (assistant Dr. Marrow). That's hilarious, and the truth is told, close to me with tears. From that time, the film is only growing below. Acting seems to be a timber as the film goes on, and Owen Wilson's behavior is particularly irritating (so it is an apology if he is misled by the flue). Special effects make this film, which is a disgrace, because many of them are very strange and very visible. Examples of these are many, so I don't bother their listings. So, for all, I, with hundreds of others, strongly recommend watching the original chiller, or, as an alternative, to buy a novel with Shirley Jackson. But please, leave off with this. And, if you look at this look, look at the TV (as many ways like to watch this movie, and not the original) or lease is cheaper, but please don't hit it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money! <br /> <br /> Last access: 4/10
