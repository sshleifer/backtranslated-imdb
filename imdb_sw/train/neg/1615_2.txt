An old elder like Che. It completely ignored the fascinating facts of Che's character. Sodeberg redid the same boring story of Che. The story of the rich young man of Argentina who was shocked by poverty became Robin Hood fighting against the poor, until he was finally killed by the CIA. Well, yes, he heard it all before, BORING AND UNTRUE! The truth of Che Guevara is very different and it rises more! The fact is that he was connected to the line of molecules, who clearly refused to seize the Maoist abuse of the world. He was very aggressive during the most difficult time in the cold war, he even asked the Soviet Union to fly to New York, Washington or Los Angeles to bring the end of the world. CHE told Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he announced that if his finger was on the button, he could push. When Khrushchev is standing down and saved real world, Che was angry with "betrayal". If Che's recommendations were followed, you cannot read this review now. How maniac of homicidal that icon icon can be the most interesting film. It is surprising that no filmmaker had enough courage to show the exact side of Che and its posthumous media change. YOU CAN MAKE THE FILM OF THE Oscar! I thought to make an independent film was meant to take a REAL RISKS and BE USED! "They are colder", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are lovers and fools", etc ... ad nauseum. Oooh, how sad, how the mind blows. Tres fight with mainstream and edgy. I would like to have real cojones and deal with the Oligarchy of Independent Film! That would be true!
