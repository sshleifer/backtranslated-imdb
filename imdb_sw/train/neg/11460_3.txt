The most interesting piece that tries to show how smart Orcas is at the same time (and quite unaware) makes the audience stupid by making the most stupid film. Richard Harris plays Quint. Sorry, that's bad, plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who takes a shark for life, but is attracted to a big catch, and tries to catch a whale to kill. When the whales of the whale kill the woman go awry (do not ask) is the wife (do not ask) you go to the rampage (do not ask) and start STALKING Captain Nolan (don't ask). Recently, Captain Nolan knows that they have the same thing (don't ask). Pretty amazing making film here people. I must tell you though, at the beginning (in the whale's voice and something else the whole) is a good haunting and final features (for many godawful song) is a good entertainment.
