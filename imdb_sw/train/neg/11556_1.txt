Oh, those Italian! To think that movies about people with strong legacy, the palaces were full of gothic conditions, and the backsliding relatives are trying to get their hands to the inheritance is interesting to all! If you have seen one film of this kind, you have seen all of them (MST3K favorite "Skull Screaming" resembles mold, too) ... and "Night Evelyn came from Shekina" is a formulaic, and -the-number, and it looks like hell. Even the taste of Erika Blanc is thrown here. <br /> <br />
