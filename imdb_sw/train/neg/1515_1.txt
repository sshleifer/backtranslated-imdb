I watched the film "Group" because of the cast of Gere and Danes and because the story of the story seemed attractive. This was one of the WORST movies that I have seen for a long time (and I have seen several violence.) I've never been published online but this film was so bad I needed to do it. I think the problems started with the script which was amateurish is amazing. The story makes the meaning of zero and discussion is so disgusting. Poor Gere, very worthy. For Gere / Danes on screen matchup, because of awesome writing, one does not believe either or behave for a minute. I'll bet Gere wants to be able to restore the negative, it was possible. It is embarrassing to see a very talented talent, not to mention I would get 2 hours behind me. (I know what you think. How do I feel?)
