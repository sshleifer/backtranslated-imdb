Of course Frank Sinatra was a talented actor with a talented singer. After all, very few executives today can find a direct location in one take, and that was a very modandi operus of Sinatra on the set. I feel that if the 1960s were dressed, the quality of the film really started the tank. Tony Rome's detective series was not easy to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series that came out at the same time. Perhaps even the James Bond competition, but nothing worked for Frank during these years. His personal life in shambles, his music declined ... Sinatra appeared more like losing the 1950s. The last film of Sinatra of this period was perhaps Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
