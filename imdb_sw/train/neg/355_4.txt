The only reason it is one of those films that first makes you wonder why it was so planned when it came out - nothing special but enough to be done with Ed Harris's excellent performance. Then you hit the last three and everything starts to increase in fraud until you have found a killer and a flashlight on his forehead threatening Sean Connery (usually loving and forbidding Kate Capshaw) and a child (very young Scarlet Johannsen) in the shade of alligator . <br /> <br /> Type of movie that looks good on airplanes, and even once.
