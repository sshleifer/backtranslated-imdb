There are good shots of the environment. The authors put the mouth in the mouth of the actors. For small actors show this will be silly. 'Art should promote humanity or is BS.' Not so because the art of all those mentioned is also stimulating humanity and describing the dark side. Leadership behavior even says those who do not drink hide on the side of the shadow. He made a mistake, lived in darkness and insisting on his dark side to drink and that one direction did not extend its scope to something else than the theme. There was no breathing creature in his work or the manifestation of his pain. All traders did so with a limit to creating twelve themes. The discussion between the characters was a grade school, the wrong things always give one character about the author. I tried to love it after reading all the first comments here. I had to dig deep to see those I agreed with. I see the positive comments from those connected with the film. I was transferred only once to the end. The child was way too passive. Good condition was good and stupid music. My only comment but no place to show me.
