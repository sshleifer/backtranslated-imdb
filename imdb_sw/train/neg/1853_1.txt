This film, no revision, this THING, these detestable films from hell holes should be killed before even even the head of the author. I could not come up with enough criteria to describe this film. But let's try again. Horror, bad, despair, lack of desire, decay, vomiting vomiting, making bad bowels, hiding, bad, put, there are just enough words in English! The "plot" involves a common killer who becomes a snowman. Don't ask how, it's not important. Snowman killers runs about killing people. How, can you ask, can someone of snow kill someone? In non-destructive ways that make you want to remove your eyes if so only you need to tolerate Styrofoam snowman again. In such a way that you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not need to tolerate the snow again. Don't watch this film! Destroy ahead! For your own soul do not look at it!
