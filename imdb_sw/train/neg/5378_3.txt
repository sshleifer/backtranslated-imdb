I watched this film so unexpectedly, I found it in a 5 film film, all of which were horrible in their own way under the fiver so what would I expect? and you know what I was right, all of them were terrible, this movie has a few (and a few are spread) interesting points, regular camcorder view is a nice touch, drummer is like drummer, ie annoying damned and, very well about it, a problem it is only exciting, in what I can only think is an attempt to create tension, nothing happens and when it is really causing it (I had my finger on closing the front button, ready to push for many films, but gave them to go ) and seriously is the first singer of the band that look good, coz will not say how good he is to hell for a lot, I thought he looked a little like meercat, all this and I even mention the killer, I even wouldn't go into it, his right not to define. However if I am worried Star and London are just about because of this look and except London (who was really quite funny) it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly see a lot worse, but I found it better. Better avoid unless your fatigue to look dry.
