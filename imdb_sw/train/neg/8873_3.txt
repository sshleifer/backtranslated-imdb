Did anyone stop the type of film they produced here? Now the former marine officer joins a group of children in a cadet school so this should be the right of a comedy family? Not right. This is just a comedy planned for young people with a good time to taste. It might be a very silly look at this time but I have seen the voice of Damon Wayans to convince you more than faith. What? Does he say like that in real life? If he does then he has my sympathy but he won 's getting any of my money from watching his movies
