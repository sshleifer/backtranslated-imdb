"Looking for the Love of Evil" is essentially "Death Street" and several publications have been added to the previous half. In the end it will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three weekly movies. It is still another story of caution about the failure of the trial, and it does not add something new to that type. Brett (Vincent Spano) has been linked to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a great trust fund. Even though he has all, he can lose everything by introducing steam and Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, the eyes of the Cedar Falls, falls hard for Brett, and does not take the time when it comes fresh about her participation. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett returns back to the bedroom of a big house, an elegant house with her new husband. While the question of Brett's police, he immediately tells Janet's finger. After his arrest, Janet seems to get a position for a minute - not that he was a picture of calm before. His defense attorney (Holland Taylor) believes Janet is innocent and is a hell to consider it. <br /> <br /> Did he do it or didn't he? How will it end? You can find answers to these questions next time “Love Care” goes to your local location. And surely you don't miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs, and women are mad.
