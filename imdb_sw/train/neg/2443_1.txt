this is not just a bad film, it is one of the worst films. it's so bad that I've been quite comfortable. Acting, oh my god, the script, you have got kiddin '. What? you can think what a writer comes with such things as: - a child who performs fireworks at school, a fire of fire, a power of fire, that when someone gets hit, the yard swings and burst. -girl tied in the cell, the killer tries to open the door. gets a drill, but the wire is not enough for a long time. he first makes a string of extensions, oh fear, and then, when he has done, he drives through the door and drives through the head of the killer. WOW - and there are many examples like that. o, and what happened to George Kennedy, was powerful (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
