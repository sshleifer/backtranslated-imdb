UPA films are amazing for IMDb despite the fact that the quality of animation is a few years behind Looney Toons, Disney and MGM for most of them. Unfortunately, due to the rising cost of making good cartoons and high standards and good nature, the UPA style (which started in 1950) began to rule at the end of 50 and 60 years. After all, these films had A little dirt to do and would get several Oscars to "prove" that cartoons were now common. Therefore, the results of pride animation were normal and this situation was not changed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA film is one of the earliest. The characters are widely distributed (any easy and they could use the stick data) and the nature was bad - simple line drawings and color-added dash patterns (often with sponge and often fill up items). As a story, it is a jive story with a jazz characteristic of power. Some will like this, others will only get very, very loud. It's a traditional story "Frankie and Johnny" and because of the bullets and all, maybe not a good film for children. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, is not a very good film to me, either! Others will read my review and of course they think I am a shadow (which I am, to the extent). However, I would like animation movies and a bit of this small UPA style go a long way and you can't focus on their artistic works - only, very quickly makes cartoons. Stop Oscars and try to view ethnic cartoons or something - anything else!
