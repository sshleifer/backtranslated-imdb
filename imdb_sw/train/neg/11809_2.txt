It hated this movie on the bargain bin at the Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie regularly and I found that this looks like beautiful. <br /> <br /> The movie is a cliche quite "1970s" and is so big for it. Unfortunately the story line is difficult to follow and not much happens in the film. In fact, I put it after watching it for 45 minutes and seen a week later I had to look at anything no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has beautiful places in it, but you are waiting and waiting and waiting ....... to them. <br /> <br /> If you are on B movies, this may be just for you, just show that the movie is slow and not much happens, and not mention the line of the story is not ... <br /> <br />
