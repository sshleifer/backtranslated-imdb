Hollywood's attempt to turn the life of Jack London into the film "Jack London" is not a bad idea; Indeed, he led an interesting life, and sometimes, of life. This film, however, sends it flat and is not recommended. More importantly, it is not trustworthy. Michael O'Shea (like London) has a London conversation; and, it is good to see Jack's beard receiving "Call of the Wild" after spending time alone, in the snow mountains, and his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very good. The film draws the unfortunate "Yellow Path" between London and World War II, all of which have been beaten and trembled. Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
