This movie was awesome. The plot was made, the act was wrong, the editorial did not come in and this movie made me look out. I wish I had time to watch this film back. The part of the balloon was stupid, the Mormon joke is very old, the sound of the sucked sound, I have not seen the chemistry between the two guidelines, it's full of exhibitions, the inner "celeb" came ... it was called Del "I'll go fast if I want .. "idiot computer. What's worse is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even came. This film support creates a long line of effort to incorporate LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. RM, Church Ball, etc. etc. I would like to watch this film and instead run the first head in the brick wall. You will be more happy than watching this bad excuse for the show.
