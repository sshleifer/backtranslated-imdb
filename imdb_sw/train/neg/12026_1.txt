I just want that time to make comedy, people really tried to make it funny. This is the film you can stay, but nothing special about it. After looking at it, you will say it was right. It was not boring to look, but gave the audience no joke to laugh. Entertainment should mean that it gets something more than o.k. The story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead failed. I gave 1 out of 10.
