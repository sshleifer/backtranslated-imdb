This movie is true! I thought he was 11 years old, and I thought it was very good! I would just like to recommend this film to children under the age of 12. I did not care, but I think that responds to very good questions that children should be aware of, such as: 1) What? Buy money fun? 2) Should I lead (my parents) about things that I think they did not accept? 3) What? Money buys friendship? 4) What? Money is everything? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? In fact, this is a misconception, but I think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, perhaps they should watch this video too, to show their children that the lie has the power to hurt you.
