Another movie that depends on the ambition, the excitement of the mad mad scientist. Film stations close to the surgeons who desire the life is to bring the dead ... to return to life. I know, I know ... you have never heard before! Of course, if all these movies are going, the experiment goes very, very wrong and builds a deceiving, bloody creature. By introducing this promising, you would like to consider that it would have been at least a little to emphasize. Not right. Like many movies of this time, the idea is good, but the implementation and script is mediocre. It's not the worst movie of the horror that I saw (no, Abominator: Evil 2 still takes a cake) ... but not one of the jewelery, either.
