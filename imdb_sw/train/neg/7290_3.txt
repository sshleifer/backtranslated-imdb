What is a long, drawn movie, useless. I am sure that this film is fun but as entertainment goes not just to make a bridge. Ralph Fiennes has been in the fantastic movies, the English patient, the Schindler List, but this was the bottom. It didn't seem to go anywhere, its behavior at first was a deep and coverable insistence that her "sister" would have any intention. Don't bother paying for this movie, give a copy of the English patient instead.
