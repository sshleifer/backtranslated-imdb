I could not, for my life, follow, recognize or understand the story. If the plot continues, it also remains undetectable. I'm going to think and say that there was a story of birth control / problem that had never been given. Manufacturers could not differentiate a lot of novels, or novels, had time and opportunity to create from another idea, which was to make a film about the killer and police killers. They ended up with a lot of things happening in the proscribed feature of the film. Too bad because they had a solid cast, the director who knows how to transfer objects closer to the best movies. In fact, a well-made movie that one can enjoy and relax and for several hours.
