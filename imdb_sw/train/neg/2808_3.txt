The source of the television series of 1980 television and television television (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among others) in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course, examples and other people begin to turn dead to all kinds of problems. It is not very good to do a lot of surprising has enough weakness and violence to get R rate but not enough equipment to fit any real desire. This is well described as a type of film released by the cable Cinemax station alternative to Skinamax. In fact I can't see the point of looking at this unless you need to see every dirty refrigerator out there. (I also need to comment that this film is filled with smoking, for sure it becomes interesting when anyone is turned on)
