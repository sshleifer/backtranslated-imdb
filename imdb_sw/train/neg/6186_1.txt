Trembling occurs. Susannah Yorke is a bright boy Jane Eyre, and her performance is impossible. However, Edward Rochester should be 35. White-black George C. Scott looks and acts as an arthritic 80. Jane's uncle's lost has been good! He makes and decides, he feels bad. He looks like a murderer who has sent his ax to be raised; we are not surprised that he puts the woman bound in the jeep! The great story of love looks like a dream of sado-eyeschistic. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is limited, the player, the powerful, and the most attractive when he chooses to be. He has a good voice to talk and sing, good sense, and conscience that doesn't try to erase.
