If you watched this film you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed to think "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I take this film"? I can't believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey looked back here when Timberlake and LL Cool J scored. WTF is Timberlake? Fun acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and he believed me I was not happy with him ... but I like the actor, not this Android called Timberlake. And her lover was small, doubting and angry as hell. I was happy when both were beaten on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was the same as I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his very bad job for the boy. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake destroyed it all. It would be very fun without him. The way, music was the same, but suddenly when every music was seen the video turned to MTV video and watched, a little motion and things like that. Something lost for this cops movie I thought. Perhaps they wanted to make a MTV video for Timberlake.
