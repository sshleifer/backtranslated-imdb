I love Jane Austin's novels. I would like to brag and hate books and movies and understanding and I am half way through Mansfield Park. But I couldn't stand Emma. I left the book after chapter 2, and at the end of the movie I didn't care about Emma. He wasn't found to turn completely. Perhaps it was the work of Paltrows (which is best in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the film. I don't know. Dress is beautiful, but the play was hard compared to playing with Interesting and Disgusted by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I gave 2 basically to the truth For boldly it is a good bloody, and though it is a very good performance for Ewan McGregor, I loved his singing.
