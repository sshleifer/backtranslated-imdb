This movie was made by a group of white people who went to school together. Well there is nothing wrong with that, unless it looks like it was made by a group of white people who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white men about the same age. It's almost like looking at a group of boys at the camp of boys who turned the camera on their own. Movie has no plot. It just repeats the same steps of the bleeding after bleeding. There are some funny scenes with comedic bits. But they do not have a flat redemption. The picture of the cartoon picture is used to cover more transparency of the budget or their resources, and it is not very well done. Anything that cannot be done by whites around the covered edge of the blood is done with cheap animation. I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a piece of Tarrentino. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. Their rest is just repeating the same kind of common, internal comedy. It is sometimes used, but it gets boring after other things coming to you from time to time. It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live screen than a movie. It's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy. I can see where the idea of ​​the story is interesting. But, in this post the film of America's destruction is like Medevil England. In fact Wheatlry says the story of the story came out then. He plans to do Part 2. I think he thinks he is Tarrentino or maybe he does something to understand. At the opening of LA, Wheatley mentioned he would bring pretty much the same in part 2. He was asked if he could focus more on being thrown in the next, which he replied, well yes, yes.
