The only kind of redemption of this high-melodrama reflection is the southern part of France and the voice of Nana Mascouri to sing the theme of the theme. Stephanie's power has been beaten and provided by the phony emphasis. As mentioned, he is too old to play at the age of 18 and looks like very young as grandmother and granddaughter of the university? Lee Remick is good though he is also an old man in his later years. Joanna Lumley talented is under spending and can also look at the young ever when his middle child (Robert Urich) finally married Mrs. Stephanie Authority. Stacey Keach's glory has not made you wonder what these women saw in her. Don't know how any viewer can relate to most of his photos? The most reliable performance is provided by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like title amateurs. It proves that beautiful girls in this epic will remain forever when they wait for their interest and eventually accept acceptance. Does anyone believe that President Robert Urich will be a wife for decades waiting for Stephanie Authority to finally accept his proposals for the last marriage? WW2 participation between Wehrmacht and Marquis is laughable. At first, the Germans did not find part of Provence France until the end of the war, regulated by the Victi French French government. We see the French competition fighting day in the Mistral villa to steal the paper after they all rest under the bridge waiting for a truck of Nazi soldiers to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a good series of mini series placed in a foreign country, do not look at Mistral's daughter. The best alternative will be the Thorn Bird.
