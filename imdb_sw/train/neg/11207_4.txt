As a bright fan of Flashman books and George McDonald Fraser, I expected to see Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Unfortunately it was a great disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before returning again to look at it again, but it was not the second time. Mr Fraser is a very good writer, but not a fan of his films and works of Richard Lester. Cotton slapstick destroyed 'three Muslims' for me and that applies here. For me, the whole voice and the feel of the film is correct. Flashman books are very interesting in part, but they are novels of adventure. There is much difficulty in the way that Flashman gets - after all, is involved in a dangerous environment. This is done in a novel, but has not been used in the film due to its comedic style. It is a great shame if it could have a good film if it was a more reliable change of book style. When I first read that book would be made, the film showed that the film was the star of Oliver Reed. I was happy, as Reed for me was the shape of Flashman. How I would like to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but it is not recommended for Flashman's image created by books (also it appears! Flashman level should be a large link). Reeds are never as good as Bismarck. What is breaking the film is that it is done as a comedy. The only area that focuses on the realities of the book is the place where Flashman kills Gautet (Tom Bell). Great disgrace, such as production standards, clothing, sets etc. is very good and generally forming best - almost everyone in the film is healed away from Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps the leadership of Richard Lester was responsible for the film, as the latest 'Flash For Freedom' radio transition, changed by Mr Fraser, worked well. Maybe one day we can see Flashman doing right on the screen.
