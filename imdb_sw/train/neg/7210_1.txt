Once again, Disney manages to make a children's film that completely refuses its history. About the most common thing with this and the original cartoons of the Gadget are names. The worst mistakes are characters - Penny has no book, Brain has been reduced from behavior to the concept of concepts, Dr Claw is more than to show off than the bad villain, but there is more than that. Fear comes from the first minute of the film - having a Gadget as a protector named John Brown has not helped to identify him as a Gadget's Auditor. And certainly at first we see a clear Disney attempt to turn every story into a love affair between a man and a woman - they start Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disney-compatible. Add to this the fact that "Malle" that appears in this film and Dr Claw's classic is almost diagonally opposite and you will see this will be no place near the original story. What would help would be the best story to take its place - but as you wanted, Disney failed in it too. The whole movie is just Gadget to do silly for silliness and disappointment after Brenda. As if to add insult to injury, Disney introduced a "new" Gadgetmobile - does not look, work or think like the old Gadgetmobile, it is only a canonical "comic relief" figure. Disney definitely realized that the cartoons of Gadget were comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they removed all cunning gags (like worksheets that exploded in the face of the Great) and changed it to the gadget to be moron, Gadgetmobile being a wise ass, and " The "show" shows. One should tell Disney that "children's movie" does not mean "general lack of brain use". Gadget should be targeted for children aged 10-12 ... not children of 10-12 months as this film. Whatever this movie should be, not, repeat NOT, the actual newspaper inspection. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate this.
