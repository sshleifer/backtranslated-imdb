This movie is very bad but I have an interesting explanation about it: It is in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, and also on Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. Most of the videos on the film are sports students from NAU. I was a good man that year, playing in the playground, but for some reason I was not involved with production. I did so even knowing several people who did and could give this abnormal truth: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this movie where two of the chiefs, as part of their smoking, should run naked in the wood. They appear from behind in the movie, doing just that. The fact is, those are not always actors but two boys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "posterors" will not be known, at least on this site, unless they decide, um, "reveal" themselves!
