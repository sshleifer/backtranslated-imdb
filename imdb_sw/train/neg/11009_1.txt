I tested this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought that this film could be very good. "It has proven to accuse ... everyone!" The trailer said. Well ... it accused me, because this film takes. It's not comedy, as I laughed two seconds during the entire movie. And what are all gay in this film? It is not gay and I have no problems with those who are, but what is to add a lot of gay pictures in a video called comedy, when these events are not really good? I think the director is a gay person in rejecting, or something like that. So my advice to you is: if you want to lose good money, you're going to hire a good comedy you've ever seen a million times, you will be better than watching this Mother of All Comedy's Lousy. In fact it is the total distribution.
