Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that in order to get the best version of Jane Austen's work, one should just read it. I agree with that. However, we would like to review a lot of books and authors of current journalists bring to mind that without good writers, it is difficult for executives to bring their roles in life. The current version of PERSUASION of Jane Austen shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in dealing with the text properly. This version is not in line with the 1995 edition by Amanda Root and the Hindans of Ciaran, which worked well and preserved the essence of the era and restrictions on the characters (except an extraordinary event and kissing on the road in Bath). The 2007 edition depicts an ignorant Anne who looks angst-ridden. Other characters were not made very much, which is a crime, based on how Austen can draw those wonderful characters and carefully selected items. The sequence of events that were wise in the novel was completely beaten, and Mrs Smith, a bed and a school pupil going to Bath - - announcing, as many characters did. The strength of character and Captain Wentworth, which led Anne to love him first, was not found to be written in the Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth. The Ciar kings had more substances and were able to convey more and look, than P-J could do with its possibilities. For all, the 2007 edition was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel by using hand-wringing, costumed melodrama of reliable value. If they wanted to bring modern emotional barriers to Austen's work, they would have to do what they do and change Shakespeare: make it now. Of course "Mrs. & Uncle" was removed from historical & village settings and it was fun to watch, as it was "Clueless". This was not PERSUASION, but they didn't know what else to call it.
