Anyone who is a jazz 1920 player, 1920s, Charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (for example I, on all accounts) will want to love this film. But the sad thing is that all I am. The program is banal and open, acting either either worse or playing the farcical side of going, and when the whole thing on there is not much left but the feeling of mirrors and smoke. This is a good movie made well.
