I am not very happy remake, or steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film has healed me. The original Prom Night, while not in my calculation of the masterpiece, still realized what is ... fear. There are some simple things to remember when making a terrible film. Standing is important to maintain the interest of the audience. Sorry people, but the white film of the shadow was not! The events were cheaper, and had a huge shadow. (An awesome scenario that has been made in the current, is a cat walking out of the closet, followed soon after an unexpected appearance and film film) this film was not able to erase efficiently, so how can I expect to meet any films awesome. There need to be a good hero or heroine. This film has no one. The most famous person was the chief detective. His stability character, but the head of the escape of the killer is what the more films of this ilk should have. The most common way of events occurring. (If you are running away from the Ax psychology, you will cross and hit the opposite direction and not the jog, while you look again at the three months, continuing with the development of the killer, just go over every branch and something that is not in your way.) If your friend disappears. , you may go looking for them alone. And if you condemn the evil you tell someone, don't put yourself out. These clich√©s have fatigue and have fun. For a variety of fears in general, and in this particular film.
