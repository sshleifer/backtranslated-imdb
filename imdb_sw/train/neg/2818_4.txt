Genie (Zoe Trilling) comes to Egypt to visit his father, a man of the archeologist (William Finley) who is involved in the Bible, and attracts the attention of a group of pastors of Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays for Sade in lower matches, walking in his cell. Genie is led by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who rides honey and horses and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a sex-oriented person who opens the opium cigarette, which leads to a wild playing field with uncomfortable players, a woman having oral sex with snakes , orgy and his father preaching back! At the same time, members of the white worship are decreasing, blowing the eyes of the eyes and bursting. When Genie has been a drug addict in her tea, she thinks Sade hanging from the cross, a colored woman in a string of leaves and she herself bloody on a bed covered by snakes. It is all because he is the regeneration of the love of the deade. The most common production of Harry Alan Towers is the most expensive, the seeds and the very beauty, but the sets, clothing, movies and the work of the place are very good and at least there is always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
