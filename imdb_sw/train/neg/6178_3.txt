Frank Tashlin 's Home Front' is one of the lifeless shorts of life, a series of cartoons made as military training courses. Instead of having Snafu to take on the inevitable actions, 'Home Front' instead takes into account its loved ones at home and how much they should provide for the war effort. Snafu realizes that she was wrong when she thought it was easy. It is a conceptual and feasible crop of good crops and instead Tashlin plays a more dangerous card, an extended joke that includes pensioners and girls playing for beauty rather than a very effective aid. The result is a short-term meaning that has little or no value for entertainment today but as a historical feeling.
