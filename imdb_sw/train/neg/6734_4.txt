I have found this film a great idea, which did not give. It seems they found a way to build forgiveness, but they could not achieve their payoffs very well. In one case the police, it's time to get to the hiding of the butchers. They go to the stress from the dentist to the dentist to resemble the dental record. At the same time, the man who caught the trap (Mason) crosses through the elevator shaft. After building all, the police arrive at the same time they get free, which is to fight the very weather to say a little. There are also great stories of stories that send us “into the imagination” of a frightening husband and wife, which prevents doubts instead of adding. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice of the voice is contemptuous and stimulates the viewer to any chance of personal experience and fear, as Hitchcock has proved consistently, very appropriate. Great desire, it is to stay through the whole movie, and get quick, instead of the live bland. I mean it's just ... "ends" to the snake.
