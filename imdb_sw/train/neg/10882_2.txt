This movie is one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. From the very first place, I knew it would be a smash accident. It starts with a girl who looks bad to kill a group of scholars in the message. As it turns out, people in it had random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college students are pulling a certain prank. The terrible act goes from the promise to the jock head. Things like jock asking him to do things in an unusual way, with a commitment to responding and making it all "committed to being a prominent role" What took the cake and this is the last battle. Specific effects of guns. For example, guns make noise without flash of the muzzle, and vice versa. this accompanies the stop-animation zombies (why they migrate in a stop motion is a secret), cheesy music, and 40 guns that are not out of place. Overall, this movie is being hit. Like many others you can rent for 50 cents in your local hotspot movie.
