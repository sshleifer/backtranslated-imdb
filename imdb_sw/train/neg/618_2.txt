Perhaps one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I will start with the bad points of the movie, which covers the entire film. First of all, no one can escape: TERIBLE ACTING. I swear that they took the children without random off the street according to how they looked. Second, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You can't even know half the children who have been killed here. All you see is that they deserve one way or another. Characteristics of the scarecrow decreased, and the cheapest decline for other extraordinary killers such as Freddy or Pinhead. The following: BAD DIALOG: Scarecrow was full of one terrible linner that could trigger, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go and look for small animals!" it only leaves them with a raised eye. Last but not limited: Then off: BAD CASTING. How old was Lester's boyfriend? Like 30? Behind his head was to vote for God. There is much more that I could say about this film, if it is a special impact on cheap, is a "high school class", but the point is understandable. It's just bad movies when it's worse. Why did I see that the "good" in the film: - Reach those with low, low, LOW levels - You can help keep sleep asleep. -Create very cheap, or even giggle.
