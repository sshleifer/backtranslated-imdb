This is the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Plan and message are bad. There are so many errors in this film that it is impossible to continue. I don't even know how this film can get any selection, forget it alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee shows an irritating / irrelevant spell which caused by his father. Benefits: He angry anger. Client: When it comes to the definition of the definition, he cannot describe the sadness he has for his father. The cry area was very fake and looked like she was trying to tear from the corner of her eyes. <br /> 2) To connect the film to the head, there were barking or dog wimping sounds when fighting the events and the rape area, which is not meaningful and confused to the viewer. I understand that it should be an example or not ... but it's just sooo dumb! 3) WHAT IN YOUR SURVIVAL IN YOUR TIME? What caused this film. When the killer began to hit the officer, the official. Already dead! What is happening? There were many opportunities that the killer could be killed, but I don't know why he was not! 4) During the area where the girl had her foot hurt. In that area, it was so obvious that the LEFT foot of the girls hurt, how was he engaged in the second area that gives all the weight on his left foot? And is this an elected actor as the best manager? WTF? 5) Sound in the film has been removed. 6) I think that this film is trying to bring about the brutality and abuse of children in East Asia Asia, why is a bad person successful and then a soldier joining war? 7) This movie is just violence without purpose. Cops beat CI with the ass and then if they are collaborating, gives them a coke and a coke? This is the total movie worse. I really feel that the person who wrote this film is a compassionate and patient person. I have never seen the most enjoyable movie in my whole life. WORV MOVIE EVER!
