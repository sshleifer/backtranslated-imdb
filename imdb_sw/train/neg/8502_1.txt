I seem to start a fascinating film, the Spanish excitement in the spectacular days of Madrid, but not so, in fact the film only appeals to the future film directors to learn about what is not to make the film, it can`t be worse in other words, even The presence of the Oscar (Mira Sorvino) winner is not enough to prove $ 3.00 dollars used to see this film, acting is awesome and looks actors are waiting to finish every day shots going home, causing anywhere and is boring, weak and bad, do not spend time or money on this film.
