Anything with Guy Ritchie to restore the Wertmuller film is unknown. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another one in the audience when I saw it, and he left about an hour in it. (I hope he claimed the restoration.) The only reason I have lived to the end is because I have never walked on the film. But I'm sitting in this piece of junk perfectly asked to be Madonna and Ritchie might think they have made a good film. The discussion is interesting, acting is the only thing and the only thing in this film is a good environment. Ritchie took Lina's movie and put it on "Bago Blue." This is a film that you can not even waste time looking at night at Cinemax. Time is very precious to disappear in the skin like this.
