(this may be a bit of the spoilerish) I would like to start by saying I didn't watch the whole film, nor can I because it was obvious from the first hour that I would have lost so much. That is the problem of taking, what many believe is an amazing book, and turn it into a Disney Made-for-TV film. <br /> <br /> Time Publisher should be a wonderful movie long ago. It has a headline that can connect children and adults. More is built in the ranks of quality. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the cinema is that all things have changed and made it a story of visualization under what was so great about the book. It is a difficult and emotional story for children. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace just "psychic", because that's the easiest way to explain. There was no reason to write a fight between Mrs W's as a tension, there is enough tension in the story without it. There was no reason to get rid of Meg ... \ t <br /> <br /> I could nitpick a day about small things, but I also think great things, like the art of the art was far away. Take an example in the way they did Camazotz watch, and its dark dark clouds. The light that comes in the book is that Camazotz could be the World. It looks like the world. It has people who seem to be human. Heaven is blue, grass is green, and there are children playing. But something is a little bit. Directors chose to make another perfect Camazotz instead of taking a lesson in the book and using it for the guidance of the movie. The course of course is that Camazotz could be Earth, that's like we forget how to love. It would be a good player to have a good afternoon if they are walking down the road with children whistling in one rhythm. <br /> <br /> I unfortunately didn't look at the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney was used too. <br /> <br /> Overall artistic desires. <br /> <br />
