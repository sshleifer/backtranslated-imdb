I saw this on TV the other night? or suppose I walked to another station every time to watch infomercials when I couldn't stand looking again. It was bad. True, it is quite bad. Not "very bad is good" just a bad flat. How was it sponsored? Who thought this was a good idea? The friend of the mine player was asked and was told he was not good to play with the bad man but I think what they meant was "to save and run from this @ @ $." I bet bet the other cast was given the option. In order to have the right to work it was difficult to judge because of the fake American counterfeit. Shooting was dullllllllllll. The move was solid and beaten. The discussion was similar. For the sad thing was the ship. In the real life of the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on the film is not good enough. Instead of trying too hard to make it look like a new building of crews and tinsel bits are closed next to the printing lots, I'm not a child, they could change the script to explain or even celebrate shabbiness. Deaf, Deaf, Kibu. Don't watch this film, even if joke.
