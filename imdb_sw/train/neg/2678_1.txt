Nothing positive to say. When it does, it plays and submits to "messages". New Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), but many have a bouquet of cards and after asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor will be a good example). This is a kind of "dozor" of weakness. Working will be bad if it is not for the saving grace of improper direction and the lack of ability that is sometimes so bad that it varies with the lack of practitioners. Special awards for the camera to ensure that every shot is shaky (does someone please please note that Blair Witch had 15 seconds of inappropriate qualities?) And it takes it a focus of careful attention before young people who are holding on CounterStrike and sexually. The female leadership emerges and attempts to check often, the male antihero requires a diction coach (although genetics are not bad: rather than a narrative eyes.) One (in the middle) for this useless meaning is not art. Anyone who explains this to the beauty being a parent (far) of "authors".
