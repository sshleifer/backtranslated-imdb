Annie's cloud does not appear well. he is not good and nice to play Annie. Annie gives out in the film, as her dress looks like a Halloween dress. strong threats and threats. This movie is such a change since the 1982. version. I think the little and younger girl should have a leading role. Ashley Johnson shows Annie a very boy. Never likes it. Of course the director gave the right to Daddy Warbucks. Ms Hannigan was also sent. Camilla Belle played Molly alright. "Warning" this film can undermine your IQ so you can just want to show them just a very young children. 8 and limited. Some plots are also fiction and can not be done in the real world.
