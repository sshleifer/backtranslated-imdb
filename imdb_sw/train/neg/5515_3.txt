There are many good things that can be mentioned for this cartoon; The natural is rich, colorful and full of beautiful beauty of art. Animation is up to the standard studio of the time, which is higher than the current. However, I find that it is terrible for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: It's obviously not the usual size of Scott Bradley. Although it probably has to be the influence of the "Great Gatsby", it becomes a dreary, sleep, repeated repeated and enjoyable (repeating and delightful is not the same, as Beethoven's 5 Symphony performances). Since many people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they wage, there are a lot of visual parts of the cartoon that will be opened by the ordinary viewer. <br /> <br /> Story of the story: I'm not giving away any secret that is not already in the summary of the plot - a good country, a bad city. This is a common theme in the film, all living and living, from this time. It is an improper feeling of the rural idlell that does not exist, which, for the present day, appears in the same "moral" situation that has never been.
