We went to the film with the group because the game we went was allowed. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies. It is not that I don't like worship movies. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any contact with any characters. times without endless conversation. And the car. Does thay carry a big tent with beds and chairs for every day in the car? It's two sets! I should say even the environment is pleasant, but not in the film, the director should make a picture of the picture, so that we can fly 80 minutes of inappropriate time and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend you, for it is wasting your time
