First of all, I am a great fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so happy to see that the film was made by one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle Time. This movie, however, has destroyed my excitement. Sorry, but Meg was described in the book with glass curls and glasses and as she looks very poor. In the film, she has the same hair and glasses and is a "kind of sports" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle showed Meg to be completely. In fact, Meg was the basis of Madeleine's behavior and showed how she felt when she was younger. This is just one example of how book and movie are different. So I would like to say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, see if you are a volunteer fan of Madeleine L'Engle and its player in the Time series, I would like to beat this film.
