Released in 1965, but it proved clear many years earlier, this is a little dream of melodrama crime and some of the sexually enduring sexploitation. As usual for the flicks of the era, there is the right amount of prohibition and wear without reason driven by lousy music, exciting details, and awkward editing. The coffee shop is based on a good foundation, if we beat between the characters in the characters to avoid actually seeing them say their lines. All we find is the shots of responses to the sound of a far-off screen character! 50s-pretty Misty Ayers closes French-cut several times before starting to start. She accompanies the proceeds of the music music from the romantic to the west to the mother-not-dish, mixed with randomly producing, among other things, the exciting cigarette lighting that has been taken on the film. See if he blows! Check if it plays the match! Will she ask or be sent by Apaches? Just when you say! The film describes a bad story of how Sally is being mistaken to work in a house, falling into a dope, and can't escape. For some reason, we are dealt with some of the exhausted and aggressive adults who have ever made a film, actually doing their nails or merging rather than refreshing customers. Some comedy to relax (boozy dame accidentally drink milk! Har dee har!) And silently acting film does not help. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, even on the Little Web Site. It is more true of the film's curiosity for those who want the history of movies - the worst movies.
