The comedy player of Oscar Wilde, perhaps the most amazing game ever written, is all but broken in the hands of the second hit. Sanders are, as one would expect, usually, quite clearly in the role of Mr Darlington, but all others are organized a waste of time. Jean Crain tries a sense of action in another sentence and other standing representatives seem to believe this is melodrama and not comedy; In fact, the whole production contains books of information that minimize the tragedy - undoubtedly the Hays office has emphasized. The direction of Preminger seems to be more false in ensuring that there are many servants about and even music seems like banal. Close with the full farce of the silence that is indicated by Lubitsch or even the version of the 2004 screen of Helen Hunt as Ms. Erlynne; or try reading to play with fun words. But skip this version.
