poorly lit garbage. it is a profound Islamic sad ... if you are the kind of person who likes that ... see drop. even if you are this person not making this beautiful film, acting is very bad, a story full of conspiracy holes, the director really should give only and get a real job if they have no talent for this. I can see why people don't like your beauty .. we've had several films recently and this is their best, which is sad! The complete lack of any kind of humanity seems to be dealing with other people but here is just grates. Horror movies can be full of destruction, they can be a small artwork, they can look good when nothing else about ... SEED is really poor.
