I am sure to say, I often love horrible movies that I have never seen ... however, this was just a pathetic for my gory taste. I've had a gory type, a kind of shaking ... but this film was blind. Acting was bad (still corny (no pun planned) one liner were cute). With that layer, Scarecrow Slayer was worse! Yes, perhaps, when you first came out, there was a great rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like Ring and Exorcist Emily Rose left, movies like this make movies like Scarecrow seem to children. If you want the movie to pass the time, select this! Special effects are cheesy as heck. But if I see that it's a small movie budget, I can see the kind that would come in. This will be a kind of movie reminders "Children Of Corn." Film movies of self-sufficient .... time-consuming. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with pigs, or on the other hand, 2 rage goes, then these movies will be for you.
