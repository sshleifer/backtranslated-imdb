I was fascinated by this film because of this plot and my desire to look at fear. <br /> <br /> With my suspension, this turned into a more comedy than fear. Acting, dialogue, and flow of all films are not well done. Much of it didn't mean. For example, there are about 30 people and all of them are afraid of one person even though they are in a secret place and they all look at healthy young people and a threatening person looks haggard. I kept thinking, maybe this was the hardness of another film like the Scary Movie, but they were trying very much to make it seem bad - insisting on the trial. The blood and gore are also not well done. I have seen Halloween dress looks more reliable than this. A boy with his head cut off clean ... looks clean - bone, bone, blood, and even head. The lowest strike and the top of the corpse should get into something ... it seemed like that man was piping instead of ax. Unlocking who is the main villain should have deviation, but in contrast to other parts in the story. What went into the mind of a woman turning like that? If there is a misinterpretation, you should add at least adding a secret and insist.
