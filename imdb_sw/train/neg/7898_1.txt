When I saw this film, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures, the dust of the dust and good teeth, have a terrible sense? Or where they planned to have a good cook (I hope so hope). If you are looking carefully you can even see the conditions that drive them (better, drag them to the screen). It was all rather surprising than the terrible and I had a good time to watch the film because I was surprised by the total lack of just one good part. It's one big joke from the beginning to the end and I believe that this film is in a new form: So it's not strange to enjoy it from the beginning to the end. (I won't try to comment on acting or all other things)
