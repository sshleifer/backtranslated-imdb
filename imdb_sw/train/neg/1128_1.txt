This movie was one of the worst I ever seen. Drivel clean. How anyone can develop a relationship with the heroine, or have a feeling for it, is more than me. I felt that I was looking at the history of the individual case of schizoid and border borders. It's worse. <br /> <br /> In his generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce a "art" film - except I can, for my life, get any art in it all the time. If this woman had lived in the world today, she would have run away from a mental institution and given several days of treatment with anti-psychological drugs. Therefore, or just allowed to walk on the street and become a woman bag. Why the other characters in this movie got anything to redeem in it - and they tried to help her in her effort to become an actor - she says more of their disease than any influential behavior she had that made it worth.
