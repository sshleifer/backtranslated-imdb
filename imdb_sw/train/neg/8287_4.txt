This is a great television version of the story, the film begins as a part of 'Xena ...', with a good commentary of a conversation or character description. It takes a little more time over time, but all the characters still have pictures. <br /> <br /> Salma is a wonderful beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually immoral person, trying to raise nut in Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo are completely forgetful. It is also a free version of story, Frollo is a light striker of light, like abbot in 'Rose' name, and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The quas character of the Quas character is being investigated, although it drives water-driven water. She is really just a guest to be looked different and enjoys playing with more than the average bell. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie focuses on children, but I'm sure, based on Frollo flogs himself with bloody adjusting to want to spank a monkey. Not surprisingly light and forgetful, but not bad, and sometimes the story of the story.
