This should be called "The Curious Case of Non-Professor Artists who are not shown to the Scary Situation as Film Shock." It is one of the longest, the narrative stories of the brim of the frog, very clear gag that even the Flounder from the Delta House can see it that way. Jeff East, actor at the pay point, can be forgiven for taking any work he can get. That can't be said by Charles Martin Smith, who had previously acted for cinemas such as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on the tape but, thanks, not out on the DVD. Unspecified items like this are on the site and anywhere.
