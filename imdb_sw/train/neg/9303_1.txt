I am writing this review after watching it a few months ago. The trailer seemed to promise enough for me to purchase this shadow excuse for the movie. It is a full joke .... and literally spit on the face of a real original generation of fear as the Texas Chainsaw murder (1974) which even had a gall comparison itself with the back of the cover art. Producer who played Brandon should go to the flip burgers and serve up to greasy hamburgers .... Hell he may even be good for that either! The lights were bad and the worst out of the film could even see the actors' faces sometimes. I did not remember even some of the cast members who are really sad, the bad they never do anything to attract you to be memorable. That's all the time I will lose on this review. <br>> <br /> If you want a good budget for the lowest, better than this ... then look at the movie Jeff Hayes .... because it takes the talent to make it with fear and the baby has it! </> <br /> I just gave this 1 star for cover artâ€¦ that's the only thing to enjoy this so-called "film" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
