I see what the director was trying to do but missed the score. The main actor was very good but the adjacent next to it takes you away. The function of the camera, the lamp and the businessman is a kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more suitable but it was not. The voice was far away and it removes you from the film too. I see it can see this director doing a bit better later but not the whole right but it doesn't expect the movie dv almost next to 28 days or whatever, put your expectations down and you'll get more from it. At least it was only half an hour. Oh, and others to lead the lead was very bad if you asked me. But I am a snob of the movie so take it to what it is worth.
