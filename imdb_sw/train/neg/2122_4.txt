Although in some of the seven Pounds things are strong and interesting in some of its style stories, the Gabriele Muccino is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it continues towards the end: human hearts and emotional, physical and romantic eyes. Seven vilies are more than an imitation of Amores Perros and 21 grams Alejandro González Iñárritu and lots and lots of lots. The problem is a completely predictable story from VERY easily through the film. That's very bad, because the seven pounds can be like "good" indeed if Ben and Emily are placed in the right hands.
