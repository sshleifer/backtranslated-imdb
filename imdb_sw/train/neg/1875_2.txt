First of all, I was very fond of Henry Fool, which put me on a very small beach for girls. Parker Posey is one of the best actors on the screen today. But this film was a perfect practice. Watching Hartley and actors talking about the film in the extra - so full of pride, making the analogies useless for Star Wars - was a stomach-turn. This was part of the producer (HDNET) manufacturers that reached max. The true example of the King and his new clothes. I usually feel that Hal has attacked HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can see again in the light, innocent. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can FOOL some people at some point ... etc. The director was not anywhere today like all that he had done was useless rubbish. Unfortunately, it is a good example of the lesson taught in the comparison of the film. Stories must be exciting and active, or his hopes of the box office is true. Never think good news. For actors, it was like trying to make a problem. <br /> <br /> score, I believe Hartley, doesn't matter. For dances you hit the whole conversation. There was one loop of Apple Soundtrack I realized that he gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they just try to grab a new audience. But it is really a trip to ignorance. I would be happy to destroy this film for you, but it's done. It rains. The FOOL Franchise is dead. Live long Henry Fool.
