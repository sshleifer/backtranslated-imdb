Considering its nature, this should be a more enjoyable film than it is. Even with the accumulation of eccentrics in cast - what the aficionado does not expect hard movie bringing together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, without ignorance. <br /> <br /> The gift of Kim Novak was not essentially comic, as she continued to prove in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good player, as he showed in movies from Philadelphia Hadith to Harvey. I think he comes out of this mess better than anyone else does. Except maybe the cat.
