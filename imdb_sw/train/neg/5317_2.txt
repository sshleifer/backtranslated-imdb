For the first 20 minutes or so (I was looking at PS2 so I didn't know exactly how long it took) Alienator sets a good base. I don't think I've seen a movie of slasher and alien from another planet as baddie before. However, the recent intention returns to infidelity as you recognize 'alien' is a great body builder woman in bikini. Yes, Alienator feels stupid. I don't think I think that against it. In the world of shlock-horror, constant ignorance can often be a good sign. However, the clear ignorance of its premise is all the movie that goes to it. Alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest on the order. Staff members on the experiment of weight failure, the probability of wise lines of fresh cheese negotiations are faced with insufficient capacity and direction cannot count even one or two pieces of respect. When the movie is finished you will not see the original concept through the team's total team team. Add to this the fact that the 'stranger' only kills people by ignoring them, as opposed to making any 'slashing' any such and you have a great painful loss of good left to decay. You will laugh at Alienator, but AT, not with it. If that's your thing then go ahead and watch.
