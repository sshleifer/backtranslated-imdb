He made a serious mistake to see this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It had been shot since the beginning, but that's the best last comment I have about the film. Acting was very bad, I wonder if the real gogo girls were employed? But it was a conspiracy that was real, and really was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Tenants under **. <br /> <br> I just want to mention a few events that had the audience laughing: <br /> <br /> Shoving a girl in the field: who would think that a child who hit another child could be treated so badly. A real eye view. <br /> <br /> Enter the bus area: The girl gets then. But, according to music, the world is approaching. <br /> <br /> Around the bottom of the line: Wow, this reflects the author's knowledge of the plot. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skills. Why not just make him commit all three sins immediately? At least this film can be a little lighter. <br /> <br /> Run down the stairs of the stall: see if one of the girls takes run down the stairs followed by the meat to eat Dau, no waiting. he * is going quickly fasting to break his nails. Running with blood: this is definitely my favorite place, and the best end for the movie. Half a marathon in red color, completed with a high and high grade level, just sent by an abnormal jump with a car. Not only this, but this suicide is done by a girl who appeared very well in the film, now includes your behavior. I would like to think that this film was created by the 16th year old and their partners. Sadly, after meeting with the director in the presentation, this is not the case. But, if you have a sad situation, and you like laughter and a few men. then you shouldn't even think about it.
