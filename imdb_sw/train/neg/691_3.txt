This may not be suitable under the Slasher movie bar which is not available but it is certainly a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> The Holiday Cluster offers an interesting variety but after the first movie events show that it is poor production standards and stupid plot. I mean, the small genre was at all times about unseen young people because there is no clear but this takes too far. There is no solidarity in events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> Clich√®s is more to pull, gore is smaller, and so secret. This is a good entry for a slasher which should not be beaten even if it has a video label. I am very disappointed with this trash piece.
