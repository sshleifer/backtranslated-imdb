Loss Control is another offering in the kind of exciting erotic that can be considered as the fiction of the leaves of the world film. Typically, it involves a cycle of cycling for the purpose of murder, facing a large-scale cancellation. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the most beautiful women who live in this world of faith. Kim Ward (Rea Kira) is facing the author's author. Luckily, (or is it?) It meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who is involved with him in meeting the most dangerous sex. The person refuses to give any information about himself, but Kim strongly refuses to leave it. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks it will do wonders for its book sales. As in many films of this kind, the denouement is nearing the end but some things do not move. I have seen enough for this type of film to reflect, no change there, then - but I love them. They are very undemanding. <br /> <br /> Disposal displays vary. Doug Jeffery carries a film as psychological / sociopath does not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince the woman if she is in danger. Clay Greenbush as PI did not influence either. <br /> <br /> Finally, be careful about the reviewed DVD. All the cover and the condition of the disc counting R and the time you run as 93 minutes but the flight time is less than 86 minutes. 4 stars.
