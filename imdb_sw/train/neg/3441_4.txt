What she was this. Someone clearly read Stephen King and Sartre in one semester. We find the possibility to communicate with the cheapest. There was a time when you were frustrated but everyone was deleted by bad music, CGI, or act. <br /> <br /> Problem with fantastic stories like this is that it feels lazy. Even the work of David Lynch feels like that sometimes, and like his spectacular performances and movies run very long. And sadly this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> Planned was interesting, and that's about the limit for this. I think it affects the feelings of young people and the fear of loneliness we all have, but it does not only make suitable characters for us to care about their fates ... whatever they were. The last event leaves nothing worthless.
