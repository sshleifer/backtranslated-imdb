The Dead House was the worst movie I had ever seen, between the pathetic matrix '360 of the camera camera and good effort I slept. I don't think the director and manager of the set can decide whether it is rain or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not another. I would like to measure this movie 1 out of 10, (10 to be better, 1 worse). Also flying scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just doing for a while to lose. I ask anyone who reads this, NOT to get it. Not suitable time.
