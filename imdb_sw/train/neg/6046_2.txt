This film is essentially two hours of the attitude of Dafoe drinking himself - almost entirely - die. The only surprise in this film is that he did not have enough signs or skills to be surprised. It was a bad, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just played. Slowly does not make a bad movie, it was very bad. The artwork mixed with artistic ramblings of an intimate detail of the namorphic does not relate to each other in a meaningful way except to show a certain year which is shown in several ways, eventually at the end. I am very excited about the artistic vision, but as a entertainment, it puts me to sleep. (By and large, I slept and I had to look at the film - which was more awesome.) <br /> <br /> I do not like to make negative comments or views on others' work, even when it exploits, but this film focuses on one . It is so bad that these chief executives were ashamed of this final outcome.
