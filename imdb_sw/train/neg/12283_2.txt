Alex Gardner's college student (Nicholas Celozzi) complains to the ghoul dream of Alcatraz's cellar. He dreamed of cutting his own hand, blowing the fly mate, ghoul broke his chest and filtered on open fire. After his friends see him stirring "6 feet" on his bed, a good, ignorant teacher (Donna Denton) shows that they are entering Alcatraz to cope with his fears. No doubt it goes in the middle of the night when no one is about to speak when things go wrong! That group is cotton, Alex Richard's brother (Tom Reilly) becomes host and starts killing everyone. The foundation of "Mickey" popularity suggests as Sammy Mitchell's attraction, "Bodybag" singer. He teaches Alex how to eliminate his body and make intercut rock intercut music and repeat the dream footage pad out of time. All victims show as the wisecracking ghosts of the character of Griffin Dunne in AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. Script is full of conspiracy holes, cheesy negotiations and attempt to lose on comedy. The good FX function and open-air loans (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that get any reputation. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make certain songs on sound sounds. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
