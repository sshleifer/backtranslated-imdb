This movie is very bad. It is a star Scott Backula as another coach, but that's not important, it's important a great black fellow who plays the first foundation. First he needs to be at least 75 years of age, but still plays a little league baseball, and the second begins the movie on the outside field although he can't walk, letting him run. Coach of the Coach leads him clearly that he first tries to stay in the same place for a very long period of time. Backula shows a more effective strategy to teach the talent at the end of the film, (SPOILER), tells his star player "city metropolis" to hit home run, to clear "downtown" saw this as a good argument. He ran home and won the game for his team, a little league squad that played Twins who were class of majors in the movie. Now if only Tony Muser, manager of Royals, would be a skilled teacher like Backula and tell his players just to run home home for each button, Royals can not finish inning alone to lose the game.
