In the shortest town in the city and his wife have a wonderful life they are singing when a man takes on the old suit of the red pants of his mother. I kept watching this hope that I would see what had been done, or why other viewers felt it was funny. For me it was a waste of time. It's not everyone's taste is the same but this was obviously not mine.
