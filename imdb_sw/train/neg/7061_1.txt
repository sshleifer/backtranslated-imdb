I am still trying to think if there is a point of this film. The content that is supposed to be 'rebel' and 'controversial' things that Maddox distributes to students are very crippled. The pupils seem to be easy to be beaten with an uncontrolled sense of control and words that have been caused against the tips. Priests, everyone. I think it would be too much to ask to have a boyfriend film where a school bell can not turn off. It seems 'great fighting on football fields' is fighting two people. Human characteristics seem to vary by randomly. The soccer player Maddox was fighting (and who later won the top of the face) all excited and apologized the next day. The fact that you have not reached the real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that nothing can be locked within half an hour after a special school. If they had rejected more than a pseudo-glitch sound experiment.
