Really true - rarely I watch the film and it's left sad last. I have seen very few changes of Ira Levin - 'Child of Rosemary' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and they loved both, but this did not like me. When I read the plot of the plot - the award winner (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and write his script for his own success - I was happy. I love exciting, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I can not destroy it for anyone who has not yet seen it, but all 'd say there are plans to lose and turn. Most of its kind of difficult to describe the line of the plot of the film in detail, without giving away. I enjoyed the first time ... 45 minutes, before turning and turning began to happen and at that time my interest and happiness began to turn off. Although I must give Lumet credit for an exciting end that made me laugh loudly. <br /> <br /> The main ruler - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all skilled in their roles. Although Worthy of the Russian fake obviously caused my little nerves (no one Irene, I think any fault of an artificial actor would be negative). I don't know if the character of the Cannon was supposed to be sad but Dyan managed to pull and hate - at the same time. Anybody reading this - I don't want to be released for this view because of my views - make a chance, you can love it, you may not. It's all about the comments.
