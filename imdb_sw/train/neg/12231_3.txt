I saw this film, and sometimes, I wasn't sure to believe that this film 'saw me.' Munchie sullies 'farce' for years to come. Look again at Star Wars, don't look at Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I talk to those who are parents now), I (you) will not allow my child to always participate in this pseudo-occult video. In order to stay in Munchie is the devil, for the viewer, it is possible to harm 'duh'. He is a fierce, alien, stick, and evil - if a Bogey man made a body, invisible to adults, trying children with life that they could not afford (without earning income for years of rejection and wise care). He is a helper of simple answers, and false values. He is everything moral viewer is not. He is the only President of Ron. I pray (I mean this in fact and for example, with an emphasis on the past) that this movie has not made the structure fly on DVD. It is my hope that this kind of "yellow films" died a death that had no redemption in the winter of 1994. Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. Comes very much.
