I have seen about a thousand films of fear. (My favorite type) This film is among the worst. For me, the idea gives the car. So, even the wrong work, the cheap film can be good. The Weird thing is obvious at the affordable price. However, it has little to say. I still do not know what the karate area was originally associated with the film. Weird's little thing to offer. Put yourself in pain!
