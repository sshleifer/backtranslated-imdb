Identify the plot immediately. The daughter of a divorced couple is trying to bring Mom and Dad again. Yes, that was the head of Parent Parent in 60, 80 and 90 years. But here's a spooky thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills while playing the role of doting daughter, Durbin seems to be very old, just like adults. And so do all his brothers. And this mix between the adult and the child goes to the film. The girls are wearing small seaweed but they seem to be ignorant in them as the director seems to take the pain to give their heads enough and the cups. So you are constantly breaking into thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "beat" it feels like they are pedophiles, and you can be one, also to recognize those tushies and on the director was showing. Young people or temptations, young girls or young ones, do not know exactly what you should think of as. Parents, too, seem to be too old and the whole film looks very much. <br /> <br /> It is a rusty version of Parent's trap and you should avoid, or at least make sure your shots of tetanus stand if you don't believe.
