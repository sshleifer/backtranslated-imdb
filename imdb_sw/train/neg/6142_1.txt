Gymomera is undoubtedly one of the worst films made. But it's not a bad kind of bad movies. This is very bad to look and laugh. Kurt Thomas has no right to work in action. He should return to the gym. But who can forget such incidents like a high bar and chalk, stone stone or five minutes after tracking through a subtle village for slow motion. I don't think it meant to be bad, but who could say. It's not an art, but if you want something little and fluffy that will make a good conversation, a gymakta tax. Makes an evening of fun.
