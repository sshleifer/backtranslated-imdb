Well I am not America, but in my opinion under Scottish Steve Martin is not, he has never, and never will be a pleasant person as long as our supporters are going to the south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a good man, of course due to skilled writers and directors and other talented team working team members who have contributed to one of the most funniest and non-timeless American comedies. How anyone can be confident even try to strive the character of Phil Silvers is far from me. In order to combine this exercise it has been reinstated in Martin's unwillingness to be the Inspector of Peter Seller of Clouseau, another attempt to provide delivery, in my opinion, to retain the unintended work. Some of your contributors say 'Steve Martin sets his own stamp on character', since I will say 'balderdash', his exhibition will be long forgotten when those Silvers and Sellars will be protected for future generations
