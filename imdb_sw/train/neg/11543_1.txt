Although I regularly use this site to see how other people thought about what I think is a challenge or just a fun film, after looking at this "movie" in the Fourth Film last night I felt compelled to write something down, even if it helped me immediately clean up. again. <br /> <br /> The movie was the most unlikely possibility I ever had - the main characters hit by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy always have Spock) didn't have a real substance on them - I don't know if the first half of the film did not make the final cut but certainly in revenge you would like to be impressed by the victims ... here I could not take care of a little. In fact, the only way I felt caring was the dog, and the stag comes second. And both animals made out Dire (sic) and Scully, which were quite clear. I think though you are just as good as the script given to you, and I would like to thank the authors, producers, director and everything that was hit by losing 90 minutes of my life with a really good electricity.
