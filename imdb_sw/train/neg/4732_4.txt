If I write a review on the film, maybe it will catch me ... but in general I expect to forget I have seen this is just two weeks from now. Why are you bothering? Because again I see myself looking at a movie underneath that was fun to look at. I didn't expect you to stay in the room when you were. It was not great, but at least it was not patient ... it's not a comedy of mistakes that always makes me fly. It was just a beautiful sweet ... and if you can't pick it up, crab in the room locker boys. I agree with those who protect this film because it is certainly enjoyable for the number of people excluded, and it will not be a total bear for an adult. <br /> <br /> Offers beautiful chuckles here and there, but nary splitter side. Certainly it's silly and gently just entertainment, but at least it does not drink (as many have said it does). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? I have a tendency to hit the bell on the alarm bell, so 4,5 or 6 is exactly right next to my book. Giving 4 is meaningful and will strengthen its rating during these text. Give 1 or 10, as many have done so far, makes the rating number being useless. I can't believe how people feel in one way or another about this fluff forgetting (or that I'm causing it to write about it). What? Is there anything? However, it should be noted that Emma Roberts does his role as Clairedycat completely lobbying. Ariell Kebbel is often written in the responsibilities of b * ch is not available when its character is available. You can also remember Bruce Spence playing Leonard, although his role is helping them. You can lose this if you are an adult. But, if there is a little girl's boyfriend in your life, borrow this movie for her ... and be ready not to hate it (you can even enjoy).
