For this cast and budget you expect more. John Cusack has made a number of the best-known film, still working. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this destructive garbage. <br /> <br /> Movie is nothing more than a series of eyes and poor there. The plan does not go anywhere, the writing is made, useless and the characters of the characters are thin. If you think of a third-dimensional film where the story and characters brings deep to the picture, this shinker comes as flat as steamboat mickey. Dan Akroyd's appearance in this brought to mind another bad movie, 1991 Nothing but trouble. In fact this film is a kind of project that kills the job and finds the deleted agents.
