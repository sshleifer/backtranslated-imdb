This film reminds me of a lot of "History of Violence" which made it a close observation of violence and violence but it stopped that it was not the lowest of a cheap movie that builds as a film of violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British grandmother move to a small English town and meet endless abuse from the local abusers who have nothing but rely on bars every day and make trouble. Are these men not working? However, Dustin takes everything he can and at the end of a movie that stands at his home and fights every one of the attackers in a bad way such as boiling whiskey pours on the man, the strangled legs and some head get caught in a trap . Funny that one will need a great trap to carry in a small British town unless perhaps the head of mans in it. <br /> Sam Peckinpah who made "Wild Bunch" which also revealed the topic of blood to allow violence that no one was saved. But it was done in fashion, and you believed it. Dogs are not trusted. The first part is correct and does not work. Why make it in the UK? I would like to think maybe in the inner city or town in South America in the 1930s or something. The second is not in my view has clearly explained why these men are fighting violence unless they have been drunk and feel the need to kill Hoffman and his wife. Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this.
