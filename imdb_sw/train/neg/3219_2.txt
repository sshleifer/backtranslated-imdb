Someone named Howard Koch schlockmeister but he wrote a screenplay for "Casablanca", isn't he? Or was not. Perhaps there is more than one Koch around the Hollywood, and I am not also experienced any "Casablanca". Waiting a minute - yes, there is Howard Koch another around around Hollwyood. This is the one who wrote "Casablanca." No matter. I will put a lot of service in these comments as "Howard W. Koch" put in this production, which is just saying a bit. <br /> <br /> Do you know what this looks like? The reader of the Cliff Notes on Shakespeare's King Lear and decided, since no previous ideas were within the Express Inspiration Express, to make it with Hollywoodize for fun. <br /> <br /> There is a difference. Lear decides to distribute his vast territory between three sisters and before doing so, he asks them how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw their feet with a brown nose to get her money. The third is a beautiful girl and refuses to work for Lear. But in play, Lear lives alive to regret his decision to give two to connect his stash and deprive the faithful girl. He sends the foolishness and nakedness during the gale on moors, putting flowers in his hair and embracing. Children can do that for you. (Take my child, for example. After all the efforts I have made to raise him, does he show any interest to be a doctor or a lawyer? No, at the end, everyone in play dies. A good sister is proud and suicidal but when she tries to pull out, someone jumps and saves, so the end is, more or less, happy.
