I am a sympathetic person, so I have given this film 2 instead of 1. It was of course the worst movie that I have seen for a long time. There was a very small plot and the most interesting places touched on what Jesus might have wanted us to know, had been emerged and instead we were given heavy doses of the sad punishment caused by our heroine. The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humanitarian to its character and audience. Acting was almost there and the direction was not opened. And, if I saw some water or pigeon going up to the camera, I could start shouting more than Patricia.
