I am angry with the modernization of Shakespeare when the director cannot make his ideas about using nature or doing it. If you are using the original words in the updated settings, this is amazing if it is set in the 20th or 21st century though it can work well in the styles of the period, for example, the twelfth night of Trevor Nunn put the late Pastor at the end of the process. It can work with 30 settings only if there was a little song and dance and more than Shakespeare text. Unfortunately, it is only last to be very good though a very good show. Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that the very old to play one but more importantly, he is an experienced actor of Shakespearean that despite all his efforts to be just another pupil, his ability to act is always visible. No doubt he would have to play the King - there is no problem with having an old pupil King surrounded by young students. Instead we had a good but uncompromising actor for the King, therefore, who did not set up an impartial king. The rate of song and dance, which I have provoked in spite of good tracks and good enough play, unfortunately the meaning of the big talk Shakespearea was dropped rapidly. So anything has turned down a bit, and I was very tired, including a comic cycle, and I was happy when it was finished. Branagh has not done the right to Shakespeare in this production. Even though Bard and Geraldine McEwan are older than the older couple.
