I just want to say that this production is direct, it breaks the preference if you want to be taken seriously. There is no credit for people interviewed, so you can't have an idea if they deserve to be heard. It tells a story from just one view. Doing so is very dangerous, because the next generation learns a bad idea, and that's why the war is coming. I know this is not the only reason for war, but it does not give either. <br /> <br /> you can view this document, but read on many web sites, before. Balcans are as hard as human history.
