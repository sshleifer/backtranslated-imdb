'Mojo' is a story of London's fifty, world of rock stars, war and homosexual abuse. 'Mojo' uses a technique to shoot in the 1950s is often seen in films that emphasize physical differences in our own time but also represents a widespread dialogue (because much of the dialogue was presented in films made at that time); I don't know if people really spoke like this out of the movies, but no films made today and put in modern times using language as stylized. It is like the use of the 1950s the film producers are doing the most common work in the past that appears, for that reason, a very distant country; and thus emphasizes exactly, rather than all, in the story. 'Mojo' has a strong performance from Ian Hart and those despairing from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the last still struggling to create a post 'Treninspotting' work; but it feels like a piece of the period, a modern film that is not understood for a timeless structure. Rather, in fact.
