First I would say that I am not a fan of Dukes, but after this film series appears as Act and Procedure. The worst thing is to be placed with Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not a Hogg Boss, and even more was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If they had ever seen a show of Roscoe was not a hard copo. He was more than Barney Fife than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> Movie is restored by normal error, cars are breaking, and it continues if nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the Chief meets with Billy Prickett, and the Chief enters the dirt hill that is falling down and stopping, but continues to win the race.
