Bruce Lee was a great military artist, but this film is still one of the worst films made. It has Bruce Lee died as a result of a helicopter collapse after being hit by a ninja knife behind the neck but does not describe how he was on the helicopter since the previous place was close to him but not on helicopter that is already 200 feet in air. It just gets a lot of wonder since then, as something from the comic book of cheap. Perhaps the idea is not decomposed but it has not been done at any level of art from the film perspective. There are a lot of martial bombers out there, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam improved this kind by adding enough stories to his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are better than 90 percent of military military films during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' comes in the junk movie community in my opinion, despite Bruce Lee being in it.
