There were many realistic movies that were produced in the seventy years - but this film is certainly not one of them! It is embarrassing the child is not better if it works because of a decent idea that takes several themes of success at other times. We have the idea of ​​a child with a vengeance, which did very well in classic films such as bad seeds and then we have a great theme of a zombie, which has actually been behind many of the most successful movie screens. This plan is essentially: the little girl claims the burden of the people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the grave and raises the dead to take revenge (as you do). This is good and beautiful, except for the fact that it is boring! Nothing is done for many films, although it takes the end of a good year; is not enough to justify staying through others. The film was obviously being hit on the budget as the areas looked cheap and all actors were trash. There really can not very say on the film as much as there is not much. The child is a flick of seven years and I certainly do not recommend.
