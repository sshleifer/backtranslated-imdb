Poor Michael Madsen; he must be giving himself to know people have discovered about this awesome flick. In fact I can't imagine anything more than I ever saw, except an amateur porn. It's bad, and all here; The wooden act, the bad script, the end of the crappy code, you like and is on this film. My question is: "Who is hell who put $$$ on this piece of doggy doo? He could see Michael's sister nike in the area, but I don't think it could save this stinker ... For a cool guy that has made some movies of discrimination, I want to know what the wacky church sponsored this piece of despair.
