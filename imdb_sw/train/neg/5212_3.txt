I didn't know I had this film on my shelf for a while at the Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to look at it; though not expecting a lot. If the first loans revolve around, I am surprised to discover this film was made under Filmirage Company. Filmirage brought the world to be as stinkers as amazing as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible", and the "Sword of the Sword Strong", so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> As the movie began to be very good, though it was not unusual. Year events can be improved if expanded and more frequently. But after a while in the film, the speed began to dig and I found myself thinking "Right person can be killed soon", or "Someone else's best." At the beginning of this drag, when I had these ideas, though one might be killed or converted, however, as described, the effects and effects were not very good. What made the worst situation was that the change of the area was a mixture; For example: first Dr. Houseman would be in Zoo, then he would go back on the possibility of killing someone, he would eventually wake up in a cold sweat on the bed - making the audience ask "Was he going to the zoo?". As the film speed, this change of location was worse. I will try to say the development of Dr. Houseman's behavior was very good, but at the end of the film, that is, You have seen what Doctor has made in, hope will laugh - which, in fact, is the only reason to see this film at once ; This movie without volunteers runs like a long joke. <br /> <br /> Costume of um, something that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "Sword of the Sword Strong", which was made the same year. You should love Filmirage movies, always using the same things!
