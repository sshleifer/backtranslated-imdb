It's a disappointment! I hated mummy but this was worse! It was very spontaneous and unreliable and at some point I found myself searching and smelling every time. I can't believe that people liked this film. Nicholas Cage's role was not very interesting. The whole movie saw it as a great tour near the most wanted American buildings. A never-ending cycle of thought and mix did not convince them. I stopped considering about 30 minutes. What had to be a happy night out there became a general desire. What drag ... I think I've seen so many movies to enjoy the National Treasury.
