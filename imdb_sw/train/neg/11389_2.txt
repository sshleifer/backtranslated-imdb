If you like movies coming out and the slightest exhibition of selected kinky sex, this film is for you. On the other side the leading actor / actress (the partner woman) gets an interesting presence of the screens, but it is not enough to add more than a mild-looking movie - like that. Basically this film is about 3 social partners (male, male, and Russian, gay immigrants) who have somehow established securities. Why not clear. We are expected to accept these misfits are the basic foundation people who are able to love when they beat their bodies on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith was really loving and ninety something sugar father! The painter shows the wrong side of life when he wants us to believe under all these people who have been so badly damaged by the standard that they have three hundred that help them through life. Fantasy completely, but unfortunately is shown here as a real look at life on the wild side. In general, there is no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless you would like to love kink !!!
