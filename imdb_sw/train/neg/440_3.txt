** HERE YOU CAN SPOILERS ** Recap: Mia (Helin) returns home from Stockholm to Rättvik villages to celebrate her 70th birthday. Eivor has a family and still lives Rättvik and Gunilla has been divorced and moved to the city far. Mia is still a wife and she cares for her work. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hatred between sisters and disputes occur as they face each other with personal problems that have difficulty dealing. If the party is going on (and alcohol is used), more and more secrets have been revealed and more and more conflicts occur ... the same that the Swedish elders have played / dramas have been following for years. Certainly there are no new features or ideas. This movie approaches three primary areas. 1) Just a humorous sense of humor makes a fool of their own. 2) sad and 3) worries. This step has the ultimate goal, almost forget the first point if the movie goes along. There is no loss though, since the humor that is not funny. Exhibitions from the cast are good I think, although it has been lost behind all the pain and recently forgotten. I was hoping that there would be new ideas and influence, but there was no. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend time than to watch this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
