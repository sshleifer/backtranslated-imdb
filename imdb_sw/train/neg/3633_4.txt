Of the ten actors who were shown the Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe appeared to be more qualified, but in this script the audience is the way forward to the most prominent detective. After all, when jockey, Douglas Walton, looking empty in space, is obvious, and says something like "I must climb and be killed," I felt dumb that nobody took it after being killed. The police thought it was suicide because he said he would do it! After the owner of the hijacked Gene Lockhart was shot and killed, Frieda Inescort is doing the same thing, saying he is going to be killed, and then the oil appears on the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally said "I got it," as if it was a revelation. However, the criminal party was carefully guarded and there were serious doubts when the party began to encourage Lowe to make him laugh over the roof.
