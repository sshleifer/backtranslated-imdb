This film was useful and box-office fiasco back in 1957. It was the basis of a novel which later turned into play - which flopped on Broadway. The story is about navy officials when leaving San Francisco during WWII. They have to leave for 4 days that use the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film does much and no characters seem real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and game - but here he has a kind of wheeler supplier and he doesn't really pull off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have the best choice. Audrey Hepburn began to put against the Grant, but had another promise - so the pastor of Suzy entered. He has never worked before, but it was the highest example of America at the same time. I think he did a good job, considering any pressure he was under. Grant meeting with Jayne Mansfield in a few pictures - did not work. Studio tried to give him a certain class to act with Grant - but the character had nothing.
