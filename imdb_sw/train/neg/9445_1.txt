A shameful attack on UA ​​/ DW for what you are doing! <br /> <br /> I was surprised. Do not take children to watch this film. Humor is not quite good for children - with them they will be tired and desperate. Certainly * we have all read the wonderful children of Theo and indeed we hope ... but this is a good garbage. Dr Seuss will be embarrassed and certainly never ever give "fingers" on the dastardly attempt of fun in classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then give it a book and give it to the Toys app for Tots. This movie should not watch "free" tickets. <br /> <br /> Close the book. The cartoon version of the TV works best if you want a picture showing - secure your money ... for weight. SAVE your money - it will be on the cable for the day of the patty saint. Shame shy shame on what they do !!
