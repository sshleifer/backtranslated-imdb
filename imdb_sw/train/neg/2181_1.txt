I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of the old B movies that are fun to watch. I wasn't right! This film was stimulating and certainly has a focus on men who like to look at women with intelligence. The story was so ridiculous and strong that it had completely lost my interest. It seemed to be in the same type as Ed Wood's film - under the barrel.
