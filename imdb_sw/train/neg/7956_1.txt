This movie should be a number less than 100. Acting is so horrible that when I and my child look at us we almost had a physical illness. And the story is even worse. I would like to go on and on how bad it was but all I wanted to do was add a warning to the frankbob review as I see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing it yet. Don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this film. Thank you for the good we saw on television so we didn't use anything on it. If we were, I would have to write the people involved with these abominations and be forced to make orders in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I liked to enjoy Carrie Fisher's action. But I am sad to say that it is not appropriate to watch this film. Don't lose your Carrie's opinion by looking at it.
