Wow and I thought that any movie Steven Segal was bad. Every time I thought that movies could not be worse than I saw it. The story was good but the participants could not remove it. Also, they made a lot of mistakes on how accurate storage digs are done. For example you do not have to deal with the residue when they are placed and they are ringing. The greatest crime in forming was a girl of memory. He is a weak actor and I heard that his acting made the movie that was impossible then it was ready. The whole concept of the knights to be underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they lost and things, so that almost seemed to have trouble. I thought the characters did not explain well. You haven't found a lot of history and that has made it difficult to communicate with them.
