Okay, forget all technical terms or physical functions of Space Shuttle launched by a robot of quirky heart gold. Forget the special effects of hideous with the wrong-dimensional characters. Just look at the basis of the story. The reason for the film is for the first place, and you will see how this film was played together. The 9-year-olds look at this trouble with the mind and just laugh there. The story is awesome. Acting is good and the message you are trying to show cannot be understood. And what's worse, it's that cable Modern way KEEP to show IT! Its twice a day every two or three days! Why would anyone with a good mind think that people would like to see this piece of celluloid multiple times, a little bit of seeing it? <br /> <br /> My discipline is not worth even using energy to check this object. His justice is not worth it.
