I must accept, there are few books with movies I have read before I see the movie changes. Eight and thirty-one happens to be one of the most common events. The book was good. It was an immersive and pleasing prophecy. But the movie just directed to the open. Easily the worst films I saw. The only reason I did not stop after the first 5 minutes was that watching the film was half the work of two parts for the class. It was dark and pleasure, but he did nothing in a way to achieve a good condition. Acting was nothing on average, and based on the fact that there was not much to do, this was very difficult. The book, for example, did not give me the feeling that Winston could not delete more than one weapon at a time. The banning, distortion, and visually impaired, the film was not fully released. Wait a second ... Isn't the UK?
