This movie is probably the worst I saw. Bad work, bad script, everything wrong. Compared with the other two other movies in that form and from around the same time it is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are very good and seem to be more stable in both stories and lead and are still Albert Pyun who has led them two too! <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a horrible place, perhaps because of a natural disaster or nuclear war, and people live under the middle of the situation. Specific types of robots (cyborgs) live in human blood and there are stories ... Cyborgs needs to find many people to fulfill there "prophecy" and human beings need someone to stop them. One girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) has been created by the creator of cyborgs placed by the fate of saving mankind. In this movie the director tries to scenes of the Hong-Kong fighting and participants jump up and fly away. The movie fails to bad situation in this attempt. I recommend this film for the only reason that most people will get a new "worst" film related to it. And for fans of the kind I recommend "Cyborg" since I think it is underestimated the movie and quite on entertainment factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme then see "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I photographed this 1/10 film.
