The average level even with Monogram levels, this secret (remake of The Sphinx) has an odd plot that has not been identified for many effects - you will see through ten minutes. The two guides have a good conversation at the beginning, but John Hamilton can not be as good as the villain (who beat Lionel Atwill took the role) and the Nitwit Shtick's Warren Hymer is very angry. However, it is worth staying for five minutes the appearance of Mantan Moreland without a match like Nicodemus administrator, who gets the best defense lawyer during the hilarious court appearance. You need to give Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not a lot of director, but he would often be running a normal app with a goefy vaudeville.
