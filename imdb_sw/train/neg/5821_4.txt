As others have realized, this should be the best film of the hammer, and it seems to me that that's how many of the actors were ordered to do it ... but the screenplay is so leaden, angry, and filled with a lot of red soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton is put together most of them) that are very high and very important. This is the impossibility of Dalton, although he is actively working in the area that Dr. Rock finally knows what he did. The only actor who comes too far is Patrick Stewart who is the most welcome. Freddie Francis can be a famous film writer, but he was a good director.
