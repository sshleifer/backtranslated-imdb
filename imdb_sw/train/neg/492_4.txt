If you have followed the true story of the original artist Baroque Artemisia Hamachi, you will be disappointed - even if you are after the sedition of the organized bodice with the theme of the art, you have found a movie. This film is an incorrect picture of the life of the Levite Artemis that almost makes me cry. (Put in Artemisia on Google and look at some facts about false stories.) From a real technical perspective though, the film was the same: sets, clothes, and especially in the lighting of the maaroscuro lights helped create immersive 17 century experience; although the above mentioned texts leave them down. I wonder how the director / journalist Agn√®s Merlet defended his film at that time? Probably refused to show Artemisia as a victim, which would have been bad, because it faced the face, was.
