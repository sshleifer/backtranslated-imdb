I just saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The movie has very little like any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous psychological-violent violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this film because it made the star Zoe Trilling of the "Night of Demons"; and I wanted to see him playing a normal person. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's lesson goes ahead and goes wherever Robert Englund leads the film and stimulates attraction and plot. Zoe, I know where now; hide from this film!
