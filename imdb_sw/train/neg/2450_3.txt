I watched Peter Jackson's version of the ring when I would be half way to read the two Towers and I thought it was quite wise. At this time the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DVD but I told myself that I would finish reading the two Towers and the Return of Kings before examining it (if I thought it was a whole trilogy shows). <br /> <br /> So when I finished trilogy I went and brought a DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was quite garbage. I was working for 20 minutes for something that was very strange because I love the book and I have been beaten that the filmmaker can even think of at least 1 and a half of the books in 2 minute minutes 8. No one who has a sense of feeling when they were speaking and seemed to be reading the page, even my favorite character which is Gandalf was not found even interesting. The animation was just the same as in the film except for frames (visible visually) and Aragorn and Sam's face. I don't know the way this film was released because it did not end the end, but maybe it was good that the manufacturer lost money because the film could not be better. I hope that no one condemns the books of this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
