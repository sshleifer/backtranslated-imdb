I don't know anything of Iliad so he can't comment on the accuracy of the story. However, if the film alone alone saw this as boring. The war of war was trying to be great and positive but they were just CGI clear. <br /> <br /> Acting is poor and of course Brad Pitt was thrown to attract women. But he can't make a good fighter, very fine I am afraid. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This film looks beautiful and the island buildings and buildings / amazing walls. I love the film which at least tries to find the characters really causes but this film seems to ignore it completely. we hear English, Scottish English anything but what you can expect for a film about ancient civilization. For all, I do not recommend this film for families to sit down. It is too long and young people will be attracted to. For adults, it is okay if you don't care about shortages.
