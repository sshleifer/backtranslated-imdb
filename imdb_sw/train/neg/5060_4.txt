This movie is the perfect perfect English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit has the role of Richard Gere, Emran of Olivier and Malikka responsible for the perfect player of Lane. They have changed the second half of the film to deal with Indian citizens. Yet the movie has a full repetition of the unbelievers, although it was not infected by nature. It was the cheapest pictures of sound lovers, where Mallika showed more skins than anyone who tried to show. Emran worked more like this and even called the serial killer name. In the future if India's Directors plan to fix the English movie then they should look at the possibility of a plot with Censors of India. Although the film hit a box at the box office, the participants got a misunderstanding. In the future directors should be more careful in fixing the Oscar film selected. All have said, this is not a family film, so take extra precautions when looking at home and family.
