This is the awesome production of Bartleby, though it is not, if another inspector has put it because "it cannot fail," but because it does not keep the spirit of the book. It tells you the story, near the pain. Looking at me, I could have these pages in my book and follow, which is not very happy when dealing with changes. Instead, see the 2001 edition of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. This version, when humorous, brings new information to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like set, character names, and clothing. The difference between these versions of the film is like night and day, stirring and hilarious. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if the situation is dealt with poorly, the perpetrator, the perpetrator.
