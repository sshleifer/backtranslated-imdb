Madness, I haven't seen this bad film for a long time. Maybe not since 'New Guy' or various movies of Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's very strange. Empty and wooden projects of Mira Sorvino must be transferred by Freddie. The film was unusual (like playing, instead, and the sense of closure does not work well on the film). The characters didn't know what they did, especially Sorvino. His feeling was bad and his gender appeal was not here so it was painful to see him 'cheating' other characters and 'fall' for it. And what were the templates of the audience to live in lawn seats? Nonsensical! I had to turn a dvd player, it would be an independent pain to end this film.
