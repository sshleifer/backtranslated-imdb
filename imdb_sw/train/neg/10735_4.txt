Perhaps being a former Vulnerant and having a sense of humor to protect me from leaving this movie on the 'arthouse / festival crap'. It's not a great film of 2005, not a full garbage. It has many problems. I also believe that this film was banned because of 'ideological fears' or 'conservative hats' or any other reason for this film can be called 'bold' and 'absence' abroad. It was banned because viewers knew that 99% of Russian films would be prejudiced because of the bad taste used during the shooting and editing of this unfortunate film. We therefore have a great opening shot. Good sound structure, beautiful background - full of meaning and symbol. The use and placement of the mark will be consistent in the most powerful aspects of the film (not that number 4 is a challenge to see awesome). Over the next 40 minutes we have set up the same. Talk of the amusing bar and well written among 3 characters (main?), And we feel bad for these people, the great country of Russia, the human nature and all. Then the movie will begin to decline. We begin to wonder what -will - lies ahead. <br /> <br /> Others are quite boring, just setting. Indeed, the boy in the village is stirring the heart, and there is a short time to kiss. Good sound, certainly. But the joy of this movie, not to mention the plot, is experiencing serious problems. And this, inadequate to stay in all the pain (self-shooting), is what will ultimately make people angry about the "rejection" (personal, large area of ​​refusal is bound to be interesting, for that The most interesting way of alcoholics who may seem innocent can be seen. If you want to watch a fun film where Russians disappear over a long period of time (the entire film), see National Hunting Details. More advanced items after Soviet. So yes, 4 out of 10 for 4, beautiful and typical of my short-term status.
