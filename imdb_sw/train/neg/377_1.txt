Don't even ask why I looked at this! Only forgiveness can come and that I was sick with Bronchitis and very weak to change the facility. :) It's very scary for words, a movie that is, not Bronchitis. The actor is sad, Richard Grieco puts it as an attacking gunman, attacking gun and player by knocking the soldier. Nick Mancuso's phones in action as a striker on his election and Nancy Allen can put a special place of mercy in the entire film. Script is bad, full of clich√©d lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" tries Richard Grieco for each of his victims. Trends. Avoid.
