The animation was good, the picture was good, although it was not quite natural, however, the story was too long, the way also confused, and on the top above. After an hour I couldn't wait to get it. For many characters who do not have anything to contribute to the plot of things that can happen anywhere or go anywhere this movie was not one movie completely and it would be better if a short series or maybe two movies. If you would like this popular story you might like it, but in fact, I have been ruined by many more stories of creation that actually have a kind of telling message. Go to the Miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll find more ways.
