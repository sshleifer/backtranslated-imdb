This week, I thought it would be a pleasure to catch Corey Haim, after seeing two film losses last week and all. It's not that I am a fan-fan - not far away - but I have loved the two Coreys in the films back in my young days. So, I am prepared for three films that are interesting to him. Unfortunately, I have taken "Dream Machine" as the first (never seen before), and it was godawfully terrible, I decided to just install Corey back in my closet and let it resume the first, before pop in something else of her. But I was able to fight my way through this film first. I had a feeling that he wanted to play in one league as "Ferris Bueller" (1986) but it was found in his deception. Typically all the film wants to be comedy and close to the end without hope trying to be a thriller. The only thing on "Dream Machine" is based on: the dead body in the trunk of Porsche. The rest of them is very disappointed, it's a shame. Even more to Haim. I can dig you as a young man, a passionate person, but at least when he comes with some kind of guidelines for instructions. This was not clear in the "Dream Machine". So, we have a full car, yes, that's black Porsche. Girlfriend of Haim? Just a blonde player who doesn't have any lines in the film. Perfect murder ... close? Some of the dude that falls on his ass as a man of the film, trying the whole movie to steal the body out of the trunk, does not really match, and finally the end of the film thinks it is Michael Myers (minus William white Shatner mask) and Corey Haim mistakes to Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't think they could make this flick any lamer if tried. A stupid, unpopular film that leads anywhere that is led by a director who does not know how to lead his cast. Great achievement! The last question for Mr. Haim: What idea was it to have a direct smile into the camera on the end of the movie? Your or the director? We have not been made.
