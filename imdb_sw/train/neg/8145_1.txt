This film is bad I can't believe it was really shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you mad? Were we looking at the same film? Or sh sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this film. Story (there is a story?) It is not good anywhere, it is not possible, acting (some of the conversation is just ridiculous), the color of the music (what is that ****?), Editing, and especially the artistic direction, a fresh disaster. He reminds me of the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of the production of production, the girl's dress is a sleeping bag. I'm not laughing, so it is. Another example of the biggest mistakes we get here: you see in the area of ​​one extra woman, a woman with 200 pounds, who says about her mobile phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different area, can see the same woman, still speaking on her mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes away. <br /> <br /> big, big, losing money. It's useless.
