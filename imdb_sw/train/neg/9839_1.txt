The beginning of this film was good. He started getting dumb after telling people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a small town like I would be interested in seeing this film. They have made many people look like dumb and mad. What? These people could have much to do that they follow closely and always. Often these people were telling him the ways of suicide if they asked him to do so. How can most people respect others? I also think they could end up better with this movie. There were good parts of this movie too. Some people may like it, but I won't recommend this to anyone.
