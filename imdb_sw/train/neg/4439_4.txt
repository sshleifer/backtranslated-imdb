Yikes. This is very bad. The match is not good to start with, and the decision to transfer to the film is not favorable - especially if Peploe did not decide how she wants to treat the nature of the exhibition material (we find regular views of viewers of sporting games etc.) And decided to go with the style the jumpy editorial aimed at keeping you in mind that you are watching the film, when in fact it is only a servant to remind you that you are watching a very bad film and a director who has been injured by its material. The chief performance of Mira Sorvino is a breath-taking a rough action: step-y and plummy, it is like playing a part through the work of Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory. Only Fiona Shaw provides the functionality of the note - and it may be that its exhibition nature means that it has the ability to handle the material - but it is difficult to watch the film for one performance alone, even if the performance is like light, true and whole as Shaw. Ben Kingsley returns to a moderate turn and defeat, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her role just like that. Unfortunately, there is no magic of Bertolucci that has taken his wife as this film is being a witness.
