"Cobweb" is an example of many models of movies that show strong performances, sometimes good and high points, but unfortunately it breaks down with a slower slash and a little bit to attract the audience. It is a star Richard Widmark as a practitioner working in a mental institution that lives in trouble due to family problems and conflicts of concern and effectiveness which looks like no big deal even. The plan is proud. At its time to find the new drapes for the windows of the library. One old woman wants to have her drapes to put them on, but many patients want to do their own. And somehow, this ignorant and unintentional crisis arises in a situation where life is dangerous and families begin to fall. It seems more like conflicts that will occur between very young children. <br /> <br /> The logical questions of the plot and if it could actually happen is so great that someone wonders if just as real lunatic can buy. Don't make a mistake, nothing wrong with acting. The following release Widmark comprises many other actors, most of them who love Academy awards and winners. And there is often a film that works carefully, but it always includes a stupid plot about window window. Unfortunately, there is a lot about drape doggone and so, the movie flows down. Much of it takes is long and made from one view of the camera, accompanied by slow pacing and lack of interest to look at it as soon as the plot comes to the target, which makes it quicker. It is really not as much fun to see and tell you it's not very fun to watch.
