I gave this movie 1 mark (Awful). The only reason that should even get 1 instead of big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines regardless of the bad material is thrown his way. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is out of its feature here that if one viewer can't get over the fact that he is in that piece. <br /> <br /> A stupid, stupid story and terrible production. Don't lose your rental video.
