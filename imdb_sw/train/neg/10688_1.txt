I spent about two hours watching the movie I thought, along with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I could not believe when the movie ended and I had no idea what happened ... I was mad because I could spend that time doing something else .... I tried to do it all, but really didn't have a clue. Thanks to those who recognized and explained .... right or wrong, it's better to know anything !! What woman in the movie with black hair that we saw several times driving? What? How did the first woman know that her husband had deceived her? At the end of the movie Kate said she could finally know the truth. What? Does this mean that we will be filled with the last 2 game?
