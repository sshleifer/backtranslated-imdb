Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among those artists that I have always been looking for, despite specialty. I've seen Mrs. Ryan become a good and interesting actor with all her roles, and Kevin Kline is very close to looking at. I say "close" and "close" for the most part because of this film. <br /> <br /> First, Meg Ryan can't play a characteristic, playing whiner weak who starts artificial nerves shortly after opening opening and does not give up a few days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is more serious and impossible. So, even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend your offer this movie to pass.
