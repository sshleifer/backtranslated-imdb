This film has a simple but somewhat bad way. The whole movie is about the girl getting sucked through the gate for another direction then years later is reopened by the wizard when a group of friends (including a leading actor who is having trouble getting more of her former partner who is one of the other Businessmen and partner his new ... another girl ... certainly they are elite and there is undoubtedly deception without some reason). Unfortunately the demon follows the old girl now passes. Also unfortunately, no matter this is explained. Where exactly? Where did Daupo come? As a child in the place of evil spirits? What? Hell taught him and made him a type of gladiator? Acting is horrible I think but it's hard to say because writing is bad it probably didn't have anything they could do with it. I give them three because the wrestler was so nice and the effects were fun even though they were very cheap. I would recommend it, it wasn't very bad enough to be funny.
