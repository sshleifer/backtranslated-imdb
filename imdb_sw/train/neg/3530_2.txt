When Ritchie declined first in his films films were proposed as funny, false, well-directed and original. If a person can compare the hype he gave for his first two attempts and almost completely lose his last two created one should consider - has Ritchie been made? Is he really talented? Does he really have the original ideas? Or is it a self-deceptive and self-director who wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone are all locked into one common heap? After looking at one Revolver can be released for thinking he did it all not recommended? What happened to its sense of humor? Where did he get all these ideas mixed with itself? Revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and consistent, tries to be psychoanalysis of the mind, tries to be hard and complicated hard. Ritchie makes an effort to meet all these goals and incorporate large script scripts into the existence of multiple conspiracy actions. However, finally all they serve is to build an unidentified building, unattended and ultimately for the audience. His advice is wrong and uncertain even though Ritchie is trying to commit himself he should be punished even if he is trying to make it as his own work. So what the audience gets finally is the worst screenplay inserted by many oneliners concerned with clumsy setpieces. <br /> <br /> Revolver is finally an unoriginal and bland movie which stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club, Anime Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It focuses on, but largely stimulates several matches. Revolver deserves to have a sheep, it is a very bad film that emerges as the center of the wannabe from the author. However, it falls on its farcical face and fails everything that it wants to achieve.
