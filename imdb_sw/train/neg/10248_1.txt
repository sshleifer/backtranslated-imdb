The end of the world looks like a good movie on the lid of the box but show it bad. Since a great fan of mega Christopher star star was a fanatic. if the obstacles (77) good cast does not mean that it will be a good film.The beginning seems promising then turns out to be reduced, many parts of the movie are very dark to see what's going on.the rest of the cast is shown briefly as: Lew ayres, Dean Jagger, and MacDonald Carey as a security guard.I could expect better from the Charles band who made the most beautiful movies like re-animater and dolls. When he heard Christopher Lee he was forced to make this film. told his star partners to be Jose ferrer, john carridine, and Dean Jagger.well Pastor Jagger is there but two others did not (luck) if you are making a film about the end of the world using a big budget and Jigger continued to make two good films afterwards , alligator (80) and the death game (79) sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the film under its lollipop. If you are a glutton of punishment then look at the end of the world I encourage you to say a vagina during the whole movie.1 out of 10.
