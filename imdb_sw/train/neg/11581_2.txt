This is a truly awesome film. The plan (as it is) cannot be absolute. (I think it has something to do with betrayal, but I don't know it at all.) The part of the debate has strings of meaning. The other half is said by various actors in an incomprehensible "south" simulation which (with appreciation) words cannot be identified. But the real tragedy of the movie is that this historic talent like Mary Tyler Moore seems to have been in a very serious financial or personal situation that appeared in it. <br /> <br />
