WOW! Excellent things. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor street roads in Sardinia and joins the arsenal director Joseph Losey for this Tennessee Williams fiasco of a wonderful pregnancy. Taylor has a wealthy widow, who died with a fortress on her animals on the island where she commands, loudly, her memoirs to a brave secretary. While scoundrel Burton showing claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor knows his time has improved. Extreme listening - it is difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are doing wrong or if it was the intention of Williams to make their characters reduced. If so, then acting is a brilliant! Burton breaks his line, including the BOOM word several times, while Taylor tries. She is very bad. So it's Noel Coward as the hero of Cat Taylor, "the magician of Capri." Of course BOOM is about how short and how fast life goes - two common themes of Williams, but it is similar to Losey, who had Taylor and Burton did not say to the audience when their many eight-monologues, any film substance would have completely diluted . It says Joanna Shimkus, Romolo Valli as a Taylor-born physician and Michael Dunn as his security guards ... he and his dog are making a number on Burton!
