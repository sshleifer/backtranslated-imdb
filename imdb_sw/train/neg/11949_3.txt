This dumb comedy really does a good job of losing comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused here. I may have a hatred once or twice during this film, but in general, it is a boring movie, and a bit of ignorance thrown to good measure. Cluster, though frequent, was not bad, but once the plot was placed, the film did not go anywhere. Don't waste your time with this misfire.
