In one word ... odd. I give one star for sex hippie cases and eye eye eye, otherwise forget. The worst attempts of Corman, no bar. Ben Vereen should have his name completely beaten from the cast. I can't believe that this will be now on DVD (like 2/15/05) and "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I woke up the sick in the bed this morning and cold, I decided to watch the film to please some, identifying digital ways ... The column seemed attractive because I love to see the B-movie sci-fi, the hippie culture and boy rebel flicks. It seemed to be somewhat familiar with Ben Vereen in cast, I thought ... why? It was a great mistake ... it was the start of my terrible day. Just after watching it, now I know why skills entered the rest of my brain resumed. I remembered to see the incentives that came to this film as a 14-year-old (45 years old), to return early / mid-seventy to Sombrero, a local art gallery that is no longer ... all theater laughed loudly and even cried for great sounds how this movie appeared. Make: awesome, stories: bad, movies: close-rough, music: awesome, sound: terrible, leading: joke. If you would like to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." "Gass-sss" is the full name of this film ... you feel "bursting" after watching this film - or maybe you should be taken to the "gas" room to damage your brain. I have seen the super 8 home movies that put this film to shame. Certainly add new to all my Top Ten WORST films at all times ... it's up ((down, down) and "Restrictions."
