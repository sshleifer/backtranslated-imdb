The most positive thing I can say for this very poor production of "comedy" is that you don't know. In fact it is so amazing that a man is wondering how many of them to write again and a committee that passed through to completely eliminate personality. It is not magic, not entertainment, not wise, and not charming. It's just staid, laughless, the development of the four who should change their way - and their attitude to women - allowed to attend the wedding of their best friend. By doing a job that will be minimal for the act of amateur actors, the plot of the plot might be exhausted except to make the 40th season of 'Allo' Allo look clean, and joke about whether humorous like looking at decay vegetables, Sione wedding however made ten ( yes 10) selection in the NZ film recently awarded. Luckily, someone saw the mind and did not win any.
