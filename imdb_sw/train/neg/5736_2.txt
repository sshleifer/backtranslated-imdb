This is one of the worst films I have seen in years! You can randomly 5 people on the street and they can do better than anyone in this film. Loss of time to watch. I gave just 2 as I like gory movies but this is just a trash. Acting (and I use that word in large quantities) is bad, someone please say that the 5 main actors in this were making their first film? Don't waste your time looking at this. Hostel was the best film in some way. I can't believe that someone has spent the money to do so, I hope for producers at a cost of just $ 50,000 to do - looks like a school project, conducted by children who have no clue. Did this even happen in the movie?
