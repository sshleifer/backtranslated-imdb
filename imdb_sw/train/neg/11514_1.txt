Of course, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie were married, it is because they all thought it would help their film work. If you have been in a bad condition to watch "Removal," then you know it was the same as a spiritual game. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actor (or "octress" if he could call it in "The Next Best Thing"), he still can't pull out for long enough to turn into a performance that anyone with a taste can even call good. And that's the thing that makes people very unpopular on the screen: that gut feels that its ego is so inflated that it prevents him from being able to just allow and connect with his audience. If there is any right in this world, he just struck his last chance.
