Oh, he is a very good actor who was famous in the movie where he plays for the mother. It is shown on BBC 1 out of midnight, I wonder if ... yup it`s TVM <br /> <br /> You should give it to TVM producers, not the content of one short film, usually it gives us two non-standard movies where two themes are confused together and now there is a difference. The first topic is a woman with a risk of a pollin cross and a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce scene which means having a place of heroine living in an experimental trial followed by a place where her son Sam asks why he was divorced? And that TVM she responds that the reason is "Be people change" instead of saying something along the line like "I`ma slapper right" or your father cruise mens public toilets "if it happens in real life divorce cases. little I feel, not just his parents are divorced but he is like two big wooden trees. In fact, because he is stupid he doesn't deserve mercy because he does not know that a man gives birth under a toilet is a drug dealer, he doesn't know that you can die if someone sends you, and he doesn't know that I love LUCY is very bad. If only our own children were innocent children, ah and Orwell said "ignorance is strong." Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life! Is this a development of character or poor scripting? I know what my money is about. And wonder that Sam boy does not know if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes, car cars and train trips from the 1950s? The loss of a plot is a mother who is dummy. Then there is a final plot of moving that has left me feeling like idiot for this look
