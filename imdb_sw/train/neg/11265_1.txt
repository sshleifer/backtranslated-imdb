There has been little time in my life, when I have been worried and sad. In addition to Rancid Aluminum was one of these. The warning signs were there. No premiere (even stars did not want to attend) and no reviews in newspapers. The only reason I lived through the film was the hope that I might sleep. Nothing in the film was explained. That story was idiotic. I was happy at one time when the film leadership seemed to be shot, then to my despair, it was revealed that he had not been shot to my delight. I sincerely hope all people involved in the film are being hacked to this violence. There were good things, especially when you did not make a sense of humor. For example, the area where the main character, for some unknown reasons feels the need to pull out of the toilet container, telling someone in the second village to put his fingers in his ears. My words cannot describe the anger I feel, so I will do it. <br /> <br /> Rumini Aluminum: for concerns, wastrels, and only regressives who want to suffer themselves.
