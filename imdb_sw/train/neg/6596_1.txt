This is a kind of one film in the eyes-jawed, quietly, and still continues to look, mesmerized, like looking at the train look at slow motion. And yet, behind your mind, the mind says: "Who is on the green-green earth?" <br /> <br /> Some of the original user comments say things like, "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an abomination for children everywhere. Children who need a learning program to learn to love the comedy slapstick shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others said about the credibility of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy that I will deal with: why? One can imagine that the movie BOMBS according to the favorite series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, nauseam ad) would teach Hollywood that there are some things that can never be restored. Laurel and Hardy Movies are easily available on video: why is this sad? <br /> <br /> To F. Murray Abraham, a good actor of action and screen ... well, all I can say is, must be in trouble with IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, don't go, away from the television if this garbage comes!
