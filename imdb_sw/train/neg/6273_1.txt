This was a good movie until the end. The latter was only one of the most despicable efforts to encourage men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to the reason and logic and used the aggressive nature to control and put her love for someone who eventually gave her power and control over her relationship. It is not unfortunate that he was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car while driving him at the end after praying and begging him to take it again. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible for all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a contemptible movie for that reason.
