What a bad, horrible film. The worst collection of images I have seen for a long time. It's not that I saw a lot. I left the theater after 40 minutes to find a hard drink to reduce my nerves. Meryl Streep was as bad as usual. Can the words pain and suffering have 1 person? Gifts of Aidan Quinn were - as often - completely lost. And who told Gloria Estefan she could do it? Trying to have the police fix this film still emphasizes racism. (A brave teacher with bold courage teaches children unrestricted violin at a nearby school). The children were not very good! It is written in order to match the script that fears. Aaargh! Wes Craven actually made me cringe at once. This really horror!
