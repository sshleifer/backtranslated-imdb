Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. She has nearly 20 years and what Gene Barry doing all of this movie? No idea, the director probably was his brother! This is a movie that has no meaning. The author / director not aware (dude same) played everyone's talent with his awesome job ... work. I've got a DVD for a penny so he can't complain! But it's weird! And it makes you feel infiltrated and not a good way. This was the 70th and it looked as if the director was on a bad acidity and wanted everyone to know how it was in his head. It has some interesting and controversial concepts, but if the record is played, it comes quickly. It has a "Manson family on acid" with it. Do not know how another auditor did all this from this film? Maybe they worked in it when? At any rate, prepare to lose 80+ minutes of your life you will never be able to return. Yes, that's very bad!
