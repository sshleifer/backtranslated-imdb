It's amazing. That's what you would say if you sat through this film. Just, wonderful, wonderful. In fact it is so incredible that anyone was stupid enough to lose money in making monstrosity that you just can't believe what you see. That, my friends, is a horrible thing about this film. Someone thought it was a good idea to do that. Well, here's another surprising story: A High School student (occasionally appeared as a college figure) has sex with a mother, lives in a trailer park, and is a "artist" who laughs. to "be different." In fact, this poorly laughing boy has finally been killed and, here's the original part, his spirit is scarecrow (under which, he is killed by John's latest slutty mother). Then it goes closer to the death rate than all those who have done it. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is a breakdown: <br /> <br /> Beautiful: <br /> <br /> --Amazingly funny movie ?? even if the producers of the clear drink wanted This and sequel on one disc on the Wal-Mart bin of $ 5.00 so it's just a little reduced. <br /> <br /> Didn't hurt, Is T Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gore is a small type of standard. One person is injured by the sheep. <br /> <br /> - Do you tend to make efforts in music? But it is not recommended well movie? And not all good. <Br /> <br /> Bad: / Is another player allowing female women? none of them take off the clothes. When was that the bottom of the slasher bottom? <br /> <br /> - Myths of concern. The aggressor buries one piece that can make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger broken. <br /> <br /> - The basic festive love story does not go anywhere, and it is not done. <br /> - Were other people killed as if they were chosen random? you don't really know who anyone and then they are killed. And you just think that should be when it comes. Ugly: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - To a large extent the cheapest, just with the scarecrow of killing instead of ?? well, everything else. - There is no closer to interesting like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series? all that is better than this inrocity. The worst talk I ever heard in my life. The script is filled with the level of loss that I never thought could exist. I am bad here is the most complete point of horror. Do not make mistakes, however, is funny as hell? But I have never heard more than aininine flag even in the "Terrorist Party Party III". This film makes "Jason X" looks like Shakespeare. A person who kills a boy who is scarecrow: Wig worse than ever. Similar discussion. <br /> <br /> Uncategorized chapter: <br /> <br /> - Where the primary school children offer out their open discussion: "Hey, let's go look for small animals. Huh." <br /> Acting: Story 3/10 Stories: 3/10 Sky: 2/10 History: 1/10 Characteristics: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Sensitivity / Sexualism: 1/10 (No dirt, Mother is prostitutes, girls do not wear bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, large quantity) Talk: 0/10 (Very evil, clear, high-up and funny pain? Bad is good. My first rating for a conversation in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Trends: 2/10 / / <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: One way for people just like me who enjoy watching fresh trophies. Or the producers of Slasher film. This is not a good movie, even. The conversation of wisdom with the perpetrators puts it as a joke. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
