I would like to start by saying that this doesn't seem or feels like a film. It looks like just another show of TV about popular girls and boys who have no real film on the top return. <br /> <br /> The camera alarm is exactly the same that the story is told the easiest way possible never to make the public connect with it. This movie takes us to where no movie I have seen has been done earlier: for an area where the Theater Theater is in the middle of the heat and gives each public part of the definition. Also obvious. The large screen of the film is used only as a surveillance TV from where we can see all the characteristics of these women in a greater way than life. It appears soon that the small directors prohibit the Art of film. sales. This is very awesome. The industry destroys art in movies. We must learn ourselves and our children about what the cinema and its language are true. Not only sales and entertainment, but the way to communicate feelings, desires and even culture. It's not like a launch platform for young people and young jocks.
