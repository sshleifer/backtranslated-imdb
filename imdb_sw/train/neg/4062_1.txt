Short films have been left with such a sense of decrease, and this is not a thanks. Since I saw it on the playground (How it ended there I can only be surprised) I was under 90 m of hateful trash, derived from feeling, the main feeling that like this other ill-o movie "Do not answer the phone" - but worse. The evil of all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (as opposed to strong things like "the last house on the left") and the most despicable of the victims (perfect) and everyone is involved, leaving the viewer as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like a shower. No credit to the director
