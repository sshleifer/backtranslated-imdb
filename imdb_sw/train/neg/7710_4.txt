"Death Tomato attacks" tend to run away, walking badly for filming. The worthless plan, and the various characters log in and out of the image without any explanation. Watch this silly spoof, you can get more excitement than many other ideas being captured correctly: that is easy to make the cheap film, less quality and then use "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheap price and low quality (in one area, girls swimming are afraid of tomatoes that are around around them; how far can it be "stopped by unbelief" to go-even in the disease?). The title of the head is better, though. (* 1/2)
