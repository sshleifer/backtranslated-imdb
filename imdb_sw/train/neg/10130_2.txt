I have almost every movie of Seagal (yes even those like this is a low budget), and I must say, this may be the worst, not only of its movies, but of all the movies made. The only view of this film, and just because I gave 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has other sweet events, especially in the shop, and also sometimes he will take out the whole army with a knife. Sometimes I will give 90 minutes of Seagal people to kill people, and don't be confused with the story line, because the story is not just stopping, but also the work, the fact that F-18 and F-14 somehow change to F-16s, and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as F-16. Also Stealth did not need to accelerate? And since the time of Afghanistan is considered a hostile area from the point of the Air Force Army. When I finished, we do not have Air Force, we (USA) can control the atmosphere. Also, this secret secret work was played through speakers for all staff in the room, but Admiral still whispering to another person that is confidential. Also, how did Seagal come from under the truck, up to the top? Panda tell us why they caught him, Since the Army Army Warriors where they are the greatest command (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since they are drunk in Arab countries, based on Muslims who do not drink alcohol? Also on this, since the Arabs heard the command from women as required # 2? The film's model was obviously Seagal killing people in the shop, and another 50 people killed them with a knife, with a very short and unusual lesbian area that did not disappear.
