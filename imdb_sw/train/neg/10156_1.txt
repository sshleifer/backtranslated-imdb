Written S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character reduced his boobs. That was very good. Before and after that very good film is easy. Acting is like an E list and is shown well in the film. Not to mention is the lowest budget that Ecclesiastes and Chainsaw Charlie plays with that person. The whole movie looks like a shot with a camcorder instead of a half-way film. The only reason I loved the movie was because Charlie Chainsaw and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that if you see this film in Blockbuster everyone would like to hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be mentally intelligent.
