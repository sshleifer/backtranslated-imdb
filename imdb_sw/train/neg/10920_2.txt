This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't agree with another provider, who said special effects were the same. I have seen them so bad: it was not true and they were very fake that they were just despised by real stories. <br /> <br /> Maybe that trouble is the reason I didn't fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "sets". They are not worried about telling you what was put, or what is so much known about it. That also makes it clear why they wipe out in California, when the movie intro takes place in ancient Egypt. If you are photographing a movie in the wilderness, try to really go to the desert. Origin - the ancient festivals - looks like it was hit inside the studio instead of the desert. The action rate was going on every time of the film, no ups and downs, no peak. It made the film look short, and it is certainly a pro for this special film.
