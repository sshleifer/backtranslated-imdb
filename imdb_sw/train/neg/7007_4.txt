This is a very bad movie. The plot is a sentimental mushroom. I think the production values ​​are the same, beautiful pictures, unobtrusive patterns and all. Mark Hamill was awesome. I have never been very concerned, and this film proves that view. It is not surprising that he never had any kind of work away from his film "Star Wars". I will only tell you, "Gentlemen, Mark" as he sinks into deserved destruction. On the other hand, Annie Potts very little stole the show. She showed beauty, beauty, and doing all the work with one function. I remember seeing him in "Texasville" recently and remember his beauty. Interesting to see him from ten years earlier. Otherwise, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, you are far away from this film crying to the hills.
