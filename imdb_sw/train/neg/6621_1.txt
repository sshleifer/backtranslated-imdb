Something somewhere should be very wrong when the director was seeing this plot. The movie, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the favorite movies in the cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of the film making. The best traders could not also take the contract, which just continued to show that the film itself was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> Editor is bad. Trends climb. Work did not come from the world (omg)! Anime who are supposed to look at the awesome power people laugh on the ignorance of their talk and dress. I couldn't watch the film even if someone paid me a ticket or gave me even a free burger and that.
