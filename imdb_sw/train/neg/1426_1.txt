One question: Why? First of all, the premise is not exciting or active. They are using the interviews, and it takes a voice to play with the animals that talk. First, the interview is not for leisure or entertainment, and even if they were, I am sure it will be a lot of entertainment that looks like before, without turning it into cartoons. Does that add any hilarity to it? I turned on Monday night of CBS, (which has been a common way for me to relax after Monday's work day of suffering) and found this. Of course, the sitcom line would start again, being summer, but seeing these periods again would be more entertaining. I tried to give a "CC" space. I did the truth. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it would be fun. Don't. And then it went on. It was about half an hour. And I can almost see if there is a purpose, if the interview was shown in full, and have points. But no, it was just one part of the line, cut and knit very fast. It was an awesome version of Cartoon Network of "Robot Chicken." I wasn't a fan of the current sitcom to delete CBS "Class." What had been, it was half an hour to the top line I would fight through. But if it happened to me to determine the entire season of these events or three of "Creatures" .... let's just say I would like to take "Class." Considering that you have been a couple of hours since it happened, and I came here to see it I was the first to comment ... I think that's a good sign that no one looked at, and that it didn't want long. The road to the Cartoon Road.
