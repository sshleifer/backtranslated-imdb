I really tried to love this film but eventually did not work for me. I've seen more of Kitamura's output and I've found it very different. He lived, if all his films have an interesting plot, another nifty system with the right amount of creativity. However, these characteristics are located in short shortages in Alive. The plan is cool if not all of the native and who could do with a good film of ace. Unfortunately, the acceleration is slow and the film takes the age to go, before reaching the unpredictable areas. The action is on approval, and the final struggle is very cool, and the original about OK. Soon it is also destroyed by the old overspeedy work, and to do with a little co-operation. There are some interesting interesting effects and other interesting ideas around the discussion, but the film is still a great challenge. The characters are not found well or legitimate and the color scheme settings are both private and private. The movie is not very frightening and has some interest, perhaps the wise use of the fast forward button can strengthen. For twenty minutes taken during this flight can be sci fi thriller very good. But the film's full length is lighter. It was only recommended for fans of patience and patience.
