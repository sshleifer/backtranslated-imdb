I thought the movie was a bad document. Nothing of the substance was discussed. It seemed to be cost-effective and did not give anything new. The film was neither fantastic nor romance or anything that could run one in science. Many scientists seemed "absent" and sometimes weird. The woman said that her rewards don't care about anything, only children helped. He said that after a 10-minute area he described all his awards. Play "humble scientist", do we? "I'm equations playing in my head," another said. I don't see how this describes anything to us. It is not necessary for the great effects of science in our culture. Science politics is not very touched. It is not a bad flick for children aged 10-14. Other than that, I felt it was boring and uncertain. <br /> <br /> 4/10
