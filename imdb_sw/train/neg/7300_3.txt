This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the forest. One of the friends holds the frightening virus. Suddenly, friends turn to a desperate attempt to protect themselves from the disease itself. <br /> <br /> "The fear of Cabin" is a terrible film. For one, it tries to be many times immediately. What? Should be a cult, slasher, black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? No one can tell him. There is a great area at first and second changing, turns funny. When the film tries to be funny, humor is bland completely, excluding the end. I liked the last end. But far from the end, I was desperate and disappointed. Violence is better, it looks far away from screens rather than scared. Tones are changing in each area, sometimes pleasing, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl making karate in motion. What should we get from it? This girl could suffer one of the characters. Was it necessary to be funny? I don't know. Some of the exhibitions were decent, and most were quite amateurish. I don't care for many characters. I liked the plot but the action was done with horror. As a horror film, I did not know what tried to be. I didn't find it funny, time, neither scary. At the end, you are different, you think, "What have I been getting?" Unfortunately, you will not know the answer to that question.
