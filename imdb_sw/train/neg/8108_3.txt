After reading a book, which had a lot of meaning to me, the movie has not given me any feeling that the book was given. This makes me wonder if Kaufman liked this book successfully made it something else. The most important thing is where? From the very first place, music drives more discussion and feeling, and this goes right through the movie. I think the creators thought that by having upbeat music to play through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they failed quite here. Instead the music can give everything that "movie feel", through the fight to put it on them, so that everything emotionally emotionally. Another example of how this situation fails is by strengthening the story line to make it more amazing. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on the way to see Sabina. The introduction of this meeting / space, which certainly did not occur in the book, gives the story of Tomas more important than it does. There are many other examples where the development of the story has been changed, for the worse, however this may have been done because the book doesn't just change the movie, such as the Kundera style. This makes us wonder if all the generous actors on this site were writing with their book and film experience in mind rather than writing about the film. Film which is as long as it cannot. For those who have not read the book I still recommend reading it. For those who, I tell you you will only waste your time and maybe end up here to write the same warnings to stay open.
