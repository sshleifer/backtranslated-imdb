If I did not read 'Union Street' of Pat Barker before seeing this film, I would like to love it. Fortunately this is not the case. In fact it is my kind of film, it is well done, and in any way I want to say otherwise, but as reform, it fails from every angle. It is a hard-to-play novel about the fact of living in the northern part of the British district that stood up and refused to leave for a week after finishing. I was placed in tears, shock, shock, anger, compassion and trouble when reading about the women of Union Street. Better. A book that I have often heard I could not read again, but I did not miss it. It faces yes, but it faces a lot. <br /> <br /> Movies. O dear. Hollywood picked up the reality of the barker and the reality, and expanded the layer of sweet sweet sugar on it. Good movies, exciting sounds, beautiful performances, story of hope and romance ... yes. 'Union Street' ... no. Women's Union Street and their stories are diminished in Fonda's behavior, their stories are touched, but many are lost. I agree that some of the Barker stories are sensitive issues and it is also risky to look at more, and that the film with 7 leading guides is not practical, but the content is not my main issue. The nucleus and the real disease of the novel will disappear - dark and rain, wrapped windows covered with cardboard, and vividly depleted poverty is replaced by the sun, the most beautiful houses, and the stamp of William. > If you have enjoyed the film with its potential and hope in the face of 'reality', I suggest that you do not hesitate to read the book without first preparing for something like 'The Schindler' listâ€¦ but without the end of happiness.
