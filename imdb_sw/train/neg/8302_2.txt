Funny how the studio thinks it can make a sequel to the usual Christmas story and cast a new and anticipated float. Indeed they used various actors for Batman, but in that case Batman was a typical character before any actor who gave his cape. In this case there was a common tendency in the glasses that had been blown by Ralphy that needed red rifle rifle bb for Christmas ... Somehow we should forget and accept another little boy who is not identical to the original. is a sequel I wouldn't have to think from the cast ... except actually Charles Grodin tries hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that your are constantly reminded that previously was better ... <br /> <br /> The end might have worked like they would beat the best film. They should expect to watch or just ignore the original and try not to copy the look and feel. This is just copying cheap. Ralphy did not give up just the pity of the appearance of his character to blow his eyes out or die.
