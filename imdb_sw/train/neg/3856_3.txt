"Something of a young man" tries to capture the feeling of "Something About Mary" or "Meet with Parents" but it comes more as it was outdated to reject the two-room movie. Thanks I used to hire for 5 days because I couldn't sit and watch over 20 minutes at a time. The columns are good and I liked the events where other people are hiding directly from Paul's chaos (player in Save-mart was good) but the script text is quite awesome. Negotiations fall flat more time and only when you think that things will eventually come upon some mandatory-gag track facing because there is no reason. Also how many toilets you need for one movie? Do not get wrong, slapstick humor is good when it is done as efficiently as in other films that I mentioned, but this film loses its logo. It's not bad if I love Julia Stiles (Ten Things I hate About You were good) but even that didn't help me stay on this bad movie. Save your dollars and go to rent "There Is Something About Maria" sometimes more.
