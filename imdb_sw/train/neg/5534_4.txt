I am making my way through the Classics Store 50 Modern Movie Packing and REVOLT OF ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I look at them and my seven-year-old daughter, which makes more of those movies being a laugh of laughter. I was hoping for REVOLT OF ZOMBIES, after looking at White Zombie, which is actually a predecessor of a huge amount of zombies on the cinema (think of Clive Barker's Snake and Rainbow Bow and James Bond's Live and Let The Night of the Dead Dead. However, although the title includes the word "zombies," it is a little more than a love triangle, involving a romantic man Armand Louque, beaten by Claire Duval; who is also taken by colleague Clifford Grayson. What fest-fest, my daughter fell asleep half the way. I had a very difficult time to explain what these people did - partners or axis; but, I think that doesn't matter. I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the features of this movie; but, of course those were his eyes (from White Zombie) as a tool for mind control for zombies.
