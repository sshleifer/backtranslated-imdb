When I read a lot of comments, I heard that they were also burning for this movie. I found that it was completely lost on the original Zatoichi movies and it is going to prove that after a long absence from the screens, it is often better to let things be. I conceded to the image of Star Trek from another consultant who compared the first movie Star Trek in the previous series â€” millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch bland and sterile the original comparison. The plan is an incomprehensible time, very bad (although soon Zatoichi NEW and Beat Takeshi are many bloodier) and it doesn't have a natural heart. I had no feeling of blood all the time, but some can extinguish and (especially sterile epilepsy). In addition, when it is not suitable for Ichi - it looks like a broken and depressed person in this film (a lot, more than usual) - and that's something fans of the series might not want to see. This is a very slow return to Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see all Zatoichi film, this is very avoidable. Check out one of the previous versions or version of ALL-NEW 2003.
