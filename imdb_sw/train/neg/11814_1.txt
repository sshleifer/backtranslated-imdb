Returning to that day, I remember seeing Nintendo Power members of the dumb who had the same artwork as this show ... and then the word came that this show was coming to the television next to me! I was not worried, but I was wise ... I was eager to know how this show manages to absorb. All my friends said that this show had no real meaning and it was silly for people alike and I enjoyed (I am really gay), so I decided to look at the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT HOW TO HELP !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are dumb and I hate how many fanboys drool on Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they did Chef Kalasaki (or any other unusual name) a good man who had a restaurant. Poor move, TV 4Kids! Escargoon is nothing but a lost counselor to King Dedede (who is looking for a lot of time in this show) and I hate the company's face that continues to give Dedede with these bad weapons to destroy Kirby. So I am afraid, I hate this show. I started to hate Kirby even more since it was Nintendo obviously was just hurt to get Kirby some popularity. Kirbyll never hit Mario in the fight for the winter, and Kirby will not be anything but a little bit cream cream puff of gay. NUF SAID !!!
