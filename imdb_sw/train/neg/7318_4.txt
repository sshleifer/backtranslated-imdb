This is a painless, uncomfortable and unnecessary pain in the unlikely relationship between Brooks' psychotic and Harold film editor, his lover of rice. The two have ZERO chemistry together - especially because Harold can't do anything rather than look good at this point of his work; but also because Brooks's behavior is neither good nor impossible. There is a static 15, an exciting moment at the beginning where Brooks, after breaking Harold, is facing his apartment in a state of trouble, caused by the effects - a failure. Enjoying and reflecting the book of Joe Cocker "You are very good", there is only enough information here for the feature film. There is nothing going on on the side of their relationship and giving the appearance that these people are in the real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to shine the light of the hot flame on it and, somehow, to strengthen; but if you do so writing and acting you need to be better than here.
