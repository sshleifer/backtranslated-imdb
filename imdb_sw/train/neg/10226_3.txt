"Don't worry to watch this film" will be the best advice, if you would like Marilyn Monroe in other roles. This was a great desire to focus on casting, not just Marilyn. The story was not anything, of course anything as described in the VHS box, of course. There is just no insistence, the little excitement of value and many dirty ads, many of them trying to show what "Nellie" (Monroe) had been broken. This was not a good role for Monroe, although I didn't need to see this character to know he could act. "Some Like Like Fire" alone was enough evidence for me. But this role did not happen with him and it is not surprising that it was not one of his most popular films. <br /> Also very bad films had the destruction of executives like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr. <br /> <br /> Summary: not entertainment and entertainment is the name of the game.
