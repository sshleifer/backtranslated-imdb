When childhood memories tell you this was a scary movie; it's touch and go if you should do it again. However, I remembered a horrible scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain playing with Jeff Kober. "The first power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. Faced with the clich√©s of copi and very bad script and truck holes can run through (with the "losing" easily unsupported which supports the story run together). Lou Diamond Phillips is a bad ass of the ass who sends bad Kober killers to the gas room just to know that he was a minion of Satan himself and now he has the power of the resurrection as well as the ability to have every weak person coming. Through a very bad psychic combination identified who helps with the case. Ahhh, this is garbage. But enjoy as much, especially if you have memory records. I was scared as a child and a place where a homeless person is still very good. As for any kind of logic here; forget about, almost every situation is thrown down by a good measure and finish the cross between Steven Segal stage and the 70 flick of the demon. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to throw Lou Diamond Phillips here? Without saying he can't convince however, but he tries so much and I have never had a problem with many viewers of people here seem to have. For Tracy Griffith as an intelligent, the least said better. But Kober is good as a killer; always loved the actor. The "first power" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and is required to "change the brain". Beer increases the likelihood of viewing and I will be loaded with sometimes the film spin. All in all; not a good flick but a pleasure of guilt for nostalgic fans who were easy to fear as children. "Look around, buddy boy"!
