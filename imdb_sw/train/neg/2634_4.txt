It is not confused and excited about the most common "Sentinel". Sentinel was the main shadow of the movie to me, not giving a concrete step, several critics promised back. For me it seemed like everyone was opening it, and there just pay for quick money, for this reason it felt so much like it was given for a TV film. Sentinel is a rehash of several excellent films, as "On the Fire Line" this does not have any nature in it, and watching Michael Douglas run around, he felt kinda silly in my opinion. The main problem instead of having an unoriginality, was supposed to be the poorest of the poor. I was often worried when I tried to watch this film, as I watched a lot of time left, more than once. It's not just miscasting with Eva Longoria, who couldn't convince the lick value. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions. Michael Douglas is usually a trusted actor, here it is obvious through the way. He does not influence whether someone is running, or a secret agent. Her chemistry and Bassinger, also was far away. I am a great fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just the same, nothing more than that. He tries to come as a surprise, but he was able to have more bland and anything else, and to be honest, he didn't seem to be interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. He did not influence him in his role, and he was clean candy eye. Kim Basinger is very beautiful as the first woman. She looks out with tears, and her role is cast, more with anything else. Martin Donovan has a great place at the end, but it's not enough for me. <br /> <br /> Below down. Sentinel still, another political excitement, which hit me tears. It is too old, too tired, and most importantly lack of effort is being planted. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
