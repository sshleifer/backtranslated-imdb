I gave a film of loooooooooooong "2" because of the interesting actors and half sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read as a faster reader you can't get through the heads trying to keep up with Spanish speeches! And, what hell continues in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Steps to the end with the eyes of walking and the frequent refusal. Just boring after an hour or more. Some of the most beautiful performances but also some of it you think to think your screwed screens. How this has overcome anything that I will not understand. It is difficult to talk about "ACTING" since leading actors seem to only look and look for each other when they are not involved. Geraldo's behavior is so interesting that it is difficult to believe that anyone could evict him. And what is his mother? I just obviously did not get many times except that there are three people who all seem to have history with each other .... but never had anyone who "EX."
