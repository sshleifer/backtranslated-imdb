I don't know who else thought. The fact that this film was self-indulgent is not appropriate. You can be a great believer if you want ... many of this film is a shadow of mind. I feel that I have been accused of looking at the first 40 minutes. And that alone was not too small. It is not just a bad statement, but a plot has never been closer to development. There are countless holes in the story, until you can't even call it a story again. I have never read that book, so I cannot admit it, but this is the first comment I have written here and the purpose is just to save all the audience out there at half and a half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldn't even finish watching the movie. This takes a cake.
