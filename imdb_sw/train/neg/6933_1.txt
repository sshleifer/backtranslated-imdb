With regard to other Columbo movies, this can only be tested 1 (bad). I do not fully understand other providers who have seen this tragic tragedy of film training. It was in a legally legal way that I kept looking at it - seeing a strange or inaccurate decision that the director could do later. Another counselor suggested that it was only Falk to explain orders because it intervened in his role role. In fact, I think the real reason is with the laborers of the studio, who should be afraid when they saw what they did for their money. It's amazing they did not kill.
