This short film period begins with a young person through the process of trying to get a driver's license. Faced quickly and almost every topic of thinking generated by cars. <br /> <br /> Things like buggies of dune, drag drag, custom color jobs and car displays are discussed. They often try to be proud but instead of the film is lighter, given and sometimes sex. None of the people in the film heard. Instead, everything is done in the notes and sounds. Sorry, but I can't stand it. Nothing to teach or interesting about the "Father, Can I Give It a Car?". It's another piece of filling regardless of taking time on "Wonderful World Of Disney" of TV show. 1/10
