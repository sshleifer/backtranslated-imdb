There are many views on this film, but I have seen them to be misleading. This is a cutting corner, a condition that is used more often when a typical person becomes a partner in crime for someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. The boy meets a girl. The girl has a boy to the gunpoint for something foolish. The boy is interested. <br /> <br /> You know drill: The competitor turns into wild wild, free without social space ... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy 'is he mad or just needs to embrace?' The role of the Food Breakfast Club is just reek as a leading character. And all that remains is the turkey of the movie.
