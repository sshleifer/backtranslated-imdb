That is what I found myself saying often in the third wonderful excuse of this excuse. First off, computer effects are quite intelligent-blowing! They 'computer ministries' deserve very much pat back. Some of the films, though ... \ t A lot of laughter in the film comes without pretense, as they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible person doesn't work. Please, give the audience more credit than that !!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if it wasn't found? No one can find you! These issues were dealt with most in the classic Invisible Man from 1933. There is one area of ​​particular violence that is incredibly ambiguous, and not mentioned immediately later. If more attention was paid, Kevin's mad scientist could have more meaning. <br /> <br /> The movies would be more successful as porno, as the premise can actually be made in a unique and interesting way. But this piece of work ... go see something else. Or do not live with the results! <br /> <br /> 3/10
