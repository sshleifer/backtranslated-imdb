W. Somerset Maugham's Human Bondage should be English language. If so, a lot should be lost in the film version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) is fascinated by Mildred (Bette Davis) is a trivial matter to make the situation seem like a decline after a cessation of a relationship from a person's perspective. Being a family lawyer I have heard many accounts; the man is self-righteous and always right, and the woman is a helmet who had no other purpose than to use someone. <br /> Of course, unless someone wants to laugh at the social thought of the creator of the film, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even engages with Mildred when he gives an endless child, but the truth of the truth comes when Phillip allows Mildred - the anger and now of a bad hygiene - a free run of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was fascinating for five years of his life, but that period did not happen here. In fact, at the end of the film he looked very much like the behavior of Baby Jane could play thirty years later. I witness how Howard's behavior is wearing and displayed. It tells me that Phillip wants to respect middle class. Such a person could not run away from a woman with Cockney acceleration. Phillip is for many films, student; such a person would have been more credible if he was younger, and had an outward appearance that reduces low income and appreciation which is often accompanied by English student - Raskolnikov, as it would be. And that ratio to allow Mildred a modicum of charm.
