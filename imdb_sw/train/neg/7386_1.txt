I tried to re-create the film twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. What? Steven Seagal's voice changed? What? He died during the film and the studio should hear the voice and someone who even resembles him? Or was it a sound on a damaged DVD? After 10 minutes, finally hear the real voice of the actress. Although in many films, it looks like the radio was modified in the bathroom. I would like to embarrass you to share a copy of this movie with the Good News, if I had a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will look at this database before renting some of its movies, all of which were movies (more or less). You knew what you were getting when you watched the movie Steven Seagal. I think that no longer exists.
