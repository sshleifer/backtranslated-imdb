In addition to the Christmas break, a group of university friends sit back to help prepare the storm to burst and be replaced by apartment buildings. To make the task more complicated, murder, hate-wearing psychological is to walk the dorm hall, spread to the group in various ways of violence. It has been registered as one of the 74 'video listings listed by the UK in the 1980s, the Blood Dorm had a good reputation built for it before the first look. The word 'bad video' sounds some pictures of a great year, a minister, sex, etc.. So, after hearing all these details, I have put in the intervals (alt. Title) to expect a good slasher experience. . . and so he tried to be, but was completely defeated. Look, the film is not good. Style, year (except for two events), and general trends fail. It's just not good to enjoy. Unusual Script does not exist and often gives us unwanted items without any real reason (like opening open). There are some cool death scenes, including pretty beautiful melt face (which can be seen on the poster), but that's on positive. Acting is very bad, the story seems useless, the killer is not cold or scary, and faces one big mistake that any flick of the slasher should avoid every time: it's a bit boring. In general, for films made by a few students of UCLA film for $ 90,000 (which will be more than twice today), Blood Dorm is not a general aggression. It has good things, and it looks right. . . But, as a flick slasher look to be on the film level as House on Sorority Row and pieces. . . cannot compare only. Don't expect too much, and you might be recommended. I hate to say that, but this is one of the few movies I have seen that would be better and remake. . . and yet, it goes after a great job like Christmas Black. Oh well. . <br /> <br /> Elements of the Error Error: <br /> <br /> - Spell: Good / Italic / Violence / Gore: There are some brutal cold kill, and the for the most part. . . but nothing special. They also examined some of the best killings. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Gossip: There is very little (to me) deception, but not much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Nah. Monologue (s) of the murderer made him a good column. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A jump scare or two, but nothing to be effective. <br /> <br /> - Secret: I think, yes, but I was not worried, and it was clear as a nose on the face of the killer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> W / Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
