The movie started well. It was with his colleagues to get hit by a green meteorite, gaining strong strength (telekinesis, x-ray vision, destruction, run, ability to talk to the dog, superspeed, the vision of the vision, and the ability to make plants grow bigger and faster), and fighting crime. From there there is a descent. Meteor Man gets clothing from his mother, the struggle with the population, and he has to meet many group leaders who serve to give you the desire to despair, and stop the abolition. It can't be too bad if it wasn't like watching a box of boxes where two fighters pretend to fight when viewers are standing watching when the fighters just keep playing. <br /> <br /> With all this non-meaning movie has good points. It clearly states that if you try to take a group alone then they will return to your home and hurt you. It says that groups and communities need to see their real enemies (big bosses who use them for their own purpose to break the faithful people into the existence of ghetto). It also says that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community to destroy harmful animals. The only message that is not sure is that voters should ensure that their elected officers (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush) also do not know. <br /> <br />
