Once, this film was ridiculous. Not that it had no redemption features? For example, the best thing about this film was good natural environment. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know the South does not have the beautiful mountains like the West. I knew it was absolutely Utah on the bat, but maybe Dalton could not overcome its English emphasis, so they had to forgive them for saying this was the southern city. Reducing his inspiration in one South was easy. Certainly the film has a problem of conspiracy, but its sense of place was something I couldn't pass. Not as Utah does not have a laboratory ... Why the authors thought it was important to pretend to be South is more than me. Anything else in the picture pictures always bothers you. Why always makes "sound" of sound effects when the character draws a straight handgun? It seemed that every sound effect in this film was "chuk-chic" indicating 9mm was caused and is ready. Of course, weapons already had all the sides that were not needed. <br /> <br /> At the end, the pyrotechnics were the way up. But hey, this film was aimed at a 'certain part of the market' I think ... It's very serious. Each of the participants can act, but this film was limping.
