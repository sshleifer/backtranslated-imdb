The sixteenth birthday of Melissa is around the corner and she only learns sex and boys. But it turns out that all the people who spend time with the wind are all killed in this 80-bit slasher film. It is for the city of Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, Wild Bunch) and its lovely-beautiful daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th), to reach the bottom of these killings. This film focuses more on the secrets and melodrama elements of the movie and under the killing itself and so can isolate itself from many '80's Slasher brothers. It does not hurt that Alesia has a good body (I feel the need to emphasize clearly by saying that modern actor is over 18 years and so submitting that I am not overly misleading). On the other hand, the movie is subject to a few strikes that are not constructed and unwanted, grating landscapes which are used very often, and the end that is tad to combat weather. But goodness becomes worse (of course). Give this tax, but I do not want to buy.
