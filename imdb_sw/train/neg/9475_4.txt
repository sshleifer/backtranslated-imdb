Beauty and photography for beauty, in general, but writing is very slipshod. There are no instances of such a lack of joy in looking. The fact that this little girl has a twin brother, for example, has learned that I cried loudly. And the "light-light pipe connection" seems to be very bad, too. <br /> <br /> I don't know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like having fun with a nice looking and few privacy screens, this is a very good movie. No great effort for the part of the viewer is required. But the Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is very common, better than this.
