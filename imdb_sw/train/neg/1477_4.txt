I found Dolemite and also (Avenging) The Godfather Disfather, another two good work of canon transport from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, the Human Tornado (ie Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. With great fear, the lack of knowledge in the production of film, and the full passion (in fact very little), Human Tornado cannot pass. <br /> <br /> The opening section sets the tone. Our old Pal Dolemite deals with a white woman, while some tribal militants flee to the house without good reason, and you can't know! The woman who slept in Dole's bed is more than a sheriff wife. Right to him when he sees him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite cry: "& $ * @ $ is really ???" The lie had no great assurance. <br /> <br /> Important things? The comeo and the youngest Ernie Hudson (the name of Ghostbusters), the persistent mistake (the characters watch one way in one shot, and another in the next, the Dolemite suit takes the color in every single shot of his nightclub), and the denomination the Queen Bee eyes in her first place. But the real pleasure here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. What? Does that person think he was cool in this film? I certainly do not know why, but you should be interested in the great interest he has. If it is a completely fly out of the cliff, or ordered orders to his group in the rhyme (for example: quickly! In the cave! I plan to allow that mother $ * @ (% & dig his own grave!) Man does quite a thing The higher, however more than at any time he does kung fu. The very fierce battles are hit faster, but the occassionaly slows down to allow Rudy to pose and blow his teeth. In any case, "Matrix" is not. .. Not only very much. Enjoy with my heart recommendations.
