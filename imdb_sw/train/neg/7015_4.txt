"54" is a film derived from the "54-studio" studio with a beauty of the 1970s - hangout for the clubbers of social elite and party. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, according to a real Studio staff from 1977 - 1982. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The problem of the film is that all are glitter and style with no substance. It tries to be very bad and solve satire as "Boogie Nights" but it finally comes as inferior wannabe. Mike Myers has been given an unappreciative job to play cocaine-snorting owner Steve Rubell. It is only a small role of humor and if this was the best efforts of Myers in running a sporting game like Lemmon and other comedic actors did when they were, it's a total failure. "54" can be both interesting and interesting but instead is another young boy who is not entertaining or even involved. Look for your own risk.
