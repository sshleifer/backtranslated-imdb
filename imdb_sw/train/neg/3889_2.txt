I've been wanting to see this because I love horrible movies and such a title, I was sure "Good Man of Smoking" would be very happy. It was not true. I mean, acting was interesting, the script contained the rough lines of classic and special effects were seen as if someone had raised all the leading actor, so I had to love. Unfortunately it's really draggy among these important things. I decided to look at the last half of the movie when I returned my tax. That's how this film throws. However, if you like bad movies you will enjoy the wonderful of the Milk Nurse, and the stellar executive of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to a poor person, he needs to give an amazing and mysterious face to the face - as the conversation he has with his wife on track under IM Man: <br /> <br /> " geiger. "" Is he a radiation? " "Just a little bit." Yes, the plot has Dr Ted walking on trying to get a superstrong zombie killing machine only weapons and what looks like Mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his program fails when it gets a lot of goop on the tree. "Oh god - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I am very happy to clean it. I know that I am making this voice of sound rather than fun. It would have been just 10 minutes long, but unfortunately continues to continue, and the wonderful Melting Dude is just amazing about making a proper mess when he should eat more people in my opinion. I think if you had been stoned you would like to love it, you have no pop-tarts during the film, because the leading actor really looks like close to the end.
