The abuse of ET and Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention he will have the most likely to grow psychotic, sad or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how she desired privacy. Now the little rich girl Ashley Olson wants just left alone. Not surprising Greta Garbo joined and said "I want to be alone". How much ET and make this little girl? What? And is it not the best thing to report? I bet there are many people who don't really care what color the birthday cake and ballo were. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nichole won any of those court cases on her love and inheritance. Who pays for the life of Larry, Howard and Dannielynn little? Could it be ET?
