I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than a piece of meaningless (you believe me, two numbers are needed here - it's bad). This film was in trouble from the opening key when it was revealed that the screen writer was the same person as the songwriter. All music numbers are too many and none of them (“Thank you very much” has good songs, but lyrics are more stupid than words). I would like to carry the screens wrapped by Scrooge in an incredible sequence of hell than to sit on these insults to the music of the film again. The only part of this movie (completely without a dedicated way) involves Alec Guinness like Jacob Marley. Wearing white white powder, Guinness offers money through its events in what was an attempt to make it seem like he was circling as a spirit, or showing his great contempt and being in this bad film. Albert Finney, at the same time, combines the best of Alistar Sim with Charles Laughton in order to create his unselfish character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Scnooge's Finney is a very hiding man, it is impossible to believe his change. Request the films of these films at all costs.
