OH MY EXTREMELY THROUGH THE HOUSE OF NIONA - this is a great idea that came into my mind after watching the movie. And I don't know anyone with the opposite story. Although, perhaps the idea was good but the sad result. I especially meant the role of H. Graham. What was it? In my opinion it has destroyed the good intentions of producers. Characteristics were played in an affected and stimulating way. Every time he appears he reminds them that you are watching a movie and destroys the spirit of the time, then the whole movie because you can often see there is a stupid face and a more stupid effort to create a sense. DON'T, don't waste your time.
