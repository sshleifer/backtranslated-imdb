Saddles severe! It is a struggle between two brothers who are far away (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of them can burn a fire in mind; they square on the diversity of childhood, and Dippy love interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (television player behind "The Sunset") stimulates the dark-textured comedy on Vince Gilligan's screen and so much presentation, the movie resembles the entry of a passionate film student on ten million and five. It has great power of the main business feature, but the non-copper style that does not bring anything from the characters except their kooky violation. These are not the characters, they are the work of the conspiracy. It is often presented in the movie, the film is a tragedy, though in full as an example of fashion on this substance it looks good. Winger is standing alone in the cast which seems to be confused. * 1/2 from ****
