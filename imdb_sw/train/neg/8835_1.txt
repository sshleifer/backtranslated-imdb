Before watching this film I read the review here and say that this film can be one of the best films! ha ha Scene and the tension situation grows well ... from angry characters in this film. From the little girl talking about the gibberish and trying to sell the little boy, the killer runs without a note (and who was on the beach talking to a young boy!) .. things just seem to happen and then go not answered in this film. As I looked it looked like the film was going to one direction, then it was not going anywhere, but in a new direction ... and going on ... <br /> <br /> Acting is good, but the text is awesome. Each character, in every area, says or does something that is not possible, the realities and the results of colleagues / surpluses are amazing. There are no resolutions of the problems made in all the films, making them mix and eventually waste time.
