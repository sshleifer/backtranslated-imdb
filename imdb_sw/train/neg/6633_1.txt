Where to start? Is it better to explain how this film was bad? <br /> Let's start with the humor of the camp. It's not very funny. Add a group of music actors - Food Food is awesome and Deborah Harry is worse. Poor poor Art Carney, who would have to know more than to make this film. <br /> <br /> Then there is a plot. Raadi whose goal of life is the work of the Alice Cooper show meets the girl whose goal of life is to be groupie to Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> There are some executives who let you know that this will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and has a greater responsibility. That is a sure sign that the film will probably not be very good. If nothing else, movies live up to low expectations - even worse than the poorest. Just say this. This is a movie that all bad movies are comparing. And no worse than the Roadie.
