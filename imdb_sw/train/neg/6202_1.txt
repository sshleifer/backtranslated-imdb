I watched all the movies through the end of the embarrassment though I felt angry with what I saw. I felt that the director was crying with caution and the only way he could achieve this was to ignore it as possible. Since I have lived in the UK I have come to love this country but this film shows young Britain in the worst way of thinking. Nothing says but avoid, it will make you angry and sick. People involved should be ashamed.
