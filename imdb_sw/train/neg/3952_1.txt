The return of Boogyman is a horrible movie that does not act as a film, drives it as part of the TV sitcom when they are photographing in old sessions. Return to Boogyman is just a show show. <br /> <br /> The film mix is ​​regular and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Regular artwork. It's very interesting. <br /> <br /> Movie is about a woman of mind who has a vision of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I found the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes as often again and I don't know who it is. The whole movie looks like it was done quickly to make a few bucks with it.
