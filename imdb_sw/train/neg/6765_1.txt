* Activists * Some people argue that natural killers are a deadly barrier to media and violence. But this conflict ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could show his ordinary poets as a bad killer, innocent of innocent people and they succeeded this with the media fascination. Instead he gives them precision. The movie shows about every victim as a person who deserved to hurt. Engaging in brutal fraud, Stone gives victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb damage, migrants of English speaking, lazy people. One person with a love of homicidal love is also an example. Of course they are old friends, Hallucinogen-using US-Hindi - because they are trendy, dude? Let's be a good character. Oil, Chinese clerks and "sanctions" are grass, then let's seem to be worthy to die. Instead of misleading, hate that has been damaged by their mistakes, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are getting cool and cool and surreal pictures that should convince the most interesting people. Justice is despised. Police and prison officials are shown to be cruel, evil and fighting and compared to GQ killers. Again, this is not the news of the media inside the film but in the "truth" in the film. No printing or trick in the film - just displays and more advanced images. The film does not say anything new or special about strife and violence. The proof that the film fails in its message is in reality the real world. Some of the emotional young people who saw this movie showed it as an incentive to kill them. The "message" of the film is a failure because it motivates people in different ways and the negative consequences of real life. A clever message cannot be seen.
