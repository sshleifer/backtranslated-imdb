Before this film, I had just examined two films and director Andrea Bianchi: zombie trashy flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), popular among fans of fear for its unforgettable performance from baby-baby Peter Bark, and the joy of sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Neither the film was a fascinating piece of movies, but both were enjoying their special way (and the fact that they showed a lot of cloud and dirt did not hurt). Killing, however, is small, unintelligible, irrelevant, despite the slightest splatter and abnormal spot of the improper body. <br /> <br /> Stories, about a series of killings at a hotel where employees and employees of the horrible films living during their shot, are combining with oh-so boring: when blood is unavailable and the skin is not on the show, the film is a struggle the actual staying through (took me two experimental experiments), and the endless incidents of identical and emerging characters among themselves and very little. Only one interesting way about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several scenes of death by dialing out his movie mega-gory Cat In The Brain (AKA's Nightmare Concert). And if you have already seen the film, then there is a very small reason for disturbing and killing.
