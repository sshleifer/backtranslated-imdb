This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was a kind of remake but then again, it's not true. I was amazed at the tools that Tim Burton could. He had great success with CGI available with a lot of money ($ 100,000,000) but could you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film made for less than $ 6 million? Heck no. Therefore, the film fails. At least in the original film, the image of the autonomous scene was amazing but nothing was amazing in this film even the last location because you would like to see it coming. And, by the way, if you give some ideas, and I do, you can know how the end can come. I just want to get back when I lost thinking about it. This video would be a great and fun film if it was on the first film lines and the "Received Planet" section. Here's what I wrote: <br /> <br /> Astronaut (it must be more than Mark Marky because he is not a good independent film alone so I would put them in three people) that would be about what they would think would be another planet, meet and human beings (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, was protected, made friends with other good monkeys, discovering that they are in the world by searching for ruined ruins, ending the refugees of walking people living under the earth; , and then .... well, then your mind grows wild as you die. But my point is that there may be much more on this film. Sadly, Tim Burton knows how to destroy the good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is the richest director to encourage what people think. He is a direction so he must be good to think. Sorry, but no. If someone else had made this film, it would have been well and would have been more satisfying.
