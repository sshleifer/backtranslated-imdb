Nothing laughing. Yes, I looked at any of the trains of the train but only that I could not later ask whether Cleese came to mind in the last part. (No, he did not.) This may be a historical fascination for you young people out, seeing that the "humor" of the UK included "joke" of darkness like these, thirty years ago. What is even more amazing, is to read the comments of other consultants, who confess this is not very good, but then walk and give high votes. If most of the games that you have seen are worse than this, then I am truly sorry for your wickedness. The level of humor of this show appears to target young children, but the issue does not matter. So who is this? People who enjoy twice and supplemented double-takes, eliminates, jokes of the drug (just like a short trip back to '77), and another humor "down". The three stooges are still funny, and they were to me as a child, too. WHEN they made some effort in making jokes. This however has been beaten away from the schlock. I am afraid that it is the end of civilization, if these things are accepted as valuable. Then you will be telling me that tabloid TV is known. :(
