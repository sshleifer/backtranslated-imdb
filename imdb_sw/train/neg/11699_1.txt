The Thinner Plan is decidedly thin. And total. The entire lawyer runs on the lady of the gypsy, and the curse of the gypsy causes loss and weight loss ... for bone. Well, the Gypsy curses should be entertaining, but the weight loss weight has passed? Don't. Unless Stephen King thinks so. With Michael McDowell, another scared writer and filmmaker of this film, he does too. The lawyer is not just a criminal liar, he is also fat, haha! The pastor is like a piece of skin to someone who says how he / she has never seen anything more disgusting than oil. Hey, I can only say: Try the mirror.
