I have given 3 stars out of 10 possible - because the stories are exhausted and not explained, and because of the inconvenience of the person eating it in a very unpleasant manner, as well as decaying dead bodies. None of the above needs to be displayed in such a clear manner. The film program, such as, involves three incompatible connecting stories, not one that concludes with the satisfaction of Hunter's bounty, played by Bruce Dern, is a character that combines all three vignettes. We have Dylan McDermott, looking at a fine darn, as a criminal wanted who is running to Mexico to avoid all the rules and bounty hunters, while passing through the border city with the adventures of a sad girl's mourner played by Helen Hunt . So we have one of the Hemingway girls, who is, who is the western woman outside the arrangement of the one who goes to see about a neighbor, a spectacular appearance, whom we know you have been on very small islands. The conclusion of the film comes back to the bounty of the bounty and what happens to him, and the final location in the film will be more than a wise understanding.
