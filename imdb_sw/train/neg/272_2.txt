When I was young I enjoyed watching bad television. We have been convicted at one time or another, but my apology to look for things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was sandy and stupid; they don't know what makes that show very appropriate. Thank you, I am now enjoying good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. A 12-year-old child would like everything to hackneyed, every line of discussion planned, everything of the required technobabble. Writing is more than a fraud; so bland and incompetent job causes someone to lose a Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me a long time to show Trek bad ever, you're in trouble. Stargate films are a good pleasure of guilt, established by two strong performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, who had a wonderful Egyptian architecture and culture, amazing music, and good sciences fi. Less than the original music, there was nothing that made the fun of the film visible in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver look at the legendary Legend, looks like he half of sleep episodes. <br /> <br /> Budget should be too low because sets sometimes seem like less than a person. Style is not much better, like vanilla and lighter like scripts. It is interesting that it shows in a more fashionable way (like Farscape) and objects (such as Battlestar Galactica) have less smaller than this paper. Not suitable.
