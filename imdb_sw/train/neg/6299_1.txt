This inapt adaptation of one of the weak novels Martin Amis fails to even draw a comparison with other work of medicine as Requiem For A Dream or anything written by Irvine Walsh as it is difficult to determine whether it is a stick-stick cartoon or a hyper-true reminder. Guided by William Marsh in over-saturated hues, a public drop-out group joins in a home waiting for the appearance of three American friends for the weekend of taking drugs. And that's it. Except for a small plot of a conspiracy-of-conspiracy plot on a cult group that deals with the violence of the world's academic figures, whether it is politically motivated or beaten. At the beginning of the first you know exactly where this goes. What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany doing in this fatigue, badly written? He did before the popularity of popularity and Jennifer Connelly could be assured that he had been given this garbage now he would have a change agent immediately! Avoid.
