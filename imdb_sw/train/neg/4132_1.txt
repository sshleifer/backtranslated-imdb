The feature of the early 21st century movie lets the hole beings different evil and wrong against each other. We didn't see things like this since Godzilla v King Kong and so on. It always looks good on the paper when you look and in the haze of good things you have a guided vision and you see the whole play before you love Beethoven. Then you come to write. The main ideas like all vacuum are women. Ergo is a fire, causes death but in the way I want to lose the way. And all Zombi are men. well what are men like the woman after she is cast or deceived by justice? So it all looks good to make it. Then evil begins to enter. Many have fought. Nothing happens. Another war. Sewing fabrics and cods wallop. Eureka have seen how to win. The great war again with the End. Big voice is not? If it was made an indie company would be good. But this is Hollywood and eye on bucks: gloss instead of what fans want. It would all be a good covered cloud.
