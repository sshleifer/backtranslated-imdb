Boiler - boiler if ever I see one. Exciting lease from "Time to Kill", "Sheep of the Sheep", even interrupted "At Night of the Night" for a small backward murder, the "Guests on the Train" are thrown in, failing easily where all of the above, for large scale, succeeded. That way, in giving happiness. The layout appears to be removed from a big book, and the development of the plot is obvious and unknown, while the direction can not accelerate and conscience. In order to return to any dense, great loss should be given along the road and here it also fails. Connery is very understandable in her old age, of course disturbing her attempt in the US emphasis and instead seems to be too old to be Lange's husband and father of the people - her children. He even has a father-in-law who is younger than he is. Laurence Fishburne gets a chance to stay in her role and you are confused from the beginning if she is a bad person or a good person. One person once said that the flashbacks should not lie - they do, for confusion, here. The rest of the play is just a lot of good casting in their written tasks. The period also considered is also managed, by eliminating the solid foundation back, not as it was the goal, in front of my seat. Inherent films of Hollywood film film for sure.
