To be honest, this film is another in a series of great desires ... many of these so-called "masters of fear" film are just awesome for the question of their low impact and lines of laughable stories ... away from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film can not do to save their lives ... These weapons were seen as a man who calls Bop-bottom of a boom or something, and it seems quite unreal ... in general, this film is like scary like Home Themselves ... just good masters are Burns of Fire, Jennifer, and maybe Pelusi ... I don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have destroyed a very genre that some of them used to understand.
