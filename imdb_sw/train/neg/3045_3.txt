Believe it or not, I have a copy of this DVD of this "movie" which I bought for Walgreens for a bigger dollar. I still do not know whether it was a dollar or a dollar that was lost. <br /> <br /> Wonderful layout designs and clothing. Apparently many ideas and efforts came into their decisions. Setting settings are very Mexican in delicate. I loved them very much. And Santa is awesome. One of the most surprising Santas in freedom. <br /> <br /> I think the original purpose and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and good for the audience of children. But, somehow, it comes all over. In fact, I am amazed at how well it is understood. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a dubbing of English that makes it look so amazing and amazing. One of the reasons I would like to see movies in the original language that was made by the use of English headlines as a frequent blowing often provides unexpected ignorance. The words of the children were at least the actual voice of the opposite of the women who pretend to be children who tend to hear too much, worried. Do you know that demons in Hell spend their playing time around making ballet in their long term? You are not? Then I even watched this film. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> What! This movie should look? Now, that's tossup. I cannot have a good conscience for anyone as it touches its wonderful way. However, his voluntary understanding is what makes it worth looking at. You decide what you will do. I'm ... for myself, has made me feel uncomfortable to see the evil spirits always do the voting action of guns. Now, that's just right ...
