A group of women who can not sit around, talk, smoke alcohol. They have another woman in a wheelchair hiding because she has been damaged, and often kills one person to feed this human flesh which looks like a ham wrapped in a store that they are wearing to the tiny fingers of plastic. We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered with a sheet of water. I can't eat Spam fabric for paper again because of this. Just think of a spam cover and paper is enough to persuade the same safe narcoleptic brought to try to try through all this movie. Occasionally there are scenes incorporated by a guy who is "hunting" through a man holding a seat tied to his floor. Why he took this person and how he was connected with the Sisters-On-The-Couch Sisters. There are also instances of some "human being" going out. He p *** es blood and punch through the wall, but who or what is wrong and he is not told nor even bound in the story. <br /> <br /> No action, no special effects, no stories. If you want to look at other people who are engaged in a great way to talk about anything while sitting around and eating meat and cigarettes, then here is 90 minutes of that, because, except for the area where one shark looks at the corner of the road and closed random scenes, nothing really happens. (YAWN) Oh, almost I forgot, you see them transporting other things, including a damaged sister, when they move into their new home. It is a few times they are not sitting in bed or sleeping in bed.
