This reminds me when I was a born-again believer who would be a minister. I never thought I would be a minister or a high school graduate because I had been positive when I was brought to heaven before that would happen. That was before I realized that Christianity was a group fabric. I am now God, and that proves that "once saved always saved" a doctor that Christians tell us is not more true than elves. If so, why did I leave after many years of being born again? Yes, I am saved. I prayed the prayer of the sinless and all my heart. As Christians had to read their Bible they will see that their god thinks as rape, genocide, abortion, and many other murders are the same as him. They may be surprised to know that there is no word that is "raptured".
