Ah WINTER KILLS, according to the novel and Richard Condon which deals with the plot killed the US president 20 years ago. I knew Condon also wrote the MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with such a theme and was hoping to see the mind of the mind. It's not exciting - It's a piece of improper skin, maybe the worst movies I have seen this month and the boy I have seen many bad movies in June. The problem lies in both direction and script and see if William Richert is responsible for all then he should be blamed for this unwanted farce <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this movie. First is the way that everything is presented in the highest way. It's not like OTT as saying something like that of James Bond's movie by David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has a sharp edge of the business with all the active performers their performances. This can be fair if there was a leisure value for the movie but no. If satire is very silly, so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable. Second events appear to be so cut off that they are offered without meaning. Take a typical example where the hero faces a militant leader named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds to start then he is reduced to the hero at the flight. Events start and end without rhyme or reason <br /> <br /> a suitable movie that is a problem of staying through
