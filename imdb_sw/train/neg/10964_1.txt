I was not happy to see this on the Sidewalk Film Festival. Control was generally disappointed with this movie was the last nail in the coffin. Being a faithful fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books I was very excited about this film premier, which made it so that it was not too much to see. I am always passionate about modern instructions if they are handled properly. Usually it is interesting to see the balance between the old and now in a common story. Unfortunately this movie was under modern sophisticated beat and more misleading pop culture. The practice of natural characters seemed to be young and usually seemed to be very angry. Probably not helped the participants were not very good either. Many exhibitions were on top, which I think is due to bad patterns or efforts to make a bad script. I did not laugh once through the film period. All jokes were brief moments of non-current events that are sure to lose their confidence when it goes. In fact, the special event of the film was the opening of the opening where the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice, but yet the mark was a strong match for Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would like to say that the conversion of the croquet game on the dance dance was very bad. It was undoubtedly a low course of film. <br /> <br /> What is joke. Don't see this film. After his conclusion I was really angry.
