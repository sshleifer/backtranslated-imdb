I read the comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever. Maybe if only the Chinese movies you see has no conversation, long drawn out stares away from silence, and hack editing, then you're spot on. <br /> <br /> Hard story line? Not possible. Try babies and amateurish. A lot of feeling and haunting memory? Not possible. Try flat-out boring and trite. <br /> <br /> This was awesome. I couldn't wait to be finished. Especially when the best lines in the movie include "Your News? I am well. Are you sure? Yes." Wow! What is the depth of character. I think incessant smoking cigarettes should say for them. <br /> <br /> As a great fan of China, Japanese and Korean film, I was quite disappointed in this. Even Zhang's sentimentally sappy "Road Home" better than this.
