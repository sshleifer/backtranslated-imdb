"True" stories of three girls who go to the wild of Connecticut and end up with a maniac in the forest. This is a kind of film that would have played in a car drive in America thirty years ago to agree. Not exactly any film that works with its low budget for mixed results. The film looks but not quite good (blame how some of the events of the attack). It's a kind of film that you might have forgotten about once you've done it. The bad behavior is that you will not be able to think of this unless someone is given to you and tell him, "here's this", which is what happened to me. If you have been given a copy of the return, the film is not recommended for the best to see even if it appears.
