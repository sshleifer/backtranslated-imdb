This movie is bad. At the end you will see that several hours have been stolen from your life that you cannot return. The end of "moving" is very available. The development of behavior that extends to this end is not related to their final actions to the conclusion. Nineteen minutes of preparation - by confirming that L Lowe's character will die on Christmas day - is expressed in the ninety seconds of "No We've deceived you." Then the character of Rob Lowe should not even be about that! "I will forgive you if you forgive me," is angry if he gets. If someone took a week to convince me I was about to die and then said "No, sorry, just cheat" I would add a big hell. I don't feel about giving a spoiler because I will save some of you out from watching. Please save and keep this MOVIE.
