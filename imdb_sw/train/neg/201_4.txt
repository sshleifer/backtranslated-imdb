Iberia is good to see on TV. But why do you see this in the money screen? Many of the dance and music. If you would like classical music or modern dance this could be your movie date. But otherwise one and a half hours is just a long time. If you would like to see a play for skill in the financial screens it is best to see the sound movies. They know how to combine breath to play for a long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to play the play from past experience. And it often looks very good. but when the movie is one and the hour should be at least often interesting. There are many types of art not everything big then life and this film is not very big.
