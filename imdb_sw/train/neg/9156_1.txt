Ben & Arthur PENDA have 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, led, looked, and produced this film. Sam should give his opinion to a good author, director, and left acting for someone who could act. this is a good example of one person managing all production. there was anyone who told him, "Sam is bad, very bad". Jamie Brett The work of Gabel was just a good step, but she could be very good with a good director, and better actors working with. This movie is very bad I think Sam Mraovich should be bound a seat and made a look at this film (twice). acting and leadership was bad, this film turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in bad places. <br /> <br /> Second good number .... this could make a big movie movie. after the first two minutes you will stop watching the film and pay more attention to your date!
