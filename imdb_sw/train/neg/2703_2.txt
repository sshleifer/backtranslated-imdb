Few Few! I sat at the end and watched this film, especially because I enjoyed it and tested some of the original Singleton work as "Boyz n hood". However, I feel that this was a great ambition and everything I hate about settings, clich√©d, called "messages". Acting is especially poor, (pop stars and models should not have good actors ... take care of them), the situation is hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes supporters of the night? please!), but bad more reinforces every thought that you can think of. For the second half of the film has been a cartoon as in its reputation, making you lose any shred of understanding that can be for one dimensional players. Not once is a legitimate point to be made about the causes of racism and culture, gender and political sexuality. The result is only ends up destroying the effects of these problems. The message is the opposite, causing a sense of chaos and general lack of cooperation. As for the conclusion of the film I realized it was predictable, embarrassing, using and offensive. For the film "On Learning" I must say everything I learned is to avoid seeing this again. If you want a realistic view of the themes in which this film fails to describe it then go to rent a "American History of X" .... unless you just look at Tyra Bank then go to hire life.
