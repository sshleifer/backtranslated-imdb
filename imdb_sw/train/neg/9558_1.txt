I thought this was kind of some sort, and it meant to be original since 1983. But the sequel is not worth the original plot and destroy it. I had very little expectations for this movie, but I've lost just 95 minutes of life. There is no charge - actually insane feeling, bad acting, and so I have a technical error, so I like a computer geek couldn't believe it. They have tried to make it a mix between the generic battle of the movie and 24 hours. But this is not recommended even a small movie TV budget. Do not see this film, this is a complete waste of time. Instead of getting nature. Theme still valid. Do not let much power on the machine. And acting with the plot is too far to lobby.
