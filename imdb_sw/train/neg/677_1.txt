I am surprised to think what people should have the ideas of environmentalists after looking at this piece of increase, preaching the garbage. Scheduled with enough Indian-wannabe energy and a sister's sister's store store of a new age store, Starlight makes anyone who gives a devastation on the planet looks like an idiot of wearing fur-pleasing glass. <br /> <br /> Plan? Rae Rae Dawn Chong comes to lead flute play pattern of underwear in a mystical effort to prevent the collapse of the Earth's approaching landscape. But first they have to win the evil alien who does not see anything like a fighter from Castro road. Fortunately, they have a grandfather's grandfather Willie Nelson as well as help (who appears to be embarrassed with the case, he also has to be) with F / X buckets and non-swimming music. Indeed, the clunky script helps to hide the film's trite plot and pleasing speed, but that's just the tip of this iceberg of melting film. Everyone involved with this film should have their unified card cards canceled until they can complete the real reality in environmental science.
