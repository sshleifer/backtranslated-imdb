We had to go to the appointment, so we turned DVR to record the final. After it was finished, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?". He rolled his head no. I said, "So you made me look at the end of this film and I don't know what happened". He did not "I", but you know. The body of the film itself was quite good. There were many doubts. It kept asking you. Then came the end. The end was ... just as soon as it was finished. It applies to what happened or why. Until credit I continued to think something would happen to explain it, but it has never done it. So I come here to expect someone to do it and I didn't care. Don't. Four years later, I am as unknown as tom sawyer was. <br /> <br /> I still don't have an authorization yet. I am so happy I have never lost any $$ purchase because I certainly would be mad. OHHHHH! I get it! The end of the film is what was lost! ROFL
