I have never heard this news before turning on TV Cable. It is very common to 50 years of sci-fi physics: highly confident, depressed and not a little paranoid! With the typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is very good to put in the style of text - which is perhaps the cheapest way to leave a lot of storytelling and exemplary entry if the footage stock as it is binadamuly likely for what course it is A very small budget project! Although it is not self-pleasing (angle-of-apocalypse-through-renegade-missile angle later used, and more aplomb, to DR all STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) with a short, single-minded film approach in this regard it creates a good laughing laughter - especially in cases related to close births and a group of newborn babies!
