I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I understand what they are trying to accomplish though some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time that wasn't sure. Now that I have seen such movies I will never think of them again. There are tons of society, racism, and certain desires ... but South Park has that. And when I look at South Park it really makes me feel feeling. The closest thing I was impressed with the feeling during this film was that I found it after the first five minutes. I rate a movie of seven or more because I love more every film. I paid this one film.
