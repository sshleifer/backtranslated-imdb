I saw it was a real job of staying through this film. The sound method was not good and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what it said. There was a little thing to move along and often the step only stopped and there was a long period of conversation that seemed to be related to the film. This conversation has been exchanged between family groups and the interrogator was left to try and include what the common stick was that tied them. It is rare that I measure this film down and do it in this case if you all experience check it I think "so what" and "why I waste my time watching this."
