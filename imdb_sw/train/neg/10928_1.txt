You just saw this film, and how long it is. The movie was predictable and slow. It is basically the good news of Mormon that produces a basketball church. Instead of watching this film, I had to have a root canal. Exhibitions were run by sponsorship / sponsorship. This film was capable of the odds that are shown by Mormons when playing a church basketball, however because it has been tested for PG, the true nature of the festival cannot be transferred to the film. Acting is awesome unless Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the film was not really needed.
