Yes, "mourn" first was normal. A good movie of the waswolf in which I accept a slow start, but he got the speed on the way to have a good finish then anchorwoman changed in a cute waswolf just attacked down the camera. Yes made for the horrible film to be sure ... certainly forget all this if this film is not related to the film. Oh, of course, they make it out of that woman's anchor is the same as that her brother or something wants to know what and why things have fallen like they did, but they come from a small film transfer from the movie Transylvania or somewhere where they should fight with waswolves of magic of evil or something. I often ask myself what Christopher Lee was doing in this film, however I read the trivia here where he said he had never been on a movie of a waswolf before, but still read the script before taking responsibility. Perhaps you could enter the "American hell of the Jews in London" that would have been possible. It was placed in London after all. Heck, waswolves do not seem to have much in this film except for a surprising and long-term sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this film for me is when one gal began to speak loudly and this dude's ear started bleeding.
