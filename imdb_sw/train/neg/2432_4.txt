Not much to say about this. A program that might have a good pig, in the first 10 minutes. There is nothing worse for this film, a very small step for the action film. There was a chance to explore the feelings of the characters regularly. If the action film is the right type to do it and, I'm still clear. Sniper was one of the most easy to watch movies without giving the full attention, as it was a little problem with a direct plot. I was guilty of it, so for the second hour or for unintentional alert it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but best between 4 out of 10)
