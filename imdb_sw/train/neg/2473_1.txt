as my grandmother made a film he could make a better figure than this ... very strange ... The main characters (mother, father and child) are the same. Particularly the mother is good performers and the child also shows that it is especially good at the events where she should be afraid. But the director knows the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. The script does not have any form of turning it into something to emphasize. If you would like to be chased by the trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just at home and sleep. oh ... in fact there was something amazing: the film of 2001 but we couldn't recognize since the picture is bad (like mini-dv) and cars are old (like 70 and 80).
