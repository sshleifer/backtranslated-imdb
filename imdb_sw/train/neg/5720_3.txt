Some of the gorehound friends are recommended to "Live Feed" to me, and basically I cannot complain if the film offers a large amount of smut and buckets filled with sleaze, but it's not a very good film. More obviously that he is entering the latest trends in a horrible movie, called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to adopt another film in this small (and which includes examples of "Hostels" and "Saw") and its patients & effects well-trained co-naked shadows have tried, suffered and prayed for their lives. There is no real plot to explain. Five non-smart people can travel to Asia. One of them has roots in Asia, but moreover I don't know why they decided to travel there instead of Cancun. They are not interested in the culture of the basin and even the area of ​​hectares when they are preaching good dog dogs to the market. Then it enters into a good night of life and one of them insults the wrong leader of the criminal family. Just apologize is not enough, as a gangster follow them in an adult theater and gradually down to all suffering pain. One girl is tied to her chest and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake being burned under her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" wonders that boring in spite of all blood and the production standards of amateur are very difficult to watch, even if you have used to watch a private-teen movies like this. The bloke of the oil shown on the lid, the S&M employee of the east, is quite sure he is also the most talented of the whole group, because at least he keeps his mouth all the time. I would like to recommend this particular dirt pile, but hey, if you like sound music and unintentional voice, frustrated with frustration with the lost, go ahead and watch!
