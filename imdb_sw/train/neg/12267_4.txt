just say like a movie, I didn't like it much. not because he didn't have a FX or because we had one cabin as a whole film mode, in fact that's what made me look at it. I did not like it because it was a shadow, "all his friends" are happy and then they are mad, but you have no idea why; then it takes different responsibilities, one is a believer, the other is an opponent, but they are not quite sure! also, the lights were awesome and I say technical issues. <br /> <br /> in a few words, something that the movie may have "ok I am out here!" from certain characters. as a woman who does not want to hear her Bible version. <br /> <br /> about the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is the evidence of the text and good ideas. I care about the author of the book so, so, my 4/10. So, at the end, listen to the story of someone to believe or not, not just use all the time to act if you believe him and be surprised by what he says, and at the same time moving around and making jokes if you believe him. <br /> <br /> Advice. <br /> <br /> thanks for reading;)
