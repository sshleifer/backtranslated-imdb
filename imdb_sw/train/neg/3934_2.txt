It seemed to watch this film and see these actors do. However, I was very sad in the script and the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04', was a doctor in the story who uses drugs and loss of medication. Dr Sands was visiting the night club and was able to use his medical experience to help the injured client and was helped by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Take Life", '04, who is immediately attracted to Dr David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays Great Gangster's Shot and someone with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to be working in many cases and goes out of his mind trying to keep his group members from being killed. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas Series Series", has a great role to help and shows the real COOL DUDE who is so-called guardians of Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks nice and sexy with her red ruby ​​lips which draws a great attention from all men. This movie is not great, but it is not good.
