That may be the worst film made, and it is possible to appear for the same reason. Streisand is not as good as a young woman as a man to learn Judaism. The sound of the sound is hard, featuring Barbara blowing out some of the most blatherful filmmakers. And even get me started on a plot. In fact you will find more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it's soooooooo bad. Streisand's ego spreads, thinking he could lift this stinker to the Oscar length, causing this disaster. I am sure that the journalist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never allowed Streisand. I can't blame him. This film is like looking at an instant car for slow motion for two hours and the sound of 'Sound Music' played back behind the old head. It is true that it is bad. I am surprised that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this film at the same rate.
