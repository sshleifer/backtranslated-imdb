I had a lot of hope for this movie and I looked at it with many expectations; primarily because of Kamal Hassan. He is a wonderful actor who has put his feet in the sand of eternity. But this film proved to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this film the violence and violence in tenebra and orange orange clock looks much better. The Master, Raghavan, is a very courageous police officer. Who is responsible for investigating the brutal massacre of murder. Raghavan finds a thread that connects to this case and is about to solve the killings and put psychologists to death, two psychologists were disillusioned but students with medical skills, behind bars but run back and forth into the murder. Raghavan finally kills them both after rescuing many innocent people. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> The killing and sexual abuse and rape are clearly shown, which the movie could live without. Even imagine that young people and children will be watching this movie in the theater and the type of pictures should be color in their minds is certainly not good. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has the responsibility of the community and his audience. I haven't actually gone to the movies that look like Gautham's name on the production list.
