The fact that this movie has the most successful movie in the Swiss movie history makes me shake my head! It is true, but sad at the same time. Flick on the Swiss army can be a better deal. It looks interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to cancel his military and military training while he is a church, the love of his wife Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). Working in a way is not quite different from just a few employers getting married and stoned in the truth. Melanie Winiger has her role as a powerful Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, a personalized person instead of offending. <br /> <br /> Story story contains comedy with romance, which doesn't work as expected. A piece of romance is very few, and a delightful part is not quite fun, it is an affordable and unchangeable attempt in the entire movie. It's funny for 12-13-year-olds, but not like those who seek comedy for entertainment. Humor is weak except for certain shots. Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a proper comedy for Swiss RS, make sure you didn't encourage your military training yet, and never expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give you 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is funny during his screen time. It's not hell for a lot of time screens though
