This story of the film is very serious, which can happen in real life. I can't understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and could do everything she wanted, then why would she like that bad man? 2. What? The script of the story can be very weak? He was rich, he could do everything he wanted, but he did not try to hide his husband that is impossible. The words I love, don't mean anything in this film.
