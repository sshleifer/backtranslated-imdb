"True" story of a late monster which appears when the American industrial industry begins to pollute the water. Interestingly, though not true, the monster film has many people trying to find monster and know what is going on but not a completely linked way. Give points to give us a great monster on which they built to standard for certain scenes but take off that looks like a puppy is not threatening. An exciting film that is interesting for ignorance in the right mental sense. (One complaint is that the publication used for Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a copy of the designed video that had passed 20 years ago.)
