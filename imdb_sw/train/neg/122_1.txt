I would like to put this on my film list in an unknown garbage field! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are those that are unknown but you think you love them because they should be good for you! Sexual procedure, so terrible in his day, could not even awaken the rabbit. Sosi known as politics is a high school sophomore night Marxism. Film is an arty of self-sense for the worst of time. Photography is in bright black and white sand. Other events have not thought or taken from the wrong angle. Even the voice is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
