this could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't see how this could be described as a terrible movie, or even exciting? it's more like an interesting game. The awesome music is EXCELLENT but since there was no horrible situation the director thought it was a good idea to use for everyday activities like taking money or walking stairs. The movie had great potential. they had good movies (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed like the authors thought you already know them. they could carry out anonymous activities without an explanation or even a clue to what they meant. this is just one of those movies that talk about one thing and it is something different.
