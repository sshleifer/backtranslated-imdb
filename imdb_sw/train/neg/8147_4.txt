This movie was a piece of garbage mix. You never knew it went on. The characters were not well written and for the most part they were not worried except for Gus (played well by George Eads). I hate this film but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula Stocks) should win the prize. It was especially sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in this shameful and interesting film. Life was dropped down. One needs to make sure that this director is no longer aware of the film again. It was also this that thinks a terrible film because it was much more to hear than the terrible. For shame, life, for shame.
