This is the most likely of the worst movies I saw. I have also made the mistake of buying a movie because the backdrop was overcrowded and the front cover was very good too (After buying this and film "Malevolence" which I have looked at here too, I have learned my lesson). I like horrible movies on the forest or in the wilderness or on the field. This is thought to happen in the forest of Texas but it is possible to be closed in the director's fields. Production is probably the worst I have ever seen. The executives were completely WORST. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I tried to sell to F.Y.E and some of the "mother and pop" shop that used the DVDs used and will not take. That's bad how this bad excuse because of the film was. I have seen bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this certainly takes a cake. I didn't think there was a worse film than "Troll 2". The boy was wrong! Do not give this film unless someone will give you for free but even you stuck with it unless you throw out which is what you are about to do !!!!
