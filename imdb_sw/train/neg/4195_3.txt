Because of the people involved, it is difficult to see why this film should be destroyed and inappropriate. The author, David Ward, wrote an amazing film "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda won the Klute College Award, and Donald Sutherland had done the best work in the film as "Klute," "Start Revolution Without Me," and "Heroes of Kelly." Plotwise, the movie is a caper story, and a small group of misumbing of tremendous heist plans. At the same time the movie wants to be a satire of the string, a series of comedy drawings of the kind that NBC television show "Saturday Night" would be so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the bits of comedy seem to be bad and forced to forbid comedy bits to destroy any kind of suspense that heist has. It is a real movie that continues to move into itself, as well as cars in cars in the incidence of matches. The only true goal for me was to look at Jane Fonda. Its "Iris Caine" should be a good heart version of its political character of Bree Daniels in "Klute" However, one does not believe for a while. Jane Fonda always pretends to be the girl we are looking at. It is very bad performance if its performance in "Klute" was sharp. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run these two films to show how the same executive in that kind of role can be good or pathetic. It suggests that executives are just as good as their authors and directors.
