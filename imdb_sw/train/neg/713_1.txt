I would like to say first, that I felt so much about this film that I joined IMDb in particular to look at. And my opinion? That's the worst movie I saw. > <br,,, Remember the South Park section which included manatees writing Family Guy using 'thought balls'? Did these manatees also write a few? Its as the author wanted to incorporate all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to unite them all together, and then do things to do even a little, with Donnie Darko-esquire while traveling the theme to the end, messing up chronology. I could say from the beginning that this was a bad movie. Specific effects were below the budget of anything better than the DVD directly. Acting was not good, but I have seen more. I will praise the Nazi pictures, they were exciting, but the evil Nazi boy was just a mixture. <br /> <br /> I have no vendetta against this film or anything, but be honest, I'm even in a kind of fear. But this film cannot be described as exciting or game. If this story is told well, this would be a good movie. But it's gone. Waaaaay on hyped.
