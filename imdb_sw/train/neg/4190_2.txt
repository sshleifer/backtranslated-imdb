I saw this film a few months ago in a town like Greendale in the film, which is the only reason I went to see it. One of the places that he was there just sent me an e-mail message to show for the first time he had already sold it and people were evicted. His editorial view in front of him is a beautiful summary: <br /> <br /> Unless you're a fan of Neil Young or living in / around "Greendale" (if you know the real name), skip this film. It is more than an ego trip to the film manufacturer. It has no intention of realizing it, music is just the same, and many sounds do not feel like it is impossible to follow the slightest thing of a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I don't need to keep a spoiler warning because there is no surprise to give away. I would like to offer this 1.5 / 10, but that's the value of amusement to see the sites made to the movie. It was worth $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make the most beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see * a good movie message without a plot, go to the Koyaanisqatsi rental.
