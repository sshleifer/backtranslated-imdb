I am fascinated. I enjoyed the "Hot Shots" and "Naked Guns" with their many sequels, even when many people found that they could not fail. I have even been able to please the most beautiful Pauly Shore movies. There's only one movie that I found that I could honestly say was wrongâ€¦ and this was it. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater, "This is a dumb movie. Why did I see this?" It's just a movie trust that I can't recommend.
