The most part of the preparatory phase of this Star is the story of Born seems to be the ultimate success. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young woman who is not imprisoned in it but cannot persuade as an actor to develop a growth that both win and benefit from this team. Even in the long-term studies of Esther, we cannot see him doing the teacher's instructions. After suffering through Esther's pain (in large quantities of self-defense), we are not given the impression of her influence. The magnitude of the pain of the heroine seems to be a delightful bond for beauty. However the causes of these pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) have never been united in general. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should link its end. Esther Kahn is still ready to go ahead of the audience.
