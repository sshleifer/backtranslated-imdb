This film is one of the worst mistakes I have ever seen. I suffered severe pain in my head while watching this film. CGI was bad, and the story was just the dirt of the ink. The character of Cain's character was Mr-Super-intuitive-I-can-figure-out-anything, except he cannot seem to work his own helicopter correctly. The main problem was the function of split camera. I felt like I was looking at Brady's Bunch or something, not just different people in boxes, just about different views of the same thing. I can only recognize that participants need money, because this film was not worth the film was shot.
