I totally agree with jamrom4. this was one awesome movie that I have ever seen .. holy trophy was awesome .. I was warned not to see .. and stupidity I looked at yet .. about 10 minutes in painful experience I totally gave up on watch atrocity..but stayed up to the end .. to see if I could .. well I did and now I would not .. it was an abomination .. it happened and last all they preach..no bad movie that has the right to live. I urge you all to avoid fatty fuel ... if only I had heard the same warning ... please save you from this film. I feel those who voted very much were involved in film ... and all should clear the surface of the planet. ..
