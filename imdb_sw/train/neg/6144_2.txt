Surprisingly, though he can make "burst", Thomas is the perfect tough as an actress. This film is locked in my memory as one of the available and sufficient movies I have seen. So I am really enjoying it. However, the only reason this gets more than one star is that Thomas is a good shape, and it is fun to see his little body, muscles doing various gymnastic skills on abnormal rocks and shapes scattered about the eastern part of Eastern Europe (including "horse pommel horse" with a very beautifully embedded center of the village that Thomas uses to climb his feet in the faces of various villagers of pride). But then the poor boy opens his mouth and try to strengthen it, and any deception that he can have the film work once hit by bits. Thomas had at least an excuse that he was not a real actor. Everyone else in the film - executives, director, editor, teenager camera, etc. is at least bad, or worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt doesn't give as much as you can. <br /> <br /> I hope the poor Kurt took money and run. If anyone asking him to do it again in the military film, I will say that Thomas hits that person in the face.
