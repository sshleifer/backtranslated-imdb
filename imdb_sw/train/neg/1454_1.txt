I just watched this film, and I can't seem to understand why h * ll makers makes this bunch of decoration. I mean, yes, It gives a great sense of Hitler's environment, and I mean how they produced Austria in the late 1890s, WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can understand is why they showed Hitler as 100% clean, mad, unreliable, intellectual. He was after all a very wise, loving and wise man who undoubtedly had his dark sides, of course on that. But why does the name of heaven show him this way? All of its best issues have been cut off from the situation, leaving nothing except the image of propaganda as someone who had a great influence on modern civilization forever. Yes, he hit Germany in World War II. Yes, he was a racist, and yes he was sometimes an unreliable position at the end of the war. All true. But again; Why did hell describe LIE for the public? To warn us? I don't think this film was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and Nazi is the fact that they were able to raise up during the greatest crisis in the world. The fact that this evil was known but still accepted by almost every living German (not mentioning the Austrians and LOT of other people) makes it a warning for modern civilization, NOT Hitler really was 'weirdo'. If it had been if the creators made us believe - I would be sure that the German people had lost. One such person in this film never got anywhere near the party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
