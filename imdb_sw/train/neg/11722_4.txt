The problem with the Controller is mentioned by the opening area. CIA wants the international terrorist dead so contact the black opsman James Dial. Terrorism appears in the Old Bailey Court in London which asks the question why they want to put an end to the terrorist if he will spend his entire life in jail? He will be out of the cycle either way. Did the CIA not have a chance before the arrest? If for a certain position he gets a guilty decision and then murders him. There is no good reason to kill a person who lives in a high-security prison. Since the premise puts a story in which viewers can choose to choose to ignore the pit of the plot but to authorize it gives us fuel on fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police shoot and taxi riding in the attack but Dial manages to escape. So the police were almost enough to shoot someone but too far to know someone from a car accident? Films of this kind of plot. Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun to him saying "The airport is surrounded by armed men" Dial still managed to escape easily without clarification. The whole film deceives its audience based on things that have never been told. This includes an important character called Emily Day. Why did he help Dial even if he wanted a refugee? I think your is as good as my <br /> <br /> This is a poor thriller and is not available to "big name" cast. Wesley Snipes used to graduate as a film star but killed her job with stars in more and more films. Charles Dance also appeared in the main production budget of Hollywood such as HERO for HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he is known for the direct appearance of DVD fares these days, and essentially plays the role of comeo. Lena Headey's loved ones can continue to be a great player in the movies but they certainly can't put the STONE on their resume
