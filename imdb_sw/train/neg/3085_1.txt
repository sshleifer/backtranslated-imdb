Definition: Corny, quite stupid and useless. It is cheaper and crippled, it will make you wonder why these dumb people even lost two months or so spend the budget (I think this ...) maybe not more than 700 dollars to make this film. It was just a hysterical look together or without the Secret of Science. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Tie yourself, your life, your life, and money, to NOT - I repeat, and don't think if you should see this film. This film is corny, it will make your face turn to the purple deficit. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this very contemporary film. You might like it. (As I said earlier, If you have an IQ number one) With your own 12 practitioners, a few puppets bought at the garage sale, and of course cameras and music, the gaurente will make a home video more fun than this piece complete.
