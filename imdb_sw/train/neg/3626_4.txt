I don't know what Oscar voters saw on this film, but they must see very good things to see in order to be able to provide a better picture of Oscar. I know it's fortunately there was a Gene Kelly to play in it or this would be twice as bad as I think it is. First, I don't think Leslie Caron was very good to play that role. He is not talented, he is not a good player and does not look quite well. It is embarrassing that one actor or actor can destroy the movie as well as playing in it because as Leslie Caron was not in this, it might make a big film. The story was intelligent, the guide was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was good. Now I'm not talking about all these things about Leslie Caron just accusing her, I just say because I think that's the worst part of the movie. It might be a good actor but I can't tell him because I haven't seen him in anything else but I think he was very good at "An American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go on but I tell you, you're the best way to look at "Singin" in the rain ".
