five minutes after this check I went to IMDb to warn you all out so that you don't bother with this film ... type: fear? had time to insist strictly in the whole movie I had thought of myself "somethings gotta happen soon" was not ... when the movie ended I felt so embarrassed for the author / director I have never been a great fan used this guy doesn't know how to make movies and after watching This sad excuse of flick of fear I have received from being not a big fan who will not look at any of his work. <br /> <br /> I was taken for a summary of the plot please do not make the same mistake. I have given this movie 2 to the characters ... they were not bad and they had no fault that they found wrong ...
