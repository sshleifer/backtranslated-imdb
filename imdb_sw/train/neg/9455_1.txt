Well I think I know the answer to that question. For Money! We've been bombarded with Cat Broadcast in Hat and products that we are approaching to believe there is something good about this movie. I agree, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give a chance. Yes, I should go with my nature. It was a perfect part of Hollywood garbage. Once again confirming that an ordinary person can be prepared to believe whatever they say is good, it must be good. In addition to the horrible fact that the film is only 80 minutes long, it obviously started with the eating script of moths. Faced with many attempts of failure of unnecessary humor, and bad events of pastel. It jumps over the whole world without repetition or direction. This is composed of, ...... I will say, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was looking at the "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat in the middle of the Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not awarded, but Mr. Myers should be lost under the rock somewhere until he was ready to make another Austin Power film. F-, no star, 0 at the rate of 1-10. Save your money!
