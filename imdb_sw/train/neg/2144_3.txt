I've thought that Cinderella II is a very bad movie I saw, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some sequels like the Lion King 2 and Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these movies are made in one idea; because the film is not conspicuous, they try to make it by filling it with joke. I say jokes are bad, but they make more of the film. At first I saw the film, I would give 1/10. But now I think about it, many children do not care how the original movie was good, they just take care that the movies are entertaining. I still think that movie was very bad, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Now I think it's worth 3/10.
