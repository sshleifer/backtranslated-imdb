I love false science, I am fascinated by Egyptian stories and I enjoy digital animation. I thought the movie combining these three would be at least enjoyable. I can't be more wrong: The story (or in fact there is a lack of it) is not quite well-known and it does not matter - when common ideas are a great part of any false story. Talk and acting is worse than in the average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the word 'evil performance'. Bad work would not be a big problem if Bilal 'director' was not very responsible; All lines seem like they should be poetry, it seems like Bilal thinks that he has made a piece of art here. In fact, no art or poetry is found in this piece, just take care! This person must be very close to making text, as it fails to all possible accounts as a director. The worst is the awesome digital animation, which is so badly returns to watch this film to be a physical experience. Graphics look so fake they even make werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And for that half of the characters are CGI-animated, it's quite a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If the gods of Egypt ask then Bilal is a dead boy, for they will surely take revenge on him through ignorance that he shows them in this very bad film.
