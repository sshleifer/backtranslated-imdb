And Oscar for a player with a low sense of explosion goes to - Dwight Frye. His name must be expressed in the same fear as Karloff, Lugosi, and Prices, and this movie proves. Herman's character was one of the two reasons I can give to watch this film. Dwight gave this a little more misfit of sad but positive attitude that led to the greatest hope of all the movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the comic aid of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession I must give the udos for the performance of the hypochondriac expert emerging with compassion. While some "medical faults" provided briefly when a good doctor tested his fellow colleagues ... "Well continue to give him" Unfortunately, these two exhibitions could not emphasize me through two experiments to stay in this way without deserving a small movie. . The plan is predictable and few. Displaying the film during the withdrawal of the spoonful of the spoon was more likely to make me a yes - yes you can use very shade. <br /> <br /> My suggestions - see immediately see Frye and Eburne - but only during the eyes and with lots of caffeine.
