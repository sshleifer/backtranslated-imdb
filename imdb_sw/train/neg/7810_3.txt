Against All Hope is very bad, sometimes painful, movie. This is the first movie of Michael Madsen, and it shows, he is not good in it. Some people can find interesting stories; The drinker knows his life and his family is falling apart and so he calls the preacher as a last resort to help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart. I have seen many religious events, as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church but is going away with it, really. I also loved how Cecil knows her life is breaking and trying to learn, but she knows only God can help her. He finally knows with God's help he can go into life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not done at all. Acting is bad, the script can use a certain function, and looks worse than home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because a Christian does not mean that you will be able to stop drugs or heal your broken family, and Cecil knows this and works hard to stay on track. In general, if your Christian will know how this film shows Christianity and if not, you can have fun to know more about faith.
