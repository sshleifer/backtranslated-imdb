Avent-garde nightmarish, a small budget "budget" which has a deception of size. It's hard to stay. I get a message that child abuse is correct. Wow great revelation. I didn't have a clue that was wrong before seeing this. That's the fear. Do not see this "film" if you are experiencing sexual or male sex. Don't check it if you are young. Don't look at it if you care about it. For the second concept just don't look at the period. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D-<br /> <br /> Additional DVD: make a movie, first, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted events, Director's comments, two versions of teaser trailer, video The Azoic, and a video class test
