I loved this film. The original phantasm had a wonderful beauty and mystery. Like 70s horror flicks, it looks and feels like a creepy documentary, unfinished. Phantasm II, from the last 80 years, stepped up, but kept these good ideas. Sadly, Phantasm III is just bad. It highlights all of the incredible events in previous films, which eliminates rather than multiplying their power. It crashes to lose pictures from the first Fantasm as a reenactment of the original cheap. There are many types of flying on this film that appear to be like household insects than death threats. Hundreds hang on the ceiling as Christmas balls moving in the draft. Is there no one - the master of the river, DP, editor, director - caution or services that seem to be hard? Even worse, Phantasm III provides one corny, the wrong joke after another. It is different from the size of the first film. The original phantasm used humor to reduce its undue stress on death. Phantasm III uses death to introduce a cheaper joke about Reggie's horniness: a few of them refer to the film "smell fly" ha, ha, when I get, balls. Perhaps the staff voted for these jokes, but it's up to us.
