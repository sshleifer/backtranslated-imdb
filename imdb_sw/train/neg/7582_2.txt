The upper sores are non-existent items. They can lift women (or people crossing the cross) to a new height, put a bright front of style and bring a touch to a beautiful beauty. Otherwise, it may be the pain of a dangerous foot that will undoubtedly lead to the journey, it falls and the last catastrophe. Tacones lejanos are more than a disappointing journey than an increased fashion. The mother of Almodóvar's daughter is really delicate, but in terms of conspiracy it is a closed and exciting thing to be confused, complicated characters who are not fully involved or meaningful. At the moment of voting, Tacones lejanos is not only interesting. A little better comes at the start of the incredible murder of the pastor laid by the child. From these beautiful beautiful things translated are looking up, but the film comes to the heel. There is enough acting performances and there is some stylish leadership, which you would like to expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an interesting piece of Spanish cinema. With the story of murder, showbiz, female, mother and daughter's broken heart and character who is another referee, the advertiser and scribe of this police can be a melodramatic force. Instead they are poor. The ulcer ulcers are hit by the point.
