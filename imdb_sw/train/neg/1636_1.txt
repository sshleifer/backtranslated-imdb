This movie will be complicated by those who enjoy sophomoronic, no matter what, boast about the use of sex and F ... in almost every sentence. As a good plot? As a comedy? Like romance or other humanitarian values? Stay away from whipping. It was so bad I left after half an hour. I saw two children getting into what seemed to be about 10 - very dangerous - this deserves X.
