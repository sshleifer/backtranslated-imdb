I was really in my opinion to Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the entire film with my family and other friends. I don't know what the film was near. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their best efforts. It doesn't fit together very well. It's very choppy, and there is a little comedy. I'm broken. It can be better. I waited months to see this film according to fabric details. Don't lose your money unless you are perfect and just want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Bibi Goldberg. It was a bad way to spend the evening.
