Near the end of the film, I felt it was technical too. I felt like I was at school to read how our Navy saves in the sea. I liked to see that the engines are hot. I think I had to have that opinion before, but I never thought about it. Using 747 to transmit old pictures of value and very little safety is unusual and not true. Acting was very good, since they are the most seasoned experts, but if you're going to stretch so far as possible to happen, it should be more like fantasy, comical, etc.. Everything was taken very much. At least the movie was Felix Ungar as a pilot, and Buck Rogers, a nightclub, and Dracula also on the board. Movie was full of known faces. I understand that Hollywood should spread a little for the drama, but it hurts the quality of the film when the main issue is found in caricature. That is why I said it should be more interesting. My pet peeve and movies about air travel is that everyone just moves on top. They walk around the drinks, put them down and beat them 5 minutes later, as they are in the building or something, and act like turbulence is not just there. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but the charge is not appropriate to enter the second second accident after blowing something. However, skilled artists and artists keep this weak script due to being made to a film that has been tracked after the first screening. I love Lee Grant, but it was fun to look at a psychologist who lost ... :)
