The killer of BTK, the Green River killer, Zodiac Farmer; The man keeps putting garbage and the most unusual thing is, he likes his trick. I have never seen Ulli Lommel's film but I was surprised how everyone thinks it is very bad. If the movies I mentioned earlier are equal to six times when they are added together! After reading the comments I was eager to see how this man is very bad. He is the worst there. The talent will not disappear if the favorite movie started and quickly noticed that the sound had been hit so badly. Acting was very bad and similar to the camera pictures. The editor is much easier. This film did not know and I would certainly not make it again if it could not end and I had only 45 minutes on the film. I couldn't take it again. I lost 45 minutes of my life. Do not see this CRAP!
