When? Did you know that Scooby-Doo fought zombies? Well, you may also not know this little film directed by Victor Halperin, who also led White Zombie four years earlier. That would make the second film of the zombie done. No, don't go looking for Dorothy Stone to open her breasts if you could expect in many zombie movies, and don't worry even the intellectual mind. This is 1936, you know. Therefore, you will see what is an example of the period - talk a lot. You can see Dean Jagger (twelve O 'Clock High) and the eyes of Bela Lugosi, but that's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, in fact!
