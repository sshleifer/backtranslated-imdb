It should say that - despite the unusual odds of panegyric for its ability to "capacity" set here - the director of this inept, oshous tosh has not made a film since. Well so good news if I'm worried. Dead children are all beers of their creator, but they do not have the skills and technical skills that make Martin Amis journalists appear. <Br /> <br /> When will the UK film industry rise up and realize that if it wants to return to the situation once it had to stop producing garbage like this and do something real people would need to look for? Avoid as a blow.
