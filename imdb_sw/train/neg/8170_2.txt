A friend and I went over a couple of years (many years ago) to choose the lively films in a video store for evening entertainment. For some reason, I have bought this (perhaps v. V. Affordable price). <br /> <br /> Low voice sound synth is typical of time and type. There are also very few exciting screens. Among them is a place where a person is attacking and defending themselves with impossible things, has made me laugh at a time (it doesn't seem to be too surprising but it goes there). <br /> <br /> Besides being a total error, committed. But maybe the value of watch if you like the film as "Cancel Mall". Yes, I have also seen.
