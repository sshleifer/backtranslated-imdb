I was very optimistic to see the change of common stories like the Arab Light. Instead I was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my thoughts from the beginning, though I tried to look twice! It was a bonus that Caradine was in this film but it was not very similar as participants did not have the skills. For something else similar to Zorro and Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is the best for action, during comic and enjoyment in general. OK, so the Son of the dragon has as many fans as possible out, but if you are looking for something about wow about martial arts and the plot line you will find. If you just want children to sit down on Sunday afternoon then maybe this is for you with 3 ninjas.
