John Candy. We need to say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Many people do not realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness that he changes from the slope to the jerk. Just simple (trick) change the face and away we go. There are more big bits in this film and many clicks. The best time for me is Kone FU U and a good time when John (in trance) comes on stage and he talks about how much he likes his girlfriend - how he and his sexual parts love his partner. I am sure to read this you can imagine this sound of the sequence is odd. It's, but it's also very funny because it's John Candy do a little. The story is generally good disability and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV designers and Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has time, especially to open the wedding (consider Rod Serling) and a great location while talking to her mother on the phone. Generally a good movie if you have had a hard day and you need to keep your brain on a stupid. I offer this 4 out of 10.
