First, I would like to say that while it is not a specialist, the way that the case was done will satisfy your mind. First, the charges did not prove that 'facilitating learning' works. Not responsible for all charges (because they can get an appeal) and the protection of not making this statement. As another advertiser said, the study of direction was not true. Secondly, they used Terry as an interpreter who has a personal interest, and even to witness, in an attempt that is just a fool. If the court has allowed him to preach in such a way, they could bring a neutral person or they would only appeal. Third, this child was not asked specific questions about the defendant and the charges (birth crops, event details, etc.) and even when asked for specific protection questions as it began, he could not answer. If not a wise question I do not know what a competent lawyer would gain independence. Under the bottom, it starts off with the pressure of being a child of an autism child, but the attempt makes this film totally impossible.
