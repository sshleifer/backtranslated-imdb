I am allowed to write 1000 words about this film, but one word can be enough: wonderful. Hubby and I didn't laugh much like gawk in this truly awesome movie. We kept looking for each other for the best "What ...?" words. There is no way to explain enough to this movie. Tomato tomatoes were funny, but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces pictures like these and then puts them on the film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this amazing, wonderful and then packet as appropriate for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him see this film. Preteens can look at it - perhaps with "What ...?" The words on their faces. If you decide to beat this film to others, you may want to beat their yaioog. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to make the worst bad film made.
