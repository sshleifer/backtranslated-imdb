Unless FAMILY, this new season is worse than one season. I can't imagine what they think. As a fan of fear, he can endure a lot of violence and intelligence, but this series becomes worse for each entry. I can't think of how people should be involved and the members can work every day, using the task to overcome the trick. LOOK! What? That's so much to pray? CHARACTER! How can we give him a guarantee of the fate of anyone in these stories? If we have not worked, who cares if they stumble or nothing? Almost every section ends with allowing blood without letting it go, with great shock without any meaning of revelation or conclusion or REASON for what we've been under an hour of blood. Even Dante's attempts this season had sexual harassment and misguided to a pointless conclusion. Interestingly, production values ​​and exhibitions tend to be faster, while the content loses. I am very optimistic for VALARIE's Producer Exec of Garris ON SARA, but we will see.
