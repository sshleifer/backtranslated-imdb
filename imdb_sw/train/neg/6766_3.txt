You probably heard these words when you come to this film? "Herbie: Reliable" and yes it is true. This movie is very awesome and completely paralyzed. It was supposed to be the second bad Lindsey film ever since the Queen's Confession. The only good thing about this film seems to be more than a cast talent which at a distance is better than movie movie times and is the sole selling of movie action. I don't see how a respected actor like Matt Dillon can be part of this film, don't you read this bad picture before entering the account? What I did not like about this film is also the basis of how Herbie uses and fantasy as an amazing ability to climb on the wall and go faster than car racer after all just Beatle. I know it's a children's movie but they have gone to the exchanges and it might just be worse than entertainment. A little realistic is needed along with the story is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Last Words: Unless children are actually years -12 I'm very doubtful that anyone can enjoy this useless movie. What lost my money. I feel like misleading. <br /> <br /> Testing: 3/10 (Grade: F)
