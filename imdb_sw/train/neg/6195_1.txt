It's done wrong. The terrible and final actor the Director appeared to be apart from the place where the film was not very small. It is interesting that this film is taken by award at Gij√≥n film. Everyone who came out of the playground had the same opinion as I did - what was the film making? Iraqi references were wonderful or not considered properly. I am surprised that this film has been released - very, very frustrating and wasting my time. Sorry, the negative review but hopefully will prevent other people from making the same mistakes. What pity we did not have Q and A end of the film - now that can be interesting.
