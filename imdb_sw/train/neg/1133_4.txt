I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the most simple / worst experiments. Many performances work through the plug-and-play are encrypted in order to match the romantic-favorite type. This is usually the same because we are dealing with a variety, but the overall challenge is to make it original, new and innovative. This movie fails to do so. It does not mean who the characters are, except Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this film, not Isabelle Blais). Faced with this one piece and they have nothing more than easy-to-use puppets for the purpose of the lighter story. I should also mention the proposed recommendations and make the scenes unusual, or rather, make an attempt usually seems very obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the right sappy music which often appears inappropriate. I can't believe that the film that makes it quite clear of Woody Allenons continues to be this illusion. If you expect a good romantic comedy, this is not the case. Or suppose, this is a poor attempt. You will just leave the stadium wondering why this film has been getting the same moment when the movie is now over 100 years old and there are many Quebecois managers who work better. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's bad if you look at movies like artists and directors as writers.
