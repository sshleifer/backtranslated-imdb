I don't know how to describe this film. It's one of the most amazing movies I have seen for a long time. It is a very good time sometimes but it also borges boring in other areas. Dental torture events are very elaborate and can impress anyone who enters the year & splatter. I found myself slapping my teeth during some of the previous events. The trick of the movie is that it plays with our fears and Dentist so it can't separate. <br /> <br /> Filming is somehow hidden and can't be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of casual and casual entertainment and the dentist is planted in this dust it is only the film you were looking for. Try reading comments and feel somewhat interesting with this kind of entertainment, try! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
