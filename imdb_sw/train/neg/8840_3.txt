Here might be a good example of what you should not do when you have a great idea. That's the problem not? The concept is clean and full of capabilities, but the script and its implementation has no real substance. It should take you from scratch and then pull a little over your feelings, get interested and invest in characters. This movie does what it takes to turn off and develop aircraft, and this is why. First of all you care about the characters because they have not been presented in ways that people can focus on, I mean this is not Superman or Mission. They are not reliable through acting and interacting. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a soldier on chewing is a gum, forbidding and sharp look at all not the way to go here. I mean what it is, he looks like he is in the toilet or something. I loved him in the animation again and how he was in great interest / neurotic, unknown medical treatment. But not for this, he struggles to compensate for too much attention and sharp but by the neurotic way it is still not possible, not natural, I wonder that he had not made his jaw during the filming. The movie is essentially on life support, it's hard to have pulse and kept me waiting for something that never came.
