In order to overcome his wife's death, an old man makes everyone in his place a normal (at least the Greeneway movie of Peter): he and his son live in their eight-and-a-half (one-on-one) women and establish a sex odyssey. This is a Greeneway film, there are lots of interesting and unpleasant lots and of course there is an unwanted male weakness. In fact the father and baby sleep in bed in nude. Output. Besides, who wants to see an old man in front? For those who are not in the homo-erotic area, one of the women likes to do badly with horses. No stories - just a random collection of lighter scenes.
