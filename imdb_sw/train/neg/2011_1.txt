This movie is a pure guano. Mama always said if you can't say anything good ... but even Mama could say I should do my part to warn others of this film. I can make sure this is a film that Geoffrey rush would go just like. I would hope that Greg Kinnear drove his agent ... from the principle of giving him a script. After this Ben Stiller probably asks for someone to "There is still something about Mary." I have been a fan of Wes Studi's, thank you for anything you put in the holy that was wearing a mask through this film maybe people don't recognize the film too. <br /> <br /> Starts with promising stylistic demolition of movie films of Batman and then loses something ... like a concrete plot and a good half effect. <br /> <br /> Jokes have a telegraphed hour before the punchline comes, and yet it falls flat. If you want to see the most effective spoof of world book comic see "Chasing Amy". RUN! Do not leave From "PEOPLE OF PEOPLE"!
