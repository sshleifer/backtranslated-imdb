Alan Rudolph is a very director, without a special touch. For example, there was a single shot in the Dentist's Dentistry at the dentist's office that could describe the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph destroyed it. The camera is on the hallway looking through the doors of two dental doors, and Dana and Dave each other in their rooms. You get the idea of ​​their destruction and exclusion, but not more. Lighting, color, body language, facial expressions can be much more. If I was leading, I would always use it, if necessary, to get the same shot. That is the beauty and strength of the film: it can describe very much, all life, in terms of seconds / <br /> The child and a young child entering the puke valley could be improved. The child should be shown more by the ass, he should blow and push his feet, he should have his head bent down to look all around for his attention. Campbell did not give. He plays a man who does not speak, really, but instead of sending his voice to the sound, sign, movement of the body, the film depends on the sound of the voice and conversation with his eyes to consider alter-ego eyes, played by Denis Leary.
