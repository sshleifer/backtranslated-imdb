It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for a movie posted on TV. They said it was comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, after 30 minutes and laughing at once. The fact is that the movie has disappeared and I don't even have time to laugh. PLEASE, someone shouting, I lost 90 minutes without anything.
