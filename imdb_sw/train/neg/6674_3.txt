I would like to admit that the draw of this film is director Eduardo Sanchez, who supported the famous Blair Witch Project and efficiency. Besides, this is a guest movie of all kinds, and looks like the Dreamcatchers of Stephen King, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed it. But no, unfortunately I felt that in many places, it was changed to waste time, so I will continue to review these reviews. Place is always promising, and replaced no different. It says the story of a group of men who received a wonderful encounter when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase to think things. Myths about catching visitors should always deal with probes within orifices, so I won't go into the details, but you get a drift not worried, and something you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you are given a chance to take revenge? That is, you manage to effectively hunt, and catch one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's time to pay good, or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop to be snoozefest, and bad conversation, non-interesting, and even more act. Even if it is a low budget, there are not many reasons for liberation, whether it is a story of a story, or any help from being cast to make the characters just attract them. It is the standard card size from the plain vanilla script, as well as non-cheap methods used. <br /> <br /> What good though is a coating. Many attempts have been made to do some of the things that I will not do, so it will deal with a few of what makes this film worthy. Other than that, there are common side effects, blood and gory which are not something that they have never seen before. See this just as the last resort. Compared to another movie of the monster city - Feast, this is not very good, and it takes itself seriously. It was hit down with the wrong direction, you have been warned.
