This does not make the right of blues. It comes out of hard with a photograph from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was Blind Lemon Jefferson?) Blind person however) looks pointing from the sky? Corny as it is, this can be a very interesting part of this document. Later the only thing to see is the non-sounding of tribal tunes, displayed by a fake black and white 20s of fake 20s and the love of Beck and Shemekia Copeland to sing the same songs later. This is a good tool to show us why the old grease greats were too many, but they did not make a voting for force. There is nothing here that can make it a movie and not a radio. No one should be forced to see these wrong reenactments done. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for Blues. Avoid at all costs.
