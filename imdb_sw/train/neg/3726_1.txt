I had to watch this film as a little child and I was told they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would be a little afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ignorance and who want to teach their children to believe the same. In addition to the obvious issues caused by the brain and deception, there is also a bad acting, bad writing, and "special effects" of BAD. They are just around the horrible movies, awesome. Yes, reliable (and horrible) for the child, but I can't imagine the purchase of adults in this shlock. However, I must say, that I would be willing to see them today, as an adult. They may have some midnight nights / ritual worship.
