This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has an entertaining value for an entry to the elevator. Each section had plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug shortages, not very different from other sports stadiums. As for cast, I have seen the best actors on the grain box. From mid-late 90s, repeating the shoots of 'Knots' to U.K-Gold as a mountain of fiber to swallow. I am grateful to announce that I had to suffer if my mother was a big fan of the show and she would look at me religiously. Although since then, renewal has been few and far away (let's look at his hope stays the same way). The only positive thing that can be mentioned on the 'Knots' is the signature of the fascinating saxophone, later used as headline for SitT I.V,' The Upper Hand. That great inheritance, eh?
