The TV guide calls this film a secret. What a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce a very wonderful and unusual music and elite can not produce one film that can be increased on the level of contempt of this garbage this film represents perfectly. This is the best sound / worst, I honestly can't express the difference. Pleasing to the sweet, kitschy clich√©s each level, the line of the story, the state, the conversation, music and choreography. To put it openly, you must have a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I couldn't take it again. The only quality of film redemption is the good quality of the leading actors. <br /> <br />
