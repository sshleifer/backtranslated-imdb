Unfortunately, realistic is boring. This film, I thought it couldn't end, would be better if all the characters were beaten in the first five minutes. What? Where is the Blade where you need? Although it is as bad as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and like nighttime as BOISE MOI, DESAD CREAT is not nearly as entertaining as any of the above mentioned movies. Although free evil can create the hearts of Jeffery Dalmers of the wannabe at a slight pace, it was not close to such an interesting as RAVENOUS. Actually, I realized about such an interesting night night, and as exciting as a dentist's journey. If you have strong eyes, you may be able to tolerate this, otherwise, for anyone. I was so surprised that this was not done by people in the brain damage that was the quality of the organisms.
