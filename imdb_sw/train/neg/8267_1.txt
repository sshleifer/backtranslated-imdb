I start to see an example in movies I give 1 per. They are almost all the movies that my wife made me look. Maybe I should stop having faith in his taste in the movies. Otherwise, this is an example of the shade that focuses on the young girls before but makes even more than usual. Once again, the author broke the rule of the cardinals of any movie. He / she made the main character impossible. He begins to be perfect with his friend at the beginning, and then gets when he gets 30, that is basically a sh * person (who has issues, etc.). Why would F feel to this person? Okay, let's say we can pass there. Jennifer Garner is almost as attractive as you can get without having some kind of damage. I don't know whether it's his fault or the author, but his behavior goes better than my despair threshold. Here is the tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-old children do not have entertainment, sad. Apart from the most shameful time in the movie they came when they played on "Thriller". The sacred rope which was bitter. It showed that he is doing these exercises at first. That explains why he knows it, but the whole club is full of people ?! Argh !!! Macarena will be more reliable! All of a sudden he has no power and no discipline how to do his work and no one is missing? Of course the behavior of Tom Hanks on the "Big" was a work that meant a child. These body / baby switches to the adult movies once come out completely, and this is far more serious yet.
