... not live in Montana and especially not live there at the end of the 19th century. Great theme, Redford performs well. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is quite a story). <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the author / writer, who is like dry, thin character like his father, preacher. For relocation, without running his own life, he is left to look at his brother, who also stumbles in a small town, losing his life. The author never even comes close to the weaknesses of his brothers, but at least he realizes, that they do not have a small amount of homor / fun. It is all, it's a flying fishing, where he follows as an old man style of his father. The end is not surprising, unseen from the beginning. <br /> <br> Certainly not a must-see (3/10) <br /> <br />
