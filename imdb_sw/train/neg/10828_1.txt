That is not just my judgment taken on this film, but also with a lot of what was written about it. Now don't get wrong here or either, not a religious expert, I did not hate the film because it was not there as 'police academy' or whatever, I enjoy most of my right part of the upper face or arty items, I swear. Magnolia is poor, and I am honestly trustworthy for what it seems to be to be praised. Long standing, self-defense, walking in breach from start to finish, there is very little that can be trusted that what people like most about films. There are other high-level executives, and no one avoids the average or worse. Additionally, my wife (who agrees with Tom Cruise himself) tells me it is a good job for far away. But the plot is not good enough, to intervene between the stories of several characters not connected to the snail speed even when important life changes are shown to be meaningful and unhappy you find yourself crying for someone to get a blow or something. It is not good that no characters are so easy to identify or feel and (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people of course). They all play their long life stories, showing their character and feelings deeply and describing their deep and meaningful relationships at the level of the most common and developing soliloquy. Yadda yadda yadda. The sound of the voice is also the same, with the same quality that triggers the marrow-suckingly which I had now unique ideas for the music of Alanis Morisette. For all, it was fun at three o'clock to be forced to check out the 'Friends' at the time of interruption in the middle of the placenta and the broken nuts of the nanny. Little and frogs are very good.
