This is the surprise of the movie, lost in the opening area (a destructive creature) a dangerous creature kills another creature in its fortress, this is considered by a scientist working on the track and guessing what he is doing, well allowing it into the castle to look at out, clear how the authors think they think that human beings have come on the same as flying in a fish tank with white white shark because it ate your gold fish ... Pretty useless and even more dumber. I can't talk about cast because it is not worth the effort. why did not run someone who wrote that once it was hidden to me .... And this kinda brain continues to the whole movie. Just good thing where cgi which is better then average for these kinda movies under budget. <br /> <br /> If these kinda things are not trouble going to see, but warn if your IQ is more than 60 you probably hate.
