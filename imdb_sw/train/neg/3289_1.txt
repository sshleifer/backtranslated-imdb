I will tell you what happened, other people with money thought it would be good to destroy one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need great screens to do again? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans could feel like they did the remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" and actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took all the music, and made the game. You think they would like that! This movie doesn't feel the same as that nature had. In fact it was originally corny sometimes, but Bo and Luke were always good, they went into trouble because they had always set up to find trouble, and the main goal was to help people who pass through the city. None of these mentioned by the people who made this film, could never have seen the original show all the way. My main question is, will destroy the next?
