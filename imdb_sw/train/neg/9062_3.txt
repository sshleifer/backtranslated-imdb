This film was different because it did not show the typical homosexual traits I had. But that does not change the fact that it does not completely storyline. I am sure there are many homosexuals who are happy to see themselves shown on the screen, because the Black players are often seen, and when they are characters they are usually not fully developed. But, it would be very difficult for a writer to actually write a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about the story it focused on. Certainly it does not seem to be an action for this film, and even though it is a small budget film, it is still not an excuse for a lack of story or plot.
