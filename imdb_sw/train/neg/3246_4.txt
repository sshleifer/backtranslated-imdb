The 'House of Games' program is the worst thing about it: the psychologist and psychological success is included in the grifters group, but in recognition of the negative part of himself that enjoys the happiness of what they are doing, eventually gets revenge. That's on the pitch: but someone needs to take on the role of it coming to work for puppets. It should be the Mamet director: Lindsay Crouse has had different TV functions and enough film, so he can not do this at all. He should go from an interesting, cool, controlled, professional, as shown by the change from the suit of the beige pants (which appears to wear for three days directly, including underwear) for floppy floral sundress. But everyone seems to speak their straight lines, the correct way; I think Mamet wants to make sure not the weapon of his interesting script was lost. Effects are damaging and damaging the privacy and insisting trying to create. Sometimes the 'House of Games' is losing any relationship with how people are involved or speaking, and it is only a way to overcome the plot. The voice sounds of the faux-jazz huts do not have any help. The end result is that the only entertainment to have is in changing the results, and as soon as you do that you will soon get bored for the robotic, two-dimensional displays. And it smokes smoke !!!
