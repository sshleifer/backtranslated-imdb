As spiritual and not a Christian. I thought that I would still hold on to my faith, but what a burden I see. I thought the film would have a great argument, but it only has one opinion from Jews and Jews ??? And who are all the street people who do not know behind their hand from their head. Where the psychologists and priests and things where they could have move from. It is not a retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. In fact, this DVD was a waste of time and not the value of my time to check whether the truth is right or wrong or if I should or not believe because the accused Christ told me so. Please think I came to the conclusion of seeking God because his own ego and demons got better. There is nothing to say the movie was so amazing to help unbelievers read this to feel better on their own. But if you really want to show the world you care about us a poor person who we believe in Jesus then hire us for your value, not beating your dancing.
