This movie started well, I felt like I was looking at Seinfeld's adult version. Very often I started questioning the nature and actions of the main characters, and I did not find the answers why they would do what they did. All acting was very good but the only event had a short time where they were really funny. Dan Cortese was wonderful. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this film to the agents of stealing. Look at the first few events and then find something better, or maybe you will find yourself completely lost in this mess. I got this in bin in the video store. I got two dollars and as a result of the understanding of this film I felt it was a good price.
