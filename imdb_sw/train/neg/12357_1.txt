I'll be short and sure. This movie was insulting to anyone who has IQ's room temperature. Sorry, ladies, women, etc. No women will be sealed. They can forget about the drafts or be in combat too. It won't happen. You see, hard to understand or accept, men and women are different from physical. In fact it is 2007, the reality cannot change things so that people don't have their hurt feelings. Men cannot be born or children of feeding (Oh-I forgot about San Franfreako). Women do not have physical ability to have men in combat or other physical challenges. How many women play on NFL or NHL? Finally, I could not give a blood hoot in hell as I wrote that motivated you. Think of it - if this hates you that only reduces my heart. I didn't write one thing that wasn't true. This non-fiction movie is not just a comedy and one lousy at that.
