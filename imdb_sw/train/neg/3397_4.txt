This film trailer loves me enough for a DVD rental document. However, the resulting movie is very bad! In fact, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it came to be closer! <br /> <br /> The main issue is the film without knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult, exciting, porn-youth? The story is interesting, because it deals with the problem of girls' emails, but the film is a mess. What begins as a fascinating “comedy” (a word that I used for the most interesting words), then it goes completely, and decreases within a very beautiful and uncomfortable surprise. Nicole Kidman should know well, and Ben Chaplin is lost! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, who I can just think did it for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad film for everything big. It's not funny, it's almost so gender that you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and great things are just too bad. Films avoided, unless you should see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
