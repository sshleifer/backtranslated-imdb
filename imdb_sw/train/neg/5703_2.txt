Everyone for a while, Disney makes one movie of thoes that surprises everyone. One that makes you wonder until the end. In the traditional Caribbean Pirates, this movie ensures that it is complete, killing and building your village. It's awesome. If you want an unreasonable movie, meaningful, predictable "movie", go ahead. I believe that young children can enjoy this, as they love when EVERY success. But I, I like movies that attack who will win. This movie does not enable bad guys to have a high hand. At the end, when the heroes are left in the "impossible to escape" hole, you know only that they can happen. Everything happens perfectly with Cage and his friends, they never think about a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how hard it is. Watch this film if you want to see interesting layout settings, not if you want to see a good acting, or a good film. Take a look at the superman film, it will be very short, and the children would like more. For example, the area where the Cage is run from weapons of arms, and all the bullets have been made with the insult of the fire escape. (And I'm not talking about fence or anything, just one example) this movie shows the impairment of the film and film industry for cheap gags and false action, which this film provides in large quantities.
