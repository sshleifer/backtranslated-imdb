For all accounts, this can be an interesting film. Featuring the cradle of the powerful Filth, with their Dan star star and having a "future fear of Britain", I expected that Alex Chandon was very happy to live his life. <br /> <br /> is not recommended. Everything about this film is cliche or inept. The description of the short story of anthology took place to die (and better) in seven and seventy years. In fact, the idea of ​​'sick room' was leading to lowering my back, but as many films were reduced by writing a bad script and acting. Chandon cannot write a discussion. Every sentence by the chief investigator is a complete brim and swear and blasphemy (eg 'cop on the edge' formula) funny, I am sure I found that elsewhere before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It looks BAD. Easily add OTT to do with a dodgy cast (do not misuse me, Dani Filth is a singer singer and musician, but the actors are not available) and the exhibition cannot lose with a sharp vein. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. The visible view is on all the poor, with the hateful CGI, the most devastating effects of the year (for good, Peter Jackson did well and that was over the last decade and below budget) and editing cookies which they use! As for often the misuse of the Cradle Of Filth ... person, they should accuse him. <br /> <br /> The basic problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself to weight, trying to create the atmosphere and stimulate fear and ignore it into its audience. Many of the most horrible films made in the seventy-thirty years are doing better with the higher financial effects (for example, maniac, animals of zombie animals, more, suspended etc.), giving the Cradle of Fear, in my mind, rate second and is heavy. I hope Chandon can learn from this ghoul of access to the film and go to a certain fear of quality that really scary. Good luck in the future.
