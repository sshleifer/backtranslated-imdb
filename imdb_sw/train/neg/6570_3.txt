I've never found a very funny Charley Chase, although its screening behavior sometimes reminds John Cleese, who I see very KIWE. (Charley Chase also reminds me of the Broow gowky from the Scotland's 'Sunday Post' page.) In the best Chase film, I have a reputation for its profession rather than laughing. I will give Chase loans that his very fine films - such as 'Power As Moose' and 'His Wedding' - have encouraged fandom who is very loyal to him ... but I am positive that even the most die-hard Chase fan agree that very early and The worst 'Marriage for Order' just isn't quite funny. <br /> <br /> Chase - desire, awkward, gormless, naff - is a little girl hoping to sleep Rose's right. Oliver Hardy provides excellent performance in this film as his father, who rejects Chase as 'mollycoddle'. Leo White, who has made the most interesting work as the Chaplin paper in Essanay, is here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is a point that involves looking for Ingersoll. I was surprised that the brand name is mentioned in the names of the discussion: this is the original example of the product placement? Unfortunately, the biggest mistake in 'Marry Amri' is made by Rosemary Theby as Rose: she has explained that the level of ingenuity, but Theby - flat, - is physically physical for the role. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as an actor of the screen, but it never was a reliable it. Film historian William K Everson dealt with him in one of his films. I will count only the 'Marriage and Imports' of 10 out of 10, and I give them helpâ€¦ because I continue to charge that Charley Chase has something that everyone gets but I get lost.
