First of all, movies were not realistic. I just saw a document a few days earlier and the movies wasn't something like that. First of all Nash was a mathematician and this is what the film should not be about a person who was healed and who found love at the end and so on. There are also many incidents that were just bad - the area where he climbed next to the bicycle in college that happened in his previous university years without his post. In my opinion Russell Crowe was not equal to this part as he does not look at the kind of individual / individual, so he could not play one. It would have been better if it had been more focused on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not more loving love. At this level ABM was also on hollywood-ish and also on that great. For the soul I think he had no madness or paranoid and was in something since the people of caliber tend to know more than we "low residents". 5/10
