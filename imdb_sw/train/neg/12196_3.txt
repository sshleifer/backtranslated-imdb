Workers did their best to play their roles - especially mother. However, as the movie continued I found I was looking more at their acting and not because I cared for the younger people. And, sometimes, I felt angry and indifferent and contraceptive methods shown again and again. Binti is a 17-year-old who did not have a passion for her life is a decoration of popular men and being a nyphette of play (full with lots of "shaking"). The boy is a very proud boy who looks very much in relationship with friends - so much that he gives us a drug club at the end of the film. Both husband and wife are suffering, but instead of putting energy in their normal relationship without looking for new partners (although the wife takes the wrong, if someone "isolates" happens to be gay --- OOPS!). I just felt that all the characters need to grow and have a hard time caring for such inferior jerks. I think the author's attempt was to show a great violation and destruction of the capitalist system. However, because these characters are not typical of the average western family, it seems to be unattractive.
