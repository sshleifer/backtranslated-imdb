I see where a few people who took part in this concept wrote a review of their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was relevant to understanding. The fact that they basically came up with excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production structure etc. - just emphasizes how bad this movie is. And my resistance in trembling is not directly but it is a warning that this does not make a cut. It looks like, but it's not right. There are holes of conspiracy in every corner, the boundaries of negotiations on ignorance, and the end is telegraphed kilometers away. The most interesting feature of the interactive hologram team enters into silent dialogue such as making food between what is supposed to be heavy and deadly to meet an unknown enemy. What? Are you delivering us a Helper Assistant Sally, among us and killed by these rope supporters? Apparently this elite team with the latest gizmos equipment and red plastic weapons are not able to reach MREs. As soon as they enter the last rooms they act more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting area. The way to meet the terrible Rook is that it cannot be directly killed. But only one event changed, the hero will make that case abandoned King to do it exactly. Huh? Vivian Woo was interesting and gave us a good attitude to act in the movie. But not to say much.
