I thought this was a very bad film - I found myself with a voice for several times of my TV. One or both husband's husband is caused; there was quite a chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he would like to kiss a dog. The movie covers their long-term relationships and torture, showing every break-up and make-up, but not developing the middle point for any detail. These reasons would have to do with some interesting characters, not to fight or make-up in the bed (even if you liked the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it does not make the film worth it. Save your money.
