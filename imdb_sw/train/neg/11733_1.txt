I am shocked that there were people who loved this film ... I saw Tribeca and many of the spectators laughed that way in the scenes that were not mentioned as funny. I felt bad because the leading actor was in the audience, but honestly the plot of this movie needed a major revision ... did not mean even, the second second question of the characters is exactly what they beat ... the area where they don't despair and think to do it? Also the end takes the cake .I can't destroy the wonderful conclusion. But it's pretty much connected to all the awesome / script plans ... see this movie for comedy as it should.
