When I first heard about "Under the World," I was very happy. I am a very good fan of Chris Rock, he was very good at Dogma. But this film proved to be desperate. Chris Rock's performance was not the same as his old performances, and the film was very much caused. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. Plays the entire movie as usual of the comedy routine. Obviously, this works well in cases where he thinks he is working, but in the remaining movie, it is not recommended. Even when speaking to another character, he seems to think he is trying to have people to laugh. He has a momentous time, but they come at a time of standing events (no wonder they decided to make his character a player). For the others who were beaten, they are very much there just to give the Rock a person to talk to, not one of them standing. Also, the film was not properly directed. The movie has essentially one plot plot: a white guy to do as a small black player. When I prefer movies and more than one joke, this would still have worked, and it has been quite amazing. The problem was, we saw the Rock and not the old man. It should be surprising because it is this white person who tells you Chris Chris's joke, but for a long time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not too close. Few cases where they decide to show us a white person speaking like Rock is, in fact, hilarious. If more displayed, the film would be a lot of funnier. Overall, a short time of laughter cannot create the fact that "Down to Earth" does not work, and is not properly addressed. This was a very good wish. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
