When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes. Then I rested to see Paul Thomas in the area with Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This seems to Jimmy (Tom Byron limited). Jimmy's Aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about her behavior and so she uses a Kay Parker. I could do without animals, play for the role of the robot, or things to interact. There is one area of ​​good sex, between Byron and Parker, but not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D +
