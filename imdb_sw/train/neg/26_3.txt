Thinking this is not the end of the direct video release, I would like to say this name at all costs. Unless you are suffering from good performances, well done, yes. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left the remaining 20 minutes, just because I didn't care anymore (on the plot, not on insulting director ... that's bad). When you can see just 5 minutes on the movie (the shot out, the fired window before any shot is removed ... then the window breaks with the first shot), things go wrong. Let's just say this is an indicator of things to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will block all information, but this is small in every way, even half-assed acting with Michael Madsen is desperate when you expect to make half of the bond from him. And the rape area ... Christ! "Close and take it" should never be used in the rape area. HOW. <br /> <br /> 3/10
