There is an explanation that one of the heroes was raped "by beating" by Russian soldiers, which is not quite true. This movie should not be shown only because of this. There is also a statement of someone, that the KGB charged "Jews, Gypsies etc.", which is "worse than Nazi". The KGB was looking for agents called "zionist", who were (KGB believed) royal agents. This is quite different from targeting the Jews as a whole nation, as did Nazi. The Jews were never judged. The KGB was a political instrument and used to politics, but from a global perspective. The Communists really did not distinguish between the nation. <br /> <br /> The entire movie rises like a fake. The great hero can not speak Russian, the sign in Berlin has a typical error, KGB looks quite general. Some of the so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely created, and the list goes on. It is not recommended to watch - this film is full of lies, and bad things. Go to "good shepherd" instead.
