That's the movie of the dumb that I've ever seen. It is lost by cast to the royal. That is James Cromwell as a deputy deputy deputy. I could continue to go on, but I would have more time on this review than anyone has ever done on the script. The only thing this movie is close to us against them and how to talk in the worst slapstick of any human tolerance of patience. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
