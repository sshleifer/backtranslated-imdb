I remember the day when Kim Basinger was nothing more than a beautiful face who had a movie with a typical Bumby Bumby characters, a romantic interest or a boy at risk. LA Confidential, and I think it is not the only one who was surprised by his good performance. However, after that time, his work did not follow the best way. on the floor), but we have never seen him again on the great character.The movie When He was out there was nothing to put him in the situation; and not only that its character is not very tasty, but also that the movie is realistic. Watching screens from this film can not be more and more basic. However, Basinger brings certain beliefs to its character, and that is caused by poor movie to win points This movie is full of clich√©s and generic criminals. This work of the director Susan Montford is really wonders for many reasons but in particular, because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone. This film makes a great sin of being terrible.
