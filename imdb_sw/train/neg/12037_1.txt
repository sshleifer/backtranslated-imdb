This series is one of the worst displays I have ever seen. Acting awesome, adverse effects, writing awesome, you get my drift. The story is very far from the story of Robin Hood is amazing. It seems like they wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract the audience. It can also be called the New Adventures of Mr. Bland doing. Somebody commented before me that if you have thoughts, you would like to show this. That is a bad approach to TV series. The media like this should persuade your mind, it should not force your ideas to do something better. That would be as part of the Simpsons where they try Homer brainwash with a movie of religious propaganda, and begins to talk about who killed who or nothing. "If the movie is boring, I just do my own story." <br /> <br /> Conclusion: completely human waste.
