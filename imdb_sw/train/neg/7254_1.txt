Who has ever written two or three reviews that were involved in the creation of this film, a word that was used freely, or opened a bank, and should end that case, I would like to return to seven dollars! Actors, again used for a long time, are bad, in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is forgiveness. The beauty and everything about this plague, we had 7 dollars to work and the day to do it. Is this done on some past? Everything about this project says, the low budget. The best executives were D list. Don't waste your time, unless of course you want to take it and try to get a rental. The evil man is seen as a punk from the 70-year-old exhibition which ended with his grandmother's wife. My inside video block storage lists this as a returned video and sad definition. Even if you lease 99 cent this flick collects dust. One must have a certain debt. This is the top stinker and I give 10 marks.
