There are two reasons I have not given 1 to this film. One reason is some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh), who tried to play at their normal level of action. However in many cases they were somehow blocked by bad scripting. Another reason is a good idea and look at the Cyborg, which is quite different from many other roles I have seen now. Everything else in this film is as bad as it can be. Boring events, inappropriate and stimulating conversations, a bad job of the script. And it looks like it was the first movie ever for many actors. It can be a fascinating story though, but they were completely defeated.
