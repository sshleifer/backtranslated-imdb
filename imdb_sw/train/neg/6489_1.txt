What seemed like a good premise for the film ... unfortunately fails to give almost every level. Very hard to follow at the beginning of the movie I found myself fighting against the desire to wipe out a major problem from the point of view is the fact that the camera function is only about top and most "arty" splicings and half-reduced subliminal in a movie that actually keeps you from the story general. In fact you are trying to baptize at this time and build the end of the celebration but the movie has a very large half of the pregnancy and the underlying script makes us desperate and frustrated because they tried to go too much.
