Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. It's not as deep as it wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another in the type of film about trouble making film. The movie star is employed to complete the 60-sci-fi movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Consider Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. But Jeremy Davies is a filmmaker. Hack he is an artist. The movie he wants to do is a diary of his life. It was not original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside the film film Jeremy Davies are thin as rice paper. Characters that may be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann if the hack director is brought and then displayed the door without adding something. This game is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust or 8 1/2 films are the same for comparison. The movie is interesting, stimulating and developmental characters. The movies have lessons that are used out of it / knight but only its derivative and no one funny place. Film workers cite it to send but what is the purpose of satirical? Vendors say it is a ritual but I think I would like a full version of Codename length: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is easily charged with the environment as shown by the visual humidity of the sci-fi film in the film. But he cannot share why we should be hated. <br /> <br /> Besides the sci-fi movie is just a mess. There are persistent errors, the film manufacturer selects the sci-fi weapon after being selected. When? Just because he has a place where a film player is faced with critics complain about a lack of stories, a lack of confidence, a place where he accepts an inexperienced cunning does not mean he has dealt with these views. I think if your Roman coppola can leave and make a film about a filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say and so says saying nothing. For this can be considered as autobiograhical. I would look at the City Cycle on a TV wall if I had a choice. See Codename 15 minutes: Dragonfly movies included on DVD as extra and then send back.
