Do not be deceived as I had 'breathe' views mentioned in the DVD box. "Wild entertainment.", "Freakout of terrible", and worse, "SEE AND JAWS." This movie is not above. I usually do not bother to write a bad review of the film but I can't believe this stays on 7 at IMD. Not suitable. After a very high attack on the day by an attack by, it is another, chemical spilled by lazy scientists, this film goes completely anywhere and goes to sloooowly. Essentially and in some cases, a girl is beaten by a monster (I will give points to the beautiful design of the creation but this is not the creation of WETA) and her half-comical family monitors an hour and a half to track her down ... in sewage near the Han River. Their search is no longer doubted, someone who calls this by column and Jaws? -And when they find you you find that they were all very inappropriate. More than that, the majority of the movie is the intention of the government's quarantine that reaches one exciting area that involves pouring the saliva on the front of the bus stop. This was bad. I have not given birth. Want to see a movie of the decay of monster? Use Speed ​​Run. You will surely save 30 minutes of your life.
