This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is mainly due to the absence of true (as an open agent as a bank loan officer when he clearly demonstrates that he is talking to someone through a wire or area where scientists think it is safe to enter the room where the virus is given even though it 'did not get the best host'). it does not mean that it will never be found), cheap sets (the bank looks like it was locked in proportion to the shaft), and the worst acting. It is the story of the organized crime group that has made the successful capsule of the virus viral. However, the chief who decides to wipe it from the bank deposit box, does so at the same time the heist bank goes down, for the same FBI agents have been informed of this, and at the same time trembling with a terrible earthquake. Of course, after this earthquake is a mess in more than one way. However, the results do not work for the film that is doing, but instead, one that has been definitely z-grade junk since the beginning of the film. (Maybe this is why some screens capture on the installation of the installation to create with computer graphics rather than actual screens from various films. What? Hell Ron Perlman was doing in this, I don't know. I wonder if he was ashamed to be in it as I was looking at.
