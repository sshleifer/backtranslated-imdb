The Phantom Mall is the most suitable film in the "neglect" group. It is a good lousy variation in the popular story with Gaston Leroux, Phantom's Opera. It's not a bad idea for itself, but the plot and production of this film is a weak way to bring honor to the story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux is not worth turning to his grave yet. It can be worse. <br /> <br /> The Phantom of Mall has many of the many barriers of meaning in it and many ways of boring make it memorable. Also, journalists wanted to give more drafts to stories than they needed. And although there are a lot of secrets to build on the character of Eric ... the basic plot is common and ready-vu. *** SPOILERS *** It is about young couples who brutally burst because the boy is killed by fire. The fire was kept in his home because he and his parents refused to sell their homes so they could replace the building of the building. The boy survived the fire and hid in the revenues to take revenge. At the same time he protects the girl who is now working at the mall and tries to forget her loss **** Although it should only be a terrible movie of entertainment, it tries to be surprising to the mind ... and not the fans they are looking for. There are several creative killings but they don't have enough satisfaction for people who want to see a movie of fear of rest. And more, Phantom's Mall can be used at least a bit of humor !! All this production - included included - takes the very way. <br /> <br /> I'll try to finish with a few good things ... As for example, star Ken Foree !! Fearful fans will know that Peter is on the Night of the Dead! That's a terrible step that still needs to get the same. Although his role in this movie is limited and absolutely not needed ... it was good to see him again. Film filmmakers will also know Morgan Fairchild to be the mayor, he is a good actress and elegant woman. Pauly Shore is also in this but I can not stand ... so my thoughts on it may be a little interested. And finally, a small character for a leading actor named Kari Whitman. She is a very beautiful girl and she has a little talent ... very bad did not make it up. True, this film is its great achievement and which says enough about its work ...
