I say I had a great desire to watch this film, and it was considered as a major disaster when it was released by the 20th century Fox in 1970. It has also grown on several lists of bad film critics, and this has only increased interest, if I just needed to see what this film it was very bad. In seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I say it makes it to look at the wise, acting, manual, and script is so amazingly bad, that satire thought it is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to take a film, but after the opening of the opening of the sex change operation, the film goes too far into a hill that cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he relaxes and leers on the screen, sometimes it seems like he asks himself he does there. Rex Reed bounces around like Myron, Myra change ego, and even has its own celebration masturbation area. Bravo for the first show! Farrah Fawcett plays dumb blonde; he actually appeared to influence in this role. But, of course, certainly the role of the bad reputation went to Mae west. In front of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face doing sex was considered more suitable for a terrible film. I don't mean to put this self-cast; but in this film, no one comes to look good. The trend seems uncertain and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but also interesting. Draw old films of old stars, and the movie becomes more outdated. For everyone to anyone who enjoyed this, and I was happy to have at least noticed, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be a tragedy that has been identified as from the beginning.
