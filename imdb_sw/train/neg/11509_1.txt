I don't know what some of you are smoking cigarettes, but I am witnessing it well. <br /> <br /> To call the Departure to Horror will be hate for the very thought of fear. Acting is hideous and not taking Madonna here, we all know it is not good, but someone should warn everyone that his disease is infectious. My foot hurts very much from fighting too much on unsupported verses. The order is sad, you are asking for details. Photography and composition (which at this time, the skill should be WAR for any film and budget) is very strange, even the lights are extraordinary and unusual. These are the basic features of the film, if you can't find the right, you should look for another job. It seems like the production of 3 of Snow White, except the nearest place to be made or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original movie with Lina Wertmueller is a good satire and model, superly acted and written, with a picture of breathing - you can make a taste of sea salt and feel the sandy sand in your hair. Sexual tension feels realistic and quick ... those who have seen the version of Guy Ritchie's sad, should see it, is actually one of the symbols of the world movies. Those who thought remake are some kind of Catholic should be examined by your head.
