I tried to stay with this bomb not too long. What is the disaster? The work was bad. They were some of the incredible action events that fell flat like a balloon of bullets. This was mainly due to the fact that the effect of executives only did not sound realistic. From what I could suffer through, there is nothing compelling in this movie. But, you know, being just, it's not the fault of anyone really. I mean, I'm sure the script was hit in the first explosion. LOL.it is likely to end up this time when it goes. But for me, I do not agree to spend at least three days to find out.
