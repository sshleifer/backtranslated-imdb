This was bad. Andie Macdowell is an awesome actress. So, the wood makes a horse of a rocking looks like it can work better. But keep in mind that turning into four Wedding, evenly as interesting. Another film showing the UK as full of cottages of Chocolate box, and the village week. I mean that school, how many schools are away and maybe Hogwarts looks like that? The Twee Police Station was seen as a heart attack (a series of British nausea set in 60 years). This film was not able to concentrate on what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious investigation into the friendship of women. If it had been stuck to the old then the sex scenes of the grave and the very evil of the wedding might have worked (only). But these events did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also see that it is impossible that Kate could talk to Molly again after her bad behavior. Remember the last - is an honorable actor like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the advertising wrinkle cream.
