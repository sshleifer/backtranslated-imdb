I do not recognize the high level of Haneke's high-quality film making. For example, I am enjoying its decrease in the normal-normal circumstances of the day as a powerful way to force strong sense of origin. However, in connection with the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a need for pathological regulatory-presentation or feelings (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with his mother is modern-day as the isolation and misunderstanding they have seen with Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way, understandable; he looks like he is mad, or if he was monk, come!) . I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's the opposite of ignoring the issue if it's something of "freakish" or pathological; it is not. In general, films related to this issue have been back in time. Therefore, for me, I feel that this film ends up as a full-scale film, concern and modern modern theory (isn 't is close to shame?), And that is not associated with real life and experience of those involved in D / s (personal experience, forums, irc talks and recent scholars' studies will show this).
