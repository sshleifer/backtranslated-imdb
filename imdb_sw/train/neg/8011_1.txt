In fact I had to have different films from other speakers on this site because during the filming last night the audience had been stricken with dialoge which (I never even made it) half-way. As shooting as a filmmaker thought he was approaching a new skillful area by presenting the old story of homosexuality, the film uses David Lynch led by Fassbinder inspired career. The exhibition in this film is very simple and exhausting that I thought one of the participants would be lost and how they were not interested they seemed to have a script. Anything more is that it is colored as part of the Vice Miami. I don't know who the director thinks he is; Maybe he has surreal displays like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the directors mentioned earlier show the level of erudite that is not here. I was able to understand the meaning of this film about ten years ago, but when we get training such as Bad Teachers, Awesome Skin and Shows Why are you worried by this movie turd? Nothing new is shown here.
