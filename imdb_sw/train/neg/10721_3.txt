Traveled by Captain Captain (Mark Dana) goes to the Valley of Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to the previous trip. They meet with very good Simia (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. Recently they find themselves suffering from bleeding blood ... and Simira only seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Snoozer real. I found this on the TV night TV when I was almost 10. I slept! See it again all these years later I can see why. It is slow-moving, mummy does not even show up to 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), Between the worst acting (Dana) to the worst REAL (George N. Neise) and no abuse or blood found. This movie focuses more on the second level of interest (which includes a third piece of love) than fear. These three levels because it looks very good, everyone plays the same, there is a good acting from Diane Brewster, it's short and the events of the mummy attack (both) are not bad. They do not just look gently creepy. Still, this film is very bad. Mark the point of fire for sleep.
