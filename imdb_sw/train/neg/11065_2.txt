This movie was most likely. Anyone who has followed Jeffrey's story knows that there is a lot of information ignored in this film is wise. Most of the time and effort spent on movies in Dahmer storms and its use of alcohol. Where was the character development? The nature of any woman is always interesting and Dahmer did not discriminate. Where in the movies describes his youth when he began to kill and strengthen small animals? Instead we give the diving ideas to try to describe the nature of the killer, but they cannot handle the main steps in the development of Dahmer. Also, the reason why the country was so amazing and this story was an explanation - how he put the bodies in his house with the length and the steps he went to complete this; its destruction and desire for the body, etc.. I could go on, but in fact, many photographs in the film, were based on his selfishness and not enough - good things you expect to see when the movie head is "Dahmer."
