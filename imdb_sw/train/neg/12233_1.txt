I don't see just how Concorde-New Horizons directed by Jim Wynorski and in conjunction with Andrew Stevens's talent and pussy. That convinces the mind, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's make any mistakes about it. "Munchie facing" is actually a bad film. Munchie is a pingu who has been around for centuries. For reasons that are not fully explained until the end of the film, it is sent to the world to help one mother and her child. Mother's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due to her credit in two weeks ... for a small tune of $ 20,000. Ouch. He cannot come with money because he has just run away. Okay ... JUST is a key word in that sentence. What ...? What? Was he planning to pay for the same charge? Maybe it would have been a good idea to spend several years ago by thinking ... thinking? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to those of which genie would have ... but there is no limit on the number of wishes you can do! Munchie finds a young group of fancy things for one night but the child begs to return to Munchie's shops was "boring" from. The art of hate also uses his other skills to help the boy win the baseball game through a cheating way. A baseball is hit so hard that it faces the World several times. Unfortunately, those single parents looking at the game do not think it is strange. Hmm. However, I would like to close this because this has already deleted enough for my power as it is. You will be led to the fact where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, motivates the dog that comes to her. Your heart will melt in its charm when she sees the dollar bills around her front yard and asks how it could be snow during the summer. "Buying Munchie Returns Back" promised another film to follow the right, I believe, "Munchie Hangs Ten". So far, the public viewing film has been changed to what has really been a powerful movie tour. Heh. 1/10
