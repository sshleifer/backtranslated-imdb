Pay the flicks coming a few and far between now days, so when I heard on the Ward I was very optimistic and I heard good things about it. The good things I heard were bad. This flick is bad and I mean BAD. It's just plain ignorance. Everything about it. Especially the nature of the killer and how he lives and how he is maintained at the end. There is nothing original or not about this flick. Just wannabe slasher and those "Hip," "Awareness." "Movie characters". I am sick of that crap. Someone does something different because the type of slash requires new blood, in fact.
