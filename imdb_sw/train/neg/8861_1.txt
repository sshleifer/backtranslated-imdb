The horrible fear of "Praying". This takes Karen's funeral (killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee depressed) comes there and tells Karen's brother (Reb Brown) that Karen was a girl. Goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) head waswolf. Ben and the Karens employee (Annie McEnroe) are joining her. Wrong script, bad trend, inappropriate editing and Brown and McEnroe automatically impress this. The effects of waswolf are kept in the dark - for good reason! They are awesome when you see them. Give special effects too - though I was like the cartoon electricity comes from the fingers of Danning. There is also an orgy of waswolf which is especially stupid and Danning takes off at least eight times during the fast install! There are a few things - I have found the incredible Transylvania village - it looks like coming from the Universal flick of fear from the 1930s! There are interesting tricks of cameras between transition events; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at this - but they can't save it. True - WHY did they do it? Where are those who are struggling with money? This is one of the most tested movies of IMDb. That alone should tell you something. Definitely Danning feared when he saw the movie - I can understand why! You must miss.
