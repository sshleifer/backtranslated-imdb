I would like to pass this title 15 or 20 times during Blockbuster, looking for a half of the respect to watch. All I can say is that they were all out-of-night films that I have chosen to rent this. <br /> <br /> I will give them credit to have a higher rate and better than "Dracula 3000", but actually pretty easy to say since this was not a Caper Van Dien in it. Other things that had no events were: a fascinating story, interesting story, good discussion and originality, but I think you can't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** HAI *** Unsuccessful students of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire ... go to the figure) jumped from a mining colony to a mining colony trying to wipe vampires all can get. Employees include: a kitchen captain, a good old man (who dies early), his to-book, still has no first experience, a vampire farmer of a vampire (not typo), a cowboy wannabe and a fully, fully composed Asian, "boy The tough "female" is almost as the MTV's "True World" sound. After the captain dies in a violent fight with a group of damusuckers (and as seen, lovers of good parts of human anatomy) his first wife takes ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates .. Blah, blah , blah ... I could continue, but as I said it is the same story used in some of the other 'films'. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is more than me. The vampire farmer of the vampire (still not typo) was very good, but of course if you wait for him to disclose more of his purity, look elsewhere. I can't say that it was the worst movie I saw, as I hired 'Starship Troopers 2', but this waiting to come to the Sci-Fi Channel.
