I was interested in this movie as flick trashy cannibal. I was desperate. it was the same kind of desire that I saw 'on the 13th day: jason takes manhattan'. The most likely to lose! <br /> <br /> The opening area is a great priority. then it breaks down. The lovely milk and the style of the 80s exhibition can not help this movie. The only things that eat near this island of cannibal monks are piranha! I don't know the 'burnt rate of cancer' of the year, but I sought the lowest cost of the year's spending. I've never had that thing. I have seen a number of episodes of the most violent fighting, so two stars. I don't think it's very important when it takes a look at it, though. I was able to show it to a party where nobody cares about what is going on and just want something in the chest. but I won't tell anyone, "oh, dude, you GOTTA see this film." is not good or insufficient to make sure.
