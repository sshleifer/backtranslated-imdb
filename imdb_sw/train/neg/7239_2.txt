This film is announced as a romantic intellectual comedy. It is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not the best comedy. The luck of a good and surprising character, "Tom", breaks down with one disgrace with another. The only gifts of saving are the ability to perform and Tone Collete and rotation that we see the face of Paltrow's delightful. In general, avoided!
