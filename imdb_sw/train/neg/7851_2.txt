As it has been said many times, "Mountains With Eyes 2" is not a reference (commonly unsatisfactory) in the mid-80s and the end of 1977 of Wes Craven. But those who want to give this last post forming, restoring the official refunds, Craven himself (two threats with his son, Jonathan) have decided to write the same quality film - in plain language, HORRIBLE. Former video music director Martin Weisz takes the muscles from Alexandre Aja, and looks clear on his head - but someone is wondering how anyone could create a film that can be seen from Cravens' Screen writing scrawl 101. Not just characters (in this case , the National Goofball National Guard (wo) men were sent to explore the mountains of the nature of the remake of the natural nature of the horrible and confronted with barriers that have strong obstacles (played without hanging, considering you), but it is a regular joke who is not funny. After looking at their general lack of exercise during exercise, their fate against violence, emerging travelers is very obvious. It is only this time - as was the original '80s' - the script is very simple (it is impossible to exist, in fact) that any strangled subtext is beaten against the ante cancellation for a shocking shock (we have been cured by birth-born birth during credit opening, with free rape for those who have not left the DVD to midpoint!). Even the mixture in this withdrawal is humanitarian freaks - ineffective, the color of the appearance of rubber FX looks, like all the film, trying to hide his face from shame. In fact I checked the "surprise" crash at the end of Aja's best alternative film, and manufacturers go completely to break at the end of "Hills 2," and set the step - KIJA step by step three-phase ... yet Cravens and Weisz they have created a film that is the stupidity of what made the 1977/2006 versions that would make it harder for them to get the audience after the scandal of the face.
