Thank you God! I did not lose my rental money but downloaded! This happens to be the worst film that I've ever seen in all my life, f ***** g the effect of seeing, gore and unnecessary dirt! In addition to other Zombie movies like Dead Dead Dead and others. There are a lot of holes and errors in the film. If you get time after reading these comments, please see the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I have personal information why this film is like this, I mean that every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a score between 1 and 2. And now I'm not ready to find films that are led by him, but I can finish this all by saying one strong sentence. Even for pleasing or passing time or even in a very stimulating manner please see this MOVIE.
