The story with Norman Maclean is the main task; Redford Film is a mediocrity. He adds the banal events of the Maclean brothers going on the cliffs and they have twice dating in the seedy bar which did not even explained in the story. The player, Brad Pitt, trying to play the surprise Paul Maclean, an experienced foreigner, shows that it looks or sad, according to what the original story intended. Some of the throwing events are good. Also, Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer like Norman are strong with men, as men are expected to be immediately. None of the women makes sense in the film, which is sad, because Maclean loved women in her story and made plainly, even poetic.
