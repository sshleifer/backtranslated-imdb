After watching this film, I felt the need to force a little talk of my confusion. Selma Blair is a good model, who is now played by actress and Max Beesley was rather interesting in "Kill Me Later". That story, when not previously, gave some promise. None of them even important ... even less. I don't know what he is doing, but Dana Lustig's director has no talent as a director. Reduced lower tips, walking on foot pictures, turning pictures, used for non-colored camera angles, using color filters, reduced speed reductions, exploded and returned to the time line and left off the modern voice "modern" of bunking junk. I can't remember the last time I saw an incomplete job of leading the film. Its ego must be great to stop work and stories and set its direction forward to the audience audience center. Facing their throat. <br /> <br /> There are a few beautiful events in "Kill Me Later" which shows what can and should be. Unfortunately, as soon as things start to show the promise, Mrs Lustig would dig into her pocket of the school's tricks and spread things. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had a good chemistry and you can tell them that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
