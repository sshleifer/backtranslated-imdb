ORCA is not too bad, but not at the end of Richard Harris either. As a businessman, fisherman like Ahab's fisherman, Harris enters the death game with a whale to kill the whales and the unborn child. Charlotte Rampling has a whale expert who deals with Harris. He asks for a lot about the importance of leaving nature alone. He does not hear and somehow end in the battle of the wrestling war whale. There are no special effects of speaking except what looks like a round glass for the whale's eye â€” there are endless shots of Harris emerging in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew is running very fast with Orca and many supporters, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn are not doing very well.
