This was a bad movie. Essentially Jane Machi was a half Korean North Korean player who was sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible for American troops in South Korea. She becomes a slave to the US military family, all looking at her even though she looks more white (I believe the actor is 1/4 or 1/8 South-East Asia, not the Korean), and a young house-house begins to hate and finish sleeping. him. Korean military and U.S. Korea is fully displayed. Of course, the author of the photo and the director were exposed to white people who had never used the day of Korea before this movie and did not intend to show any understanding of life in Korea for Koreans or the GI and instead tried to fulfill their fantastic fantasies of We don't live no matter how amazing the film. Anyone who has ever gone to Korea will know this is trash. In the end, the Korean Korean girl of North Korea is murdered, for the most part, "paying for her sins" way. Very bad film and pretend-to-TV feel.
