Liked it. If you believe that every South African is dumb, morally free, stupid, violent, religious seeds, or a child molester, then this film can be yours. Everyone is poor and seems to not know. In one area, two older men are talking in a common shop and one says that he had hated a set of sisters before connecting their shoes. The man seemed to be proud of his actions, and someone else exposed it as a normal part of life. Very good. The little girl walks back the road looking for her sister and no one helps her - despite the disappearance of food and water (no bottles, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only a disgusting and fascinating nature, but is shown to be a religious believer who (usually for Hollywood) reflects the bad nature of Christians. The part of the film reminds them of the end of Cape Fear (one and DeNiro) - Bible texts that are being played by a bad person. I am from Northwest West, but I've got this offensive film because of the strange people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc..
