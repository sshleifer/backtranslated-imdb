Perhaps I am out of date or do not know what Electra is like in the current publications ... But Electra that I read was more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. He often used others to do his dirty work and more often than certain types of cross were involved. Only when you think you've done all that has made the wool on your eyes and find its way. <br /> <br /> This movie was too weak for discussion, acting was not particularly persuasive, and the action was spotted. I was looking at something more in the book of Frank Miller "Electra Assassin." Which is more dark than anything in this film. <br /> <br /> Special effects where cool, action was interesting sometimes, but more often than the story and plot was slow or useless. Tha hand did not have enough risk, and Electra was not ..... enough mix. She is a girl you like to love ... but in this story, I didn't care any way.
