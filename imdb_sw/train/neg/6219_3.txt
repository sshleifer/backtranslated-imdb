When LICIE MAGIC was opened in the City's Radio Radium, I was very foolish to believe it would be like a warm heat like some of the first Lassie films were. Not so. The story was bad, the Sherman brothers' songs were under their normal level, the characters were not strong with JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had seen the best day. <br /> <br> Also, I was willing to see what the contribution of ALICE FAYE would have been, for she was not there from the screens for many years and was often coming into her original responsibilities on Fox. Alice also, was repetitioned by a foolish script and unhappy photography. Other desires. <br /> <br /> Nothing was originally here, there is no far more interesting for an adult to enjoy - and clear, no gift for anyone. You can fly this without missing something.
