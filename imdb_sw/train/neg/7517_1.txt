*** One of the Ten Stars *** *** Because if it was, it gets F. Holy Mother of God was bad. I mean, I gave every reasonable accommodation based on the fact that it is directly on the video film, but let me on every side. Like many B movies, the basic story was respectful and the artists seemed to have a good resource level, but implementation was worried. It is their shame to put the name of Halloween with this fiasco. The basic premise revolves around the pockets of horse pockets in their pockets of the annual hall of the house, while the dirty book of Satan shows no place and strikes the male boys into hell. That's any idea, but instead of many films they offer to show the boyfriend's boyfriend, full of lesbians. A little bit of real story is devoted to Halloween or a wonderful book of spell. In fact it makes me mad that the creators of the film thought they could stop and make such a dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about the boy's relationship. This is not what the film is like. I am tempted to monitor producers and at least end up for physical harm. Acting is as bad as it gets, it's angry! Script is not recommended without fun. Style is just too lazy. The whole film is an amateur night. This scenario makes the production of SyFy movie production appear to be like the screens. The last half of the film's time felt like the creators of the film found that they did not produce a soap opera and they had to give it to some kind of terrible system. The last book of evil comes and it takes everyone in the haunted house into their dressed fashion. I almost feel like crying as I write these reviews. Wow! I mean yes! This was a disaster.
