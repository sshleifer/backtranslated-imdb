There has been a lot of love laid in the "Wonderful Mr Fox" of Wes Anderson, unfortunately all love is for himself. In fact, there has been a lot of time and effort put in place to make it a very special world but only if at the same time and efforts are put on the script to try and make it funny. The worst thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. <br /> <br /> Animation is good at close-up shots of animals, even when the camera is far away everything becomes very hard in the eyes and it seems to be honest as a bit of mess. There was nothing special about acting or, and Wes decided to choose its partners and great names on specialized voice actors who could make them well. I am sure that George Clooney's voice of work includes two that were seen in South Park, one of which played a dog. The movie is bad and try a very hard way to be clever and different and it is normal, despite the film in England, all good animals are common American baseball players, while bad boys are modern English and accents the most insulting English. I can't stress how much time this film is. I did not laugh at once.
