This is one very caused movie. Even though the boys deserved some of the things they were given ..... the evil killings were "little" up. The only character that expresses a certain conscience early in the hunt was killed off before giving help to a sad plot. At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be a promise of good things, but this was a way to convince viewers to be a false impression, before the fun of what came. The only thing that can save the movie to me is if Jack Nicholson had gone out of the bushes and said, "and, where are the fighters?". Kim Basinger could shout. <br /> <br /> Now that would be cool!
