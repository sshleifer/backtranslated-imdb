All these vendors and the following Matrix. <br /> <br /> I liked the original Matrix. It was not a comprehensive movie, despite the efforts of Fishburne's elaboration, but it was very good, enjoying it, and I had a soft spot for the Hong Kong fight. Anderson. For the day, the corporate drone, and the night, the hero hacker. Finally, he finally has to choose between this life by his actions - Does he become a fighter against the machine, or he returns to the world safely, forgetting what he started. Surprisingly, he finds that once it is the sound of symptoms, life rather than sucks. She has her girl on her side with her companions, but eats processed, clothes in sweats, and lives in a really odd machine. However, the truth makes free. Of course the fun part of the first movie has found the "questions like me" made in the view of the viewer. What if _I_ they could not afford? What if I "One". It doesn't even mean that you are One example of what, and a cold head like that. <br /> <br /> Additionally, the Smith Smith made a very good man, for he was afraid of the authority that we carry with us. He was as unqualified as a layout, and had no mercy. At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to Matrix to share its good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This movie completely fails to execute on the ideas of the original movie, and it does so for lack of gusto, texts as poor and poor editing that I can't believe they had made this change. When the conversation is on the fifth grade level, and the long-term words have dropped randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of failure of attributes: <br /> <br /> Oracle comes from mild benefits, if it is a delusion for the absolute restriction without real cause. The “main” article of matrix is ​​brought without a need - a leader, for example, was a good idea, but not just an interesting character. Fishburne loses its role of "counselor", and does not get anything to replace it. The people of Zion do not actually have the proposed, nor will they surely be required to flee the world. <br /> <br /> Problems of special effects: <br /> <br /> Fighting events were useless and can be used. In Matrix, you saw that Neo could lose, and that he had something bigger to survive. In Matrix Reloaded, he is just a characteristic view of the game especially bad video. problems. <br /> <br /> As I said above, fighting events could not interfere. Rave continued for a long time - everyone my series on the playground was watching at them. Not because we think playing well with good bravery, but because we didn't know about the people displayed, we didn't care. Anything that has been written by the creator's name should be a choice from business. It was understood, the words that the author did not understand clearly, and it was a waste of time with a pacing killer. The creator's speech could be carried out in the tenth part at that time, and more dangerous as "Zion is there to give the rebels a chance to go and not destroy the Matrix." Now there are many people who do not believe, the matrix is ​​in danger of destroying and killing everyone who will face it. In addition, the world cannot support even the people of Zion, not only leaving these others. You can choose one person from Zion to create a new Zion, when I delete it People's records now in Matrix. "Instead, we have found a long, given group. If someone says that it is deep, ask them a copy, and try to break the sentence. Each one is very tall and several passages, and uses words for a short, concise. <br /> So, in summary, it is not worth seeing it. It looks like a third, and despite the number of critics they have said, jump. It does not save this turkey. A viewers who feel that the second and third movies were "deep" should be able to see some detailed movies. Perhaps reading a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and perhaps a little philosophy. This movie is not hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach. br /> <br /> Scott
