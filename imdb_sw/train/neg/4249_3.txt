I did not even know that this film is available until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was wandering on a Trinitarian board when I saw a certain user explaining how the Wes Craven series was best then 'decorate' it Blade, So I did my fast research : You saw a mark on IMDb & RottenTomato for Dracula: Rise, and somewhere in the search I saw that this is a Dracula 2000 layer. I saw it. Now let's take it quickly here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I do not like it very much, and then I see Dracula's scores: The rise only reduces my expectations even more, but again, I am the kind of person who needs to watch the movie itself (any movie) so I can create my own opinion. Several things I went to know when I was watching this movie is that it is a small budget, because of it, I'm going to ignore a lot of v / fx and just a figure will be supported by stories and act, I had a little feeling and some hits on this film (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez? This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I've found it pretty fricken laughable, bad audio synch record from record recording in FEW FEW, ignorance of characters in this movie. Of course they all knew about the floods and some of the basics, Luke even had a book on it, but did it prevent those who did not want to get 'infected'? No, this is very bad then climbs where the girl should go out of the swimming pool and see the noise she hears without anything more than the fabric. <br /> <br /> I also have to 'laugh at some time, because I don't know how' Dracula 'dressed up on her body, especially since she is wild and angry and I think if I was in that situation, I don't want to be she dressed. <br /> <br /> So the film ends like any movie trilogy? is not suitable, instead is 'Cliff Hangar' where I now wait for the third 'Urban' phase. Oh worth the entertainment of Cheesy movies.
