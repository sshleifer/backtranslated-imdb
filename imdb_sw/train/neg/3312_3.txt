... but I am sad after seeing it. Since the IMDb level is high (and should also be high on Netflix), I think I put it in my queue because it is announced as a gentle comedy from the UK, a group that produced the most popular films. "Save the grace," on the other hand, is in a non-combustible comedy category that consists of Hollywood movies produced and led by the powerless. Brenda Blethyn is a powerful actor, and I loved him in other movies. Concept - gardener growing marijuana in order to overcome the pensa he sees himself struggling with the death of her husband - is not wrong with me. Although the strongest effort to give us a sense of humor, the film falls on his face (falling flat on his ass can be funnier) if I and my wife were worried. To witness, oh a gentle reader, not all who lose British comics will succeed. This is dud.
