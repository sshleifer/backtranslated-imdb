Saturday night **** Saturday Night *** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Morning Monday <br /> <br /> The US Army has just started a new new war war that can avoid detection different from any other. The senior trial (Steve Touissant) is stealing and placing the US government to redeem it. So they are forced to send to their best friend John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, instead of his freedom from the detention center where his thoughts should be deleted all the information he learned for years. I went down the Power of Attack because I could say from the cover and produce every post that produced that would be a desperate and when all the negative comments and the low level of user came into it proved what I thought. But I decided to give the FOF to go because Shadow Man (for the same director) was not bad and, what hell, Seagal was my favorite star once and maybe, maybe maybe he could make a good film again. Oh what a fool I was. Response to awesome stock exchanges of jets of airplane jets, bad work cameras, cheap production standards, visible, do not accept combat events that have become a trademark of Seagal and attractive, sleep conspiracy which does not go anywhere. Thank you for his next film, Once When in the Hood (which I will decrease), it seems to be the last sign of his contract with Sony, for no more of these awesome European films and his next film The Prince of the pistol may imply a return to the cinema. Hell, he has done so before and Stallone will be able to do that before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a Fury Bird. It's not a fun flight. It's a bird that can't even turn off. *
