This was my first, and maybe the last movie of Angelopoulos. I was interested in entering it, as it was Mastroianni, one of the favorite actors and was film By Theo, who has heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot on the jeep of soldiers in the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had huge holes and I don't know what to mention first. The main character of the story is revealed to the journalist and the old woman. during a long walk. It is about 15 minutes, killing characters and patient viewers, nothing going on the screen for 15 or 20 minutes, except for the old woman telling you a story. All that is thought to be displayed through the action, was told only by the camera and the old woman. For a short time, the equippe of the TV was moving towards the bar. They turn the corner and once the winter begins! Probably, shoot in a different day, continue to continue. Many problems with the story of the story, came out of ignorance and impatience never connected to the style, making the viewer ask questions that had no answers. Poor mastroianni, was given a role that was not integrity or charm. On the other hand, if many Greeks or Albanians or the people of Balcan agree, the movies show a lot of historical, tribal, or inaccurate, for making films about "humanity" as red in other reviews. More a lot to say, but there is no time to lose on the bad movie, which was not a movie at all, but a man's lunch is interesting on the film and paid for government funds.
