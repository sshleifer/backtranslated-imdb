When I went and saw this film, I was optimistic. But I was very wrong. This movie was very similar to all other awesome movies. It's viruses, zombies etc.. Especially as a bad Resident with many movies. But unlike this, and other movies, it is that the story is very week. It is bad actors and boring music. The picture is the same but the break is a total spoil. Do not see this movie "fear", go and see the Ring of 2 or any movie that is more stories. I hope they will stop making the terrible movies that have viruses and viruses that spread and make people zombies. We've seen enough for that. The only thing in the movie is when they stand on the roof and blow the famous celebrities, infected.
