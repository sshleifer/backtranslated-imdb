I watched this film for two hours and I don't know exactly what it is. Someone was killed or maybe they were not perhaps someone did that or maybe they were not. This has led to the memory of the good old days (the worst days of the past). Recently stinkers have been different but this hodge confused podge of trendy feminism, mind reeling flash backs and mumbled conversations makes for the time lost. I've never seen the books of Margaret Atwood easy to read. This film develops that the good traditions of Canada. Not easy to check. Perhaps people who are found in Toronto's cooking parties pretend they liked it. We people in boonies are less less engaging.
