Now, I'm one to watch movies with new ideas, and say, "Hmm ... this is not bad!" I loved Cable Guy, and I thought that my Big Fat Independent Movie was good. Remember, I have not begun to look at this with great optimism, but I thought that maybe ... maybe maybe ... it would be somehow bad I could laugh. I was wrong. At any time during my suffering through this "film" (And I spend that little time) I was even closer to being gentle. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I love rap music, but as far as I can say, the Amish priest would make the rapper better than he did. The main character only burns, and is not a character that is easy to love. Frankly, I would like to eat a gred turd out of the blood of Harlequin's fetus than to look again.
