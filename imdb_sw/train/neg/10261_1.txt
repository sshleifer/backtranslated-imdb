Wow, I just seen on the T.V. as one of the "scary" movies that show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There was nothing to make this film scary, or to watch. Also, some people say this is a spoof, but I don't think so. For spoof, you need something called "humor". This low-budget film has not had a sense of humor, and it did not make much sense, either. You basically have a monster to watch (someone in a ball suit) to come out of the lids, kill people, I think, for you will never see a monster doing violence to anyone or after the blood. The emerging newspaper tells you that people were killed by a monster, so I think that's enough. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The attempt attempt to kill a monster, which is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad purpose. Then the military forces! Wow, did this film make U.S. what does it seem to be sad or what? The animal, when hard to kill, does not do much rather than move and move around. O, and often the second head comes out of the mouth and shrieks. It was a little interesting, but the total alien visitor. What was it with a scientist who plays Xylophone to attract a monster? It was difficult to understand a lot of conversations due to non-sound quality. Also, why monster bear around the main wimpy guy for a long time? Why not a monster entered the closet during space? Why do I insist on trying to have meaning out of meaning?
