This movie was bad. The end was quite horrible. There was no plan for any movie. The only thing that was respectable about the movie was acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not make their performances fair. If the script would be located next to catch a half-story story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's exhibitions and James Earl Jones are completely lost on the bad story of God ... or lack of it. Not only was I left to wait in all the film for something that is going to make a movie .... well a real movie ... it's not just a trivial conversation between characters for what has ended that there is no reason. It was nothing more than a common discussion that would have taken place back then. There is nothing special about any characters. The only thing was how Robert DuVall showed gambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing appropriate happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat ... I was surprised that I was sitting on the entire movie waiting for something interesting to happen to watch the movie worth time. Never happened! The release of the actors suddenly began to make it clear that the movie was over and I realized that I had lost two hours of my life watching movies without a full plot and meaningless. It was not even a story. The whole movie takes place during the day value. That's right. It was one day in life (and death) of some whites in the fields. How much of the story can be done in one day (except the Film Day?)? Acting performances and the whole cast were excellent, but they were very lost on the desire of the movie ... if you could even call it movies.
