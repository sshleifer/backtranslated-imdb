Yes, this film is bad. What's wrong is that it takes any advantage of its own name! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other OR OR two. Additionally, we do not know whether the main character in the film is the DEFINITELY vampire. One can say that they were trying to “reduce” or make it “true,” but it is just about to be boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. Events occurring elsewhere are not a lot of boasting, either. Also, there is no clear opponent, and finally you do not know what happened for 30 minutes of the movie. However, I will tell you that for this film is less than the value of the production, the sound of the sound was amazing and surprising (if it is a origonal logo or sample music from elsewhere). I am on independent films, but it doesn't look like this has been excluded from the mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than the Scarecrow killer."
