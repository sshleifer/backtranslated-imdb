Gayniggers from the outer space is a short foreign film about black, gay who examines the galaxy until they are caught on Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have only the male world that all people are gay. Therefore, when they discover women or "female creatures" they live on earth, they are afraid first; they finally decide to remove all women in the world and redeem the population. <br /> <br /> Name of refusal and discriminatory discrimination, gender discrimination and sex, although perhaps it looks like satire, make this film worth a shock. However, there is a little substance down. If another auditor said, there are fewer jokes than the names of the characters (eg ArmInAss); I think I just laughed at a young gay player. I think I got a quick film action, a false satire of bad science, but after that I had enough; I continued to want the film to be ready (and it's a short film!). It's not brilliant or specifically written.
