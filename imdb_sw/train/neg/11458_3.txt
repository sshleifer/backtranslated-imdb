I can remember the attention of Bo Derek and UK media (Mucky Sun news & News of the World especially) - all following his small role in "10" by Dudley Moore. In fact, a massive shock was carried out with his face of the picture, the blue color visible and the breasts of his bouncing took place perfectly. Unfortunately, acting is, and never was, its power! I think they should make one of the three discs of the disc which always finds in DVD-Orca banks, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All these films can be chosen for "Their Great Evil". <br /> <br /> Would be guilty "must buy" me! What? Have you ever read your media, or these comments Mrs Derek, please be sure - You always had a soft spot on you and there are the most important things going on in the world to worry about your ability to act.
