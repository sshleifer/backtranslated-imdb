Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes top team as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, it looks good there. It holds many positions with good comedy and good news. But there was no event in the following many boring minutes of this pathetic experimental film. This film became extremely, lost, and ignorant after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of t.v. The characters, Woody from Cheers, and I expected to see him in this film. But after seeing "his performance of action" I came to the conclusion that he should remain playing the fool of the country who beat. His acting was lighter and poor as a movie. Another actor in this untrue film was Rosie Perez. I loved movies and Perez before, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed another job in his job was that he was not the main character and he didn't have those lines to talk (Do Right). But now in White Men can not jump he was made the main character and many lines, so it means that the audience must be connected to its sad and loud sound. So after seeing this film (the word used freely) and hearing Rosie Perez for more than now I can say that I am white and I'm trying to fly. . . off the apartment building of twenty stories.
