This film was hard to find, and when I finally noticed that the desire was too great. I mean, this is one of the greatest twentieth century stories: an unknown person uses a non-passenger airline and comes up with millions in compensation without hurting anyone or making the attempt. For all of that interest, who can do something like that, flick the talking of a real life experience. When Williams is always interesting, monitors screens thought that D.B. Cooper persona was a hero like a movie star, s what we find is a kind-of-no-minding experience or insight into a brave and intelligent person enough. Harrold usually steals the film and spunk it with fresh beauty, but the real damage was in the maintenance of the plot and the direction of the lame. Be embarrassed on this film for even available.
