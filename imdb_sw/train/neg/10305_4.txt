As an engineer, I must say this first season of the show has started very promising. Most of the calculations were very useful, and the relationship between the brothers and the Eppes' father gave an interesting edge. But after the first season, the show began to destroy, very much. Many of the mathematics and technology used to resolve crime are now gibberish and very interesting for all involved in science and technology. Participation from administrators still feels the same and I can think of the right amount of money going to produce every part, but at the end, this is damaged by a very unpleasant dish which is a mix of C and CSI style display . <br /> <br /> If you're gonna look, go for the first season only with the possibility of the second part. Later I didn't waste my time. I myself, I gave the exhibition in the middle of the season 3. Season 1 - star 8 Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - Star 3 <br /> <br /> Let's count that up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his calculations again, I can not bother with the accuracy of the handbag.
