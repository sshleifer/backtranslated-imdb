Tenants Two journalists are trying to complete their books in an empty apartment. They help first and then slow tension between them begins to build. It is based on Bernard Malamud's novel and unfortunately everyone speaks like that is in the novel. A little bit of conversation is natural, purple and highly brimming with shades of meaning. Its as well as the head of English college and head full of notes written script. It was bad and I found myself breathing everything that the film had to say, which is embarrassing since the film is full of good performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dogs down is a good form, unfortunately none of them can enter the falseness of words and columns. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. When it's not so bad, you preach too much and you are busy doing it to make you want to walk away. I lost less than three interests of the way and I had trouble in reaching the end. If you are interested I would try on the cable, but I can't put a good money to see it.
