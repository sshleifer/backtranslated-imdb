It's amazing! ..am, one person before me wrote that it was time to lose stay and watch this film. Don't do that! I am the absolute title! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I created a funny that played its meaning in the movie. However, I wanted to see this film (home only of course) but now (just after) I miss it completely! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! Bad player to play! Bad player! Bad situation! ..It is a good one to think: that wonderful girl! It should be a shadow indeed! Eeeeh! MB .10 lines down? I don't want to lose you when you no longer read my comments! I hope, I was clear and stable, because English is not my way of talking. So, net time, and see a good film, if I'm trying too. Peace!
