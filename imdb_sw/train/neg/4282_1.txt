I do not know why all these artifacts from the Ceausescu era refuse to allow. One can clearly see how distressed they were during the control of the commie which prevented many things from displaying in their movies, and now they think of what is their great free-to-fartsy freedom to fill the screens with people defending, running, vomiting, swearing, and other any hiding is possible. IT IS NOT CINEMA, friends and colleagues! This is just a misleading view. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about the author and creation and other filmmakers who were able to work for the love of evil. THE people knew their work - well, you don't! Help us, you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other long-term, and just leave us! His little time to see some Vietnamese MOVIES on screens, enough with your awesome weapons! You are not directors, you are GOD!
