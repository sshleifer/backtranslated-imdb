As I watched this film, I tried to find out why they failed to do it. Although the main plot of the movie is unlikely, there are all unrelated / unwanted forms. Hollywood people should force many bad people, two-folds with a man and woman who are very close to sex. It is amazing that we see more of them having sex than our President and grandmother. Many plots and small parts make the film very broad and no well-designed characters - I don't feel like I knew any character, but everyone is corrupt and evil. The end cannot be completed - you have left me more than wanting what might be, but what should be. Finally, there is no sense what anyone does what they do, unless they serve as more corrupt actors who make the cross twice. I am surprised that most of the participants (and good) agreed to make such an unusual film. This was seen as a film released by college students who work on their second or third project. Do not waste your time unless you are in a film class and you want an example of what you shouldn't do while making a movie.
