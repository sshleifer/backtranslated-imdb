First warn that I saw this movie on TV and it is called English - which can completely destroy the atmosphere. However, I will hit the level I have seen and hope that it will drive people away from that version. I have found this film very gently. All the atmosphere of the movie disappears and distracting to stop the confusion of the movie's stalker. Sorry, but the worst sin in my book is decreasing unless the movie about philosophy. I did not see any deep meaning of philosophy in this film. Maybe I lost something, but I must say as I see. I gave it "1". What can I say, the taste directed by U.S., perhaps.
