To make any film about the end of the world considered, there must be truth and truth. 1. We are not told why these people believe this. 2.Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada. SO PLEASE Some tell me WHAT NEED IN WHAT AND WHERE (IN THE CLOTHING CLOTHING) WHEN IT SEEM LIKE SEPTEMBER DO NOT KEEPER 3. The acting was in neo-or-natural style, which needed a director who knew how to do. The pieces of the personal story were all without and without any purpose. I could continue, but I don't want to do that boring like a film. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB <br /> <br /> thank you you are as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
