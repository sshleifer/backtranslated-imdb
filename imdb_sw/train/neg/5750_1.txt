in fact, it was beautiful funny ... in "god, how hell made this movie made" kind of way. if you do a good movie ... which I kinda do ... go ahead and watch ... but if you really think "this is a good movie?" away from. This movie appeared from the original location and the worst work I've ever seen on any movie .... usually gets five minutes in it before you realize "this film can suck" .. but no , you know certainly on the bat. This movie speaks of edgar allen poe ... never trying to explain it though, to people who did not remind the story of the poe life ... so I don't know if anything said is true. <br /> <br> this movie is about the author "ethan poe" connected to his cousin "ann" .... they are all descendants of edan allan poe ... or are they? it seems, people give what their fathers did. The poe of this young man is ethan "usher", who should be a descendant from the story "house of usher" written by edgar allen poe. The brother of ann shows sometimes trying to bury ... this year also beats, at the same time in movies, and three different street people (for weight, three ... they are right back to tell him and he even realize). The characters who are killed all over, show at the end try to save the day .... but they can't. at the end, ann anth ethan while trying to kill his best friend. In fact, before he drew him he should shout "never!" This movie should never appear!
