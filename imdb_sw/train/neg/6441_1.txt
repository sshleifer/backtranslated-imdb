As I watched these years of Wrestlemania match, I was SO dropped and can't control myself because I was so happy. <br /> <br /> Begins ... and expires. I'm sitting there, angry with hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you are looking at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will drop like a classic and then you expect the same to get the desired amount they have every time and then. One time in the whole show that had lost me was when HBK was hit out! At the time of HBK losing to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a loser / poser. It was almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me when it hit the TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I started looking again (for luck). I also have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest I've ever seen) which was Wrestlemania's normal clean. It is obviously made to 'Mania 23' and give us lots of memorable lots. Looking at all Wrestlemanias before this, like those that enable them to become fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), PLEASE don't look at this and make the same mistake I did and leave behind WWE. And if you look and get angry, start looking again and see Wrestlemania 24, it's quite normal.
