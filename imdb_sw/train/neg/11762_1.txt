As South Africa, it's a contempt of thinking that someone was really paid to produce these meaningful! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the original Shaka Zulu mini writers, this "boost" for the series is awesome! The previous series involved historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and hero. The man who played a major role in creating the history of local tribes in South Africa. The film's plan, however, is not anything except gray, hit under the barrel and the author has failed to attract since the mid-nineties. When Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, saving the slaves of decay and his red buoy with a blue smile? <br /> <br /> I expected women blond, busty to appear out of place and run on the screen in their red bath suits, because no clear. Not that this would be more wonderful than a fantastic plot of the fantasy that could occur after 10 beer beer in a fancy dressing party, where the man 's caveman's clothing led the author back to the African landscape for his next "blockbuster".
