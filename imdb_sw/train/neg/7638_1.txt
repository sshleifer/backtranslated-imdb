I could not even bring myself to watch this film to the end. I can't give an overview of the story if I didn't look at the whole film and the reason why I couldn't look at it because of 'actors'. Firstly, for the most part they seemed only hard and I am sure their writings were just in their hands out of shape - but that's a minor matter. The main issue I have with executives is not their fault ... who hit this film! Come, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought that giving people in the last twenty years to play young people came out of fashion and a new wave? I can't watch the film where one of the first lines, from an older man than me, is "I'm 17!" How can one take that seriously? Don't have a victim of this film, go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get more than this movie that would give you.
