I just saw the first film on MTV. I must say this was very good (for better). The discussion does not tell the story very well, and I was left to hear if there were many holes of conspiracy. There is no one characteristic suitable in this situation due to a bad act. I only see that all the characters are also a powerful way when it comes to someone who loves them. Also, Cate and Heath's love is very visible. They seem more like brothers and sisters than lovers. I do not understand why a father would accept such a thing under his roof. I watched this film because of the few actors I respected and were excited to watch the previous films, but as I said, it's very hard to love the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was very serious which was a complete shocker. He was terrified to be a sister who was an elder of Edward, and there was not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne to me even to reflect on his performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was good to see him in a recent thing and even though his behavior was kooky, he was the only person I heard. For Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroes, but came as whiny and overdramatic. I don't enjoy this film or music in it. There was a short summary of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but the small appearance could not insist on watching this film again. MTV did a lot of work to assure me that this was not a movie. I showed something very different.
