This mini series is more realistic than the rest and the largest budget and high expectations. SOTD is located somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment base. If not long (about 3 hours) I think that children would like a little. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not very romance or other "icky" stuff. When you are young, you say a lot of ball swords, camping camps, and events that are repeated. (At least two cases are typically re-presented in the film, as was done in the time period of the past to bring the audience to a fast pace.) Finally, many children agree more with English English-speaking conversations from Asian actors. (Not to mention the fact that a number of leading roles are played by non-Asian actors.) I'm going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like a director, producers, and cast was eligible for another extra loan for at least to implement on the project. This movie is not an art, but, if you upload your home, it actually took time, effort, and discipline to make it. Overall, it is not the proposed use in your time, but it can develop children who enjoy it when traveling in a mini car. Oh, naam ... hey, IMD! "Talk" is the preferred spelling and traditional. Your spell checks seem to think that the "conversation" is the correct spelling. When the "dialog" is accepted, both Webster and OED see it as an alternative.
