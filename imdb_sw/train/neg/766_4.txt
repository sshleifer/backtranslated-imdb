When Columbo's story comes from a common plot (a killer makes a crime, Columbo pulls a killer, Columbo becomes a tragedy in the process), authors are somehow unable to resemble the quality and interest of traditional periods. This period comes out violently, and the result is a large flop. Do you believe: Columbo should not be the face of the villain at the end? !! In fact, I was tempted to wipe over two-thirds of the way. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifice we ourselves assure experts to do !!!
