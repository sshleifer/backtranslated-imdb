I just want to start by saying this is the first review of the film I made on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this film is actually one of the worst films I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the director says he respects the refusal to build and so I will try to avoid just filming for him and giving my opinion why I found it to be awesome. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know the budget can not be allowed for the elite but for Nicholson who works in the industry for more than ten years he really knew some actors who were at least moderate. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad pieces make special effects. Once again the budget interfered with what was previously required but after working for many years there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. Effective Effects for Hostels. Although it is not actually a break, it really tries to pay for money in the old film success. The only problem was Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. It is not any creepy or haunting even the only annoying disease. <br /> <br /> 5. Script in general. All the talks were spontaneous and horrible! Also the small squares about the theater and the boy coming to protect them were as weak as and almost as after playing. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How to upload, and not a good way. Nuf said. I would like to hear the ideas of the director in my post (of course, it will make his page on IMDb.) cause a friend ... what would you think about. Certainly at the time of the shooting or editing you discovered what Yolu of Turkey had your hands ... Sorry I don't want to be brutal but you must have more talent than this I hope your second element which the gutterballs film or wahtever is better, with hope The practice makes progress. <br /> <br /> But for a time to avoid this as a blow. I want back to 81 hours for interest. (At least I did not pay for it.)
