This view is horrible, joke is both horrible and may be just worse and worse. I am one of those people who did not have a big fan of Corn Corn but at least I liked it for the first time even if it came into the second season season, all jokes were played by the characters had nothing to them. The least gases of Corner was good for the first time, Mosque Pastor at Prairie is usually bland bad CBC comedy which had nothing to go for from part 1. Who are the people who are looking at this show however, I have to be honest are people of past or maybe only people who live on meals? Maybe the joke is to them and works there? I don't know one person who likes to show this and can not stand himself, joke is to predict completely and the characters are even less developed than the Corner Gas. We hope that it will not last long because all this successful show seems to be based entirely on the basis of this show that Muslims which are different and may / should have caused a great show.
