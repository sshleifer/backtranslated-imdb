I have finished watching this film and I found it was basically not a really interesting thing. <br /> <br /> I am a gamer of the RPG (computer type, no gold DnD items) but I haven't even got a joke in this very interesting thing. Some events seemed to bring us a lot of (making and zoom can be reduced to 5seconds instead of minutes) and it feels like the director was trying to fill out the time. I think I cut a total of 2-3 times on the entire film. It is not all that is bad, almost the point that B's grandfather should have. I would like to point out not to bother with this film unless you are a big fan of DnD and yet it would be better to put it out.
