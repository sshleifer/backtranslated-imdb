We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He has done the impossible. He can be the only director having two less than 100 movies on IMD! She is a kind of cinema movie. It does not matter what little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he can continue to do them. I know, he sponsors all through some kind of German special package, but yet, his ability to continue making movies with absolute failure, complete completion is one of the great mysteries of the world. cannot be bad unless video game developers continue to give their best assets to this person. I was very excited about a series of games. Even recently, New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of the game. There was a good film made for adventures of Edward Carnby, but not so. Now Uwe Boll has gotten hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Punishment? I can only think of a swath that this person will cut through game settings and movie if not stopped. One needs to overcome his credit line, or the video game preachers should be wise and realize that when they make a bad film out of a game that kills a franchise, nobody is attracted to that title again. <Br /> <br /> Think about it, is the House of the Dead or Itself in the dark title of the game better again? No. The new game of the dead game comes from X-Box and no one will care. The head died, and because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you is working for a publisher of the game, or knowing the publisher of the game, or the possibility of the game publisher ... please warn them. <br /> <br /> This movie itself does not worth viewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this bunch of elephant from others. In fact, everything is about. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited until it came to the DVD and then leased to low expectations, I would not like it. Boy, I was not wrong. Do not reduce the ability to switch to a large bunch of BOLL sh * t.
