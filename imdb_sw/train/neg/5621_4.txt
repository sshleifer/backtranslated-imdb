I am a skeptic skeptical and agnostic and so I expect you to enjoy this film. After looking at it, however, I certainly believe that I would make the best document. Its sources seem to have only four sources of confidentiality (although they are listed on IMDb credit not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), it has been edited with fraud and the effects of laughably amateur computers, and it does not even make a little attempt to appear impartial. Describing is interrupted all the time and exciting, close to the feelings of the anti-Christian youth, destroying any possibility that the film could actually change the mind of the opposite person and just preach to the singers (ie me). Although there is a fascinating discussion of Jesus' history, the movie is experiencing an unprecedented famine when it begins to sit at a Christian school which the director attended as a child, an institution that seems to have led to bad psychology as it deals with this day. Even though TGWWT had a low budget, there is still a chance to make an exposition of mind on the roots of Christianity. In fact there is a hunger for religious documentation on the market, and this film could help fill the blank. Instead, the director chose to quote our minds and this piece of rubbish, which eventually appears to be a form of medical exercise for him. It is so bad that his Christian birth troubled him, but they do not need to present the audience to his system of response.
