I didn't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make movies as bad as the 'Mitchell', but this succeeds. I can't recommend this if you are a fan of the best works of Joe Don Baker. But, if you would like to look at the fake people and in fact, really comes out of the gun fighting, you will love this movie.
