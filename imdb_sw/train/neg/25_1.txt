Sometimes the movie is so very bad it has a devastating effect on your values. You start to ask yourself, what does it mean for our society to have a low level? Can they honestly expect that we will be able to tolerate these many clich√©s and still be recommended? <br /> <br /> Of course, it is still a Hollywood center to make GUN main character, device tool, and source of all conflicts and decisions in the film. Characterization requires a gun. He gets a gun. He can not do it because he has a gun. He blows his gun first. OH MY GOD What shall we do? Has a gun! He goes around, doing more evil than real people they do. He pushes a person's face for 90 minutes, searching for questions. At the end of any conclusion it will be the sound of the safety of the police. It is a real challenge to make such fatigue, hackneyed formula work again; The film should be very clever and punished properly. This is not. You have no life or personality, and it will light up these elements from you. it will make you feel sorry about living time and space. True, who needs it? Yes, I will tell you: I think this may be the worst film I saw. Anyone who is involved in the decision of this small death killing must have a public shame for freezing to all of us.
