haha! you should just smile and smile if you really did all the way through this movie. it's like saying something about me I think. The movie itself was created as a kind of psychological test, or as a kind of drug, to send you to a place that you have never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his first piece of tractacus (sp)? true. This movie is the same I think. <br /> <br /> If the movie is of course, the worst movie I have seen for a long time in a special way. first of all, this is on. I liked to look at this ass kick in various movies. and I have suffered through a few weak. however, although you know the movie can absorb, you will never feel that it could be as bad as it was. which is his pleasure. I mean this is blowing. you know it may be good, but it will be ok, right? smile. <br /> <br /> so this each level is weight, cleanliness. The reference to all the expert is dead and obvious, but still not being good. there is no one character in this fascinating film, at least. and doing anything more than surreal, they have a voice sound like part of various Bourne movies, not quite accurate. in fact, although it looks close to the background music of the film, it just so happens in such a way that it will delight you on your fantastically. <br /> <br /> then all the events in the total black pitch, where honestly that the characters are flat, care about what will happen, but no matter what, after the person is killed, you say yourself, I should see it? what else? how about the blinding events, sharply watching the strobe lights, for a very long period of time. certainly let's throw it in. how this bout though. when you are faced with your eyes are no longer available, do more of them in the dark you kill where you don't see what happened. and on this, it lets you face care. had passed the exhausting way from the beginning. So I came in and out several times, but I caught almost all this film. and it becomes something that you can watch, without something that brings your mind to any level, therefore, it becomes something that you can achieve perfectly with, and start thinking about your life, where it goes, where it has been, what we are like people. br /> <br /> and that ... that's the true magic of this film.
