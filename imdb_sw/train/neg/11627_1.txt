I wonder who was responsible for this mess. Jokes did not work on the island of gilligan. If this went to a series, would it have a joke about Auschwitz, or would Eve have a place for her oven, just to have Adolf showing 50 seats? After another compared to this show I love Lucy. The problem with this was that Lucille's balloon had a knowledge of a romantic and mysterious situation, and this confusion had been made clear and insulted by my mind. After the destruction by Nazi and Britain and the number of people killed, I would like to think of the concept of a comedy about Hitler would have been ignored and many ordinary people would have taken this concept before any events were produced.
