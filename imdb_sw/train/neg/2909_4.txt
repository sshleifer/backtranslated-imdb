Watching Tom Hanks as a man who was beaten to an Irish group is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial refugee doesn't work. I had a very difficult time to accept this. Not that I don't think Tom can't work can be following his work since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this has fallen for me. Maybe because I am a fan of novel photo and the sound of the sound like a fanboy (the only kind of life less than a fanboy is a cockroach) The whole movie for me differs.The Jude Law, and eliminating everything else I felt cold and more sad little. I anticipated the greatest crime of films in Bonnie's vein and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart out of the story and left us with nothing but clear bones. There are things that love in this flick however the movie drives the screen and the beautiful pictures Paul Newman is as usual and I am very happy to score, but Tom as "angel of death" Sullivan was quite flat.
