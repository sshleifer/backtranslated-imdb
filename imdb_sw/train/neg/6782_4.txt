Not one of Keaton's best efforts, perhaps he was an attempt to find himself on a married couple - Talmadges. The Polish / English language barrier and a series of interactions lead Buster into marriage with an Irish woman, who (with her father and siblings) treat him with shabbily until they think she can be a successor of profit. So many small points here - small have been set and but generally fail to pay. <br /> <br /> This short Metro has at least a real laugh - Buster's maneuver turning his lack of dinner using a calendar on the wall and the ignorance of his family adopted to bring meat to his plate. Another is a family picture, with a whole group falling on the floor as a third of the camera loses its tranquility. The beer is more likely to be a catalyst for a great series of gags built on weeds, but it leaves a short (for all construction) of development. <br /> <br /> Kino News is crisp and clear and the logo is one for piano player, dance and sound. Not one of the best Buster efforts, but the value of a few laughs.
