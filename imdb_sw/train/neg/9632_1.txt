I've had a bad videotape of a pan-and-scan of "Boom!", And I want to see it in all its glory mirror. So I voted "1" and hope you will be too. Together, we can pull this film into the pocket of the cinema, and hope that someone will get a chance for the BIG MONEY in release "Boom!" in its Extended Extension Director. The movie is one of my favorites to mourn? You just watch people involved, director, actors, cameraman, and you tell yourself, "Yep, I think you can deceive some people for a lot of time." they should be aware that, wherever it is shown, there have been groups of sale in movies. But it has never been to Frostbite Falls yet.
