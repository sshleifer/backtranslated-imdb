I am delighted to read many negative comments about the Tritter program. Everyone who speaks and says the same thing. They love the nature of the House and his mind, but they do not like the truth of the proven plot. It reduces the actual story of the hospital and makes everyone angry with police authorities. It needs to be more caring, rather than reassuring everyone in the hospital. Also, there seems to be a lot of legal issues that really Tritter does. He alone can not freeze the account and have the authority to leave doctors to write notes to patients. A lot of assurances he shows is also hurt very sick at the hospital and not a good storyline to show. I voted this not because of the story itself, but when you enter a piece of Tritter coming back and all of the plot hurts, people say they hate to look at the lines of the story again. Please do not change. Get Tritter out.
