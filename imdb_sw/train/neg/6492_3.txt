I wasn't quite sure to expect from the Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi type, but, thanks to the participants involved I thought I would give you a spin. The sound of the film was so great, walking through all sorts of forms but it never had a sense of balance, and finally I stopped trying, and concentrated on the movies and private presentations, which I thought was generally good, considering every character had a little bit to The origin of the story (does not give anything here). I must say it is LOT long than the run time for 96 minutes, and it's not a good way. I finally sought to be closed, some level of satisfaction but it did not turn out to be a good or beautiful thing I expected to be. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he did at the end of the film he gave us to ... but it was a bad mistake to try and confirm the last 95 minutes and a pregnant-patient conclusion. Finally I feel wrong. IMO would be better to let it stand without "end" as a piece of Art ... just. Or ... I would have lost the absolute point :)
