I tried to watch this film without being able to sit that way, at the time it thinks to have a "good message"; The problem is that it is definitely produced according to a certain interpretation of Scripture. Translation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. In addition, I am a maniac movie and acting in this film is totally unacceptable. I've never wanted a negative mark to test the movie. Therefore, if you want to be preached by those who have no authority, then by all means, get this film. These views are also a warning to people who love or love scifi, because the title will deceive many people too. This was a bad film, because the basic idea was likely and likely that was destroyed. The only film of redemption is that it has made me realize that the behavior in the "Time of the Machine" probably should have shown a little more sense of morality for abnormal behavior and those in the future.
