I lost three times to watch this film. In fact, it's Shakespeare and it takes some ideas to be interested or not. But this film exceeds any restriction of long-term soliloquies and not, which can prevent many from not just caring about Shakespeare's basic story. <br /> <br /> The main road to this production is a flat full of characters. Often during the interaction of behavior, it is difficult to distinguish who is who. In fact, I believe this movie is known in English. Surely they could find voice actors who could add more game to these common, literary lines. It is not possible to measure this movie more than 1, although perhaps it depends on the age of maybe age and what might seem a very low budget. However, it is very painful and stimulating. If you insist on Hamlet, make yourself a certificate and read the book again. 1/10
