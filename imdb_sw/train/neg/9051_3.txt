I was so excited when I realized this was available! I couldn't wait to see. What will lose power! It forms such as CD rarities and your favorite band found behind the rack in your music store store. Being a hard base fan was sure that it was a valuable discovery. But as soon as you heard it it became clear why these dogs did not do on the actual album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completion' which should have everything Lynch has done. "Six Sixth Men" appear to be interesting but for a short time and repeat. You do not have the future work of Lynch "Grandma" is just a normal job. It is exciting and looks like a student film. But it was 70 ... It's just interesting if you expect to combine psychological director. But you can see, briefly, some seeds of his business pictures and sounds. "Alpahabet" is forgetting (No true! I can't remember this even!) "Amputee" useless. "Cowboy and Frenchman" is very clear. "Lumiere" is the only one worth in the group. Without a conversation Lynch tells a confused story similar to his best work. I had to look at this several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. It does not accept the problem of renting or buying a DVD.
