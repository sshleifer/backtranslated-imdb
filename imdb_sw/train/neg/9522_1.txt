Wow! I remember many of the horrible films that have been around the secondary schools since the 1980s. As I watched this film I felt a bit of pride in growing in the 1980s. However, I see that this film was held in 1989? Say what! Well, the element of destruction is near there, this is very serious. The plan has a city that prepares to install secondary school and threatens all local school pupils. Which is odd, since students in this school are all rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in the home. It makes you wonder how they can't earn money to keep this school alive, and they have never heard of property taxes. O, but here is the player. The school board says that they will be able to keep schools alive, if students can add $ 200,000. So the elders might do that. Hmmm, brings $ 200,000 but instead of saving it to the university, you put it in saving high school that you are Senior? And why especially near the high school before the year is out? And ... ahh forget, this film was stupid and made in 1989!
