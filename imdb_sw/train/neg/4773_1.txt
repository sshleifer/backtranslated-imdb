A good story, good fun ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... happened? very well done with good news has been destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say but 1 in the vote ... that's what it deserves, I would think that Chris Shadley could come up with a better end ... but maybe next time :) and the meaning of blood is useless? The latter could raise the story to the nearest 10, but it did not .... last destroyed the whole story, I think most people do not have the blind and when they go to the movie you want to end, even if it's complicated ... but only limples here are last ...
