This movie is awesome. Positive combat events or not, acting is really bad, if you can tell them they read their line from the card. By giving a line of pain and everyone who was beaten. Consider looking at a secondary school game and reducing the obvious lack of interaction of the actor (intermediate between the lines of different behaviors, as well as the delivery of a quick line). If all the movies were a step, this could be forgiven, but many movies include setting the Family and style style, undue despair (Oh, wow, they did wrong). I think they were trying to be funny with this, but again came as a group of high school students / university entry for afternoon afternoon trying to start a YouTube video video. <br /> <br /> Now on fighting events. They are not very bad, based on the quality of the quality seen everywhere else on the film. Nothing big, certainly not anywhere near the same level and other banners have said (Nothing like Doctor Teacher). Struggles feel very much, with LOTS reduced to different angles and different positions for those involved. Overall, the only reason to watch this film is if you are one of the friends of the guy associated with this very cheap production. Who can ask? Oh, the man who wrote, was directed, produced and looked at the School of Middle School.
