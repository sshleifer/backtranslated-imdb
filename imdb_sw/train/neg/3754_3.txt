As a long fan of all Star Trek series, I realized this part of despair, and I wonder if the liberal use of "restrictions" arising from the use of Will Riker, both (and largely romantic) and negative (much pain , and the death of the staff was a saving money, as was the case with their "many" of their "bottles" (events that are everywhere in business). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the previous series) deserved to be better than this for her character, Dr Kate Pulaski. Honest audience (in the world of Star Trek, there are any other types?) Also not mixed. This was the last part of the second season; so, the season ended "not with bang" but with "surprise."
