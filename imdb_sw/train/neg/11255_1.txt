In a word, this film was boring. There was no life and no fun. The main problem includes two ways. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did not have any chemistry. She was attractive, and was bitter. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions were interesting, but they didn't add events. If anything, these images tried to view the audience from what is happening on the screen. There is no guide to the actual action, and so, the film did not succeed in creating any realistic or dangerous game. <br /> <br /> The film was capable, but it required the best script, to do the best, and the best director. I continued to think during the film, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford was a Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was a director. Ignore the films of this film. Critics think they are celebrating the film because they want * to love it and want to succeed even though it fails in many different levels.
