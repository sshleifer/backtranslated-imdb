He feels Eva Longoria dies on his wedding day when an angel's sculpture (without wings) falls on the back of the truck and kills him. He is the one who tries to destroy the relationship of his former partner and his new, intelligent partner who can see him. The most unusual unusual image will not be bad in the way of a clich√©d way, except that Longoria's behavior is hate and horrible that excites all the fun from the film. It's like having your clean ears and sandpaper. In order to be fairly Longoria, nor any other person beaten or staff, not a problem, is its very bad script that tries to trial. It's just really stupid.
