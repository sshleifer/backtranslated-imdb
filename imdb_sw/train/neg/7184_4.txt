This was not really a very good movie. There were many things that were not possible and predictable during the film ... but I think that most of the critics are not sure what this film should be interested in most viewers. MOVIE THIS WAS MADE BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't it enough to encourage us all to watch this film? The movie produced by the old NBA star did not come every day, you know. Children with ignorance in the big house are reduced by a psychological ax. Every shadow given for us to mourn. Gender youth. And all were produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! Use of drugs! Hijin College! And all were produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
