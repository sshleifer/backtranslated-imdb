This Italian movie is primarily an opera of soap and leather. The VHS box says it was rated "R" but within the actual inner tape was said "X." The latter makes more sense because there is a short area near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you can see the Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers doing all the sex for this person - and, yes, you can see her penis her mouth. I read it somewhere that this was the first time that "the great actor" had done something like this on the screen. He looks at talking around the nude on several occasions but his face was better than his body. He seemed good. Unfortunately, the movie is bad .... loss of time in time and certainly does not recommend despite it looks for Anime.
