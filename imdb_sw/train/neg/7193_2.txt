I had nothing to do at the end of last week, and introduced me with my friends to watch the movie ... any movie. And since the only film we didn't see was the Inspector's Auditorium, we decided to enter it. BIG MISTAKE. This is a film that can appeal only to children. Oh, and not like I enjoy the movies targeted by the small audience. But this movie had nothing to hold my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to bed. It's better than to lose hard money on this. Go to the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent and child :)
