Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal already prepare a sequel about a young American boy in Afghanistan. It also happens to be a very experienced surgeon and around freely around Kabul, working for NATO wounded soldiers. In a very difficult mission, it takes a sniper rifle and dismisses Osama Bin Laden from 3,000 kilometers away. He is eventually developed to be a sergeant, but he can not decide between the operation of the surgeon and the surgeon, so he leaves the Army completely. A year later, concerned with civil life, he joins the Navy and the last area shows proudly wearing a white uniform.
