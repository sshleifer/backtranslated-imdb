I totally agree with this last comment may be the worst movie made. I also had to move beyond this film. Michael Madsen must have made this film a warranty for man. For the quality of the photo you are opening in all the way. I will give you 1 of 10 films if I could give a low score I would like. Don't waste your time on this film or regret it.
