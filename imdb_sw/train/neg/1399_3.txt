Or, it's a bad movie of BORING Sci-Fi! And that is especially sad because 15 minutes of opening were full of work and full capacity! During the intro, we follow a group of security concerns and employ men to hit as they expel a doctor who escaped from a secret laboratory and a full briefcase of files on the secret. Because he wants to reveal the horrible and human events that are happening in the laboratory, he is cut off. Statistics? From then on, the 'action' comes back to the two areas, the previous laboratories and the rural home of the bad senator (or something), and it becomes apparent that the experiment is actually the opposite of the disturbance. More like lightweight, useless and incomprehensible. Scientists chose four non-relatives without living relatives and in fact it is very important that they say the fact though the big machine reads the content of their minds, however. They all hide the secrets of darkness from their pastures and people face when they are revealed; I was still unable to see how these tests could cause a threat to humanity. I probably missed something, but I'm sure. Cooperation between patients and doctors is less attractive to follow, in fact none of them has a reputation. So basically, "Machine Brain" only covers a group of mature people living in a very pleasant room. The film would also be half an hour if it was not for the big robbers of buildings! Relocation from the laboratory to the villa and vice versa are shown at any of the SINGLE for the second second shot of the sites. Neither builders really need padding or they think that all the viewers of Sci-Fi are morons cannot recognize the location changes to themselves. Looking at the dam left by the back house for about ten minutes only a bit, I assure you. James Best performance as a pastor and mental matters is very good, but one person certainly cannot save this thing that is completely lost in time. Avoid!
