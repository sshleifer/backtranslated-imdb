I work as a concierge of a hotel in Washington DC and take my word, there is nothing right about the behavior played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we can't walk with our pockets with a ticket to theater and $ 100 dollars! # 2 If I allow anyone to take advantage of the “day's fun” I would like to be chased there! The organization I am (Les Clefs d'Or) has a very high ethical and ethical standards that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, the idea, at the end of the film, Doug only removed its important gold signals and made it to another employee - we get these keys and a badge of honor and the ability to wear them. There are all requests and process testing for joining our organization. This video does not have anything to remove the unfortunate concierge view of anything except the money generator. In short is the purpose of our organization. I welcome any comments.
