It is clear that all the positive comments set for this film are now from non-members who are involved with the film or who knows someone who knows someone and has thus seen a reduction in many times. Yes, I don't know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's a clean garbage. The only thing that goes to it is greed and comes often from horrible stories (no on the screen for too long). It is like the film artists made this film at the weekend during a fearful agreement with actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman at the cinema during a coffee break. This is ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files and acting acting due to the cast of non-characters and mullet than accepted in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it is a very good discussion that tries to define an uncertain plot. Ther FX computers are joke, but they don't have enough or enough action to make this film relaxing through MST3K. After about 8 direct events without talking, you will find yourself in the fast-forward buttonâ€¦ and don't stop returning. Absolutely worthless.
