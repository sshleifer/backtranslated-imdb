This film was made for people who got too much Gremlins and Employees for hardcore. As many of the movies / kids / gremlins movies 80 of this movie are bad. The sad part is that no punchline for these comments. It's just bad and not in a pleasant way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this small monster movie is that it really tries to be funny and end up being successful in doing it like Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the 80 movies of fear in the classic is that they were really trying to be afraid, but they were few because they were sadly disappointed. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes Bettina Hirsch) had a knack for comedy before they started to lead this movie. Unfortunately they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Certainly see a small cross mix between ferret and tumor wearing a dark layer of black and blowing the pool balls on the animal from the Lost Boys is amusing, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> For the despair of the movie is the character of Paul. Paul's Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you go quickly from the time of his first place until the last documents have left once to see the area where the munchie gives us the pool of the pool for the man ... not that I have done so. br>> <br /> So the bottom line is walking, do not walk, to your nearest Blockbuster and hold hands with the manager and thank him for not having grapes to enter this bunch of trash on the shelf.
