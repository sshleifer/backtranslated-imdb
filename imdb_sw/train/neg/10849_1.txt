Usually when I go to the video raid on the local park I tend to B-Horror movies. For me the core of the B-Horror cinema is the value of the camp, Heavy Gore, Most of the Unhealthy Sensitivity, and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn and rubber syrup. I lost the Dedication because I have become a fan of the band since they gave it the first Demo in 1995. The movie started with an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on the mask of latex very clear CHEKA. I saw a lesbian sex area for a sex-oriented area I feel like a wife. I loved the whole movie laughing and when I was not laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how many million dollars could make a film that looked like it was on a budget of several hundred dollars. All the way to this film seemed to be attracted to "Hardcore Goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are made things since Lava Camps. That was true. For me this film seemed like 80.5% of what happened in this film just happened because of that Satan. This movie was a great potential and actually would be a real realistic movie but eventually "This Movie" is an extended Marriage Video Filth.
