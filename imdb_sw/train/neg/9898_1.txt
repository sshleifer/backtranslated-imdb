This version of "Moby Dick" accuses viewers of this claim is based on the Melville-even novel to go on to show the judgment of the first chapter instead of the popular "Niita I Ishmael". In addition to having a bad feeling, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood (especially Hollywood earlier) would go to fix and change the popular novel just to open his opportunities in the box office. A good novel, the language of poetry has been completely completed, and Ahab has been transformed from a hero, who honors, who deals with a hero who wants to kill Moby Dick after his wife !!! He turns after seeing his wooden foot. For this is added a bad bad brother who wants a sweetheart himself, and the last difference!
