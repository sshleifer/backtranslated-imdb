this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another film and the same director, yesterday's electrical 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I liked to make this film - asano is a great actress and story story was very interesting. but I couldn't find anything of entertainment about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever for anything that will happen. and the effects the director spent - as a regular mixture of the use of slow motion - just added to my growing bitterness of the fact that the plot was very intelligent and slow and the participants were fighting very much. The enormous weight was the most unnecessary results - such as an hour spent on an encyclopedia of Buddha pictures and announcing how to worship nothing. this did not add anything to the field. a Japanese colleague and I was looking at it constantly. we could not believe this film was as bad as it was. and the latter was bad. I thought the director would be at least trying to pay the viewer to manage this way, but sadly I was wrong.
