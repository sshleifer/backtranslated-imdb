Have you ever had an error just to kill an hour or two to work and look at the worst movie? Well, out of the rental movies at the end of the week I see the art of the box for this and see T-Rex. To know fully that the dinosaur on the package was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I had to rent this thing just because I had the feeling of a bad movie. It is not broken at least. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret principles, the company is concerned about the luck and its shareholders than life, and of course, t-rex large, non-animation, secular. What? I am only through a movie that had an open event from another film? Not to mention the Rex Hunger is never endless ... forever. How hungry he is than me because they have no throat (True if you look down his mouth shouting, it is strong ... like a toy or something). Now, I would like to watch B many bad movies regularly because it reminds you of how good the blockbuster film is. This was hilarious. I don't even know if this should be exciting or interesting, because there are instances where you do not make a mistake, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> What! I blame the movie budget ... yes, but acting does not help either. Okay, Tony Todd was very good, as well as other female roles ... when you cry not should you "tear" to come out? Meh, I can't be angry with this film, I realized what I was coming in and if you were looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Look at this film, then look at Jurassic Park and then the lost world behind. You will be writing Mr. Spielberg thank you for the next day.
