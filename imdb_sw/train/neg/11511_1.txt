I had the opportunity to see this film in the US show. After sitting in doubt on anything wrong, I am shocked to see the best views here on the IMDB. The original film was Turkey, but one interesting. It was closed within seven years, after the 1969 revolution; This film only shows ......., well, nothing really. It's bad. Think about the perfumes of business damage - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna was never able to act, and has been embarrassed on big screens for years. He looks more and more negatively for each of those years, increasingly being seen as skin skin. Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on the Store Code, can never refer to - his movies are clear, very bad, fashion show. We do not break the heart here; he struck his wife with wisdom as the star of this desire. <br /> <br /> Please people, listen to the positive review of this movie received from other posters below. They are open business plants. Do not encourage Ritchie to disgrace yourself by giving him money. <br /> <br />
