The story of the well-known Oh-familiar comedy about the lowest team of Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his surgery, wakes up with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde met last night. After sleeping on her to her boyfriend Karen (Selma Blair), she is forced to lie more and more to cover her songs. I am sure many of us have been preaching a story like this at least once before ... on a film or on TV. The movie is a formulaic and EXTREMELY predictable, and the last you can see coming miles away <br /> <br /> at least cast offers some interest and continue to be watchable. Lee is just fine, and Stiles are very happy in the role of the comedic of the heart different from the very serious roles he plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change work as often as other people change their clothes. But you know, this is not very accurate. The question of one question is left without answer: What, especially is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), a brutal old boy of Becky, chased by IA? And I didn't have Buck's character (David Koechner), Paul's father; he is a very good pastor who got my veins quickly as I was praying for someone to beat him. <br /> <br /> Add another extract: comeo-free, unwanted and comic / actor Larry Miller, no longer playing grouch (in this case, it is a little fair - its character is a conservative prime minister). It is not very good, but as usual for me, I give three out of ten according to the sole effort.
