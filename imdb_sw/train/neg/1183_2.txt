This, and the Mystery Stories, all have left my bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is broken with sex, and these two films are cautious stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a film, it is not very good - some act is very bad (such as a "American" woman with a French impression). A young boy suddenly emerges from worrying about marriage being committed (when it seems like it should be another way around), and a sudden recognition of a young aunt's secret did not mean - they 'did not really explain. I also did not have a relationship with a black man who was presented as a misleading sign for his family or prediction for sex. The main idea, the idea that there is a good "animal", if you would like, live in the forests, would be the basis of a bad but happy story, but it is used only as a basis for ethics, odds, values.
