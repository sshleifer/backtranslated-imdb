This film was not as close as I expected. There are few seconds of attention in this hard idiotic hardcore UFO plot paranoia-fest. Many functions are mediocre, but usually for the 1970-style elements filled with pregnancy pauses. Photographers and fashion testimonials of wonderful-indoor forests and will soon fall victim to these same-go. Clean flyers appear, many people will disappear - but are visitors or our secret group of secret people? Recently, the journalist and "UFOlogist" (visible to the behavior of the author's director) are found in this non-occurring fiasco and are aimed at secret agents who are dangerous if they are not possible and ignorant. Then joy begins. <br /> <br /> The movie, predicts, makes up the meaning as the average theory of the UFO plot, but should be commended for taking it seriously. The camera function is similar to a small budget film, pacing is very good, the script is silly and incredible, and there are continuous issues that are fun to watch out. Is it a few seconds of careful attention? In fact, I can say a lot without writing a spoiler. It should say that the end of the film is, at least, worth sending it quickly if you can't take the middle.
