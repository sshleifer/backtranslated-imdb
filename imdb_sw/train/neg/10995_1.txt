Anyone who has examined the Comedy Out around midnight in the last few years seems probably advertising for this film. I first saw the ads of this film back in 2001. It seemed like it could be funny, but I didn't have a mobile phone on TV screens and ordered it without seeing the movie first. I thought I would return until the movie was found to rent on Blockbuster. About one year and a half later, I was on the Tower Memory and in "DVDs for a minimum of $ 20", there was a copy of this film. To see that the DVD was only $ 6.99 I decided to buy. I came home, put a disk in a DVD player, and waited for the start to start ... and I waited more. Laughter has never come. I would like to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this film was bad. The sick, worthless, and illiterate and misrepresented, THE COMEDY OF COMEDY MOVIE is a piece of dirt and is my movie the worst movie all the time. No star.
