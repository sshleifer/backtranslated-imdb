I haven't explained how awesome this film is. What? Am I the only one who finds the most disgusting way? The people of Rohan look at 100% fake hair and their non-colored hair, which they have not reached close to matching actors. Orcs seemed awesome. Why gandalf walks and stops bad? Why can't they say things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were other like a horrible voice * sp * of Tolkiens characters. Both and all enjoy the label who made this pulled plug from sequal, it was just a terrible adaptaion. Visit the cartoon of hobbit for the best cartoon work of Tolkiens. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this eliminates. 2/10
