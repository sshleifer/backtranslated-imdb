If you are going to see this movie you will hate the movie theater, director, producer, artists and someone who told you to go see! Secrets over you, Sarah Michelle Geller, by putting your name and face to this film excuse. It could be more frightening if Japanese actors said only in Japanese instead of trying to 'act' in English. I wanted a boo when the movie ended ... the real desire after all kinds of television and film advertising promotes this flawless financial manufacturer. Sarah Michelle certainly did not need to do any time to make this film ... she just made her interesting skills. Don't waste your time or money on this film.
