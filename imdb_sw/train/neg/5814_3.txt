The film did what was planned to do: show how a little girl can cope with poverty and grow in her maturity. However, for most of us, this lesson has been taken into consideration and in many cases more modernized than was done here. The movie set up on the breast, which recently became boring and I lose interest. If this was on TV, I'd like to change the latest news on the Starr Report. That's what I did when I got this movie.
