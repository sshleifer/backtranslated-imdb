I don't know ... maybe it's because I am Brazil but all things were too many. So much love for music, so many parties, very different from the good life of the main characters (coming, not sad) and the image of the city shown by the director. Everything seems too fake to me: family, relationships, music, "fun". It only sells a little flavor of latinamerican fake culture. I must be faithful: it has despised me a little, but who could not be deceived by the bad life made by the music, sex and parties? I am not a fool: what kind of world do people have no diarrhea, great sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the area with the Caridad's mother phone and the debate about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
