Marvin (Rob Schneider) have no links to be cop which is his daily dream. But his fortune changes with a crush (very bad) car and is available to a doctor. The doctor uses animal organs to rebuild it. After this time, she begins to have wild characteristics without knowing and becoming the best she can be. At the same time, he is aware of the changes and herds of animals begin to take their human side. At the right time, she gets a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman which means she is self-involved. I am not happy with Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first film I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the player. (See its section in Ally Mcbeal, actually quite true) There are some nice places in movies such as playing with goats. In these movies, the biggest problem is that the script seems to be the player feels to be unwise. I am sure that this film is the same to watch as long as it is not widely available. But sad to see the films are very good at the box office. The animal is not the worst film I have seen now but it is no more than *.
