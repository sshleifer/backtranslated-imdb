Want a good recipe for failure? Take a conspiracy of **** y, add some weak, non-developed characters and lose the most special effects of the horror movie that has been known. Let the stew for a week (the amount of time you probably spent doing this garbage). The result is the Dead Revolution, a movie that takes bad movies on the dangerous and low places. <br /> <br /> Movie hit completely. My words cannot explain how it was painful to see. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and talk. This is not a Plan 9 From External Space. This is a long time to lose, sad, sad. Dead dust II is a huge waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I bother me when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit, if you can call it will work. But again, when you have a poor direction, poor journalism, everything wrong, act is the last thing to refuse. This game is like a great, disgusting turd that you want to quickly erase, afraid that a friend or loved one can see it somehow. In fact I can destroy every copy of this film in some way, so it will not harm the film's ideas. Thank you, Ted V. Mikel, for giving me a new respect for every movie I saw. You have shown the truth, and why I should know all those movies that are just interesting or awesome.
