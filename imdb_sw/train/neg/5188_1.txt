TV fighters, don't you like? Quinn Martin tried this one after succeeding in a group of other TV surveys, but this does not match anywhere except in the MST area where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is a Diamond Chief who takes orders from Aunt Mary to get super Spy Lovejoy, meaning tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic freedom and not more. The tree grows as a bad person despite all its hideings that make him look the same as he usually. There is a more common fiber of clothes here than you can imagine (required in the 1970s) and show itself is so combating the weather. Why didn't you go to the series? You count them, it is quite clear. Again it's fun for MST, but it's not much more !!
