There are bad movies, then there are movies that are so bad, that they become almost art. This is one of these films. My boyfriend and I are still kind of shaped shell, you know, approaching the space and stop! You can tell the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) they had an explosion, and indeed they were not ashamed. I give him these three out of ten simply because of the free and smutted smell of the year. I laughed loudly during many films, so I think you can say that it showed a good time. Beware of the viewer, the words mentioned above without considering that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense, is that it is impossible to adopt the movie and head as well!
