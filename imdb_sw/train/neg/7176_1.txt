I have nothing to say but it was bad. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this mess of losing. And if certain partners do not want people to question their sex then they probably should refrain from making these films more. There was at least one of the seen which left me curious. Only my opinion. SHUDDER consider what is going on from the film. SHUDDER wondered what to pass through the ideas of executives who made this film. Delete thinking about the process of thought and voyeurism which continued in the minds of directors. As I said before the mess with dirt. Its not even pleasing. As Ebert said about Caligula's film and Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good film, it's not a good story and its non-good pictures. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
