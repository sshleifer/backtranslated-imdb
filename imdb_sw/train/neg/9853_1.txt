I think that everyone wants to believe that strange things have been made and this film does not show how to try to use it in full. Presentation is very interesting, well presented and graphics are a state of art, but from a scientific perspective does not work. Hydrogen filled filled with rods? They need the size of the Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, do not try to pass it as a reality. Some people don't always understand. All in the film is all entertainment, but I always found myself saying "oh brother, it's a burden of ....". If you want a FAKE document, see this is the Wind Wind instead. Or at least turn the voice.
