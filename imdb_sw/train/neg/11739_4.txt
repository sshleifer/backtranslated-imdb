Leonard Maltin often trusted says this is "good love" and that Sanders are "good." Maltin should mix this film with something else. Sanders are snide and droll and superb, as usual, ?? you can think of his delivery of the line on adultery, "Sometimes the bonds of marriage are heavy they should carry with three," but the evil, wood and dated to describe this film more accurately. The story itself, history and Sanders as a suave thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who is a police chief but can resist the strongest of good instruments, is entertainment, but has the same kind of historical treatments of historic pits that have disrupted periods such as * Marie Antoinette *, and indeed sad * * Forever Amber * (which screams for classy remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries to add more to his character, it is for free. I am a Douglas fan of Sirk unabashed, but this is 1946, and it is one of the first US initiatives of Sirk, and it does not touch many signatures that will define its florid potboilers, breastfeeding. Sirk can get his feet wet here, and he has made some unpredictable films for the next ten years until he hit gold and * Great Bigger *, and striking his guns, throwing guns and estrogens such as * All Heaven allows *, * Written up Wind *, and * Copying Life *. But * Scandal In Paris * is not his best job? The state of low budget and a set of cheesy and costly efficiency.
