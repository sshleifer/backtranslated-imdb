One of the biggest mistakes in this film is that when the shocking yuppies are cheerful, you cannot realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve it. One of the features of these types of Yuppie is the misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only modern enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this behavior and instead focuses on their dinner disagreement, I find it interesting that only people who enjoy this film feel the same taste of films in the film as the characters do in their evening choice. If these prestigious characters in the film have a home video library, I would bet that the American Psycho would be one of those movies.
