The Bangville Police is alleged to be the first sign of Keystone Kops, called after the studio they did. In this, however, do not wear a silly police dress or a fast-fast car that is their trademark. However, Mabel Normand is a girl of the field here who asked her father for a calf. Later he sees wonderful men in the barn and calls for the police quickly. Answer one and follow there. Then, Mabel knocks her door like someone coming in. His mother may be avoiding the last bandits there! So when Mabel prevents her door with furniture, mother and father tries to fight their way! This was perhaps the most exciting part of the police car. This was a short 7 minute that went very fast before starting. The only true character that is designed is Mabel who loves charm and her face only with great eyes and looks like a celebration of hope here except, of course, when she is afraid. It's easy to see why he became a star. To a large extent because that I would suggest to see this at least once and why I have to give this 4.
