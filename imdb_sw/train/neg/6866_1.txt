This film has a very little class in comparison with Guests on Trains or even an emergency meeting for that, that despite the similarity of conspiracy I couldn't feel right to compare this to any of them. Yancy's character Butler reached as dopey dimwit I was also shy to the author and director to continue watching. I don't enjoy many live movies but I encourage myself to look at each other for the purpose of promoting harmony at home. I often cry silently but this film has caused me to cry loudly, stand up in the room and walk around the house engaging myself, before I return to my usual love-care seat. Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
