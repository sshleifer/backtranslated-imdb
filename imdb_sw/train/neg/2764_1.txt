First, I don't know how this film made a big screen. Yet not a movie under the SCI-Fi budget, which is very bad. I and a friend of films, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this film waiting for this movie to Transformers and dragons, entertainment without mind. All we had was an hour and a half-wise. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is very bad with the acting, designed for it. Its a golden natural Chinese return for every 500 years ... It looks like a good remake of Fire of Fire? No, the conspiracy tries to be worse than it should leave not just holes of conspiracy, but by magic, and a very real war between dragons (instead of a big snake) gets only ignorance. The director tried to add humor to the film that fails. My friend and I laughed about everything (with all 5 viewers), and we believed we were spending money on this. Short trailer on TV makes for many actions when the supply makes a break. I have seen many B movies like Reptilian, Cango, Spiders, and others, but I must say if you want to laugh without laughing for hours, see this. <br /> <br /> Stories: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Act: 3/10 <br /> I don't drink ... but it would have helped before watching this movie
