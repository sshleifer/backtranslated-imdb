What a crappy movie! Very bad! This movie is as entertaining as dead slug. Neither-talent-what-the-actors, plot plot. Who wrote this script? Was there a script for this goofy film or the director did just for accident on a record button on his camera and then decided to make the film when they continued? What? What does this mean for children or comedy movie or what? My younger brother is in grade 6. he and his fellow students did just a amateur movie for their school project that is not suitable for this movie of geeky. There is no excuse for this flick!
