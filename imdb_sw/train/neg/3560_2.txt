For me this is a story that begins with a funny joke about Franks paper forms when she is going with a staircase and when sitting at business meetings ... The problem is that when you look at this film for an hour you will see same fantasies / funny times once again and again. It is predictable. It has been made more like a television story where you can go away and return without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I would like Felix Herngren as Frank but not enough even when it comedy has to have more distinctions to some kind of message to its audience .... <br /> <br />
