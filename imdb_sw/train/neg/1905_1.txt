I am one of the greatest fans of the silent standers and perhaps surpass Buster Keaton movies to IMD than anyone else. Every film he gave from the beginning of his work up to 30s early and only two differences have been reviewed, so you can tell me I'm a great fan. It is because of this that I found this piece to be painful and hard to look. I loved this person's films and I have been thinking "Buster, how can you?". Well, now thinking about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton made a star in this horrible part of the TWILIGHT ZONE. He lost a lot of his fortune after a bad divorce in the early 1930s and his career of film as a leading man had passed too long. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurrection in popularity so he associated with anyone who would like to pay - to be seen in Beach movies and this clash of a great series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem and part is that it is very written and Buster is very appropriate. The show is supposed to be funny but not rather to adore to the silent film is painful to watch - especially with Keaton to keep that stupid when traveling up hats as well as all hanging slapstick. Do you recommend yourself, SKIP THIS ONE - it's copying the color of the greatness which once was the work of Keaton!
