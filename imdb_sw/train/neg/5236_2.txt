My friends and I saw this film last week and I feel it is very important to tell the whole world (or at least those who will read this) that this movie is not just about the worst five films that have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the same number. I have seen so many films but nobody hits this for a fool. you can say I realized ... my only pardon was that we were waiting for a few hours and they could not go anywhere without freeing our feet off. I don't recommend this to anyone. The first time I thought we were looking at a really bad porn movie but it was taken out after 10 minutes that wasn't. not a comedy, not a drama, not a step, not a panic, it's just awesome!
