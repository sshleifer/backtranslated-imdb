Even with the casting of names such as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland is unable to give any comprehensive meaning to this film. It is difficult to push the face of events that occurred on the night of July 1981. Kilmer looks just like John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth expecting two other jobs; as the wife of Holmes and the little girl, respectively. Some of the cast have very little responsibilities that are impossible to get any tests from them. Film is also star Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and cameo from Paris Hilton.
