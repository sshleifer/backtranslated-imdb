OK maybe 13 years old as I was limited for this film. Its on this beaten mouse, who lives in the palace. Then the canal mouse throws him down the toilet! He is approaching this mice city and meets the young mouse who has a desperate gem of a frog. He will do anything for this gem sends the whole army after these two mice. He plans to take the gem and flood the city of the mouse! This cool part about this movie is slugs. They make all the sound effects. They sing, dance, amazing, too good. The bottom row, a target of children aged 7 years. Other wise, a great movie to take a member of a small family to see. I didn't think animation was a real art of the dream though, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think slacked a bit on that. The movie was very good, not worth spending $ 9.50 for though, sorry.
