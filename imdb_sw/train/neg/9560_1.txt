Thank God I looked at this friend's place and did not pay. The program is very transparent and the whole movie has felt like a TV show. If you have any computer or electrical skills, see. You'll feel like a film is insulting to your mind. Also, the actor turned out a lot of Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst job I saw, without excluding porn. She is fortunate that Matt Lanter is very good. He is the one who bears the movie. I hate that I have lost two hours of my life watching this film! It is a shame that they should call it sequel, because I was a natural fan, which was very good.
