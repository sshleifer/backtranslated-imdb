I have seen many displays of fear over the years, like Nightstalker, which dealt with Wendigo's story, so I expected the spirit of anger caused by increasing the taste in the Halloween season. I was wrong. The whole movie creates a sense of events that occur which will be awesome and interesting, but offers a very simple story of retaliation and murder on a loss of certain property. Horror fears - not! This film has a lot to Cold Creek Manor, another completely lost. It gets harder and harder to believe anything of Hollywood puts forward on horrible movies, as they have never come up with anything original and spoon again. What are idiots that are paid for that bogus movie to be made? Go back to the drawing board, and do something important for these millions of green you should throw around.
