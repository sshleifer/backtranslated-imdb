** communicates with a few ** <br /> <br /> Sean Young (who has her hair, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) at the opening of this film. Sitting behind the police car waiting to announce the gun, his face and body are time and are worried. Unfortunately, once kraschta is located on the odds of young people will never change. This is a one-off actor. One can compare Young and executive play friends with a good friend, Arnetia Walker, to find out what is missing in Youth. Walker is open, emotionally, and easily at all ... for there is no obvious barrier between what he can have his feelings and expression. He is an open book. Young people, on the other hand, make a fun, self-conscious way you can expect your neighbor to take action is suddenly thrown into the stars in the film. Basically, he doesn't have a clue. <br /> <br /> For this huge void in the middle of the film, we are left to reflect implausiblities of the story. For example, after Miss Young was kidnapped by a follow-up criminal and locked in the closet, she breaks the door when she is left alone. In fact, he is wearing only in a bra and a panel, but in such a situation, with a psychologist because of the return at any time, would you go to the door ... or take the time to go to his gardener, take clothes and wear? I would like to think that this and other incidents are trying to suggest some kind of emotion confused by Miss Young's behavior, but young people cannot reach this kind of controversy. There are a few that affect the time in the film, like a short police interview with former criminal victims, but in general this is a trivial effort. It is very bad Miss Young adjusted when publishing a pair of comic film style that can be used by its shortcomings and some sparking (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because its floundering when trying to play real people is an oddly touch. Watch Miss Young try to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad festival.
