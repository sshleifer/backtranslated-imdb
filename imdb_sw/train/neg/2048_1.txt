1 is very good here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, although not really BOOGEYMAN was planted on the DVD cover and we all know! It hit me out. But this film, it's something else. By being led by a boy who has been around for a long time and has turned on many films, it looks like it was hit on the VHS camera for 10 years! Stories and acting are angry! David Hess, you have left me too. After playing one of the most dangerous criminals in the film history, have you used this? Stories and acting may be able to be forgiven, however, if anyone had taken time to make this video a specialist. There is a LOT shot on video films out there that is not available like that, or at least not very obvious that takes your attention from the film. I can't say it's the worst movie, because I couldn't make it through the whole film, but it is really close.
