This movie was what I expected to be when I first read casting. I would probably write an exciting letter of grace, it is a pity that they left it on the Howler's packet. Alberto Tomba was indeed a good skier but worthy to thank God (and we too) that they do not rely on his actor's skills to get his life. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even go very well on the continent without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful girl of blonde, and that's all. In fact he was not chosen for his extraordinary skills in great roles but more probably with his beautiful feet. However, I must admit that he may be a teacher of Tomba's role, because he is the worst actor than he is, and that's strange, especially considering that it is not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I saw that it was ridiculous and does not mean that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
