This movie is awesome if you listen to it. It is the perfect movie if you look at the color pictures on the screen - everyone without any connection to the next. I lost this film because I am a fan of David Bowie, and I am very happy with music. At last, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and tracking songs and dance were few and left something to want. The story of the story was true to return. I could not say whether it was on color issues in London in the 1950s or about export. For the first half of the film I was disliked by how cheesy it was but I liked the "no export" message. When the black began to be killed I thought my tape had been canceled. Maybe I spent half of two different movies? No, there was a "Cycle Cycle" and a series of drums. Sorry, but WWII is not something you can write music. At least not music that can be considered as "campy" as I have several times in this review. In general I would say this film can do better if it builds the mind and gives us the best actors. (And put David Bowie in him a long godmmit!) My bridge: C-
