This view cannot vary, is not connected to running in a "plot" (if there is a truth) and it also tries to be difficult to be modern (ignorance, out of the period and the style of the 21st century style of music used) and good (yawn: there are many very much made, scoured by jokes and animals.) Actors in his film are secondary to the youth plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's very good) loses through this film, enjoying herself as De Ville's original and leading from Sunset Boulevard! It's a film that is not very good looking. This is a very good example of bad and worthless. Even the Institutional Institute 2 had a conspiracy, a characteristic and acting approach. This does not. It's bad.
