I was playing on the Richard Burton films list when I got to this head I remember vividly since I first saw the cable in 1982. I remember the conversation from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazing. I remember the behavior of Richard Burton lost without losing, and then I remember how his inspiration did not translate to me. In short, I remember "Two Circles" because it was a very frightening thing. This movie came out when America went through a horrible period of horror and non-health or sexuality. Remember "Lagoon Blue" (and Brooke Shields other annoyances), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that are only visible on young sex, especially for adults. As a young man at this time, I have been devastated, along with an additional 70 and 80 years of sex, made from an unprecedented environment that can make it all, by saying. The "Two Circle" does not work or misuse, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it deals with the question of love between the young and old for the brave, if it is a total failure, a way. But honestly, it is one of the films you can * never * see * if you didn't see during their first flight because it was so bad. No one will ever get this permanent face to be distributed to the public again.
