Story begins slowly and nothing happens for a while. All stages are at the end, but it is not ideal because the film is interesting, but because the story is interesting. <br /> <br /> The funniest section is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia' Keitel really loses and the judge begins killing. Oscars for this person!
