There's nothing to say about this film, it's awesome. Acting and conversation are far from even respectful, the story of the hybrid was not widely said and the whole thing has hollow pits here and there. CGI is something you like to see. It's so amateurish that it makes vomiting. Only one thing on DVD was extra. Gag reel. Everything else, just waste time and money. I hope anyone will buy this, this is not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Simply away from this.
