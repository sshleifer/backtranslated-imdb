I think Micheal Ironsides function works should be high, as he has a star in this type of under the bud crap. Surely he can do better than waste his time in this waste. <br /> <br /> This movie can be better, if it has a good budget, but it shows regularly through the movie. There is one place on the outside station, which looks like, out of the front of the railway station, and I am a bet. There is one place that made this film 3, and shows the reserve storage space and take off on the lake, surrounded by forests. This had done well, but the remaining film, forget it. There is another area, which looks like an engineering plant, which I call, and it doesn't look like a space station as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a big budget low, useless to God Help Micheal Ironsides.
