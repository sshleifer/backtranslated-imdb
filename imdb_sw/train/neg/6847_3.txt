This was one film i wanted to watch every time when the promos were an eye catching with Govinda in such a horrible position that surprised them /> <br /> But the film is that good <br /> <br /> has a lot of flaws <br> /> <br /> start well until the killings everything goes well but the film fails when romance tracking starts between Govinda and Karisma and the following tracks <br /> <br /> then twist on Govinda and Tabu that in will leaves more doubtful and The flaws and then How to come Govinda returns in a lot of criminal from a poor villager? <br /> <br /> The last flashback is also long and also the whole match between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappoints Music is the same, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br> Govinda tries a negative position and makes it very good in it though overdoes a great thing when Karisma is good but irritating when with his tabu cry is the same Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between big screams and acting others is ok.
