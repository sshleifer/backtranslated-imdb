This movie is very bad is good - in an unusual way to funny. I couldn't stop looking, I was so surprised! It is like a parody of romantic pleasure, but not a parody. Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the wife of a revolutionary preacher who falls hard to Luke (Corey Sevier); The only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is the worst acting! Remember, he is not worse than other actors. You mean that the participants have * no idea * they are in the worst movie; they play directly. Everything about the film is bad: acting, script, love scenes, pacing, twists twists, choice of music. Tribal events are very interesting - first shot in the church, then the last words of Luke to Emily - I was still laughing with laughter. <br /> <br /> Of course Luke made a great weight of weight lifting and prison abunches, and we get to see a lot of his naked torso. That probably shows the film.
