It's fun of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, cheesy of humor, and so it's acting. But after all it is a basic movie of the soft, which is expected and it doesn't matter because you want what is sex. That puts me in the biggest trouble of all, there is hardly any of it. That makes you feel like you are watching TV at 3 am and independent movies are playing and what is being done by a child of a college who doesn't go anywhere in the industry. You have been left too long waiting for the actual sex scene, often you think something will happen, then just left hanging. One (perhaps two, or one and two parts) that actually may be somewhat interesting though. I personally cannot recommend this unless you found it in a clear bin for a dollar or two. If you are preparing a good movie and plot and good acting, you don't want this. If you are looking for a good lesbian movie, you don't want this.
