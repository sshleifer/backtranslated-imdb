I can't believe that the City of Muncie is very difficult to be aware that they will be embarrassed to let this show be done there. This period is like being beaten by the law enforcement officers. I have never been in my life to see anything so stupid in my life. If they have said that the comedy would be the same thing but to say the truth is a lie. I saw only once and I was amazed at what I saw. I wanted to see a little boy come in with a bad foot. It's a joke that you would be. No on the show was closer to the real world. The city of Muncie, the Police Officer, and all the officers should be put to shame and should never want to accept it from the city. Not surprisingly did not stay on TV
