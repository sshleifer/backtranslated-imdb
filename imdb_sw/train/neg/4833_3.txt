Yes, this film is a real thief. Stolen some of the shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another movie of the hero to promote acceptance (support?) For U.S. they are still fighting today. I don't really want to go here in politics, but come, this is more obvious than the summer atmosphere. The sad locker has nothing better, no real plot. I feel true in the 50 years of Hungary when the party told people what to love and what they did not like. The propaganda films were produced at that time, except that those were black and white. Even if we focus on this topic, the appropriate piece of the U.S. war. it's a kind of cool, certainly you have the best movies to choose.
