Where do I start? In the name of this film I expected a certain degree of legitimacy, at the end I had left the ground. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is Hollywood (or taking your film's hub) story freely according to some characters of real life. I had to have a clue when I heard a great emphasis on English giving an intro to a movie in German; The red text (title, artists) would have been a clue. 2. The story line was given (Lale was not taken by the Swiss parents of Rolf Liebermann, no news that Liebermann helped Jews deprive them from Germany, the original song was written out of The NS government did not have time to control, the record played on the station was taken in Vienna when Lt. was there during departure, etc., etc. The clothing is poor and incorrect for the time of the array (black uniforms used everywhere from the guards up to the positions of workers, these have left the daily use once the war started, etc.), the characters are stereo (SA invaders at once once out of power). Don't waste your time.
