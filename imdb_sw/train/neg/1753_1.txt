The writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer have had a great influence on my life as a Christian, and I expected to watch this film and find out more about her life. Words cannot express my desire. This film was included ... it did not provide a history of its life, no historical context, and nothing about its fine writing (except small records, and passed to "Teaching Cost" and its colleague at the beginning of the film.) Rather, we see her enjoys jazz (looks at the Nations) and appears with his friends before deciding to return to Germany. It seems to show his human side. Okay, I'm ready for the most part. The section that stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing it, we find very little love for a 17-year-old girl. If it is not true, it should not be a big part of the film. Now ... they are still waiting for a great deal, or some details describe all of his writings about ... or NASA to make us know a little bit of this person. dance-roll ..... wait ...... .... wait ..... ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives him the "Christian Movies" bad name. All they had to do was set up the structure of the film to follow, and some history ... even some sounds, or restrictions for him to preach from his work ... some details about who he had where he was. But no ... this is what we have. It is not suitable for the hero of Faith.
