Although I was hearing this film was a little dry, I look at anything Scott Scared at. At the beginning of this film I had a great hope of the classic but fun Scott-gets-a-ending ending up to 20 minutes before the end went great. The conspiracy was a trick and unexpected and very clever. I put your fingers crossed and would be a horrible misunderstanding, even until the credit was interrupted and I realized that there would be no fun and enjoyable ending. Unfortunately I was left unhappy that I would like to look at it very quickly and put some leap quantum to restore my belief in the goodness of Scott Great!
