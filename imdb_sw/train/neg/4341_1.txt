This was the cripples that I stole the DVD ... maybe half. It was very weak, I could not even pay more attention to tell you what I had done. I don't really blame the executives, because I think it was a script that could be dropped flat. I found myself laughing a few times, but I don't think that those lines had a keen interest. It's just a grace to save is that I bought it on the 2nd set of DVD and I would pay the price I made for the original only. This is one of those cases when they should allow the stand to stand alone.
