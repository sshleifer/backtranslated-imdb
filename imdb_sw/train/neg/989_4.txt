Well I saw about this film and I watched the preview to read almost all the comments and I had a hard time discussing if I should look at or not. Before I saw even the film I had emotional feelings about it. I wasn't sure if I would like to look at this and be confused for a long time. So, I choose the risk and look at it and ignore what I thought: Genesis started well for me. It seemed to lead in a positive direction. You have passed through the rape area and I didn't think why people were broken or tired of the movie. Do not misuse that the rape area was sad and frightening but it did not bother me for sure. Then when in the middle I came to understand what had happened that was going on. It was like a 5-minute shots without anything but people walking to talk or show nothing! The same thing to have a shot where a person shows some kind of feeling but this film did not have it. It had 3 trivial events, where you can see the main character of Maya kind of getting out of control but didn't show you the right to make me need to install. Then when he was doing hardcore work was not interesting but it is still small. Oh and if Rosario Dawson's note still did a great job. Straight to move forward after an hour of inexperience middle revenge is the focus on Maya. That was bothering. I had no bad feelings for him or anything he had what he deserved but the whole area was really bothering and I just felt after that. I did not tell him the truth or not to watch this film because it's so ... I don't know I don't know the word for sum sum up. But if you'd like to look at it not just be assured.
