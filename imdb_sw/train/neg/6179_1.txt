This movie is the second worst movie I ever seen (first being the Spirit of the Spirit). There is no conspiracy, climax, conflict, or any other important information required to display the image. This 'film' is another exemption for Toby Keith to show his male side and, 'very hard man'. I completely lost my time to watch this film. The best part would be the last features. If I am Ebert or Roper, I would like to cut my fingers and throw them to manufacturers. Anyone with their right mind gave Toby Keith the opportunity to act in the film film, it is evident in the same level of intelligence like him. In conclusion, don't waste your time watching this film, it may be the only thing you regret.
