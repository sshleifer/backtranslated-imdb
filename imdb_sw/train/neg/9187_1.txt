I watched the poor films in the past, but what dark they thought when they made this film. The production workers turned into a zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​making it, because you are sure that the brain of the brain can get any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many types and enjoy "shoot" em up "games, but connecting the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unknown. <br /> <br /> As many have already said, there was hardly any script and acting was weak. I can't waste my time explaining. Anyone who plays this film on 4 should be part of the production company or Sega, or maybe they have a modern concept of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> I must say, I was more angry with a video shop, who gave this finger up, which caused me to lease. Thank God I had a second film to watch back to my faith in movies. The comic book of the Comic book would be the same if he said "The worst movie ever"!
