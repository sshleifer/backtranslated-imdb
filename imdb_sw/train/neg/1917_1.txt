This film, though not bad, would have been done where real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was destroyed by no less than seven tornado on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located near the no-building, the coast of Platte River Valley in the county of Hall. The film makers were made on the hills covered by Ontario and migrated to an uninhabited city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this bad night just to forget because of the filthy film.
