Strengthen this game of the story of the county of sudsy, regulated in a special cut to "hard case." The main story is Loretta Young; he is on leave from a long prison stretch for murder. What? Will the doctors save his child at the expense of his life, or listen to her husband for the contrary? Melodrama and feeling are great, and not a kind of loyalty, say the least. For example, to keep moving things, this hospital has a psychiatric ward next to the reproductive ward, and allows a pregnant woman to walk around to steal children. There is only laugh and shock because this is recognized as Warners' film, especially from Glenda Farrell, who hits gin from his hot water bottle while trying to have twins that, with his pain, sees The law now against sale. Example of his repartee: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is certainly an authority as a great nurse, but do not expect to be given a good time. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that seeing a child turns anyone to mush. Even given a clear scope, this film would be better than it was.
