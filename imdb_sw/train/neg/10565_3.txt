You can give JMS and boys to pass this because they were at the beginning of their series with a small budget, but the movies are still small. Do you get me wrong, B5 series is the best series of TV ever, but if I was seeing this film, I'd like to order the series. I don't like O'Hare as an actor, dress is silly, and there are tons of cliches. This can say for the first first season (except Babylon Squared and Saved); Bruce immediately set fire in the series and continued to be a wonderful festival. If you are a B5 gun and havent you have seen this film, see. If you don't have a B5 fan, you don't have ... want to watch a series.
