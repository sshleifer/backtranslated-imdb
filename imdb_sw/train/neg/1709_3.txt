I got a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of the alternative names. On the contrary, this film actually has a better score on this site than the above mentioned head; which could mean that another is very bad! This film is too bad; you can certainly not go to a movie called 'Blood Bloodbath' and expect to see the hub, and precisely performs according to the head and the amount of the year shown… but all feel very old and exhausted, which is not supported by the plot and fools. It is your common nuclear waste that causes people to turn into zombies etc. etc.. The movie faces a sequence that sees people melt and that much of it lets you know what you are entering; low quality zombie garbage. There's a lot of run in the film, and it's really good work otherwise the film would be sad. Zombie Blood Blood looks very cheap, and it was installed open by unskilled filmmakers! The great influence was seen to be the best day of the Romero's dead, although it could be just about anything that shows the zombies and the gore. It all goes to an endless and useless end and in general I can't say I was attracted to it!
