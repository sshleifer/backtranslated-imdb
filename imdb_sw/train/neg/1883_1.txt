I didn't think it could be done, but something had come up and changed Open House- a low-budget budget for someone to kill on the high price of real estate - if the bad film I found in my short but otherwise sweet life. It was the best film in the most recent Montreal Film Festival, which leads me to believe that every other intervention should have empty-wall shots accompanying the people who read the poems. <br /> <br /> Watching this film was like a little piece of hell. It comes from Austria, and tries to get together with the Printing and Blue Velvet steps about different characters living in the suburban area and the lowest dark conditions. There is an owner of a pet dog and his wife's wife who is banned for him, his wife's wife who is living with him in a house that includes a room that has not been cleared by her dead child, a striking woman who strikes ten lists. The list continues. Forever. Much like two hours with me I spent on that reminder. Yes, characters are interactive, but not by cunning or interesting or even appropriate. I could not say if they were as good as actors, as, according to the headlines, they were given lines that were similar to Austria as "You are very lame!" They certainly did not need to learn a lot, because each time he repeated the same direction at least three times in the area. <br /> <br /> This is not a Gummo, or any of the movies mentioned earlier. There is no detection technology, and nothing to consider in the future unless you have to change "never put it in the movie" policy (which a few spouses performed during a random area - and if it looks interesting, not, unless you are one of the people A few who do not get the idea of ​​your parents to have sex- and for a few middle-aged, for boot-revolting. <br /> <br /> This movie was angry with me. It is not a strong weakness, not a string, not a terrible event that involves a gun. I was angry that someone used the money to do so when there were competent writers and filmmakers out there looking for money. I was angry that someone out of the city would go to see the Dogs and went out wondering if that was the best for us the sellers of money. Above all, I was so angry that, somehow, people involved with the festival seized everyone by believing that the king had a beautiful and beautiful dress when it was clear that he was as naked as a female woman doing striptease. <br /> <br />
