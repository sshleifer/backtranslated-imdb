I saw this movie on the playground. As soon as I gave him my cashier, he said two words that I had never heard on the playground, before or since: "No restoration!" Once I heard those words, I would have lost my money and went home. But no, for foolishness, I came in and saw movies. This movie did not make anyone in laughter. Even once. Even certainly! Naturally, we sat there quietly. Every ten minutes or so, someone would cry "This SUCKS movie!" The audience would scream with enthusiasm, then sit there quietly, exhausted for ten minutes.
