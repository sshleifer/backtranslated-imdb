When Bondarchuk was not a young man when asked to work on this project, he was still novice director with only one picture, and to cope with the success of a small WWII story, in his name. Bondarchuk was undoubtedly ready to become a star star for a decade but the skills of Thespian means a little behind the camera, and if the director was woefully not ready to prepare for that level. And it shows through the bulletin tracks that are particularly seen in the squares of the group, often the chance of unfortunate cameras, the quality of the variant of the director was very evident and the magnitude of the workmanship seemed to be left for their own equipment, voice sounds non-audio as radio announcements. Notes and “Peace and Peace” are the main reasons that led the Soviet Government to avoid any costs on this production. The image of the Vidor of the USSR was made entirely. Bondarchuk wanted to carry out the most powerful Hollywood film and find his own Audrey. His last choice, Lyudmila Savelyeva, a big dark-colored color is really similar to Hepburn. Unfortunately he was a Kirov ballo player without experience or talent, so the very unpleasant word that I can find to describe his performance is "bad." Although it may be expected that the Soviet actors, speaking the same language as Tolstoy characters, would have better understanding than foreigners but this War and Peace often proves that it is not necessary. The coup revived the top layer of the Russian traditional soil, that the World War and Peace came out, so a good part of many Soviet actors involved in this production often seem insignificant as Americans doing Shakespeare (I don '' means American actors cannot play Shakespeare with honesty, but you will know what I mean if you have seen American members made in Branagh's change. Of the three major actors Pierre of Bondarchuk is interesting, but he was even too old for that part and feels out of place in advance.
