I saw this movie with other Indian friends on Christmas day. A quick overview of this film must be AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and had no work of these works. The movie describes the story of Pakistan's attempt in 1999 to capture part of the Kashmir crisis region from India. As a true source, you get a hint from the film of the Indian army that had to restore the area from Pakistani soldiers - who took the top land. But instead of telling them what is a compelling and heroic story, all this film makes the look of Indian military being delicious and stupid, which I know is not true. I watched this film and almost all Indian listeners, who were very patriotic and liked it like this film, but also found themselves laughing in events that didn't mean to be funny. <br /> <br /> The Script was not possible. It gave them the impression that Mr Dutta did not know anything about the army that was working and was using the worst of war movies for memory. The result is a script that does not have the brain and repeat. <br /> <br /> Acting from most principals was not stellar, but based on the given script, I am very hard to refuse. As for cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> Editor was also very bad. It was very difficult to follow what went on for a lot of time, and music would suddenly leave the scene. Good things: cinematic movies were good, although it was a little hurt by the fact that the movie was not found to be modified (the proportion of colors often matched significantly within the events). Also, his songs in the film were very happy - for the first half always or so at least the lines. Unfortunately they remained longer than LOT than they should have them. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This is the FOUR HOURS IN. There is enough here that a good editor can almost cut a good movie at 1.5 and 2 out of what was hit. Sadly, a good editor was not working on this film.
