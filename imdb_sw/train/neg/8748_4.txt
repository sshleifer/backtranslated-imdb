It was amazing to see how accurate the text is in the buzz words, but it's not so cheap in the corporate world. The Department of Justice could get more of the great corp chiefs if they did such stupid things to win. The real world of corporate is the most subtle and attractive, but every bit is bad. I doubt any doubt the corp would actually kill someone directly; even mod is more direct these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, tablets, toxins, etc.. This movie must be developed by geeks, geeks, I think, and the label doesn't know different. They just wanted a dedicated thing to Microsoft's lack of credibility in the news.
