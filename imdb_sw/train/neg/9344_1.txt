If others said this film is a burden of the drivel of attention to the intellectual or the eyechists. <br /> <br /> We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid houses that Scotland is one of the most repressive areas in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid houses without a good dose of humor or a legitimacy of false legitimacy as this does not work. And even more important without a good script of the script will not work with nothing new, exciting or causing thinking on the script of this film. The fact that this movie won Bafta's several shows how bad the UK film industry is at this time. I thought the movie industry of Aussie was very bad at the moment but unfortunately the UK industry is worse. This movie is too bad to not bother the rental from the week's section. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself a permit and give this film wide.
