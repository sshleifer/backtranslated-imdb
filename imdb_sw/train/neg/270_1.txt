I am looking at it now in pink (TV channel in Serbia) and I must say this is a crap. Evil, no acting, harm is also meaningless, who made this series? This was a stupid attempt of Studios to make more money on the success of the film. OK. The film was good in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you see how idiotic lines are located in the speech of the characters. I mean, do you? They paid someone to write it, was a certain family on the studio? This is not SciFi. The film was a bomb, a series of triggers.
