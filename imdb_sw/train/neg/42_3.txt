Among the three names from Jess Franco to find their way to the official list of DPP Video Nasty (Devil Hunter, Bloody Month and Women Back to Baa) this is probably the most necessary to be identified, that is a very frightening clunker of the jungle slightly planned with a little college to avoid, part of rape rape, and loads of weakness. The beauty of the blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the film star Laura Crawford who has been taken by a group of brutal killers and taken to a tropical island off the cliffs of the tribe who worship the 'god of the devil' which emerges in the jungle (the great nature, the naked, with the color of the gun that loves to eat the hearts of female female sacrifices). Employee employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million package, a brave soldier Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and a Vietnam airplane to travel to the island, but faced with trouble when bad men try to cross . During the chaos, Laura runs into the jungle, but runs straight into the island's arms, who offers to their god. Franco leads to its usual torpid style and carries this fascinating effort to its usual awesome destination: blowing movies, cinematic movies, quick zoom, multiple shots, out of photos, effects bad sound, and editing of ham. The result is a fierce aggression which is a real struggle to stay from the beginning to the end (it took me several meetings to end the matter), and even saw the luscious Buchfellner in its natural glory is not enough to give me this revisit this film quickly.
