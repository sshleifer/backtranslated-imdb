This movie is awesome! They are the opponents "Ishtar" for a number of good disgrace. I would like to weigh down 3, except for a few funny lines; but, in general, this film adorned! It seems like they did on a weekend in a certain bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth is supposed to join Elaine May on the eternal leadership ever!
