I was looking at this show by the characters and the fact that Scott's relatives were involved. Unfortunately my hopes were lost! However we are led to believe that KGB is a group of people who do not know what they are doing. At one time there is a despair area where 4 KGB agents cannot handle a single CIA agent. I am exhausted by these suggestions, directly with the wrong image of the spy game that continued during the winter war. I find that it is a fear that the United States cannot make a film about their involvement in WW2 and more. Like the horrible U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States received the Enigma machine, again, quite a lie. <br /> <br /> For its credit, "Company" has been done well and implemented. The district is also very well recognized. Alfred Molina puts a good performance like Keaton (The collision between them is very good). I really liked to show this show and I will definitely finish watching the other 2 sessions but I wish that the American crop stops trying to show its members, servants etc. as they are mentally and physically supermen than anyone on the planet. It gets fast and focused because of what might be 10/10. S /
