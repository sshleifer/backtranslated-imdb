It is a good film for kids who love dog. It moves slowly but soon ends like a flurry of gooped up De Vil. The basic plan is the same as the first movie. The bright part of the movie for adults is a talking bird that thinks it is a dog. Birds speak like man (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and strikes like a dog. It's a comedy which the film is needed more. Look at the pastor so you don't have to pay the full price or wait to appear on Disney.
