I have seen many bad films. Often I can enjoy the film of the crappy fear of why it is. But this takes evil for so many things. It is a bland, a plot for what has not gone anywhere and takes its time on it. No shock, no fear, no doubts, just the burden of boys twists themselves for an hour and a half and then finish quickly. <br /> <br /> Blight on a variety of crappy fears, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
