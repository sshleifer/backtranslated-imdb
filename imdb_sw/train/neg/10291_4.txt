80 minutes, and it felt twice a long time! Short Crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes or so they consist fully of the dialogue (more than a guide, true) of a woman approaching middle age, with droning on "men," lack of passion, sex, aging, and recent breaks, in French boy met in a restaurant. The permanent perspective goes on when they go to the tariff, and on the bar, where his commitment to self-devising is dismissing him. "Stories" can not end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to more drone as he brings him to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What's a little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything in this whole film has more than rantings bitterness is not hard to justify the rental price unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens all the time. Yes, the end is very good, but it is a good reward for engaging in what is the same as turning your living room into a regular therapy session with a narcissistic whiner. In fact, other people like that. I would be wrong.
