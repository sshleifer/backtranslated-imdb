It has a very serious act. Line of bad story. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it. REAL HIO. Or you like for the next 30 minutes. It should never be done. It's not good. You should never see it. Then even a little. So now, if you want to watch this show, please don't do it. Call for CW's Smallville. Or Disney Channel of Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, That's the best family exhibition. So you believe on this, I have looked at it before. and it's honest, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen many TVs. So I love grace, and never look at this show.
