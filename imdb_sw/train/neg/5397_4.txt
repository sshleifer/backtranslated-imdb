I think this is one of the most vulnerable of the work of Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian. After great effort like Ado Mingi About No, etc. I thought this was bad. Sent it was weak (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) but my big gripe was that they engaged in the work of Bard and cut some play to put in the music / drums guide. You don't just make Shakespeare and then mess and play. Sorry, but that's just right. I like Cole Porter as a second person, but jeez, don't do with Shakespeare. Skip this and check "Prospero Books" if you want to see Shakespearean's Mimbingu effectiveness.
