Silly, often worried about landing on a space ship and causing danger to Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people in his cycle. They are always surprised by Daniels. He showed the depth and promise in the "Conditions of Implementation" of 1983 as Shirley MacLaine's wife. For years ago, Daniels can not keep his hands on a good role, with meat. Instead, he has in comedi such as "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> For this image, it fails because of the issue. At least, the television show brought a different situation. In this film, we have a constant slapstick and people turn into monsters as the government faces a Martian-Martin capture. Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of non-successful film. On TV, Pamela Britton showed an individual who was found in the situation and the fun and happy. In the film version, the gun-gun like Brown, tries to be sexually assaulted. Star television Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent, or is it true that? Too much for those who enjoyed the television show very much.
