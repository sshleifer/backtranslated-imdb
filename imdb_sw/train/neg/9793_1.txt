Mighty Morphin Power Rangers should be a bad television show ever made. There is no plot, just a group of costly children using martial arts when wearing second grade spandex clothing. Special effects are seen as they are from '70, clothing looks like something out of bad comedy, and the show is just too bad. Something more than a television show is a toy, just the second level of plastic waste fed to our children. <br /> <br /> There is much better to show your kids looking! Try to give your children something like Nickelodean, those that really show the mind behind them, different from power rangers.
