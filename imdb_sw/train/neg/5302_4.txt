Dewaana as the film flows through the usual clich√©s. The man and woman love with love and marriage, the husband deserves to be killed by a family friend who wants to be lucky with their family, the captive woman and the surprise husband of no one. The movie reminds you of Yashni Yash Chopra and many others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan offers good performances. Amrish Puri as a man is going through and not more than the normal level of bollywood Music and Nadeem Shravan is good, all the songs were brilliant. My recommendations are Sochenge or Koyi and koyi chaiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that flows through motion.
