I don't know about you, but I've always felt welcome to 'ART' movies. The first film I could find was Peter Greenaway's "Cook, Thief, His Wife and His Lover", which gave me my attention and spiret of creativity in growing. The film was the last, good and good identification ... this is 'cinematic art' was near, to explore intellectual thinking and bring visceral to the screen for a purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in the madhouse, and the art shows shows why it is. I like all kinds of movies, but especially those who enjoy and have something to say, if I agree with the situation or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN", is dry, clinical 'comedy' where the father and child gather harem to delete their many sexual fantasies. There is a very brief description for Fellini in the film, different from the proposed. The main purpose of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between the father and the child, bringing it together after the death of the mother. In the early stages of the grief of the father is reliable, you can feel his pain. What happens next is clear to the Greeneway levels, the gathering of the harem, the observation of love and death, and the flesh shown for the flesh ... One can say this, but I feel the movie being inferior and useless. And the idea that this can be comedy is amazing to me. Acting in a great way, ... especially good is Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although the poor Mandy should put on her clothes again) What the film lacks is a compelling story, and usually Greeneway touches most of the most amazing films . When filled with the time of awareness, and the regular taboo, "8 1/2 Women" are also cut and knit to be considered art, also interested in 'funny', and also very young to be considered to be beneficial. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
