I hate this program: not only this concept is very bad, but it tries to be very difficult (something that was left out of the same "I confess" last plans like, Muder: He wrote). Right. Why can the authors not have enough intelligence in this plan to come up with evidence that will be able to cling to the decision in court? <br/> <br /> Come: after X years of incompetent cases, why should everything be loaded, every type of episodes * to clarify * (damn it!) for killing which otherwise will not be resolved? I bet bet all the police want that criminals were good citizens: "Aw, shucks, officer, you are sharp - I think if you have revealed enough to make sure I did it, I can accept and make it easier for you in court." br>> Dogs are quite s ** t with insults for those who have enough mind even heard about IQ
