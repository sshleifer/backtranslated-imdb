This cannot be the last film of Mandy Schaffer. Man, do something! : - () / What is a little life that this could have, leading to the expiration. Do not blame the cast, they have done well. has done very well, and did not even go into the film until half. And please please please put Mandy in the other movies! <br /> Two special complaints, if anyone cares (no one likes this film too) First, Traci's way continued to increase in the melodramatic moments, to see what he had to see, and was not seen to return, was and very bitter .. Hollywood: Please stop giving the perfect villains during luck that goes out especially when the peak reaches. It's dumb writing the best scripts so they don't need to use any stupid device again. . <b r /> <br /> Second, Carmen did not want to fall En for the trick of the trick that Traci had. Already had Traci with fingered. Write the worst / lead there. I could destroy this film more but mercy restrains it. Of course I had no hatred as some do. It had no great reason to be made, unless it was just a car showing the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and for anyone who didn't think he was sexy ... character was not very written, but how can you say he wasn't sexy ?! One or one of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me. THE WORLD OF THE DEAD. (Not confused with "Moore, Mandy" - though I would like to see him again .-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I mentioned is hope Mandy makes me more movies? <: - D
