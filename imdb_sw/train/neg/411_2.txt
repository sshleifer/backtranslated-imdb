I don't usually feel a lot of motivation to comment on movies that I don't like, but in a case like this, I need to say something. This movie is awesome, unknown, and stupid. There are many mistakes in the story of the story which I will not feel must explain because it's time for me to continue this experience. The most despairing error is, however, that there is no meaning in any film that explains whether the spirit of the moral character is due to a powerful journey or psychological reaction to its condition. It is a great deal, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done good things (Robocop player on DVD is better). However, this film is stupid and generally not approaching the point or technical essence of the issue, and rather it solves the point of predicting without any enjoyment. In short, such as other inspections here (say I have read them before ...) - Stay away from this film!
