This film thinks that "light stories" about Santa Claus and "magical and mysterious wonders". But instead comes as bad. Two things in this movie that emerge in my mind as terrible are 1) how Santa sees. Have you ever seen Santa Claus more awesome? and 2) "The worst answer of Satan" Dance is just an odd dance is just a touch look. Just watch this film if it happens to be MSTed version or if you like a very good noise. I can't believe this is a children's movie.
