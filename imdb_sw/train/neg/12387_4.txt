Lipstick is a failure of one film cycle. I try to think of one good thing I could say about the movie, and I have trouble coming up with something. I've ever met, but it would be better. It was very interesting for the eye to see. The sets were very sandy and beautiful to see. I felt like Anne Bancroft's behavior was the only possible character in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon losing his time on this.
