Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> According to the director of video games Uwe Boll tries to repeat the game with the nail of nail nail for sadly he failed. Instead he makes one of the worst movies MADE! Even though it gets a little celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff's film does not have a basic foundation that the movie needs to be as good as the story line, and the basic relationship of what's going on in the dark and light. Movie blows round and Uwe Boll has no control over creativity. And not to mention the bad CGI used in making monsters. Even though they seemed cool and the pastures were good, a little blind. Certainly this is one of the worst films made. My last rating 0/10.
