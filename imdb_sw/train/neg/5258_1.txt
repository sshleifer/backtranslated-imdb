Well, I used this movie and I found it quite appropriate. It is about the family and the mother of the mother and the same fight of stupidity in the family, then a good child comes with her stupid camera and likes to take a picture of a damaged building with good things and a wonderful film, and then asks her father to take her on a trip second and agree, etc. etc.. ..... They go to the city where no one knows where they are (blah blah blah) and the worst thing is that the movie has stopped and you still can't understand what MOVIE! I have seen so many films but that was worse, it really doesn't contain the details and I would not see it.
