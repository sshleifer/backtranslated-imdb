Okay, I remember the first one, and the boy did it. After watching it, I just laughed and told, "oh boy, just another budget below B-movie I never saw part 2 for this." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, there are two parts. It appeared even more. But, I laughed again and said, "there is no way I see part 3 for this." Then, about 1/2 a year later, part 3 came out. I was a good fool to hire a boy, I was playing after watching it. God, I have never noticed how much movies can spend these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not lease the entire series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
