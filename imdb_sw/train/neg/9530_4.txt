I think this film is based on true story .... It's about two young girls who hate an adult for 48hrs; I don't see where the fear comes here .... There are some "motion" and "surreal" in the film. And two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play the roll of two psychological-man opponents. .. they do a good job (although some of them are tad on). The movie is not good, and not bad, it's really true! I mean that this phenomenon is spread for 70 years. It's not too bad if you like that ... you know ... what is that?
