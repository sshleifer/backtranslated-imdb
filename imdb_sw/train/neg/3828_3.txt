In 1976 in the west it was a good type and the filmmakers knew it clearly. Instead, instead of freezing the project and saving us from watching it, they continued to do so. It seems to require an interesting thread to get the audience to come and see the film, they decided to make it as bad as possible and possible violence. Hell, it worked for the Wild Bunch and why is it not recommended to work here? Of course, the Wild Bunch was useful to a good script but the script of The Last Hard Men is an ancient old garbage. It is difficult to know what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to them roles. Heston has a retirement management supervisor who follows a striker led by a striker (Coburn). The hunt becomes more personalized when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) has been kidnapped by prisoners and faced with sexual damage. <br /> <br /> This is a blood film that every time someone dies is shown for more of the above details. It is very sad, because the star of the stars appears as the prospect of drinking the mouth. No sense of speed or speed in the film either. It takes life to go, but when the action finally comes is caused by the emphasis on destruction. All in all, this could be the worst film that Heston has ever done. I am sure it is one of the crops that would like to include in its wonderful CV.
