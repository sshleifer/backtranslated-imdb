This is one of the movies that make you think: Is the Hulk "Right to America" ​​Hogan done the same? Actually I don't think so and he could be right. I am an Italian, I can't boast of my country for many reasons, but I did not want for another team (French, for example), just because I love Juliette Binoche. In addition to the protagonist did not fall in love with the British girl at the end of the movie but with a colleague of the country, so why they attack Yale. In addition to acting, well, all players are doing very badly. And then, you know, I hated that "dead community of the dead" sky. In fact that is another movie I like.
