I tried twice through this film, the first success - and it was like to pull the teeth - and the second failure despite the massive transfer of DVD. Problem? It's very simple. If you can find a strange court area, which takes more than half of the film, you have made it, but it's hard to reach that point. There is an interesting conversation with "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end is touch as Lincoln goes and puts his image on a screen. It is a good, good story, but it is missing the first half and discourages the viewer from the execution there. I think Abe Lincoln was actually more interesting than this film.
