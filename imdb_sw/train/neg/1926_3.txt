After being forced by my children to look at this at least 10 times each of the last two Christmas days, I feel enough to graduate the sentence on this version of Dr Seuss' tribal stories, and well ... not very good. First, after a normal act like a TV series Chuck Jones would be difficult for anyone, but this definition is too heavy and closed so you can lose. I will admit that there are very few of the wind, but in general the film comes as a grab money, at the same time as worthy to ban Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually up here, but that's exactly the opposite of the Grinch behavior. As explained by Boris Karloff, it was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no Carrey's spiritual way, and that is the most obvious mistake made. Talented artists like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely destroyed here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will only take on the role given (such as a man of his country, Michael Caine), but this needs to be closed under "Movies not to be done." This is not recommended for Cat in Hat, and even a thin tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I feel that I will make the same recommendations as I have this: wipe it, and either read a book or watch a special TV. This is 2 hours you can never, return again.
