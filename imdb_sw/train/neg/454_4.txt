The highest level of screened movie that empowers and clever conversations and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the main story of love. Cher almost makes for this with its effect on the turning of the cage and out of control body body. Cage never gets in his role. He tries everything he can think and comes as an actor rather than a real person and that's what is needed in the story of love. Cage has had that kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of Jimmy Stewart's behavior. Cage continues to take on these roles, perhaps because he likes these types of movies but his strength as an actor is not independent, although he has found the best and regular experiments. He should leave this kind of responsibility for uncomfortable practitioners who are actively involved in films and the use of energy and many talents in the more roles and films where he can become his most attractive person.
