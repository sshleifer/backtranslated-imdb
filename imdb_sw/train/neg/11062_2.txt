Way to go to Ace! You have made a fascinating, fascinating event of the cannibal of necrophiliac in soft, exciting signals. It is definitely a movie called Dahmer will be one of two types: Fear, or document document? This was not. It was not close to any deep truth, (it really didn't have anything at all) was not worried or scared or did not try to worry too much (if you would like to try it). Hell was what the author / director thought? Here is one of the REAL examples of ordinary casual killers and we are being shot badly, not being raped for homosexuals and long droning spirits at a time only in the home of the old parent. I think Jacobson was trying to present (or produce) 'a little' side of j.Dahmer.
