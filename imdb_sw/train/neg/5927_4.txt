I am a very good political man, so when I say sex I mean a female guest, Dr Miranda Jones played with Diana Muldar. in spite of all its beauty and control, there is nothing in it but a big, unintelligent young person. envy, but it started first. (You think she could walk in the room with her eyes closed and freezing the box, very easy) takes Business in a place outside the galaxy outside of the boys. Well, the ship is stuck in a bato, at that time they could go to a good doctor's doctor and discussed. "Spock needs to make sense of mind and Medusan so that we can come back home. I mean if the beetch want to stay adrift until we run the equipment and die?" But the true fashion woman Star Trek is envious monsters who cry and mourn when the idea ends, even when her image of Medusan told her to fast and go with them. Therefore, these contaminants have been hit by Spock caused by forgetting to keep his seats that make Spock go insane. Kirk, usually, noted what was essentially and had deceived him in fixing his attack on his telepathic power. Of course, eventually Lady and Medusan leave and all are forgiven. You almost want President from War Star Galactica demonstrated jettison witch out of the airlock for his stunt damage. But in the Star Trek country, women are allowed to be totally unethical and cruel, but at the same time there is a sense of gender equality. This is what I mean to man.
