Budget, dignified executives ... who knew these things were important. Don't waste your time on this junk piece. Side effects are broken. Acting is a crap. The only thing that could do so even tolerance was cheap T&A and lost for the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only way of remoteness about this movie is very dirty. It was as if they had only 7 people on the planet who had never been cursed before. Hats off! If you want to see a certain dude in a bad suit just go back and see old pictures of chicken. The only way Flick Bigfoot is good is to have a big budget with other actors who have not come from Frogballs Community Theater.
