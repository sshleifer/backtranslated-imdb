I can't believe that this film has ever been created. I think the director's point is trying to make it a piece of artistic but this makes it worse. Zombies seem to have used many eye shapes. Zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are perhaps five or six total zombies, definitely not a nation. A good part of the movie, if there is one is definitely credit because painful experience eventually ended. Again repeating some comments of users, the voodoo pastors are amazing and do not have many minds in the entire movie. Also, there is a place where the snake and the girl of romania have no meaning at all. Never explained.
