So, Steve Irwin. You should praise a person who is not willing to throw himself into a river that is completely full of crocs, snakes, sores, raw tons from the previously mentioned creatures, and mud, not daily, but eagerly. He was not able to make me want to do it, but he could make his wife come closer. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fit into my parallel world film - film for people who were just their teeth hit, have migraine, or have no film experience and therefore as mediocrity stability (currently full of films) Disney). It's too loud. Yes, Steve is too heavy. He is just happy all the time, and he would be cut through the boy's blas√© (I can hear now: "The film was STUPID") or Tylenol and codeine. I would like to say his passion is being infected, but if it were, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has never happened. I admitted it was beauty, but I still can't see them. <br /> <br /> Plot was really predictable. The wicked were very bad, for a minute when I thought I was shopping on a superstore consumer consumer. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, that's why I watched it. The plot (if you call it) was actually more than a reason to cast another croc into the truck. My expectations were low and aligned in that way. I was hoping, though, there would be a second line, where Steve and Terri (have worked with their practical skills) have a movie and a real plot and many fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve again. I hope that Terri and children continue to participate in Australia Zoo and the detection center, at least. I can't imagine seeing the crocodile without having another member of the Irwin family tell me very strongly how strange it is croc. Crikey!
