This film is about the life of the person that happens. His business fails, and he cannot share his wife despite many attempts. <br /> <br /> The program is a complete chaos. It's just meaning. In fact, nothing in the film is meaningful. The story is well explained that I cannot understand. It is embarrassing, because the sets and clothes are done well, and they seem to stimulate enough. Shots are included in all films. However, these aspects of redemption still do not create a bad plot and tell the poor story. I am surprised by the great names that agreed with the stars in this film. It's a loss of that talent. This film is very bad. Avoid !!
