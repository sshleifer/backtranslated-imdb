Rookie faces a lot. There are random music tracks that are introduced through the film, a long-term unsupported script and enough urine to make Jerry Lewis sparkle. Noonan and Leavitt do not know when to stop. It takes a full hour before the story comes to the main plot and the characters break the ship. Then the boys begin to play in the Japanese marine and the usual color of the day's color. It is a disgrace to the funniest parts of the movie is when Noonan and Leavitt play young Japanese, ignorant. But, it gets tired after turning and returning between two sets of characters. Then it approaches suddenly. Even naked Julie Newmar in the fabric can not save this. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the movie and it's more than half an hour too. This story unfolds while trying to establish a funny and defeated situation. Put to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had a charm and Jerry had the same face of animation.
