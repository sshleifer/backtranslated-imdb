After seeing only on the TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It is clear that when the stars are seen stars, they do not run the round. First, they are broken into two groups - Moe, as "Short" and Larry and Curly as a migration pair, so there is no full work of the perfect team. The story of love that triggers the plot is not very good, two women are alone with any ability to act, there is another group of music music that is not required, unless you think their attempts to be sad to be sad. Music is tiresome, they drive on the ranch and then hang on the horse, wear west of the dorky is silly, and there are a lot of non-speech films on the camera. By the way, this is clear after the first stroke of Curley, and its level of reduced energy is clear. Vernon's blood appears early in the role of secrecy. I liked everything that these people have ever done, including non-curley things, but this small scale is very good.
