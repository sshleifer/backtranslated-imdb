For anyone who doesn't know and c.S. The book for Forrester this film should be interesting. It is a color, it has done well and shows the top adventure, but for those who know the original stories are awesome. I can't stay that way. Some reason screens seem to be forced to return the stories they do. Of course, the word spoken is different from the written word, and there are some periods that can be difficult to film. But, why do the authors rewrite the story instead of just doing it? In this case the external writers did themselves. <br /> <br /> Only a few examples: There was no mutiny on Known. Officers took the ship after the semi-semi-lost Captain who was completely missing through the hatchway-for the reasons mentioned but never given. There was no military court. The inquiry court was carried out in a near-praise manner. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor Col. wife. Ortega. He himself, never had in mind or ship or beach. There are many aspects of the Forrester story. <br /> <br /> For a technical basis, I think the regular use of the device to the back of the device hurts the development of the story. Why, oh why why the screens were supposed to destroy good news?
