This film, released earlier in Christmas, in 1940, was a long-term thought. Very bad text is raised and made CD, now sold. Don't give it! The film is very bad. Compose is poor, the script is bad, and the guide is afraid. <br /> <br /> Photo of Roland Young and singing. And that was something to promote. Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
