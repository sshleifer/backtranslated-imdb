It is one of those dramas that are so bad that it is approaching the point of being very interesting, the script is quite realistic, the horrible direction, the only quiet lighting, the only thing that stops from really not bad is to feel good is that the sound design is bad completely; it adds no stress to the story though it tries hard, but without at least destroying any speech. There is a persistent trouble with the shots out of the door. And finally the end but not an awesome option. For professional production it is highly felt for the university media project should feel sorry for anyone who should put their names for this.
