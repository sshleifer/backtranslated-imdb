I felt that I should look at this film all the way, since I found it in bin bargain and bought it for myself, but I've come many times to wipe it out and just write the money I paid. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is the same. If there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the use of artificial blood and body parts to the effect of the disease. If that doesn't work for you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This movie is being hit on home video cameras, with grade school props and awesome actors. It's a German name, but even allowing it, the voice is bad. This film is about the budget as the budget gets, except for the specific effects mentioned earlier. If they had spent less money for executives with a real script instead of blood and guts, the film could be more fun. The story is about three men who live on an island with an army of tin-masked heroes. They are captured, and some of the movies are about their attempt to avoid. I will call this story in the meaning of the loosest, for it is actually a series of torture events and combat with connectivity and unrestrained conversations. Nothing / nothing about liberty about this film, unless you like a useless cloud. Imagine yourself warned.
