Here is a movie and good cast and good work to look at the area but they just don't. Director Richard Brooks should be a little tired at this stage of the game; Is better than his authors! The horse and all the steps were seen in slow motion even during non-slow events. This film is needed to be captured, if anything. That horse lather certainly looks bad to me and tracks definitely tracks when those tracking desert - just lazy. good work. Very bad. Workers did well, but I have indeed seen all of them doing well. Ben Johnson is always happy, though. I first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; he was desperate and went on to face a second 30 years later.
