Julia Roberts struggles her efforts to overcome her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with these incidents of domestic violence, but it is hard to imagine she could finish working as a strong and convincing (and winning oscar) as did Erin Brokovich according to the back of this garbage. Do not make the bones on it, not more than Julia Roberts, but unfortunately, its performance is not much more than it. The program has all the night-to-night features of the night, and not under the impression that it will give you any insight into the dark world of domestic violence because there are no characters who have been beaten out enough for you to care true. <br /> <br /> Finally despair and exciting, without the name of Roberts on the head, I am sure it would have fallen quite, deserved.
