In fact, who in the name of God gave this film a rating 8.1? I think people who actually did or listed in the film were voted. Otherwise this movie comes! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or maybe a student, a film. I am a fanatic of the film, and I have seen horrible movies, but there was nothing to redeem here. Stories and acting were very bad to me. Props, including the use of airsoft toy guns and special effects of horror, where it is as bad as everything else. I am in bad language in movies, but F-Bomb has dropped on every third word and I think we can have a winner with a lot of F-Bomb in any EVER movie. The film also seems to have been done using the cheap video cameras and not the real film. I would like to expect this award for an amateur movie shown on public access centers around the world, but not on DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't give this film. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that this was a bad waste of coupon rental movie free. This is a valuable time that you cannot return. Unfortunately for me, that time is gone, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning.
