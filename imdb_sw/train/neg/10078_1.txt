Boy-girl likes thing / series and songs, just this time he is punkette and he is the direct arrow. Movie sessions out there like this film? Has fans? I must say, the mind makes it ... "Grease 2" is a limping business that does not even have courage, snakes or strong gas to take note of its predecessor under fire (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it slows at slow speed and often only dies. It seems and feels cheaper, and is thrown in large quantities between unhealthy patterns and poor handling. This was the first time many viewers photographed Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she did not find herself, it is a responsibility to forget to forget. Attack on very low levels. NO STARS from ****
