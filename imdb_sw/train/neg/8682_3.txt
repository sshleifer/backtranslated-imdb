I want to start by saying I am a republic, although I disagree with many aspects of the bush being done in the office. And I like daily shows and Colbert's report. They should be two favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the joke of the bush in Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the best person to walk around the world (I believe he is not a sleeping man.) But it comes time when enough is enough and not really funny again. I see where it can be funny and it (hey he is disgusting our authority figure he is hilarious.). A pleasant community though it tries to be difficult to remove. I mean maybe one special place, but the whole series is dumb. It seems CC is just saying the joke of the forest that we have heard the way for many times. In fact I can't see this ongoing show season 1.
