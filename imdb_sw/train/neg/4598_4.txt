The wife's producer in London hopes to revise the American song and dance song with a star in the latest show of her husband and colleague, an American girl who makes her fashions of life in the social circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already encountered themselves, and the girl thinks a guy is really a marriage producer married to her friend (the fact that she is not wearing a wedding ring should despair any misunderstanding!). Fred Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers music is finally coming down to Earth with Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script, which is full of young character. Astaire and Rogers are not just 'meeting with the cute' - faced with ridiculously (he tap-playing as mad in a suite hotel on it and complains). The 1935 listeners probably didn't care how these two could get together - as long as they did, and with joy. To see today, intermediaries do not seem to have the motivation to complete with each other's hands: he asks for flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain "free of thought" in the department of love) and gives him a shadow. Nothing that little play could not heal! These two beautiful ones are as unacceptable as in the London and Venice settings, but we just look at because the direction is Fred and Ginger. It is a fantasy for non-... those who do not mind the plot that has fallen. Music time breaks the built environment, but fails to approve the neighborhood shortage. ** from ****
