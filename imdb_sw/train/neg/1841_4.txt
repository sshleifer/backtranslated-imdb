This can be seen in many ways. This film takes, good or very clear. The third person describes this excellent film. It has an amazing theme and has just a wonderful plot. So who else but Christopher Walken could play in this no matter how bad, moderate or even how it might be good. It was the best you could expect from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always loved to know what will come from him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always far from the wall. He enjoys watching no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wisdom is very amazing. This means that it has its time (although very few) but it can get a little over here and there that makes me feel like a movie is just desperate but of course not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Redirect was moderate. Barry Levinson is a very young director and did not have a good job here. This movie seemed to be more powerful and did not do much to reach. The average rate was not seen as much effort was made to make this film. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to good comedy. It is obvious that this means writing here to fail. For best it is less than average. Considering has its time was not very bad. That's not anything to say about the movie though. If not for Christopher Walken and the end of stupid folly I would give a low score. He is always a character in his movies. And then this is just a wonderful movie that deals with strange characters who do not like anywhere. Not quite awesome but I would not suggest much though because it is a very forgotten movie.
