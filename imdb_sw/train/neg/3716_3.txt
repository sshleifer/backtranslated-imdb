The main character Lance Barton is killed in heaven before his time. When heaven learns about an offense, it is given the body of an elder who was old and white Mr. Wellington. Black black in the old mans of white mans still has a character like a black black man is perhaps funny if you see it happening with an old white actress. In this film I have reminded him several times: "Chris Rock should be a white man". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as planned: "Deception" is not sent properly and love stories cannot be completely reliable. The fact that you all see is Chris Rock playing the black boy, because the old white person should see it only in small buttons, it is a challenge for the audience to "stop the unbelief".
