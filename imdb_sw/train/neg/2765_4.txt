How this movie was found for the budget of $ 70 million and completely uninvited is my. Myths and conversations are mostly amateur. Characters say things are no real person to say and almost never respond to the things mentioned earlier. No one seems to be the foundation in the real world. The role play is good because the writing is dud ... but several actors in the role of actually help bring low production. The brains of the hero probably should get his own credit, it was very carefully-focused ... without mentioning that it provided one of the best displays in the picture. Finally, for film about L.A. if faced with the main villages, this film is very interesting. It's a shame! If you see this, your mind will be running constantly, thinking ways that you could take SFX scenes and create a better movie around them. Sadly, it would not be much.
