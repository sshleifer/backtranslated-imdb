"Smithereens" is a kind of an improper flick that hang out of the cable channels taking place as riesy dime novel in the public library. Little of the useless and of the first efforts to the good Seidelman director, the film is full of evil, bad sound, bad work, and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Most good movies do not do this to the market and why the junk climbs like this makes and never seen going away is one of the biggest secrets of life. (D-)
