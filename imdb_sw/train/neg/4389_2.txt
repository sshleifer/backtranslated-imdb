If you like regular dirt and the role of the high school secondary school player, then don't look again. Starting around half-half, Arielle Dombasle's good and failure begins to pull every opportunity. That's the only thing that made this movie look and look. <br /> <br /> Stories are lame and arrogant, humor is corny, and character development is basically nonexistent.
