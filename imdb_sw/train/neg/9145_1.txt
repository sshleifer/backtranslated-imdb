I would first say that I enjoy watching "bad movies". It's funny how some of these films leave more lasting than those who are the best. This film is bad for a terrible and destructive way. This car for the false ego of Sam Mraovich does not only have a lack of knowledge, has renewed the meaning of the words. This should be a barometer for bad movies. Mendoza type for film. Mr. Mraovich writes, leads, and stars as an object of transparency Arthur Sailes to fight with his and the Christian forces of evil as he and his girlfriend Ben "died behind the eyes" Paper fights for the balance of marriage. If libertarian I believe gay should have the right to get married. Ben & Arthur are doing more harm than that because the army of homophobes. The display of all Christian elements is bad and ham-fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you can not take any of them for weight. Arthur Victor's brother, the Bible is increasingly free, Jesus is very serious about homosexual / gossip that you wonder how he was beaten in this role. That's because Sam "mix" Mraovich was also a casting director. Worse is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think someone leading is doing the words of the pastor, hitting, and chubby coming to mind? Sam also provides lines like a pizza of domino, cool and usually not correct. Tally end: you absorb in writing, guide, act and throw. That's Ed's four crown. I accept you a little fearful person.
