Emma is my famous novel of Jane Austen - Emma means with her mistakes, so readers can forgive and love her, and the relationship she has with Mr Knightley, which is warm, normal, honorable but of play, generated by heat, fuzzy , romantic excitement. Mr Knightley is a perfect man, and Emma is almost like you can find it at that time for a free, clever, brave woman - remember, she is only 21 years old, and was sure she grew up and grew away from her mistakes. Who does not want to be Emma? Who does not want to be told by Mr Knightley? This version of Emma gives you a sense of things I like about Emma. I couldn't even finish watching, I found it very bad. I could not see Emma's warmth and hospitality, which makes the reader enjoy it: the patience and warmth he shows his father; The relationship between him and Mrs Weston, which shows his willingness to put her friend's pleasure on himself (as he sacrificed the same kind of friend in his house to send a marriage Miss Taylors). Mr Woodhouse's attitude in this situation looks just wonderful, not just ordinary, old and try a little. <br /> <br /> These very important changes fail to bring a relationship between Mr Knightley and Emma. Their relationship is built with respect and love: Mr Knightley breaks down the fatal error of Emma believing that his mind and true service to others will not allow him to go too far; and Emma looks at him, though playing with this trick and continuing to use his own judgment. Putting down the right at the start of the show reduces the flow between them, destroying all the possibilities of displaying their relationship status as described above. Mr Knightley also cannot be very attractive to bring a life of sexual tension between direction (or to encourage any compliments from the female audience). <br /> <br /> Truly awesome. I can't understand why anyone who resembles Emma's story can love it, unless it resigns itself after I have changed it.
