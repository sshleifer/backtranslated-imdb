Wow, I hated this film. This lesson should have a very good film effect, and the leading actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there was even * was a script - is a mess. This is not a small movie than a slide show that goes anywhere. I would like to say it goes anyway, but it's actually 81 minutes more than you sit. As I said, the leading actor is good. So it is Faruza Baulk (SP?), As his mother sometimes-bright-end-and accepting. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here, because this is a mess. A real embarrassment, because I really wanted to love this film, but essentially it takes from a film that has never been made. Skip this - it wasn't worth 6 dollars.
