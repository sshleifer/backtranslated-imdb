because that's the only way you won't think this film is to lose TOTAL in time and money. Remake of "heaven can wait", (which was at least a look) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It is more than a car to give Rock at some time on the film for a fine comedy stand that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his joke is usually supposed to be from the body of an adult, fat, rich, dead but is shown from Rock himself. As he hates black and white caused by chemistry. The movie is not funny, a bad shot job is weak at best. Going to the tax "Heaven Can Wait" and the Rock Rock video and you will be the way ahead of the game.
