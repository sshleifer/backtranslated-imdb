I did not expect much from this film, but oh brother, it stinker does. Did I get this gem in a big DVD dock in Walmart (where else)? With cheaper if this disc was, I feel uncomfortable. Special effects had a high school looking at them, the work of a damaged camera and fabric fabrics and sketchy wall and acting was a perfect example of 'Christian School'. One can think of a long and stimulating “prayer meeting” with a production company after seeing a run back - people who have taken this thing should have had a strong sense of biblical towards a non-productive company that has closed this out. Think of their pain because they saw their investment of 914.86 dollars. things that make them very good. Reliable stories and characters, under hand movements and excitement, oh, and a story that attracts - to everyone-, not just true believers. I.e. Leave the Preacher, Save the Church. Take a series of Omen or Prophecy, for example. Beautiful films and compelling lines, great movies and bright music. No hysterical arm-waving. No preaching. If this film had a laughing song it would be better.
