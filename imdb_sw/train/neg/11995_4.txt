I was very excited and engaged in watching this film when the first promos came out in November! It looks amazing with songs! I was desperate when I went to look! This is a film that prevents 6 couples together. It has 12 people victory! Most stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, could not manage the situation well and should not have many people in this film as this would be easy to make. Compared to from the author of Nikhil Debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishq' is located behind. I think Nikhil must have a small star. I think the best things of this film are songs! These songs are good and I think that all the songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a good job and has worked better than years. I think the summary of this film can increase because of good songs! One thing I was satisfied with, is that the director should not include dirt in this film made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this very difficult to watch this with the family! Although, others can get this nude as a comedy, not something you would like to watch with parents! I think the best acting was done by Salman and Priyanka In general, I think his amazing movie!
