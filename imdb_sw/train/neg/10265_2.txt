Kirstie Alley, looking a little bit, but just a little bit, it's in this mess with someone who is a MacGuyver viewer, wearing red hair and all. The premise of the movie is about an old woman (50 !!!) who can not find her screenplay produced because of age discrimination so she will send in her little niece to introduce as an author. It is not a natural idea and not a very good ethnic race, a dialogue with a plot of ignorance. There is another plot on the author and crush or exciting character of Kirstie and why this is included is hidden. Migizaji who shows Kirstie's brother is a wood and miscast, it was suffering to watch their events. What it says about this film. Avoid.
