It is not just alien visitors who are seen as furry who gave the woman a woman and not just a guest visitor who can speak English fully (with Australian emphasis) they also call their stars and they call them our world scholars have given them! <br /> <br /> And leaving everything, the whole life of the stranger knows how it means, evil, destruction and destruction we humans are. And they are ready to tell us how bad it is. If you get a chance to see this film, not. Well, unless you are experiencing sleep or choice is this movie or surgical diagnosis without anesthesia. This movie tries to get ethically, ecologically all around but it only succeeds to make you a bit and pray soon.
