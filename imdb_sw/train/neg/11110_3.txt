I would just be known, that I often tested movies under 5. I was very excited to see this film. Its many television versions for several months have really made me want to see this film. So, one night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I found popcorn and sat watching the film. <br /> <br /> The story of the story seemed to be exciting enough - some dude is killing people who have no subway views. There is a photographer who likes and missing people. Where are they going? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a link between the pictures he has taken, and he has a player, following him closely, until he comes. The film had a way to spell it, although the plot was predictable. "No, it's dark, look out behind you." The plan, even though it is not possible, was cheerful ... that is, to the end. "This was good until the end .... Then it became just a pride", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here they come ... Look at, I was hoping to be a fatal killer, a psychologist who had a destruction. No. It was a secret society of living people for centuries. Woo. How originally. How untrue. What? Reduces. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come Lionsgate. You have had amazing films, but this has fallen.
