Bad movies! You must be opposed to some of the actual stinkers of the appointment of the Golden Globe. They have taken the story of the first professional artist of the first Renaissance and put it over recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken freedom and truth; if the story was good, it would have been quite good. But it's very strange - with all the true stories of this artist would have made the film better, why came with this script of clean water? I think there was not enough naked people in the true version. It has run fast at the end and summarizes the artist's life - we can save ourselves for several hours if they prefer another film and concise.
