I have seen more, if not all of Laurel & Hardy's films. I've been enjoying it in ignorance, even after watching it regularly. This new film tries to restore classic and two new actors who resemble Laurel & Hardy, however it fails for many reasons. One of which their clothes are outside (it is still the 20th century) yet they are shown in the 90th context. This film can be the worst film I saw and should be dragged on the shelf and locked forever. Laurel and Hardy real around their graves by imitating the worst.
