I love Dracula but this film was a perfect desire! I remember Lee from Dracula's films since I was young, and I thought she was fine, but this film was very bad. I don't know if my youth deceived me in believing Lee was Dracula's last, and fashionable, looks, attraction and evil under that. Or perhaps it was just this film that despised me. But you can think Dracula for the English motivation of snobbish and body language to go with it? What? You like when a plot has unrealistic decisions with the characters and it's boring and doesn't have any kind of tension. Then this is a film for you! Otherwise - don't see it! I paid only 2 because somehow I was able to stay awake during the entire movie. Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must sleep deprived at home alone in a dark room with lots of unknown space behind you. Perhaps alone in your parents house or with guests at home. Because even the characters in this flick seemed to be afraid, and I think that counts the whole thing! Or maybe you like this film because of the place in the history of Dracula's movie, perhaps the attraction of how Dracula's story has changed from Nosferatu to what is today. Because if the film is not interesting, it does not draw you into a fantastic secret for me to make the story of Vampyre amazing. <br /> <br /> And more has a lot of that 70ies feel about it. Beauty looks like a cheap Theater. And not to say that rejecting everything done in the 70ies. Because I can love the old and new film.
