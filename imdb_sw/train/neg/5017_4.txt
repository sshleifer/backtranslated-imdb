Just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and became a fan of Nick Stahl I was forced to rent. For all honesty, perhaps they should stay on the shelves. The concept was one of the most interesting and there were several wise and return changes but somehow I thought almost all before they came. And the movie just went too far at the end of my opinion ... if you should suffer through his view you will see what I mean! For good information, Nick's Stahl Act was good (especially considering what she worked with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good but always has the same kind of attitude ... also Paul Finch from "American Pie" come for my love. And finally, the worst part of this movie Should have the emotional performance of January Jones ... I think a really good face is really all the important things in Hollywood.
