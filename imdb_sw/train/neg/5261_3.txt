I have read some of the other comments and I must agree with those who caught the last. I thought it was going well ... until the end. It continued your mind to run and then splat. I don't know what went on in the last few minutes of the film except the full mess. It's like they lost money to come up with a good end so that they could be improved. First they had a wonderful thing to make people go astray and they had a boy talking about the Zone 51 (which makes them think of strangers) then after going to the stamp. I thought executives and actors did well is just a script developed. Anyway, if you look at this film already ready to end.
