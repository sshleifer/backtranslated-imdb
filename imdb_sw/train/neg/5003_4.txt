I am ashamed to write these reviews. I say that because those you read will know that I am sitting all the way and that's a shame to accept even for strangers. But I had to warn those who read the views of the audience on the IMD before watching the film without looking at this. It's a little I can do. This is a bad movie! Believe me. The program is goofy. Acting is amateurish. With leading functions, cameras, sets, clothes, etc. is the second level. Let me go.
