Other Historical Rape </> <br /> This movie is a tragedy; it only uses historical stories and makes the story of sweet love, and the bad efficiency of budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 time, they just dragged you when you made a mini series. The war show is stupid and unreasonable, the sellers discover the stupid, fatal dress. The Romans were good at fighting in the open areas, one of their troops were completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in the forest, in this film the Romans are fighting to fight on the city, I mean to get real. <Br /> <br /> And through Cleopatra came out of the origin of Macedonian, which means a skinned person.
