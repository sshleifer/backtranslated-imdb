Feh. This film started in an interesting way, but quickly run the gamut from the confusion of light. Particularly disrupted, especially at the beginning, where the scenarios are so many that it is difficult to say just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so. Poor comes later, and good love between two living people (pusses all). The spirit of revenge of the dead girl is actually a very good man in the film, which is sad. If all breaks had come, the pot may be better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story gets really interesting for some time, as it appears that the mother of a sixteen-year-old daughter of a girl tries to raise her daughter from the dead, and the negative impact caused by the rest that the rest of the dead will come again also, take a human form strong, and most likely start to kill everyone. The Japanese Night of the Night of the Dead of Life. But this does not happen. Although this defiled priest and a few red-headed priests tell the uncomfortable young people that this will happen if the priest's wife completes her worship, she does only the dead man who shows her daughter. There is no increase in the number of dead, no navigation army, nothing. The priest only makes the spirit of the girl turn to the land of the dead, taken out of the boy, as he gave his back as a brittle nuts (when I was tempted to enjoy with a loud voice, like this Idiot went to kiss and asked the girl DEAD, ewwww !!! ). The Robitussen pastor, a good friend who cannot move around has a last shot when he leaves the village for the last time, and so. There is no real fear, there is no real shortage, which the Japanese tend to do better than the American creators and their emphasis on top-over-cheesy face make-up, no mimis. I was shocked.
