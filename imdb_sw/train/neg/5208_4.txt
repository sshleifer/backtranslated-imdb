This mini-series, also according to Alex Haley's book as 'Queen', tried to use the same method, that is, to build a long history following family life for many years. Although in the 'Queen' results were knowledgeable, here Mrs. Flora's inspiration was missing. First in the book, and indeed in this TV production. Many more are brought in more quickly than years, as the saga is not deep, high, not quite like the 'Queen'. A perfect score for the creation of the original film, designed with great care, but as the film continued it appeared to have emerged that it was a form of an impressive dallasian combination in the third three-hour period or time. I was more optimistic; but obviously Haley was under the leadership of this story than his 'close-biography' queen, and Peter Werner III is not like John Erman. It is only recommended for those who are interested in these long stories of increasing generations.
