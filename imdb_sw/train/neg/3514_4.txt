Philip. K. movie of Dickian. And one of the respect for that. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and the disgusting report called Little Spielberg. But facing the same face, the end of misleading and cheesing was very little to me. Half of the movie I started to be afraid of that kind of end, and I was certainly sure. But that doesn't mean that the film is not timely. No, not at all. The first half (if already many here have spoken) is amazing. There are some parts that start to wonder if the director wanted to convey the message that display is a very important thing in the future (we will do the same for Corny items because we can) or it just mix. But the paranoia is there and feels "out of joint" too. Good.
