This film makes Canadians and Brits being tangible, idiots of values. Men are stoned / drunk, and then they say / fight almost every area. Women do not like the story? I don't know what is there? they use any area that causes ruckus, or worse, to distribute as much as the livestock used. Apparently, Canadian women have a violent hog or hippie hulking conflicts. It is a girl who has been beaten, her lover of losing and the humor of the evil mother we have seen in many movies without original. Every aspect here is a photography, small childhood. Needless to say that all seemed like they need to bathe! And the idea of ​​any kind of area showing sex with George Wendt? shudder ?? it's enough to make anyone be! I watched movies because Samuel West was in it? but I can't understand why he would accept such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is a good actor - alone and an unprecedented time of redemption, but his talent has been lost here. <br /> <br /> Like the second plot? The three imbeciles try to get their dope back ?? yawn - or Karl ?? who has died, but who is the most active character in the minds of those left behind (such as Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock Catholic? although I am ashamed to even think of comparing these two films), why even bother? Karl is so breathing that you find the state of his death enjoyable. <br /> <br /> At the end of this bad movie, I thought all would be better off to go with him on the boat!
