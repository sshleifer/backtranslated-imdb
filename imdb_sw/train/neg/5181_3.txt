This is the first Horrorfest film I watched and after Im almost think I don't need to see any of the others. I was told that the "movie mans of the fear of thinking" and said that if this should make me think I am thinking about what the splatter / gore films are in the same. Don't make a mistake even a year in this film is worth staying through. <br /> <br /> The program has been enlarged with too many art for art. The effects of cameras and music are not out of time and characters are banal to say the least. Several characters and events seem to have a sense at the end when they reveal some of the "Hamiltons" hooks. I realized who Lenny was about half an hour when I saw the movie. I was very awake under the whelmed and confused with Lenny that I was quite felt ripped off. I expected what I got but they could go further, in fact every year falls completely flat. For movies out there like "Hostel" and "Saw" you need to come up better with a film that "is considered to be a typical or very disturbing to the general audience".
