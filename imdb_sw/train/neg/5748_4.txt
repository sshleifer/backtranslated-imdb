I should say I hated this film. I don't like to say it because Gerard Butler is there. About half an hour of interesting dialogue, mercy for all who care about the plot, I have started to speed up Gerry events. I don't know the end, I was smoking it. If Gerry was not in it, perhaps I could do one of two things: sleeping or opening, but Gerry is the bright light of this film, as he has many original films. If you are a fan of Gerry worries, he is good and precious as he is at all, but if you really want to watch a movie for a plot, good luck because you will need, either a lot of coffee or soda to stop you! And that is because the disposal director had meant to put Gerry on this film, even though they had no idea how to translate his name!
