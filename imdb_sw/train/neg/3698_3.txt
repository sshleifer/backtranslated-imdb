There is no need for more details that others have written in the other reviews - here goes a summary: It is a very good job - it is very good - it would like to make it to edit like a necktie <br /> * Story and practice are snooze total - it was very difficult to stay awake sometimes <br /> <br /> If you are a good art student, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so on - you have it. This is FILM for you. <br /> <br /> If you want to cooperate, entertainment MOVIE - look elsewhere - this is a failure if anything except artistic information. We do have a horn ...
