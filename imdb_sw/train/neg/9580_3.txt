Former brat player and good star Rob Lowe in the film put in the top US security prison. I had a hearing disorder that would be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY is not the type of film, it's more like a "Man Run" film like IN. It also argues for the subject of penalties and justice with James Coburn put in the cameo as a spokesman for the group of victims of the victims but any discussion of the mind on how the community should treat criminals is totally ignored as the film faces an exhausting exaggeration. shoot out and drive chases
