I read the book and enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. However, when I saw the movie I had lost much. First of all, he did not respect Deborah Raffin but was very old to play a 24/25-year-old woman. Christopher Reeve also ended for that reason. Would according to the book, it was close to 30. I would like to see a little further investigation of his military life, his Red friend, the Elly journey to see him as that was an important part of the story of the story of the characters. Also Miss Beasley was sent as a book that referred to her as the most common woman. I know the movie had no budget "Madison County" which I believe was released almost simultaneously. But for me this was a poor budget, under budget, published. As mentioned, I would like Miss Spenser to come out with retirement and write screenshots for his books as they should be. He knows his characters better than anyone else, I hope he could focus on doing too. The movie let me down!
