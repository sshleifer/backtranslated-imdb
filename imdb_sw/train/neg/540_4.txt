ALL FOR LOVE (as it came to the end of the weekend) is a romantic festival with Captain Saint Ives French officer in Napoleon's army which was captured by England and imprisoned in Scotland where it meets and loves to love a little girl who looks in prison . There is also a story involving murder. I will be honest and admit that I was not considered by the film since I was not a fan of the dramas period and the screens of the screen significantly but I will say that this has been done well by everyone involved and that it is a good experience that shows Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The design of clothing as you can expect is also good <br /> I would be very surprised if this film does not get any complaints after announcing BBC2 to teatime. Captain Saint Ives is lying in bed with a prostitute where the underwear is quite clear and there is a French prison bathing area that includes male weaknesses without mentioning the location of the murder where blood appears clearly. You need to be concerned if the BBC editors have any kind of clue about what they are doing
