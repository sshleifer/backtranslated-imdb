I must say that during my childhood I am very proud of many movies I have found. Except Theodore Rex. Talk about the movie every time the player in any actress resume. What? You can just imagine what Anopie's runner should have told him to sign on this piece "Hey Whoop, you have ever seen that it is shown Dinosaurs, they are actually making films from them, and you see Germany!" After that the agent must have many records of Star Wars . This video was very bad I thought Whoopie should have bought every copy of this film and destroyed it. I just want him to do one thing in my memory, because my sister still gives me a crap to watch the movie. I mean, I will accept even I called Mr. Nanny and Kazzam on the movie (the best reason I left for Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a short time), but this focuses on my mind as the worst childhood, and the deep regret of my life, and that was 16 years ago. I'm 24 now if you want to do a calculation. Every time I think my list of all of the worst movies even says this, because as a child who is raped, I'm trying hard to insist that it's happened. Delete you Whoopie, we are glad people only accept Eddie and Sister Act 2 if you are very bad luck.
