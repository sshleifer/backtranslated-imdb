As a mother of two young children who must or must say they have been growing and re-born of Scooby I feel good to have a comment on the historical and current edition of Scooby. <br /> <br /> As a family we have not seen any events before Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we can be enjoyed as light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But in fact it is a problem in the current structure with a normal weight that will not have a long time "Scooby" and a long group. I am sure it will succeed in a quick return of money but I am sure you have a long time buying it in old age and is a real risk of being lost. My 6-year-old son saw the new version broken and without telling anyone that it looks so bad and why it wasn't something like the last series (where you are). Scrappy Doo was bad but still better than this. Let's hope We get a clue that will be dirty by mentioning to producers.
