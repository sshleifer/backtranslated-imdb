Interestingly, more damage that you are trying to write the birth of the Federal Intelligence Office. It begins to be promising, and the only solution is still in the airplane, however, the melodrama involving James Stewart and Vera Miles only finds the way (Miles had a habit of playing his bravery under trouble, and his artificial nerves come here to schedule). Mervyn LeRoy's director helped them deal with Don Whitehead's book, but in spite of the involvement of the talent, the picture cannot make a lot of sense. The best performance led by Murray Hamilton as a partner of Stewart, however a lot of conversation is very interesting and stimulating voice causes the movie to appear twice as long as it is. * 1/2 from ****
