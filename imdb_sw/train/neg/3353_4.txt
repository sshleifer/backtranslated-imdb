The image of the bad picture does not provide something new. Common and angry handbags try to renew the story, but thin. Work is not recommended on pathetic. Why Liam Neeson is registered for this is the guess of anyone. Owen Wilson returns true in one of the worst exhibitions in the recent movie of fear. Catherine Zeta Jones is happy to look at and not more than Lili Lilior has worked on the average. Special effects were memorable and the house itself was beautiful and hauntingly beautiful. However they can not practice with the worst acting and stories that seem to have been hit together for the last minute. Don't bother.
