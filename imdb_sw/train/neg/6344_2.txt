I have been beaten, Woody Allen's film that I walked after half an hour (I know the moral weakness of commenting on the film I saw under half, but I hope you will know why. Basically, it became obvious very early on that we would like to be considered from the screens and: the script that announced pretending to be as a shot point; cast all those who were trying to become characters from Hannah and His Sisters (except Chloe Sevigny), and were misled to do so; and a satellite camera around, for there is nothing to film but to talk to the actor. Drama? No; it is written before, but the action is not worth anything to develop a great situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I left too early in this case, but at that time I would like to decide against an hour and one half clones -liner-Allen. Script has its funny time? I went completely back to Will Ferrell's places on the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!) ?? but there is a slight chance of leaving them off without surprising, as much better. Worse than this is no fluidity. Saying the wood of this film makes the forest look like a jelly: a discussion of the opening of the caf√© that is more dangerous in action. The only thing to be done with numbers is to be reviewed? 2/10.
