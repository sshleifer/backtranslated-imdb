- Temporary publications spend a lot of human money. Of course the attacker wants his money to return and does not care who is killing it to get it. Punk enables his friend and old farmer to help him save his life. If this seems to be ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this wear Izod, dune buggy-driving punk can hold one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is clearly silly. His friend may be good with a gun, but he has against a group of trained murderers. The former striker is a little more than comic aid and no real help when it comes to face with the group. There is also a little conspiracy about how the father of a friend had been killed years ago by the master of the attack, but it is not good enough and not suitable any movie. <br /> <br /> - master of the group, Mr. Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I think he got a name because he has what looks like a nick shaving on his cheek. Palance is as unacceptable if others are thrown, doing what they should get paid. I have seen the Italian Italian beautiful crime soon, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them. Check out the Sadist Syndicate or Revolver instead.
