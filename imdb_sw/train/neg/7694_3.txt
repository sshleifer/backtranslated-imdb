Unless you are twelve, this film is not very good. It is a clear low-budget film with B artists, and for such a fantasy type that sometimes requires the work of an intense CGI which is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rent it. I enjoy laughing on bad movies. I didn't know how bad. It is loaded, until after 2 hours, then begins to burn. The fight styles are likely to be among the most common battles that obey the laws of physics, and fight the wires. No actual changes to change. It has a program, but again, it is clear the child's movie. It seems like there are open moral lessons of days that are presented, like Sesame Street or something. It can carry. But better if you're, say, nine.
