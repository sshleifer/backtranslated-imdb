While watching this film, I came up with a script for a film, called "Making 10 or less items": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. Good news is, we can find Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Author: That's good! But what is the good news? Producer: We can only bring him back for one day. I think we will need someone else. <br /> <br /> Author: So we employ for one day. Movie is an hour and a half long. The working day is eight hours long. I can't see the problem. Producer: But ... will have to spend time getting character. <br /> <br /> Author: So we have to play character basically himself. Producer: But still will need to understand its motivation and all of it. It says we call a great actor who plays a low-budget film, you? <br /> <br /> Author: Why? <br /> <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But fine, at least we will have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we ought to put a film in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Author: Of course. Producer: This document is a load of crap. We would like to earn money on this. If only, the behavior of Morgan Freeman has stolen Wal-Mart or Target or one of these stores, so at least someone will sell DVD. <br /> <br /> Author: True thing! <br /> <br> Producer: Get a second ... what about a small bodega and a "ten or less" way to express? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I think that's good weird. But we can't change the name now! I doubt that my document is very similar to the truth, but it did not "10 or Low" items. This is the case of good acting, but writing bad, and I hate to see it happen. When you watch an independent film, you expect to try to broadcast a message. I think they would be trying for a fatigue age "don't let anything stop you" a death message in the best movie. In any case, with "10 or Low items", the only message I received was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
