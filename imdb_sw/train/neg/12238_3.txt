The most probable concept, and it was fun to see these two holiday holidays together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's respiratory nose did not require "notes" made in this film - such as Power on Star Wars movies they do not need the "medicine medication in the blood." But in particular, the film stops cold because of the plot of Winterbolt on hard to destroy Santa. Has the ability to put proposals in people's minds, why does he do things that way? Breaking the nose of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to dissolve the Frosty family ... Many Pinky and Brain squares and "Phineas and Ferb" Dr Doofenshmirtz (which takes place in such a way and laughing) seems simple and equal compared and Winterbolt, which we are expected to take to some extent. <br /> <br /> There is a special time (and amusingly) when a character loses its two guns to a bad person, such as boomerangs. I understand if they don't want to have a gun to shoot at the family film, but then why do they have guns in the first place?
