I wanted to hit the TV. Watch it was suffering. I liked it. Never look at this film. Terrorists are sad. Adam Sandler is angry. I usually like him but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the world's most popular film. The player who is busy is jealous. The only part of the funny is the rock and black teeth to find all the girls. It was very angry I wanted to hit the TV. DOES NOT KNOW THE MOVIE YOU CAN NEED A CHILD. If even Adam's little Sandler, don't give it away. It will only make you a fan. Make yourself a permit, if you see it in a store, hide to put everyone out of the risk of buying. It was worth $ 1.99 I paid for.
