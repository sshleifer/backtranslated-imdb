The worst movie ever made !!! Please check the actual film review for the benefit of this film. Check out the Rotten Tomatoes on the web for good self-review on this film. The comments made on this site are obvious from people with financial interest in this film. I see very good ideas. I see how shocking the negative views are against this film and a good comment as a speech at the Academy of the Academy Awards. Do not lose your hard earned money !!!!!! This film has decreased! I can't believe the film like this could be made. Why would Hollywood lose their time on that junk? This film is an attempt to something. I am wondering what a partner could drown their money to produce the trash. I went to the block and the servant told us even to lose our time or money. I didn't listen to them and I lost my time and money. Please don't make the same mistake! It's really a "bad movie ever released!"
