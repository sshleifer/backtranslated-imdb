There is a word for this type of film, and the word is "drivel." It was a rental car when renting VHS, and it is a challenge to run again for satellites now. It can deceive you, because it has two names known as Kistofferson and Henriksen, good sound of sound, and beautiful monument Valley scenery. It also has a angry woman who has fought too much. If that's what you want from the film, maybe this will make you happy. It is still a shadow, however.
