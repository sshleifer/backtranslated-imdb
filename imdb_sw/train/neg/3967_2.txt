IN IMPORTANT is the movie under the budget of America of fear which somehow managed to win the award 2. <br /> <br /> The program seems to involve 2 different pieces. First, a woman commits suicide by throwing her hands during swimming. Secondly, the young daughter of the technical writer is found and his throat declined. The grieving couple decides to move to the cabin alone in the mountains. Later it turns into a home-based shelter and around the haunted areas. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, two different pieces of stories collide as one can expect. However, the implementation does not lead to a mixture that you may simply have to be resolved with many views. Unfortunately, the film is not only suitable to attract the audience to look at it more than once. <br /> <br /> Welcome to everything that can go against this film goes wrong - and quickly! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all the shortcomings available here. I believe it is fair to give judgment on participants involved in this production as the material was very poor. <Br /> <br /> The characters are not as interesting as described by other consultants on this site. The highly registered script presents many people without giving them interesting dialogues, without creating the status of the situation run by the character and without increasing the depth of any of them. <br /> <br /> Leadership is not moved. A guide from the J-Horror displays such as RINGU, GRUDGE and CALL ONE MISSED is obvious. Unfortunately, the DARK REMAINS directors did not emphasize the J-Horror style. J-Horror works effectively because it makes up the fear of the unknown. The tension is made up of a constant change between the incredible atmosphere (the spirit on the CCTV camera continues towards them for example), and the answers to the main character that faces it without any warning. No humor or language-in-cheek feature in these movies. Everything is played in a straightforward manner without any criticism or restrictions that you cannot help but be trusted and interested in it. At least the air creates doubts and ensures that fear has psychological impacts, very different from the "awesome awesome" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> DARK REMAINS Directors tried bravely to avoid the clichés of Hollywood and also managed to avoid using CGI. The J-Horror judgment would have been well planned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh "awesome" on the screen. The consequences of making "ghosts" were not very bad for the low budget but their actions were just dirty. I was blowing my head a few times during this film. I did not give away even if I wanted. I just couldn't understand. All I could do was that it was something to combat. <br /> <br /> What yet? The answer if the auditor on a different site has said it is a burden. Movie is a job to stay. Amazingly, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, many may leave long before the end. There are only positive things that I could find in this film - avoiding the achievements of horrible clichés and the lack of "f-word" in each single sentence if one would normally expect to get. This is what two stars are. Those who become like extraordinary or psychological fears associated with ghosts and haunting can do well connected to movies such as LEGEND HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING or J- Small fears. If you think you have seen a lot of established movies and want to see a non-standard "R-rated" movie of fear on ghosts, see HUNTER HUMTER SKILLS. It may not be the biggest movie that has been made but it is certainly better than DARK REMAINS and has a real surprise shop. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid OUT OF WILD as a blow.
