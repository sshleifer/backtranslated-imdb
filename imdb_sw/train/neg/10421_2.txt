I saw this movie as a very little girl (I'm 27 now) and was scared me without ignorance for years. I had a dream about every aspect of this film from the way to music for (obviously) abuse. My parents are still talking about who allowed me to look at them and they both say they will never allow them to watch the film. I think they just say that they know I have a strong feeling about it; 0) Now I am reading a book (out of curiosity and the fact that it is classic) and it's a good story. However I don't think that would have been done in the cartoon. Forever. Well, maybe children today can get quaint but he gave me night to week and week and it's still hard to see a rabbit offered in the same way. He gives me a little heart at any time. Yah I am a wuss but I suggest that any parent looking to show this film to their children, read that book instead or see first to confirm that they are approving the content. Not everyone gets it as hard as I did but we're out; 0)
