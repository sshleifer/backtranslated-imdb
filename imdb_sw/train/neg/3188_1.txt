Joe's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (island of men who feel) and involves Joe Don Baker to track the Italian striker. Joe Don's behavior is called Geronimo (mentioned Heronimo) and all he does in this film is shooting people and arresting over and over agin. Everyone in the movie hates, like everyone hates Graydon Clark. I loved the original photo of Greydon, "angel revenge" because it was a boy of seven-year-old. Avoid this movie at all costs!
