Although nothing can be compared with Vampires Vs. Zombies ... in any movie area I will try to judge this movie. First, special effects were taking breath. When there was an explosion on a television screen I thought all my house exploded, and when the machine guns were directly shot I thought the crumbs were walking around the floor next to me. Only my friends. But the event that Jack Black made a sound-like monologue that I heard around almost killed myself, but don't worry since he was burning a movie he could pass his bad work on "I must be up". To a large extent, he must have been looking without thinking without thinking about all the non-existent ideas that are not quite available and just added that he must be "over" to justify his bad act. Well as you can say so for an excuse for a bad acting then if you talk to authors, directors, chief manufacturers, sponsors you will probably find similar answers ... for weight. With the production team called "shock-o-rama" I was shocked not to put a shade on my mouth and ended my life after this shocking excuse for a filmed film. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you should be killed your own in fact, <br /> <br />
