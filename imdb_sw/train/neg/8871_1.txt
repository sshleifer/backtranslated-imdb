I look at 200 movies all year on movies and at home and I can confidently say that this film is far more than I saw this year (If not at any time, however I have not seen the "Knights of the Delta" yet). This film is just a bad joke after a bad joke held for 13 years and because I was angry to look at it on a bus trip I couldn't walk out. <br /> <br /> What! one in the rental aisle. Four dollars can be used more on any movie for numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
