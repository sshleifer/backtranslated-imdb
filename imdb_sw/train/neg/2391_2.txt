I love movies. I like an independent effort and a great production of studio. I love movies and stars and I love those who live and unknown. I love dramas, comedies, step-adventures, science fiction, mystery, western, any kind except fear. I love foreign movies with those in English. I like good movies and I even love them badly, because almost no film fails to enjoy it or hate it at some point. Except for "Even Cowgirl Animals Get Blues." When I attended the show of "Cowgirls," I joined an audience of about 10. Less than half in it, I was alone. Recently I could not bear the trouble of trouble that came out of my eyes, and I came out too. To date "Cowgirls" is still the only movie I ever went to. I don't know how to describe this non-fiction, vacuum, trashy, insignificant, or how far enough to convey its lack of redemption. It is worth mentioning that it is one of the largest films of all time, concerns and concerns each level. She tries to be clever, but her vaginal pregnancies seem to have an honest honesty. It tries to be amazing, but its humor is good and worthy. This is one of the few films that can erase its own ethos, by showing the characters in a very far-way way that defies them against their values. If you want to watch the movie, see "Waterworld," "Ishtar," anything except this. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read the book instead.
