Gee, what movie of the trick that was! I can't understand what people see and horrible about "Raw". The director makes one trick (I would like to admit a very good one, which brings a very stunning life) and then returns to the entire movie again and again. For this reason I was surprised a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew the digging normally I slept as The Grudge grew more and more predictable for a minute. To conclude, I can say that there are the best movies in the kind of start, that the so-called "Ring" was a bad way and that buying the ticket "The Grudge" is losing money.
