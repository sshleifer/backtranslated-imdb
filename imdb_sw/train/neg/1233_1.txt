My God. The idea that this movie is exciting is quite a shock to me. rather than a point that seems to be written at age 5. The plot, acting and even the buttons and pictures of this film were not more than embarrassing. It is not usually this is important about any movie, causing everyone has its own style. But this film, however, was perhaps the worst movie that I saw in 2008. I can really believe that this film is not known, and I think it should stay like this, for movies like these make jokes of exciting forms. <Br /> <br /> I advise anyone that it is a fan of exciting movies, or even just movies to stay away from this.
