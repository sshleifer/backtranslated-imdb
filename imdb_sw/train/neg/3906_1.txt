I was able to run one night and go to the film hall to see this, I think I was on treatment. Boy, I was not wrong. Considering the relevant talent, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everyone in it was sent, and I find it strange to read on this website that there are people out there who really liked it.
