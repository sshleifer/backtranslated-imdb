Holy cow, it's a piece of sh * t this movie is. I had no way how these photographers could take a book of 250 word and turn it into a film. I think they didn't know either! Don't I forget to leave or break this book, do you? <br /> <br /> They took this all classic kids, added some farting, belching and sexuality, and prostitution in KAKA laughter. This should give you a good idea of ​​what the manufacturers of hollywood think. I must say, visually it was surprising, but the story of a brilliant visual has been damaged by the humor of the toilet (if you think that kind of thing is interesting) I don't want children to know I think it is. > <br /> Don't take your children to see, don't lose a DVD. I hope the spirit of Doctor Suess spirit comes and hates people who made this film.
