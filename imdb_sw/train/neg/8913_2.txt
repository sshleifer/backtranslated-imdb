When I first heard this morning, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was a little exciting for a week or more ... But we have to deal with them, these journalists (if one can even call a few) have TOO MUCH MUCH "play around" time. First, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman has never had a little journalist in it. He is not very profitable. He continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform the audience about a news report. It is true that he is angry with the fact that I can no longer look at it. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. Hell, he is more than a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. Therefore, he changes immediately to become a celebrity next to the celebration he deserves to interview. He is not a very professional and very likely to see his relationship with celebrating more important than being a potential journalist - and that's all I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Also (for despair), this show contains more entertainment information than information on the world, government, the United States, or something that will benefit from / or serve the best interests of the public. They also take into account that everything they are talking about comes as a commercial product. On the other hand, field journalists are interested in the interest ...... / It <br /> I believe "good day LA" is for young people and celebrities, and certainly not for people who care about the news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would very much look at KTLA.However, they are very hard to be entertaining sometimes. They are still very small. Morning America "is also the same ... as long as Diane Sawyer can't be a great way."
