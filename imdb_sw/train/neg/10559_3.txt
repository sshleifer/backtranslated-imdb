'I don't understand. None of this makes any sense! ', He says one of the tragedies of the death of Death. After staying in the confusion of the movie, I know exactly how she feels. Stories, and film director Aristide Massacessi (good old Joe D'amato using his true name for change), is a wonderful mix of wonders, murder / secrets, and good trash of good water, which appeals to those who appreciate garbage 70 trippy as extraordinary efforts by Jess Franco, but which were striving to remain aware. The opening of a hunchback lamenting the death of her good sister (who had an unusual thing, before fleeing to a dash doctor), The Smiles's Death in the killing is so confusing when the same woman (played with Ewa Aulin, whose star in 'Kula's Death') appears alive and hits, the only user of the coach accident that comes out of Walter's property and Eva von Ravensbrück. After being invited to stay and return to their home, where he is attracted to Dr Sturges (Klaus Kinski in the role of losing), a good lass begins to love issues with Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück (meaning the audience is treated with some short but entertaining scenes of nookie and lobian). 'lesbian'). <br /> <br /> 'So far, it's good', I thought to me here, 'we've had hunchbacks, incest, blood and guts, and freeous feminine' ?? All the ingredients of a great Euro-horror; what follows, however, is an attempt to get lost by Massacessi combining the murder of a giallo style, continuing to the spirit, and even elements from the 'Black Cat' of Edgar Allan Poe, to tell the story of a very quiet, quite amazing, and ultimately highly motivating to retaliate outside the grave. This video seems to have very few here on IMD, but from the choice, I would like to look at one of the director's movies from the future in his work; I think it is unknown, delightful, surreal 70s Gothic horror just isn't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (only for cheesy and nekkidness), planned up to 3 for IMD.
