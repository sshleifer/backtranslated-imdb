This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. It makes the "Fantasy Requirements" looks like a Disney film. Although, technically, it is very well done, act, movies, music, lead, etc., is good. However, the area of ​​completion of the mating group is a horrible and horrible thing I have ever seen and I would not have seen. I am afraid that it will defend me for the rest of my life. Although I think anyone who gets the film is very worried, my wife and some friends were treated in a very similar way and I did not need a clear reminder of their fears. I saw the film at the SXSW film in Austin, TX and none of the people who were sent or staff attended. I would like them to have the opportunity to protect the violence in their film, which I heard was excessive, inappropriate and unwanted. The early location succeeded to describe the situation they were struggling with, but without touching your face in extreme sexual and open violence. This film should have a large WARNING label on it. For these reasons I will not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
