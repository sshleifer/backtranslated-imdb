Janeane Garofalo has been very public in his anger about this film, calling, among other things, anti-female. He also said on his radio shows that he hates doing "romantic comedies" because he does not trust him. I agree with Janeane wholeheartedly here. This film is the best problem. He does his best, but in general, it was anything more interesting, incomparable "romantic" which has no foundation in the real world. Although there will be people who will say "stop your lack", someone is motivated and strengthened almost every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeane's behavior, for some reason, is often done in the shadows and darkness, which makes her look uncomfortable, while the character of Kana is sealed with light tones (which might not be interesting to Janeane and perhaps one of the reasons that hate this film). That really hurt the film if we should buy the foundation that Janeane should be better than the two. Many have said here and on other threads of opinion, Janeane is not bad, but in fact, it's quite good. I have not read one review where the man said Uma was looking good. Having said that though, I believe that the behavior of Ben Chaplin would be more than staying with Uma, not Janeane. Most men do not like wise women (and most women do not like intelligent men), and sadly, Ben may have stayed with Uma. And despite the efforts of the director to make Janeane impossible, it does not work. Its natural beauty comes in any way. I think most of Janeane's fans who have loved him like this film because they like to think of themselves in Ben Chaplin's character, and really fast with Janeane. Janeane is more difficult than the character playing here (real life is always much harder than Hollywood can think), so take girls cool shower. This is a role that Janeane is well known, and that is a shame, for this is not a good film.
