Carnosaur 3: Types of Primal (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn. Why even bother to review this film? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which the top secret military people discover those involved in modern murder (and very fake) before killing people through gory. The original was very bad, good was worse. This goes somewhere in the middle, although it is not associated with one of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. R tested for image abuse and gore, pictures of gris, and dirt.
