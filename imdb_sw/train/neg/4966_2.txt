I understand that this film was made on a very low budget but that is not the reason for strengthening that is Grendel. Deathstalker, the Throne of Fire, the King of the Jews, the Conqueror, the All-Anonymous Assistant took place on budget cuts and special effects of effectiveness but they were still able to create worship sessions by adding some women with fun and fun women's sense of humor. . The old clothing, the dark palaces and the beautiful Bulgarian environment gave Grendel the possibility of having a low-budget sword and magic film, but the creators completely destroyed this opportunity by using the negative effects of CGI and non-colored characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It could be Kane of Citizen but it is a good example of how low-tech-scientist / entertainment entertainment can be made using special reliable effects and interesting characters.
