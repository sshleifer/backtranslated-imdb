Photography on DVD is dark I thought the screen is dead. I think I didn't see a half of the movie. However, it was well done and not interesting. I did not find a story related to the title "black widow". I was hoping secret or exciting but did not participate in enough after the first frames. I lost the movie especially to Willem Dafoe and I was sad to lose his talent. I don't believe Giada Colagrande has learned a movie to do long enough to develop a great motion picture. He is fascinating and can continue to be an actor but he did a lot of work in this film. Although married in real life, they have no chemistry on the screen. Their relationship did not seem to be reliable. I do not understand why other characters were even brought on a plot.
