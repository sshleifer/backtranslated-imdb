I watched the entire film recognizing William Hurt's participation, Natascha McElhone, and Desiree Nosbusch. I am glad that I did not know the idea of ​​the existence of Peter Weller. At the end of the film I said "THAT was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for better performance. Weller played the main character, and his performance was that I would not recognize him. <br /> <br /> The sum of the plot was bad, the text was bad, and the performances, except for Nosbusch and Weller, were down. The beauty and environment were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, of 10 possible.
