It took only this film to buck in the National Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I've run. I don't know that I've seen the movie worse than this. True. And I can't write a bad review of the film I had no great respect for that, namely, Stephen Foster and his music. First, what is it? Is a music profile? Yes, a lot of tunes and Foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern types of numbers that reek more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone has been given PAID to write this drivel? Second, the REAL story of Foster is amazing. Why even come close to it? Third, what were they about Ray Middleton's great make him make this film? His pictures with young boys? With the Communists? What to lose a great talent. So, friends of Foster, and really, with good entertainment, panic ... become very, very, afraid.
