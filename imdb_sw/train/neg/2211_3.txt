Hahahaha !!!!!! This is the one that brings this film in a single word. For this trick was "something", because it can kill me using a movie!!!!! I hope the director, the author, and the producer did not mean this to be good, because he certainly did not !!! A scientist converts his child into a shark hammer, and a shark kill a group of people a scientist invited to the island !!! oh my Gooooooodddd !!!! I love this film so much that when I was watching I laughed all the great parts, because they were corny and unprofitable .... and could not make the shark seem more unrealistic, even though this "thing" had a larger budget than many less movies The budget.I should say it's watching this film intends to laugh all the bad acting, and talk of stupid corny, because if you expect a good film you 'I'll be very disappointed.
