Why am I? Why should I be under the slaughter like what could make an interesting plot? At least if I can warn others, it will be useful. I was supposed to watch this awesome movie for college course. Otherwise, I would be looking at the peak behind that and understood it. The movie was slow, had developed a little character, and thought the idea that a little white white man might be cold if he hang out with LA-style token black man. If you want to know the feelings of LA's speaking skills - look at the film. Remember, however, that this film does not depict what we have come to think of as "LA life life", is a wonderful example of products that leave.
