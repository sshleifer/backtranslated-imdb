Opposers of this film "Architecture 9" as one of the most commonly made movie. Always worry when that person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Author 5. Pastor, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 work! IMD shows that he and his father were 'western' western people. So maybe that was a problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example from the film: in the sheriff film testifies to another city for protection. Of course, bad people get and wait. But, what happens? Good men climb together and shoot out and hit a tree around them. When the camera shows us all the bad people just sitting on the log, they talk. What is wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I would like to continue. Perhaps this film was meant as a comedy. If so, it did not do so well.
