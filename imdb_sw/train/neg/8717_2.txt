This is one of the worst movies I have had to see. I watched this on DVD with friends on Monday night and we can't stop laughing from start to finish. The story is very simple: terrorists pick up the convoy they think it is carrying a uranium bridge, but actually carries a group of dinosaurs to eat people. Error easy to do. Cue team of the Army Army Army Armed Forces to deal with prehistoric animals. Guided by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; The person who seems to have been completed 'hate fart' acting, as advocated by Joey in Friends. There is a lot of gore and bullets too big, but unfortunately the Rance team seems to have a problem focusing on their weapons in the general direction of many hordes, which they made. Also, everyday lights seem to be able to walk and go out at any time of Velociraptor attack (perhaps we cannot see how bad the organism is bad). Having said all of this, we all have a great deal of fun about who will cut their head. <br /> <br /> As the Jusassic / Aliens style action adventure movie this movie is getting worse than the crotch of the dinosaur, but as a bold, tongue-in-cheek entertainment is the success of roaring.
