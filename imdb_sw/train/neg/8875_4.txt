If this is a "favorite" movie of someone, they need great help. There is nothing surprising or clever about this. I haven't seen the original movie this is a remake (some 1950 movie), but it should only be better than this new damage. Great is beaten outside the military for a piece of fringe, and the wind to teach children at the ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main is the Daman Wayans ... so your kids are in the world of terrible, infinite. What? Can the Jews beat those lost to shape? Can they make him more human? Film bombs like many Jewish films do, just for a moment. William Hickey gets one minute of screenshots, just a little bit. This old man (known to me as a "Story from the Player" of the Crypt, known as you like Uncle Louis from "Christmas Holiday") shines every time he's on the screen, which is not here. Bam Bam Bigelow also makes it look like a bike, which resembles it perfectly. I remember a little more Bam Bam, but I think made the role of "biker" on as far as it can be done for the military film. And then there is an interesting teacher, someone who falls to Major Payne though he is treating children badly, has no social skills and it is impossible to change that person you would like to spend time. He should be foolish or very strange. I don't know which (though it would seem "stupid" since the movie makes it clear that he comes out of the house often enough). These routes had one time shining: a series of drums where it performs a series of steps (including a very good "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 Crew Live. This was fun but not included for anything else that made the dog's film. Overall, try this film. If you want to see a lost film that helps eligible children to become heroes, lease or buy "Ernest Goliath for Kambi". At least he is a lovable loser, and really funny. Maybe if Major Payne fought with badger I'd like to feel good, but he didn't. Forget Payne, forget the Wayans ... you can do better.
