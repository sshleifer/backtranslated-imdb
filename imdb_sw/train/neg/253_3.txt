The movie column has been described and if you have done so now you don't have to pretend that I am an opponent of the film. And that being said my own opinion of the movie is very low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes into a group of his work is not very good with DOA 2 and 3, and others (a lot). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to get free to adopt because it's a Takashi film and something of Takashi can not be right. This is a high-school cinema. For the rest of us we will see and the hour and half of the child screaming because there is no really really scary (and yes, this does not remove the film), the speed of the film approaches the level of rigomortis, and Acting ... well ... hmmm. If someone is a Takashi fan you will see it regardless of your interests. You do not have any authenticity (see Neverending Story) or any behavioral development from the leadership behavior in the face of another crisis then one of the highest ones. As described this is the first film Miike has been confirmed by collaborative writing, but that doesn't mean much if it is not what we would like hope would be Miike's personality on the screen. All we get is some of the tiny sticks of the tiny walking sticker. <br /> <br /> The movie was able to be a great thing. The cluster is not hard to run wild. But this seems to have been hit down. <br /> <br /> My comment is if you just get in Miike is going to have some levels like Gozu, Ichi, and Inspection. Then the movie works like Harp's Blue, Fudoh, Dog Rain, Chinese People's Birds.
