This film line sets a new level of bad film production. Jared Rushton gives a good performance of very badly designed films, and thus makes a real impact on the worst movie. The main aim of the film is how a short-term trip to a Canadian desert after losing a plane crash allows a frustrated young man to cope with his pain over discovering the loss of his mother. Unfortunately it turns out to be an incredible collection of "life events" (including two very hokey events involving a fight against beba) and a wonderful hall that makes you wonder if this child is not just sitting on the beach in a dream-looking dream. All this movie (and it's a dream!). Additionally, despite the viewers of the family view of the film, there are several improper events for very young children or looking at the family, including an area of ​​experimental experimental underwater experiments and one of its seemingly avoidable eyes. . > <br /> All in all, a bad movie that no one should be under, many innocent children.
