A horrible act of conspiracy, a deliberate plot, a stupid and universal story of horrible movies includes this junk piece. It was exciting to stay. Just bad. Don't lose one cent on this. Movie theaters should feel bad about putting this film out there for people to watch. This "awesome" film did not even have a bit of terrible, horrible or disturbing. It was not in any way appealing. Acting was very bad with all actors that any attempt to draw you from the movie through the conversation was completely destroyed during the actor / actor opening his mouth. With the whole story, I don't know why someone will make a film with this story again. Don't waste your time or money. Even if it is a free ticket you should not lose one time watching this movie. You'll dumber to look at it.
