This film can't even say it's bad so it's sad, just a good pain. Lack of any true magic or imagination, a narrow plot is introduced to the absolute limit of 'joke' (which is predictable and high) is given to an extraordinary length that the deficit and the owns quickly find the viewer. Another rock symbolizing the downward spiral of John Waters and reminding us that what 'caused' or not heard us 30 years ago does not work the same way now. We've seen all of them before, and no longer rooted any roots because it has since fallen. Miss great.
