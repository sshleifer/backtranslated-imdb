I did not feel like I would be raped as I did with CHRISTMAS OF ENCHANTED, but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still an antithesis of BEAUTY and BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not with that very bad degree. It's bad, odd, idiotic, and writing is very bad. Read the story is working. These are not the letters we liked from BATB, it is a group of powders. I wanted to do it, but after a few minutes, I gave out, because no one has good sense to take this claptrap for weight. We have here three stories. "Word of Perfect" is excited, learning forgiveness forgiveness. "Fifu Folly" only works if you can accept the name of Babette is actually Fifi and that she is a closet close to James Bond and that Lumiere is a fool about women. "Broken wing" (or "broken wind" if I would like to call it) is probably the worst for that group. The animal hates birds? Since WHAT? Do not look at this video for each video of this video should be filtered. BEAUTY AND BEAST is still the most common movies, unusual celebrations of love, art, intelligence and human soul.
