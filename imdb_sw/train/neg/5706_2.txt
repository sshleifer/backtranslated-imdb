This film is like a movie of "cats and mice" thousands of years ago. (The following can be seen as a spoiler, but it only describes a great class of cinema). convince the story of the "impossible" love, loved ones taken captive, and of course the evil surprise and innocence of its cruel beasts. Everyone has seen tons of these movies already, and "National Treasury" resembles any of them, with little bound. Each side of the story was easily explained (and I can assure you not the most bright tool in the water). I have been exhausted and feel for money after having left the cinema from Hollywood, and if you've ever felt the same, look at my warning; get miles away from this film.
