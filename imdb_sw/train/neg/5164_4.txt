The basic program in this film is not bad. The woman makes it so big and turns to alma mater being adored. But, despite the good work with Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. For this I put it to Joan Crawford or the director or both, if its performance is very bad. Instead of being a real person, he makes a wonderful contribution to the effort made on the heads of the head. In other words, she looks away and has "golly I am SOOOO stunned" expression. After just a few minutes I became angry. Now this is not just a Crawford film that I do not like for its performance, as he did most of its mixing - in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many future films, like BERSERK! I advise it to try a different film of Crawford - it was certainly better.
