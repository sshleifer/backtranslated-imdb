So it starts with a good old house in the country. You have a group of people who need to be asked to come home and (not surprising) managers always close doors at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke etc. Dr tells them the spiritual story of this woman and other children. They are afraid, they begin to feel things. No, the girl sees the spirit. Others speak more then the great spirit comes and etc. This girl knows that this spirit killed little children and that she must be free of their own soul, yes yeah, blah blah. He does but, oh no, he dies as he does. And it goes to heaven when the evil spirit goes to hell. Two people live and run home. The script is awesome because the guy gets his head and cut and Elanor (dying to save children) says "oh no". Acting is timber, the effects are crap and set it a couple of apartments used frequently. Basically if you want to laugh on films made, see, but if you're looking for scary then you will definitely give them this film. I was shocked when I looked at this. Great bigger. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film is awesome.
