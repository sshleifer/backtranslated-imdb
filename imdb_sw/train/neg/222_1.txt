As one woman over 40 years, I have found this film very disrespectful and disrespecting women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, delightful attempt to write and direct "flick flick", and miserable. Andy McDowell is not a lot of start-up actor, but due to the "conspiracy" (I hate even referring to a plot) in this, he had no chance. attempt to make the film in any way true or reliable. And then there is a male fantasy of an attractive woman directly to decide to give lesbianism a try - PLEASE. The DVD rental, I also want 112 minutes of my life back.
