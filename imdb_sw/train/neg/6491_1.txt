This film was a perfect waste of time. I watched this film with a group of movie assistants, who have different tastes in movies but always struggling for the "genius" work (if one of my fellow speakers on this site had a bucket to mention this bunch of leaks ?); none of them had one quality of redemption. We finished the film and the chorus of stimulating me not published here. I can just think that the positive comments provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself. Later, if one of the reviewers will tell you, did he finance the film himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere in the world, for that, will have a risk of one cent or its good name in conjunction with this film. Do not allow half actors who appear in the film are attracted to their categories? as Christian Slater admits in the specific elements "make of" she signed on the film without reading the script or knowing any details (evil I'm sure she will never repeat). It is a pity of the evil person who sits in this written, inspired, produced, and sponsored person who is very popular to admit to himself that not everything he builds is a masterpiece (and if you believe me please google "Anthony Hopkins" and art).
