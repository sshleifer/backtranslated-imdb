See the edition of 1936. If I hear my soul getting the voice of Charles Boyer, he is more than a payer for Rudolf, very sad - I mean Omar Sharif is trying but, no - too good and strong. Catherine Denueve (sp) instead of being too old does not look like Marie - no! He also looks at even the thought of dying to the love of this person in that style. The only actor in the entire movie who offers the opportunity they are playing is Ava Gardner who looks like Empress Elizabeth on the screen is briefly (and looking at the pictures of the king are more identical) like history, Empress Elisabeth has not been very active in life Rudolf.
