I have never seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production. When DJ radio / oldies in 1988, I got a call from the production company. They asked if I would like to write and record a little they could leave the sound of a voice as a voice from the TV (TV screens cannot be displayed). I told them the truth, he wrote the discovery of the monster of the monster '50s sci-fi, blowing some sound effects and called to another DJ, Pam Landry, playing the female part. When he was in the sky at that time, he wore a long song, joined me with a mike in the production room and we cut a voicetrack to take one. Giggling, then returned to her show when I was confused in the sound effects of goofy. We would never have done if we knew that "Woodwood killings" would have been like Turkey - but, again, we have not been paid for our efforts, either! - Gary Theroux
