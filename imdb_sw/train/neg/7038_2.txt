Ah is the 1980s, during Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and other stars of hiding in hiding in a distant jungle that blows away. At that time I could not believe how movies are similar to RAMBO, CONNECTING ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the RED REDW? they wrote very badly. The TROMA` method is a language in cheek to pick up a variety of movies but you should invent the need for spoofing the first place? Of course no. The TROMA` war does not have any modern effectiveness - although it makes sure that there is no real difference between right-wing and left-wing fighters - and sometimes it feels more like a bridge than to send. Maybe it's?
