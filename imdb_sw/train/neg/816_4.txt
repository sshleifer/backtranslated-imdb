Back to the 1970s, WPIX ran the "Adventures of Superman" every afternoon afternoon for a few years. Every time, we would get a treat when they were despising the neighbor's air "Superman and Men's Mole." I always looked for those days. Watching recently, I was surprised how bad it was. It was not bad because of special effects, or lack of it. In fact, the costume of George Reeves' Superman was so bad, beside the padding of foam made it look so obvious. In fact, Men's clothing was worse. What was required that the furry lid could not cheat the ten-year-old, since the same as the zippers, the sleeve muscles and the badly woven fabric in hard cloth clothes were very clear. But these had shortcomings of forgiveness. No, what made it bad is the compound material. Over time, Superman failed to do anything to strengthen the situation. The lynch community is looking for creatures? Instead of surfing the crowd or looking for the beings himself, he stands to describe the risks to Lois and the PR. What? Creatures being considered? Again, he stands near to watch and talk but they do not save until they are shot. Luke Benson, the town of the rabbis-rouser, removes him? He tried to kill any sensible person, but Superman is always giving someone a lot of trouble. Superman had very few chances to avoid the problem in the bud, but never never received their benefits. That said, George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, they seem to be easily instant in the roles. If only they were given the best script to work with.
