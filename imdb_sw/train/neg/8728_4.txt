This is bad. The bad and bad movie of the film crimes that does nothing out of the ordinary in it. A series of crimes, a murderer who does not see in the entire movie, a classic investigation. And also the classic story on copi who defines what is going on and is not believed by anyone, so he has to fight himself to reveal the truth. Not so much in this. Vote: 4 out of 10.
