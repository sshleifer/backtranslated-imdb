"Shinobi" is one of those movies that think only the act of killing a character directly brings a sense of gravitas or feelings to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to really care about people who die, you should develop characters, otherwise all of them are a violent violent group. The problem is mainly included when you have TONS of characters, all of them dying. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if you can't be worried to make memorable characters or sympathy in any way, can you at least do the FACT for what are defined, right? Don't. Here we have a battle between two groups of ninja, without any direction knowing WHY they are fighting. They kill one another because the king says so. Yet even after it became clear that the king wants ALL they are dead, they still refuse to stop their worthless missions. That's not stupid ... that's dumb clear. <br /> <br /> Good, fine! There is no development of behavior, and the plot does not provide a good reason to fight. At least a flaw to fight in the screens of cool action, right? However, NO! In fact, most of the fights do not even war: super ninjas that the movie spent a lot of time and effort to establish a sudden (and in a manner, in my opinion). I am talking about such things as, "Lalala, I go along with the * neck * reduces *." ENDA for such behavior. Not even half the film, I threw my hands on the confusion of ignorance.
