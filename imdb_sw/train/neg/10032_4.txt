The story of the story was the same. Akshay Kumar was as good as always and that's the only thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor appeared bad. There was a hue and right on its zero size but didn't look good. I don't know why Hell made Anil Kapoor to accept a very serious role. There was nothing to do with him in the movie. Just because Yashraj's film does not mean that the actor has to accept the role yet bad. Al-Ali said. I think it's a good time that India's directors and manufacturers are starting to think of India's customers as much of the mind. Who are we? fools! What they think, they will show 2 men who do SWAT squad for teeters and we will trust them. What? The Indian police are very foolish that they are trying to try other criminals .... they take over 100 police force and no one has been around the building. That step died and I have never seen such a bad step. Akshay Kumar was in the middle of the 30-40 police circle all copying ..... and he shot them. No one of the police shot him but killed all the police. Kamba. Deal. I think the combat director who thought this area should take retirement. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend NOT to see MOVIE.
