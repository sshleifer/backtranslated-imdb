This looks like one of those movies that we think we like, but I didn't. It seemed to be trying a very difficult way to be 'very'. Flash all, without content. It has good events, and any of them is good to watch, but to integrate all together and becomes the hard work just to stay that way. I lost this because of a new comment on the video carton, and the fact that I am a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I found it to be proud and, sometimes, is boring.
