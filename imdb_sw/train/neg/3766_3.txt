I went to watch this film to know that it would not be good. but what I saw was horrible in words. I don't mean to be rough, his only movie was awesome. in general it was bad, i mean AWFUL special effects, acting was not so bad, but it was not good either, and sasquatch himself was like .... well, not sasquatch. In my opinion the best movie of sasquatch is Harry and Hendersons. not violence or fear, but it has a beautiful picture of sasquatch. at least his suit and not half of the ass cgi rip-off. just see this film if you want, or thank anyone in the film. or going to watch the boondock saints, it's better.
