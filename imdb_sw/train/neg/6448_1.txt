Unknown Creature is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Modern. This movie is a piece of leather from the beginning. It has a "stupid" plot, "silent", and so "special effects". Some thirty-something years of "after teenagers" are locked into shaded forests, reptilian, basketball ball around the world. What you get with this movie is a group of discussion and a small point of value. You have girls walking through the wood speaking, and then you have boys (with heavy mascara over) walking through the speaking trees. The whole thing is very interesting! Creating itself is not found in most films. If the picture is corrupted to mask the fact that it is a person in a ball suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, so the reason for blurring and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> HOME beautiful movie in ANY since the word and those here who are grateful are likely people who took off the street to "act" in this very interesting movie! Skip straight!
