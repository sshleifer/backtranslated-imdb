There are bad movies, horror movies and boring movies ... I can look more and keep it to the end, not this time. To avoid this as a blow, music breaks all heart, bad editing, no comedy, its tackier than a new mug ... My missus wanted to watch this thinking would be Legally Blonde material or something kind of watchable, but never better than average, panda flick. His first time he was asking me to push the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, well, could not start with (Denise has done well in Starship Troopers and Wild Things) but you've gone to gravel. I feel like a mug who has spent 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson is almost recognized after a great construction work on her face. Please take my advice if you want to avoid losing oxygen essential and brain cells to relax on the fabric on your screen.
