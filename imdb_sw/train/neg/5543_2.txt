To a great extent, I love these old movies and their humility but I looked at this for the first night last night and easily isolating myself into my five low all the time. It was necessary to be on the story of love or zombies ??? This movie was very bad after finishing with all the mercy I could do was laughing how ridiculously bad it was. Thanks I am too young to turn the movie without seeing anything or I can't brag about watching this way through one set! I would think something positive could say about anything in life so considering the theory I would accept the properties of this beautiful film, it was too short for a full film of length.
