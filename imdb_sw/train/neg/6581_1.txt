I lost the "New Best Friend" hopes of movies similar to the exciting games of young people like "Gossip" and "Curve". Instead, "New New Friends" is more like "Quantity in the crowd", where they have no exciting and acting it is very amazing. "New Friend Friend" is boring, and events during the movie are the same. Skip this film ... is a waste of time.
