I have read all the rave reviews here and am attracted to the views of those who loved this film. I can't say that I've got a lot to recommend. The voice of Leonard Cohen is not just a very heavy but dreary load. The film seems to be enough, but something has to happen to work, and nothing does: a secret conspiracy (not a real problem to me), not a character development, nothing else. It's just a slope. Caused as it is, the "Heavenly Desert" of Cimino has a very special moment and it is a film I will look at again. By reconciling the brilliant Western, HBO's "Deadwood" is better than "McCabe."
