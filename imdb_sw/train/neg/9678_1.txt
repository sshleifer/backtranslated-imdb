Sorry to say it was one of the worst films I ever saw. Although the most interesting exhibitions (for example the use of color was quite surprising), it was very good and disturbing (see father / child). Additionally, music is not available at all, and if you think of these wonderful voices by Michael Nyman (who wrote many of the Greenaway films) then you can think of what it makes. <br /> <br />
