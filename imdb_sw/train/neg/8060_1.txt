What's bad, bad movies! I tried to watch without a quick transfer ... That failed. After 30 minutes I finished the movie, I walked on the line to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Just 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a sense of confusion, provoking. I don't think anyone can get knocked down to get hit with a fluorescent bulb down a bit gutted by one! One amazing thing is that I watched the "Killer Edition" of the movie. The box says boldly "Blood more!" "Sex More!" "More terror than the release of exhibitions!" Yikes! If this film was bad and all these claims I just wonder how wrong it is "The UN-Killer extraction" was ??? If you want to see a great movie on the world of living & the dead world watch any of the Night of the Living Dead series!
