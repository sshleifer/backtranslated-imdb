This movie was completely ghastly! I can't understand how this film made. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, this is any fault of the writing team. You take the old plot - let's make our way out of being poor and poor - or STEP in this case. But this does not have any real plot - or at least one that anyone would care. With the Canadian speakers of what is supposed to be the American environment - this film is very flat. For a positive note, the management was good and the movie was very good too. It seems like the production budget was also generous too. My only request is that this team will remove it alone and go to find real-time journalists to help them bring live words to the film. Bad results - How she moves is how she uses.
