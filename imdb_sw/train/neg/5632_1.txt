I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW at U.S.A.) and I heard later that it was, indeed, a real bad movie. But they should cut a little out of the original film, or I missed a lot. Sexual incidents had very little dirt and no dirt (even even chest), but I have read several other comments on IMDb.com to mention damage and something about tampon. I did not see anything like that, a bad, stirring film and invisible characters and sophomoric conspiracy. Giada Colagrande can be paralyzed from the mouth or inserted into the gills, and nary words touch its face. And her name makes me think about Taco Bell's top drink: "I'll have Cola Grande!" It was really fun was so bad, I had to play if I was in my Secret Secret of Science 3000, noting things as the fact that the skin of Dafoe is so great for her face. It's really like a silly putty!
