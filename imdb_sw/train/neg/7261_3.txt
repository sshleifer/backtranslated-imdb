This British and Spanish partnership is one of the most popular films in Spain due to the expected anticipated achievements of Italy "Spaghetti" in the West and, as is the case with such efforts, it shows the eclectic balance of the establishment and emergence of international stars. : Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Surprisingly, however, this irregularity of the cinema gives an example of the majority of US Film films began to sink in the 1970s and are now common (or are they official?) come out. I liked to love this film, not only because the West is one of my favorite movies but also because it had all the features, including interesting background, good - not to mention The fact that my father bought a copy of the Novelzation paper of TOWN CALLED BASTARD next to its original family easily! As it is, the special power of the film (if, indeed, can be called so) is its independence: for example, Stevens, playing the widow for retaliation for the man who despised her revolutionary husband, sleeps in a coffin (!) Driven by car and his dumb servant (?) Sutton; Savalas, like a thirsty bloodwoman, who initially appears to be the great man of the film, is easily sent to his pastor Lettieri very early in the picture; The woman's piece, then, turns to Landau who, in the first film area, is seen robbing side by side our story of the hero-turned-shaw story! Fernando Rey, with blind animals, is the only one who can recognize Shaw rebels who, finally has just been ahead ... well, never! As you can see, the plot is very confused and becomes a stranger from there! The production team involved with this film was also behind other Western trips near the time period, like CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
