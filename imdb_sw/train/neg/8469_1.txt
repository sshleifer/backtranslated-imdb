"Children As These" can be a good film, due to the issue. But instead it has been a less-common movie, a run-of-a-mill TV week, and it's not many going to it. Acting is a stale, a conspiracy plot and direction does not exist. For the best movie on one subject, try the best "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a film that cares especially for people with Down syndrome. In "Children As These" are used only as excuses for the right feelings. It's very interesting. 1/10
