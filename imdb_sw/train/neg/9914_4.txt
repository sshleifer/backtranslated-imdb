This movie is facing a kidnapping from a mother's perspective (Lisa Hartman Black) who does if someone would be in an exciting act. Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police, here the mother tracks down her old husband who took her baby. He gets help from his lawyer who finally loves him. <br /> <br /> Before finally being infected by his son, many amazing things happen. The mother tries to pick up the child who looks like her child from the Children's Children's Place in the playground. He gets, then he knows not his child. That alone would have found many people put in the Minds or a few months in jail waiting for the trial. However, in this movie the mother is given a few hours because the parents of the victims feel pity for her. Soon the mother breaks the house of her mother-in-law and then the police come and they have their own gun but they let her run because they recognize her (and feel she)? Sometimes in the story they looked at the child, but when the police came to find a house they turned away from the back door and went into the river over the dinghy which looked Dad went just around for an escape as an emergency! The mother gets someone to lend a raft, and even though she must have taken some time (in the real world), she and the partner of the counselor, and the Police takes up to another raft in a hurry and has slowed down the fall by falling. Instead of leaving the raft to look for a father in the country, Mom thinks she drowned the boy and jumps into the water when he sees the jacket of his life. Of course, he cannot swim and sink like a rock. The lawyer saves, but they have no chance to follow Dad. One time Mom was told her baby died in a clinic in Mexico. On and on it goes, and there is no one knows! In other ways, this film uses a lot of child withdrawal and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman doing all the things that people do in these types of movies were interesting (or funny?).
