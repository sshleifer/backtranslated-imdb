Don't waste your time with this movie. This is a total of actions to act, lead, voice editing, sound sounds ... There was a loss of performance for some very good actors. The movie does not work for Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar who is also a star who is doing a very bad job. John Abraham, what is wrong with him? Is that what you call a call? I mean he should thank God that he has a good face or he would win Razzie awards in India if there were such awards in the voice. Asrani is a beautiful talent, but it is a little disgraceful as before. <br /> <br /> Screenplay which did not mention the abolition of Boeing Boeing of 1965 was very badly organized. First of all, sound people cannot do the original thing. On this they do not know how to replicate well. The joke in the movie was very busy, it was painful to sit on them. Priyadarshan can be a star on the south, but it is not necessary to make a movie of a decent Indian. Editing sound is amazing crappy. I can go with this issue, but the bottom line is that Voice should be embarrassed to make the film. The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What is wrong with you men? This is why the voice is where. Did you know that the voice makes movies more than Hollywood each year, however, many films are not heard outside the country, because of such movies. I am a Indian and I am a very embarrassing voice to produce this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were very strong. They are world class movies that are not available ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is probably one of the worst century. Period. <br /> <br /> I offer 1 out of 10.
