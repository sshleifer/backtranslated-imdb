Considering the risk of demonstrating gender relationships before the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could do better to make a single-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as more than a life test of Cahill. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film hit the same sex relationship between two attractive women to attract the audience. Also consider 90 seconds of causing crotches of several women to jump back on top of the top pole. This random area was important for movies and it seemed like this was only done to keep the audience interested in this bland film. I think the producers tried to deal with the boring plot and the most beautiful landscape of the film (the Oregon Track and Field Competition of 1980). Muriel Hemingway's infiltration and the same-sex relationship destroyed any loan that I would give to this film. Pepper Thompson
