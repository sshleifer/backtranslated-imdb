In 1941 Columbia was a great studio and could produce a movie with a similar police technical as MGM, Paramount or Warners. That is the best thing that can say about "Adam Had Children," opera soap opera and exhibitions near bland and Ingrid Bergman (over-billed for the first time in American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman has a French girl (this was when Hollywood thought that one foreign foreigner was as good as the other) employed as a migration to Baxter's children and staying up (for one disturbance caused by the 1907 stock market accident) until adult boys who attend World War I. Almost everyone in the movie is good-good is a relief when Susan Hayward as beauty goes into the middle? he is about the only person who can look at the movies even though he makes obviously Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is also the first in its long series of alcohol roles? but the script remains saccharine and the latter is quite preposterous. Not surprisingly, Bergman also denied the "Valley of Decision" four years later.
