I thought that the nadir's making of the terrible film was reached by the "Book of Shadows", I was missing. This film makes it look like the "Mabersons of Magnficiant" compared to this piece of shame, a non-brave thing that has the courage to call the film. I would like to write more but I'm still angry that I had enough to spend Â£ 3 lease, bobbins. <br /> <br /> And these people were English? and where the forest> I lived in the UK two-thirds of my life and even if I know no forests in the mountains. Any bally thing was seen as a conifer of faith. The angels seemed like porno tips (which were much more, my research). I did however as little when Judd was broken into pieces. I love and praise Tom Savini but NOT TO ACT
