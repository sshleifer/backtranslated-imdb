I can't imagine myself as one of the great fans of Leonard Cohen. However it makes a feature as an important poet / musician in my text / music heritage. For the most valuable element in this document is to hear Leonard's reflection on his life and work. Burn and humble. Unfortunately, most of the musicians who loved the festival did not talk about Leonard / literature status. Nick's cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton were different, although Leonard enjoys the Rufus Wainrights of his songs. What actually failed in this document was the ability of the film manufacturer to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is how these musicians interact with him. Many say in this regard, but the viewer is not recommended by the man Leonard Cohen. This fails is very obvious for interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon, but they can't translate their real value to Leonard Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is farce. The entire registry of life seems like a running task. And like in the entire film, Leonard Cohen just keeps his part and can say about his own part. <br /> <br /> All the project and screenplay is like a project project on the project. The use of effects such as echo, slow-motion or image shining is placed on the patient. Some camera functions are bad. The part of the mark did not remember any links I could expect. Sometimes it seemed that the filmmaker was adding psychological elements to the film. It probably refers to its immediate use of LSD. <br /> <br /> Some of the uncomfortable humor ... some time Leonard explains how he influenced the genres. Initially can not remember the name of the genre, until finally he says it was punk, punksters actually took his music. The next section in the film is life insurance 'I can't forget' ... <br /> <br /> "And I can't forget, I can't forget I can't forget but I don't 't remember who"
