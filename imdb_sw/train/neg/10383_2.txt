This can be one of the most enjoyable movies if you take it seriously. It's a bit of date and effects are crippled, but it's very fun. There are huge crabs that attack the girl. oh, and crab sing Japanese. It's amazing amazing. And last, which has been telegraphed in the entire film is hideously awesome. It is expected, but seeing the final struggle will leave you around your seat. Don't even give this film a chance and you will love it. Susan George is happy to see and yes, she seems to look naked. Her daughter is not worth considering, but she is attacked by a huge crab. They are the size of a big cat. This is 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I offer 7. Does I mention there is a great crab?
