This type of "inspiration" of saccharine is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs his thoughts as the world's largest semaphore. It removes from viewers the interpretation and feeling of making decisions. The big finish is to swim in the caller player who should work as a jumper cables on the car; I think you need that need to feel like you're ignorant enough to watch the film as simple and sappy like this. Struggle and wonder if he has a deep sense of emotion on display or whether it's just --- display, turn off and turn off as light. Because I can't for my life see how he could get life in such a film. Although it depends on the true story, and one of the impetus to be sure, implementation, implementation and exhibition plays as a third-degree film or semi-secondary school.
