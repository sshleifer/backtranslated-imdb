This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There were people who came out of the theater, others were asleep (right, it was a show of the night) ... This is a no-movie movie, one of those who can make you never want to see out of a normal image again. I would like to watch this film removal as I care about what is going on the ideas of the garbage. Do they laugh when they build all these foolish things or think they are doing something interesting? I am wondering ... The sound of the voice is far from other things that remind the original album of Bjork. Even if you are a fan of the music of Bjork, stay home. It's the best thing. Smaller pieces of good music are not the reason for going out and devoted to this suffering. God!
