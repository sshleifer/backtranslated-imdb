When I saw the preview of this film, I did not expect much to start - next to the second level of the horror movie. But wow, this movie was quite bad. And that's generous. First of all, making the film was bad. You feel sympathy (or for any feeling wrong) for the characters. Acting was so horrible that I would just be waiting and hope for God to finish. Secondly, there are points in a movie that had no connection to any plot. What? One can please tell me why a boy-watch begins to explore "PANCAKES !!!" on her lungs when she gets Jackie Chan I may never have seen before, and even told the boy with the virus? Why does the baby's father get angry with someone who is infected with the virus, and go to redneck hunting for him? I was left with the feeling of such confusion and unbelief that I said loudly, "Where did that hell come from?" I just believed what I saw. I really thought that I had seen some bad movies, but I must say that Cabin flu affects all of them. This movie made me look and then puke again. Then blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please, set an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass to grow, perhaps, is an appropriate alternative.
