I am very passionate about sci / fi and awesome movies - I've been looking since I had 4 or 5, so I've seen some very bad things, but I am fighting it. I have watched many movies of SciFi Channel so I don't expect too much - a very promising film that has no end to chat. Hope has an eternal fountain, I think - or a victory of hope on the experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a real dog from the beginning and I knew, but as a moth to the fire, I kept thinking something, whatever, interesting would happen. Not suitable. Both characters provide good performance - due to the script, I do not know how they all kept direct faces. It has nothing to do with hungry parasitic organisms that take over the community, one body at a time. There is a bad plastic surgeon that cooperates with the enemy by giving them the external appearance of humans ... don't worry, he gets what comes to him. The people of the snow themselves do not know where they came from, they think they could walk on the meteorite to the world, but ... somehow they know about the members of the slug gods among them - princess slug has managed to reproduce a man who knows that she is a small queen he loves himself ... oh, I must? Please, please, do not waste two hours of your life looking at this ... whatever will be better ... consider the worst, unpleasant way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this.
