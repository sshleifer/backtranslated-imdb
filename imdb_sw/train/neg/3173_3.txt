This movie is similar to the play called 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The wife's spirit and central plan is very closely connected with writing to Coward. I am surprised that the original movies do not recognize the concept of the original author. I realize that the public cannot realize that this is a knockoff but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These movies are very expensive to produce. I do perk up when the screenplay is original. I even lost time is a creative way to generate a job that was previously released. There were mentioned samples (such as Topper, etc.). I know that movies are still a form of cheap entertainment. However, I am not happy when the public taste is easily taken. In this case, the public taste is ignored. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the best entertainment of the film produced. <br /> <br /> In this case. I rather see playing.
