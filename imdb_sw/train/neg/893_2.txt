When I bought this DVD i though: "It seems to be good comedy light on love and relationships created in Portuguese standards? Let's give a chance?" I was totally WRONG! What a terrible movie! First, not comedy; is a cheap festival that can be so much kilogram that is worse than many Portuguese soap programs! Second, the plot is boring, and leads anywhere? Does not have a structure, just passes, like wind, in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Mixing sounds is awesome, because sometimes sounds are connected. Did I remind you of the old Portuguese movies from the 80's? Acting would be good too? Well, in general, it's not a film like this that the Portuguese movie will help! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen over the years! The worst argument, the worst acting, bad production? I didn't have much hope for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever thought! Just forget about it!
