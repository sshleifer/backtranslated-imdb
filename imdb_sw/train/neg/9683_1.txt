I give them this piece of craft pride because I don't believe there is the worst film in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this film, I hate acting, chat, set, write and guide. I hope everyone who is involved in this film burns and draws into the dark circle of darkness. Try this dirty dirt of time. I pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my thoughts. I pray that I wanted a movie, and that I have never seen it in <br /> <br /> my local video store. BURN IN HELL
