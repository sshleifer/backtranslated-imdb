The doctor who tries to complete a dream of transplanting therapy tries to secretly conceal the dead from the hospital for a different success. His last chance comes when he likes his head for a boy wearing a car. I was looking for cheese and for this reason I believed I got it. It has everything that a bad movie hunter seeks - chest and brain surgery and surgeon-based surgeons and special white headings, unique camera tips (I always look at the back of the passenger wheels), cheesy clarinet stripper music, and one of the longest death scenes in the history of the movie.

The best part of the film in my opinion was the 1960's "body purchasing" and I even found myself accusing it at that time. Do not waste this money - there are better movies out there to enjoy your mood of humor.
