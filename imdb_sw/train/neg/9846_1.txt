You may be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers looks at it. That will be a mistake. This is one of the most useless movies that have been done. I continued to wait for something interesting to happen, but there is nothing interesting in this film. Even the film industry realized that this was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. It's amazing that it was installed on the video. I wonder what kind of contract that led the retailers to be this film. I also wonder why people involved with this film were allowed to go to other films. Certainly this film is losing money used to make, and lose time to anyone to watch it. There are indeed secondary school students who will be able to write / produce a film that is a plot.
