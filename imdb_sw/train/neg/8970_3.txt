The first movie of the Cube was a movie of art. It created a world where the main archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they tried to understand the world of hate that they could not understand. It was, at an unprecedented rate, a "man against violence", where a man who represented innocence and goodness came through the end, overcoming a new, unknown world than a small group of man; The world where there was no more struggle, but peace. I measured 10 out of 10 cube, and it's a movie that has never meant to have any sequels. The second movie, Hypercube was a great desire. Some of the ideas were cool, but in the context of the original film, the story and the landscape was uncertain and had no meaning. However, having a good entertainment, I evaluated 5 out of 10. <br /> Movie three, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, acting as the first rehash of B-movie's first business, without a sign. No "honor" or "tax" here; there is only a stop. That kind of plot, and other things idiotically changed (like having a letter instead of a large number of cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a deficiency of nature and nothing to say). "behind the curtain" means nothing, because observers are only part of the Great Effort, the architects who do not hear anything. And, in this film, those who enter the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where * bleep * is meant to that? That's just flippin 'stupid. I am glad I did not pay you to see this. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and acting in Zube Zube is not so bad, but these stories and ideas have no inspiration which this film can only get from me rating of 3 out of 10.
