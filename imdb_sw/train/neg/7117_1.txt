If the film begins the author warns us SKULLING SKULL is so awesome you can die for fear - and as such happens the free burial is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anyone is dead for fear of seeing this film, but a few can die with weight. SKULING SKULL is a kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look beautiful. Greatly based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is about a rich but fearful woman who gets married to a bad man whose first wife died under confidential circumstances. Once placed in his home, he is tortured by a half-minister farmer, a picture of death, a pig, and finally a skull around the room and causing him to scream. And with his talent, actor Peggy Webber is very loud. Unfortunately, its ability to do so is the top part of the film. The program is very transparent, to say the least, and when the cast is actually the same, the script is awesome and the movie so inappropriate will be ready to run yourself. Actually, something that only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels long. Add here this quality of real print and you're there. <br /> <br /> There are films that are very bad to watch. It is true that SKULLING SKULL has a few fingers - but the film is very attractive I could not work more than ever, and when one thing is on your head will come from an ennui. If it was not through Peggy Webber by shouting, this would have been a sure cure for sleep. Do it. GFT, Amazon Reviewer
