I think I was attracted to this film because of the story of the story and the leading actor, so I gave the opportunity, from the director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldier). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) has been initiated by the police, especially the Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush) Administrator, is forced to run the group and go against them to clear his names and family. That is exactly what I can say about that story, because I didn't pay attention to being very honest. Also, with Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini like Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton and Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning like Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths like Susan Scott. Ledger makes good performance, why it is valuable, and the film has an interesting time to watch, especially with gun wars towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it if I didn't look at it all. Okay!
