Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately lead is not his tote. I had high expectations on the film before hiring and maybe that's why I didn't like it very much. I like Spacey Experiments to make a film that takes place especially in small cases, but not a counting attempt. I saw the film is lighter, interesting, and it's identified. Acting was not surprising. Gary Sinise has done very well, especially since she knows in many of her films. Skeet Ulrich was desperate, but this was one of his first films (I got a kick of how young and chubby this scream star appears). The only thing that pushed me on this film was one shot of the car from the top. The middle line of the road was fully focused and the camera moved along the line and passed the fall. However, the shot was "ordinary characters" ish and I think my Spacey got an idea from that original film of her (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fun film that is done in a small, look at the Hitchcock Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should look at it before you open this.
