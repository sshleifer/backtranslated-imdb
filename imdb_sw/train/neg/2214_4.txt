This movie was not quite impressed, but it was very bad. acting was certainly very good! The jeffrey leaves did a good job as a mad scientist, which is the only kind if you do not know such things: D. bill bill. he is a very good way for these kinda things, and his role is not very important. I rented this with the two leading powers, and I wasn't very desperate. I mean, heck, it's a movie about shark man / half shark. Not the people of Shakespeare. Other than a conspiracy, which is full of holes, and poor dialogue, I would like to note that movies are leaving many things to want. there were shots were trying to look "cool", but it ended up hiding the area or just coming from the cheezy open. they also beat many times during good conversation and cut earlier before someone even gave a line. it was very bad. but if you're a fan of sweets of jeffrey, this is worth watching. gives good performance and does what he can and behaves. Forsythe is not bad either, and either is the female leadership. heck if I can remember his name though. down, I can't waste your time.
