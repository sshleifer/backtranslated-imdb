(Spoiler possible or two) <br /> <br /> "The salvation of the soul" is the most likely of the worst exhibition of ever-ever movies. There is nothing important, there is a conspiracy about a girl who has a wonderful vision of people who may or may not die. The whole movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really bind together, at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Tha who works does not exist, the camera function is jerky and the script is confused, only makes the movie difficult to watch. I continued to wait for something to connect the movie together but nothing came. Certainly the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
