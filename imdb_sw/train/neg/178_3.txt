This movie was made-by-TV, so considering it, I can run into it as hard as I would like a feature film. Script is small, but it succeeds to be humorous gentle in advertising, whether it means to be or not. Acting is more advanced-over, but that's true for many low-budget movies. The view of this film that I liked so much, though, was that 90-95% of it was shot in the film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the picture is being played on the video. You can say because there is a slight difference, the color is not clear, and the picture is clear 30 frames per second instead of the appropriate 24 frames per second. I don't know if these events should be shot later and then they did not have money to photograph the film (I think this is the reason, however), but it worries and makes the film appear to be the player than it appeared. However, I have seen the worst movies, but I certainly can't say that I enjoyed this film and I can't recommend anyone to see it.
