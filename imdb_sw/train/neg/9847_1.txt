Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a pirate cook who takes the captain after killing the previous one. Although he has seen the treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets becomes empty. So, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (puts an advert for it?) And help guide the way to the treasure. It is intended to change how anyone can register this useless film. The former Goon Milligan elder ruled Medak as a director, and gave the Medak talent in the Governance Film, perhaps I think of what the crop is, the unprecedented events were Milligan in the chairman of the director. Peter Boyle looked for a moment in the first 10 minutes of the film as a pirate striker. He may be so grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year that was filmed by films, so that he could put this off again. Franciosa seems to be striking like a good-back-player but he and the whole seller seem to be very good, and even the hair of the traders and hair seems very frightening. They should know this movie was a bomb even if they photographed. For such verses, I can understand the possible cancellation: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (about embalming) You will pay for this. TYPES: No, I'm winning t. I will do for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the GOOD jokes. It is amazing to me that many Sellers devices are still available on the vaults, but this was released on VHS over the last 15 years! How does a person descending on a plate with a casting in the US receive a well-received UK "A Show Called Fred" with Sellers, Milligan, and led by Richard Lester?
