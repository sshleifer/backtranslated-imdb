If you want to watch a non-fictional, odd, incredible story of these men (and one woman) who are happy to beat hostage, if you want to enjoy a story that goes anywhere of these two, one of the strikers and another gay man, then you should watch this film. After watching this film, I felt broken and cut, as a director of the film myself blowing out of me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where one is not anticipated for a conspiracy or a good acting, this is a movie to watch in fear and wonder. Many like to check the plane crash or the fall of the train. If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, movie "B", or even a short film, this is not a film ... Warning for all who watch this film, please eat it before. You may want to puke the end of the film.
