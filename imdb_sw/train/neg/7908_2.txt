I did not expect too much when I saw this in the Palm Springs Movies movie. It was another choice when two other films were sold out. However, I was optimistic. It seemed a little like "Mrs. and". " B & P was not perfect but it was a fun and laughing film and the characters it looked like. "My Bride" did not have anything. Acting seemed to look and the way of numbers. People were so clich√© story looks like it would have been written by a high school pupil freshman drama. Technically, that voice misled me. It seemed like there was a lot more of dubbing to talk. I mean a lot. I know sometimes it's important but it looks like half of the film was shot in the closet and it was very scary. <br /> <br /> The two stars are very generous.
