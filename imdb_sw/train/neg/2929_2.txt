Not funny - who can connect this to Monty Python? That's absolutely ridiculous - no laugh. This is not funny. On top, but bad, weird just for weird and it seems I these people were on something at all. Unfortunately something that didn't make them few. <br /> <br /> Should be given certain points for any bid. Really seems there is a track track - or is there one? Hummm .... Since there are any doubts that are a possible question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing that right - maybe it's kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in this case whatever is going on, don't worry. But these boys are playing women with high-pitched voices, turning stones. Come !!! It's not funny. There is only one successor to the Monty Pythons who is intelligent and that's Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
