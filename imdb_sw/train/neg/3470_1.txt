Like many movies of Ben Affleck, the comedy is dry and legendary story. That's if you want to call it this story. Many elements were left connected with no ideas. I want to thank the director for explaining the best points. I say this because, that would mean long suffering. On either side of Ben Affleck's failure, this is not an exception and can only be saved by other actors. However, acting in many places was made and was not believed. The lowest trips and executives who have not seen in the years had no value to enter. They all think they must be told, they are also joining quickly to the "has" rank. My choice was to wait for my car to be ready or to watch this film. I made the wrong decision. All in all I would like to give you one laugh ... especially because that's all I came out of.
