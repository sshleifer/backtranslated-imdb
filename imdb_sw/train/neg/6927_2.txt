Although I beat this film for 2 to be fully displayed in an attempt to create an awesome film of quality it was 10 on a large scale. I didn't know what was going on in movies or people who were but I wasn't worried because I knew every area would have something to make me cry and laugh. Talk is low in the movie but I believe this is because they started to photograph without a script. The fact that no plot of the conspiracy makes the film very mixed. It doesn't matter if you sit down and look at the movie from beginning to end or if you look at it to restore you will be confused and happy. I especially like the area where the prisoners are running around the outside blowing each other with sticks. I believe the doctor says this as treatment. Genius!
