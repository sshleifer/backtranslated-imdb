The word summarizes the writing of oh;) Five girls are going to try to find their way home, when they stand at the shop to get the instructions they are driving on their head, looking at the area with the right to trouble but suddenly they see one head coming behind them (ooooh). From there everything is screaming, screaming and harassment as they try to leave with this lost person because of the head;) screaming and crying loudly through the entire movie (very angry) The movie is shot, and a cheap camera trying to make it appear "real" or "awesome" I think, it's just a shame and useless. By lacking anything better to compare, "the style of Blair's witch". <br /> <br /> Right and right for the whole movie and the crappy sound was about to suppress the top, you actually get the head :) I'm sorry but this was not scary, just a furious piece of movie crap.
