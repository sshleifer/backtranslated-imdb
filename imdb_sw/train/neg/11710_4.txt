There is only one reason to watch this film if you're not connected to one star or producer: actor Nichole Hiltz. He is a show in this slow and moving story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, star films Joyce Hyser as a divorced wife who decides to take revenge on her cheatin partner. Oh, but not in the usual way. He plans a guerrilla battle and uses a bad girl Nichole Hiltz as his weapon to choose. He wants Nichole (as Wednesday) to be close to him (who was good but little Stephan Jenkins, who should be connected with music) to make him embarrass and destroy his life. David DeLuise is good at a short time, and the star of "Crime Story" Anthony Dennison has been given anything to do but scowl. Hiltz on the other hand comes from time to time as sexy and playful, then evil and deception. He also deals with the vulnerability and "perhaps a bit of psychological" well. He is also hot (although there is no naughty show shows) so that you can understand how he can find anyone who is looking for him. But the performance is a type of loss in this film, which is not just to destroy or attract enough to recommend.
