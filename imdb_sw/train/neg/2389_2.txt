If Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and big toes) that pass through a crossing country, finally find a real place among the peyote-glowing cowgirls in a field that is preserved to protect the Red Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their gender leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who loves to Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant explained and changed the book of Tom Robbins, but his satire has no primary goal and just skitters on the map, like Sissy (perhaps it was his goal, but not involving them to the audience). Of course the notable box-office was not as much as it was ignored, and one can see why: it is a series of drawings in search of the field, and the exhibition, touch of instructions and movies vary.

Author Henry Henry (who did not write this, but perhaps should be) gives the most reliable performance as a doctor working on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> The two lowest.
