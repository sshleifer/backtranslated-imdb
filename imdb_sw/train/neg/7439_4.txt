Look different for fear. The difference between photography between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American view this movie was not very good. The protagonist, Marie played with Anastasia Hille was not a good character and I had a hard time finding him. He was unacceptable on many occasions and confused for a lot of time left. Also a good time was found by bringing the main film to the film. Then long before any real doubts have been built. Once it happened it seemed that it was used as a major effect that was to make it more sad than anything else. The concept was more natural than Direct-to-video movies and did not use sex to create a thin plot. All in all I would like to recommend for lease, but not for sports travelers.
