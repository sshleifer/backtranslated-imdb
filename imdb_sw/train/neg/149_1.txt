Well, you know others! This has to be a very bad film I have seen for a long time. I can only think that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking this responsibility. The role of leadership is played and (complete) is unknown and I would like to think of extending back to access after this Turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led military payments in 70 years and since then fighting events must be martial arts based or at least brutally using the street fighting tactics. This movie uses quick use to show military art, however, even this can not hide the fact that a woman does not know how to throw a punch. The 8-year-old could take him away from this display. Sorry, the only secret on the show here is how this did not win the raspberry gold for its year.
