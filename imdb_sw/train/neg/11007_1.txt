Recently they have been trying to lose this night film at the end of cable television broadcasts. Don't believe hype. I was one of the uncomfortable people to see this stinker in the movie. This is, in my opinion, a 3-worst Movie, behind the Mac & Me (# 1 worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 worse), but I must admit it, all is close to all TERRIBLE! Actually, nothing of this film is amazing, or anything that combines it, or anything else that says it's not wasting your money. The only thing is good to give to your worst enemy. It's not a lie about it. The person you would like to kill or torture would be the main candidate for this film. It's a very bad thing. If you don't believe me then you have to suffer through the trouble of this look, which I doubt that you can finish. Two thumbs with enthusiasm down.
