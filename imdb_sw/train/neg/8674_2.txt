The first few minutes of the "Bodyguard" have the charm of the camp: it opens with a crawling text from the Bible (a part that Samuel Jackson tells recently to be victims of in "Pulp Fiction"), and continues with two school karate teachers in New York discussing the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba looks, playing himself; immediately stops flight and break the bottle for two with his handless hand. Unfortunately, the value of any entertainment, deliberately or unintentionally, is soon faced with an unrelated story, lack of action for a long time, and poor quality of any current action. To put it easy, that's why “The Bodyguard” is a non-waiting movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There is hardly any war. 3) Existing conflicts are short and very tough. Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is good, her face is glorious. It is only for them that I offer "The Bodyguard" 2 out of 10. This movie makes 87 minutes to feel like 5 hours.
