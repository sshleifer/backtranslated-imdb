Well, I say, this film was so bad I could walk if I didn't have a job inspection. Not too bad, I wanted to see it so badly that I walked around the city, I paid $ 10 for double parking because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - when only I saw him playing another one was in the same movie by John Travolta. Anyways, the plot has the potential - it seemed good in the preview, but it is full of ignorance, predictable, weak return of conspiracy. And I was hoping that this would be a single Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN "should be saved, and that Santa did not need to substcdmetn, but nope. The only cool place was climbing the sleigh, and the little boy was the best character. that this film can be good for small children, but for adults it is so lame that it is chore to stay.
