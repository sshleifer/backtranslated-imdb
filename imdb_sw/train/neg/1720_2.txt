Few of unprofitable characters are terrified by a prehistoric creature. This creature is seen in thirty seconds of motion motion motion, but oh how you would like it for all the time during all the film animation is replaced by the producers of the production around the inner tube and teeth. There is no time to panic when this movie has been taken half of these boat-leavers, which suddenly become the leading actors; but again you have gotta accept watching the try that funny is better than plodding around the sheriff. Just one of them is given up and the other is sitting on the rock crying for loneliness - not fun!
