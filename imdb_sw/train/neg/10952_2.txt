I hate how this film does not have the most intuitive input. I know they're going to be real, but to be clear I don't just want to be realistic. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will come, live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk about it. I can deal with low production standards, hell I am a player for low production standards, but at least work in good ideas. Trends only go to grab camcorder and walk around a bit, but I really need to dig that because it makes more things. Hitchcock was saying the drama was essentially a life and bits are well cut. I can only conclude this is not a game, not a long shot. We see Rosetta walking elsewhere, Rosetta working in the bakery, Rosetta eating a meal, Rosetta carrying around the pockets, Rosetta walking home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... not just entertainment. No more deep meaning. I got so tired that I wanted to reflect on life in this film but it is quite clear, the best done in business. I think I need to love this, but come, nothing there.
