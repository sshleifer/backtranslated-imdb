I stole this film when I was a member of the university. I have tried to watch it three times, second second because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I have never heard of this film, but since he is very funny you gotta be funny." Still! I cannot rely on this match team after a nightmare of a nightmare / nightmare, where the burning of a good sex man causes your physical pain. You would think that the awesome comedy hurts you is ridiculous, but after this look you will know the truth. This movie is not worth the price I paid. I looked at the tons of Steven segal movies, and I saw even the Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't watch this.
