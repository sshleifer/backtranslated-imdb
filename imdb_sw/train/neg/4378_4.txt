From the head to the modern art box, I was ready for everything. Perhaps my hopes were just a little less, because I was left a little dry. The film workers working on sex sex films are completed in a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is having sex. Where was this not used before? The difference here is the nature of sexual destruction. It is not allowed to display all (shots legitimate legitimate shots in Japan for a long time, what is shown is being examined) The film tries as hard as possible to show the viewer how common sex is not. <br /> <br> In the center of all kinky on, the dope monster (who originally I can't learn) shows up and started killing people and raping women ... then killing them too. Some sights are very little, especially when a woman with her intestines has found out through her vagina or another woman with a mouth of ... things, but otherwise gore is a good standard rate. Finally the film has been hit by its own designs; is more sexually becoming a horrible picture of horror and also anger to work as flick sex. Members can work, but there is a need for equality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
