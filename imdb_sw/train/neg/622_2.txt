This film involves a lot. The main character looks like he's 35 and I've got scrawny beans and balls more than this person. The pieces of the plot are so predictable even not worth checking for the cause of the trick. Some of the worst discussions I have heard in the last 3 years, "lets go get a small animal tortured". <br>> <br /> Ugh ...... <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unknown
