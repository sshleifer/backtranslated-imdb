Recently recently on the AMC cinema and I was laughing. I had great hope of this adventure which follows in the vein of the "Journey of the World Core" and "Wonderful Island". I was shocked not only in the merits of acting but in a silly story line that reads from the comic book of five years. Be sure to see the front of the wire that goes on Pterdactyl wings when they know "Ogar" a half idiot man before modern who becomes a friend of lost warriors. Finally you have stopped reopening for the same effects as "People You Are Celebrated". Don't waste your time.
