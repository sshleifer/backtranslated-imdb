I will accept you. I think Uma Thurman is a very beautiful woman in the world and has made it a message to see every movie she had (unfortunately includes films containing Batman and robin, The Avengers) and this. <br /> <br /> This is suitable as the worst movie I've ever seen. (it looks even lower than the Avengers). everyone seems to lose in it and not out of faith. Even if you think if you are a female god like I do, PLEASE PLEASE don't get involved with this film. you will hate the next morning for him.
