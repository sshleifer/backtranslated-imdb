At least the seats in the playground were good and I ate pop maize as loud as possible to stop the poor conversation. This is not just a girls' film. Any blokes that love it, are we women we can be sure to stay away from. Dumb's story, brief discussion with the overall cheap film. I have seen many movies, but this is a new winner in a bad community. If you're going to see it, one thing you'll expect is the end. So you can finally run on the theater as soon as possible.
