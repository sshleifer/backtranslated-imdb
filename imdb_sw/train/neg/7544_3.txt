First this movie was not bad. It was entertainment ... at least for all the wrong reasons. I've never seen it before I can compare these two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me to Christopher Reeve of the movie's Damned. These two movies have different plots, but this feeling of refusal and unwanted hatred is in both. The wicker man thinks that the mystery / thriller / men please do not use the women's movie. I don't know anything of paganism and sacrifice was a little far away. Nicholas Cage, his self-centered glory goes to the known island of Summerisle when he receives a letter of calligraphy from his long-lost girl who says his daughter has been taken away and hid by the islanders. Cage is a police officer and a fearful policeman goes to an uninhabited half island leaving a word for anyone who is in the real world. Foolish. Things get stronger when many Muslim women who live on the island visit and lie about where the girl lost. His wife is not help who seems to be grown and tired all the time. Cage sits on the island when she learns that the lost girl is her daughter and she is a lucky man who cheated to come to this island as a victim of sacrifice during the sick harvest festival. do not do very well. Is the feminine infections of the female vagina? I saw the movie breaks at some point especially when the castle attacks other women and runs around the suit. I think there were too many buttons in this film. I see the whole concept of angry women locking themselves on the island regardless of the most entertaining, but the way shown in this film was amazing. Although many women have been hurting and shocking this is a clear type of sex. I would like to turn the film by ignoring if the roles were changed. This movie is something to watch perhaps once or twice. It is not an exciting thing to be categorized as strange.
