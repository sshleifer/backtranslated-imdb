First off I would like to say that if I had to imitate this film from 1 to 10, then I would give it -4. It's not that I am a critical critic, it's just that this movie is bad. Everything from the story, to lead, for editing is bad. The story is not worth half of respect to start (you can't expect a lot since it depends on the video game, something that I didn't know to go to the film) but leadership and editing made it even more. The movie is reduced by the maximum points and goes to events that are not completely related to the previous; The other, if the sex scene quickly in the middle, do not mean to be put in the story to see how characters do not express any feeling to each other. You can go to this film you expect to see a bunch of stuck on the screen for an hour and a half and you still want to despair. In fact, if you pay to watch this film then you lose your money, and if you do not pay anything then you are still missing an hour and a half of your life. So make your consent and keep it.
