The reviewer said the movie is not all bad. What?!?!?! The movie promotes child abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it, then let's get 5 out of 10 stars. Why not perfect 10? Because the film was "amazing," the baby's shock was "unreliable," and a friend of oil was "angry." There is no place in the inspection that the auditor explains to any prejudice that the American movie in 1981 showed the incidence of a child who has sex with an adult woman. I happened to catch this boiling bread while I stayed at a hotel that was Showtime. For me, even if a fat friend made a storm and was eligible for Oscar, I'd like to give the movie just one star. Howard Hessman's television played on the film at the same time as it appeared in WKRP especially with ignorance. But don't take my word for it!
