Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, and a little bit about the Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humidity. Good, and put that action, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how it enjoys Japanese listeners, Mamoru Oshii is a very good-director despite modern things in the style of Talking Head , and even that was strange and somewhat interesting- and I'm surprised you came with this. It can only be one of those lost-in-translating cases, I am afraid of, but as a European observer watching a film containing a full-loaded English load that I thought was awesome. The joke seemed to be rough, the script was cooked-meant, giving the audience a rest, and freezing a little you narrator-damn - to the point of making my head interfere with overkill's fast-paced talking and amazing action. br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was real. The idea is good, and is used well in those animation screens. However, candy-eye opens as soon as the characters are left aside to start with endless and not funny in all the speech-jumbo speech on the image yet. It just makes you want to develop quickly to the location of the object of the refusal of the leaves. I have read Mamoru Oshii in fact planning a series for this. This idea was good but it is misused. Perhaps the second part will bring the best parts of this first and actually makes an interesting film, or maybe it will be more than the most narrated images. But Hell, if you have thought the Head of speaking was heavy, the amazing Life of the Fast Food Gifter will give you cause for injury. Of course, all of these views are based on the experience of a European person. Perhaps this is not quite meaningful for Japanese people, perhaps it was a true film lost in cultural and translation boundaries. Maybe.
