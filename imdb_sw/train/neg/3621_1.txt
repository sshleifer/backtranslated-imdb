I hated this show when I was a child. That was back in the day when children showed characters actually had accents, not just bland, generic, General American Dialect we used. The Wild Jack had the reputation of Britain and Pufnstuf was south. As one of those listed, however, I have never understood what the program was with the witch you want to flute. It always seemed strange to me, maybe because the flute heard me and I didn't go to any trouble to remove! <br /> <br /> Only comments on the similarity of Pufnstuf to the first McDonalds's 70s announcements that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf prompted McDonalds. At the height of the popularity of McDonalds, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought a McDonalds license to show them, but when McDonalds refused a TV show he changed little characters and passed as they themselves. They recruited former employees of McDonalds ad and sound operators to perform television shows. McDonalds defended and won. Search Pufnstuf McDonaldland case and you will find a lot of features about it.
