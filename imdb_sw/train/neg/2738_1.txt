Bad movies / movies are often not bad because I will find them enjoyable. This is so bad that I'm out of words to describe - it's under "bad". There are instructions at the beginning of the film that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, several orders and beer could not help me to go through the entire film. One identification compares this with KillBILL which is certainly incredible and insensitive to our minds. To clear. This tagliner had a plan to try to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you think this lease, let's! If you think about buying, do you? Think! If you have unlucky to have this dvd, dont play, throw in the garbage trash immediately.
