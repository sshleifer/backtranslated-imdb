There is no doubt that this film has been thrown surprisingly but unfortunately this did not help with great speed for the movie. I have never understood why directors ask practitioners / practitioners to use permits not themselves when it is obvious to everyone who cannot influence. Fiennes can not do Irish and Fitzgerald is not very good in Russian. When the voice is correct then it does not matter how good it is to act never to influence. If the big problem ... plot ... was there one? I think there was some kind of story involved but it had a lot of holes that I just couldn't wait for the film ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and don't see this film!
