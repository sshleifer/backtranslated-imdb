Even though 99,99% of people who have seen this film are Brazil, I will continue to English since it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. The worst job I have seen during the loooong. Children are awesome. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw someone who had a face-to-face than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and one voice voice, as a 5-year-old child reading in front of the class. How can a person become a great film maker? The storyline is very poor my daughter could do well (she is 3 yrs old). It is very easy can be written in a towel and told in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is only possible for three people to enjoy this film: 1) you are before the boy; 2) you have broken the brain and deception of Globo you think that anything with the Globo seal is amazing; 3) you have serious damage to the brain. Avoid at all costs! Shame to the area of ​​the Brazilian movie.
