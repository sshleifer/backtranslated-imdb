I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and I actually searched for this film (I had to get a DVD to Chinese Chinese!). But, in fact it is one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting (except for Dafoe) is awesome. David and Colagrande BOTH wrote and guided this (although he did not recognize the director), and they do not have enough talent to write or lead. (Close to Willem; Giada out of business, FUNA!) <br /> <br /> Nothing is happening. Except for a sufficiently consistent, completely without a reliable motivation, the actions of these two people (which met only) in this house. Colagrande's sleep, I was not worried about expressing myself without a change. And sex events are rotting. I was actually beaten two of them. Yuck! They are not very clear, and it is still the only time the film did not make you sleep. Then, it's busy to find you. <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
