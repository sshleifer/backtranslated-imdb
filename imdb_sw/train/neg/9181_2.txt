I usually try to be a professional and build when I criticize movies, but my God !!! This was the worst movie I saw. Bad act, bad effect, bad script, everything bad! The program follows a young youth group on their way to the rave (which takes place during the day) on a remote island. However, when the group comes, they all see the empty floor of the dance and the blood clothes. To determine what happened to other colleagues, the family has been given a mission through forest damaged by zombie. During this war, they are assisted by chick the police and the captain of the sea that just happens to have the correct number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet Jonathan Cherry and other victims. Basically all the movies are a collection of an indirect mechanism of action including a very long shot out of "dead house." These clashes have been filled with Hollywood-filled violence, downloading from the HOTD video game, and the matrix-esque camera camera. One of these behaviors even volunteer to give himself to save others. Why? Not because he was so good and brave, but because the face of his face was lighted with the acidic plunder after he continued to beat the creature after he was exhausted! I should feel sad for this person ?! To count it all, there is no absolute point in seeing this film unless you want to see for yourself how awesome it is. The game I had been dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I saw to see a piece of sh * t could reach the cost that was taken to do. GRADE: F
