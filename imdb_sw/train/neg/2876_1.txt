I ask why the creators of this false account of BTK killer's intentions. What? Are they trying to show animal rights activists like sick creatures? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think people involved with this monster are hurting enough? What is ignoring and absorbing the victims! It was like a human attempt: What makes you more concerned, killing or killing people? They used the exact names of some victims .... This movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to activate and restore the line!
