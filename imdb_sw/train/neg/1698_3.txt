Lynch. That person has many true things! He knows how to bother us, then give us to give us thinking in different ways. This, however, is quite different. The Dumbland Award is 1% of the incredible comedy, to get a lasting 99% ignorance. I may have just laughed at once, but somewhere near the 4th place I just started looking up quickly. You missed something. I felt locked when you were finished, and that's part of this step and this series. It is a desperate series of desperate characters in oppressive conditions, hit by sad animation, voice and voice. But recognizing this and its other failures still will not make Dumbland worth.
