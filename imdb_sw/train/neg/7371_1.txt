Steven Seagal .... how can you be part of the bad movie? I lost this film because your films are often very clean. I have lost many honors to you to a bad movie like this. Very, very delicious! I am ashamed that I even took this movie. Steven, if you continue to act in this movie, I believe your work is over. My husband and I have enjoyed watching many movies because you can always "get a bad person" with a few hands and make it ... and also the language is very clean on your movies ... but this is something else. I'll think twice before hiring your other movie.
