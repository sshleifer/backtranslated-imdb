Good quiz and good ideas (the liberation of the prostitute, humanity helps out, ...) but the bad result ... The direct director tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung for restoring the preference which you think the Viet Nam ... The only problem is that Viet Viet Nam has gone a long time and when the "green papaya" had a historical history ... trying to try this kind of cycle (sound and speed of life.) The modern day leaves a fake feeling. Besides it builds a sense of weight and quickly becomes very clear. I can only assume this action is done in Saigon or Da Nang because that's the Harvey Keitel, the former sea in the movie, it is possible to be standing during the war ... But in South Viet Nam no one or very few people talk to a piece of photo North north displayed by administrators ... Large odd even with bad Vietnamese speaker. An older poet who has leprosy ... very worried (not a disease for people of his status), a well-being girl who can read and write Vietnamese poetry, ... even more ... <br /> <br />
