Bashki should be commended for trying to change one of the great English lies on the movie, and then beaten silly for this attempt. The animation was so bad, the characters seemed to be worried, the music was very irritating, and the film was blitz ramshackle through the first and semi-masterpiece of Tolkien. I can still remember my despair and hear the movie when I saw the first. Now I understand that any attempt to change the book into the film fails in many ways, just because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki has more potential.
