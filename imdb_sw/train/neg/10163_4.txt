When thinking about the revelation that the main character in the "bubble" comes to the end of the film, I remind you of years ago "Machinist" and Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> Photos of a small town life. The head is the reason for meditation. Maybe, we, the audience are those in the "bubble" if we are not given discounts in a small 90-minute race. The audience's ears were often full of judgment, showing clearly how people who were prevented could have seen any thread of humanity to the characters so that they could become self-reliant. These are the people who are involved with those who put George W. in office for a second time. It is sad to consider how real television has caused our feelings of truth when watching the viewers jump at their feet for a quick move as a credit card. This film has features, and it deserves attention for things that do not say exactly.
