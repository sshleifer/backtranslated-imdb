This film was more effective in convincing a good Islamic conspiracy than Muslam. And I am a Jew. Does anyone go to journalism school? Read the editor? Freshman year rhetoric? These scandalous claims, made in an interesting way, can prove to persuade them. But by giving no compromise to arguments that may resist, nor can the solution (or any), a few sources and every nature of concern, make the argument a disastrous diatribe. And good thanks for that - I don't want anyone to leave the theater believing any of this claptrap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a tale to warn you - actually read on the film before you see it.
