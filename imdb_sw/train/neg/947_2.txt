As a person who lived through, and still remembers ten years vividly, if the real 70s was half this funny and (half) normal, it would be more enjoyable. For real children at that time did not act or do anything around with eyes and as bright as these children did. The young people of the country were still under the influence of hippies and the culture of all drugs who have '60s rebellion that was produced, especially in the department of behavior, petulance, smugness, self - integrity, youth, their deficit - no characters demonstrates any of it. Somebody compared to "Happy Days", and I can see why: They were both sitcoms that are 20 years before the current advertisement, and both offer only face, chosen pictures of real eras , even close to its full scope, just show clear things - fashions, toys, music, protest, etc., and that's yes. For those very young to remember, or were not born then, believe me, the 70s was not like that, more than "happy days" were like 'real 50s, like "M * A * S * H ​​*" did not show life accuracy on the basis of US Army treatment during the Korean War, etc..
