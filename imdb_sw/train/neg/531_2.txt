For a list like this, I expected it better. Venessa Redgrave spent many of the bedrooms in bed. The best traders in the world cannot do anything interesting during their acting is limited to sleep and sleep throughout the entire movie. The summary of the plot states that secrets are revealed to the daughter as their mother comes near death. The fact is, he never tells his daughters except the advice of pride to be happy. All links in movies are not developed. I also felt that back and forth between the past and now it was not necessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen or from the Da Vinci Book which the device was used to add to the blackberry, or from the Register which they used the device to create the last romance of the main characters. Any way was a cheap device for this film because it didn't work to create anything. It was a way of trying to insist on a film that does not exist. I stopped wondering why good movies cannot be written to women. In fact it was a disappointment.
