Paul Verhoeven finally hit a bomb on this. He was a shock on himself. Sometimes we have a film that includes sex and abuse, evil, talk to women and a lot of respectful debate between characters and dolly panels. <br /> <br /> It all for free. Because they are not any action in this film. Deleting all pieces of the set. All characters offer a variety of video formats for Verhoeven. In other words it has increased over every act. Starship traders withdrew with it because it was the world of eye-seated characters. In these scientists are doing the same way. I am sorry Paul but the soldier and the scientist do not have the same ideas. One of the biggest things in the program is that after escaping the same night to do the bad things of Kevin Bacons then return to science laboratories where we've been spending more and more time to look at these animation manniquens (Elizabeth Shue unless you walk and talk. Why not show the level of what the behavior can do in the outside world. What? How could they follow him if he could be anywhere? Think of all the different things that can be made with this concept, both in shape and story. Then look at what this film makes and actually done badly and think the whole project was true. More insults are Doco on a DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is some kind of MAG Genius. Well one of the two is not bad. This video doesn't have any color in it. As the head says. Hollow!
