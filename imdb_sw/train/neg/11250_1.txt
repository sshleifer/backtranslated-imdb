I like that period, I would like to try, but watch a film that looks like I'm looking through a bottle of coke gives me a head. If I played computer games that were clear and inconsiderate, I would like to improve my computer. It could be that this was looking at the director was back, but not so hurt the eyes and want to leave after 10 minutes. Although it was consistent and not the movies for every saying, Brother's Port completed this. They looked like a footage of WWII, and just a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to look at. Movies need real people, and real sets, and real places; Use CGI when appropriate, not for the entire film.
