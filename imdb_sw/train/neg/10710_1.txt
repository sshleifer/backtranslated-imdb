Dolph Lundgren stars as a New Template New York when the key that reveals the anti-Christ is found by the archaeologist, of course the demon is just a few miles behind Dolph and has not been as easily as it moves from body to body. (If it has fallen without doubt) Lundgren is undoubtedly out of its feature with an unknown movie. I agree to be a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies at any time on TV. I found Minion and the boy I was desperate. This movie is quite awesome. With the follow-up of the improperly constructed and improperly constructed actions you cannot make effective effectiveness in the fight field. Anything more is Lundgren's less bad than the leader of a tough guy! this is the worst movie I saw from Dolph Lundgren. In fact it has nothing to recommend. It is bad and is the lowest point in the work of Lundgren. And I saw the Cover-Up, the Last Warrior and the Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4 (Awful)
