I've got a DVD from the library in the hope of getting a good idea of ​​how things are going behind the main opera production. I say, I was so desperate. The lesson was very effective. Session in the production of Wagnerian should, for the most part, have an elaboration and an interesting story of creation and their use can be an excellent educational experience. Instead, we find what hodgepodge of the people who walk around with many environmental objects, of course help with the comments that have failed to keep my thoughts. I found myself hearing especially from the back parts of music from browsers. I was impressed by the magnitude of the effort required to keep such production - which came well and sometimes I would be on the opera I am sure I will remember that part as this video - but it was degraded to feel somewhat lack of clarity and definition.
