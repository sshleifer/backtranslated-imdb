Funny that I once was forced to fix this film, but here I am. I look at, because soon, I have had the opportunity to witness the RC revival. Play for Sheriff "End of Safari" at New York's stage, at the Belasco Theater, and Hugh Darcy, and Boyd Gaines, Mays Jefferson and others, as well as the leadership of David Grindley. I left the shattered theater. I am not widespread, I have been growing. After two and a half hours of the most reciprocal and claustrophobic symptoms of the soldiers in the Somme trenches (I think), during World War I, I lived an active life, with everyone involved, coming out of the playground and trembling . Listen to it, not easily chosen, nor am I very sensitive. I am an actor and director himself, so I know the bonds were pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally, as well as psychologically. But what I had witnessed, came so much in life, that I had a spine in my back as I left. No even these feelings were ever gone, while looking at the "Aces High", a film derived from this game and even adapted to screens, with cooperation with RC Sheriff himself, shortly before the death. <br /> <br /> Matching the screen takes place in heaven over France. Therefore, he has gone to the claustrophobic ambiance to start. <br /> <br /> With only films, it is a war of the sky, which are seen in their specific effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid flying techniques adopted on screen. Certainly there were a few of the "All-Way West" screens and Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in the tanks, and not in heaven, but that was "German" of vision on things, if someone would like to be bright on such things. The "End of the Journey" is the other side of the medal, and would make it a great movie, if they left it alone with the intervention. The DVD transfer is poor, although in Widecreen and adapted to 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is the cinema movie. No more, nothing less. It deserves various defects, such as small scratches and dots, though copies, for others, are clean. If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy seeing the sky war between the old people, then this is a picture for you. But I would like to suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, though also, is a movie full of obstacles. <br /> <br /> To all others, who love good acting and sports game, I would like this one out. Buy play. Keep watching the play, if you have the chance to get a better resurrection closer to you, but stopping this would be the same. <br /> <br /> It's a fighting game, released, but the weak I have seen in my life forever. The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, because they seem to be only very weak and very briefly accessible to all movies. McDowell, Christopher Plummer very talented, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, both offer very weak performances, not because of their skills, but due to lack of truth and strong direction. There are many shortcomings in it, and as mentioned earlier, they find themselves at an amazing end. Unfortunately because in the original play, none of the people we know and plead, and stay alive. All of them have been killed in an unhealthy and improper mission. In all their movies they die, except Malcolm McDowell, who can manage another day's life, to be a champion of the unlucky group, just to get three other pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> At the end of the game you leave a clear point in the dark. You hear only the sounds of pigs, machine guns, and grenade effects on the playground. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The file comes. Lighting. And here it all is. Closed, standing straight and solid. The corpse of obedience ... <br /> <br /> Far more amazing and more amazing than finale of "Aces High", which is also humorous with hair. <br /> <br /> It is for you to judge. For me, if I had money and contact them to do so, I would like to play and develop it, as it is. Add here and there part of the step in the field, to see the image of "out" and the ongoing slaughter in the "French giants", next to the men involved, but then, just carefully consider what is going on, in that "small" shack The edge of the sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> Want a similar film? <br /> <br /> Then ask. <br /> <br /> This is not the case.
