I saw this movie without knowing anything about it before hand. The plan was frightening and significant shortcomings of existing information. The movie had no "war wits" to feel me. Businessmen dropped out of empty words, sometimes causing me to stretch my teeth in pain as they continued on. The plan was possible except for the abdominal homoerotic disorder at the end of the end (I am not homophobic but I had a physical illness for my stomach), even the end was expected. And you can tell the detective it was Judah Law in clothing, everything from artificial smell, the work of terrible teeth, the face of the shop, everything that said it was hiding. The whole movie just felt like losing time out of my life. This movie had the impression of the puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as sticks and houses as a window to see the show, really boooring in my opinion.
