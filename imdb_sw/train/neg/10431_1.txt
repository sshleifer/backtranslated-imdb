I loved the first season. Excellence declined slightly in the second season, which was however a great center (Pegasus!). The third season was novel and original and it was okay. The fourth season began to decline rapidly, because they did not even begin to give us any information, while we now began to need them. Was hell a Cylon plan? Why were there two groups of Cylon? What was the meaning of Angel-Kara leading the ship to 1 destroyed land? What kind of past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they get, or were they born again? Questions everywhere, responds anywhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. World-2 (Our World) formerly. Okay, okay. But destroy the ship? Providing technology to stop any kind of urban life, and spreading a few thousand paper-thin people around the world? That is not just anti-science, it protects the cause and fight life. And the philosophy of the show seems to be human being ever trapped in a cycle from a romantic nature to a decadent capitalist society to focus on A.I. which destroys everything. There is no vision, without hope of a great future for humanity, and it is contrary to the correct science fiction. And do not create angels! The religious finger of the worst kind! Final desire! All "all this has been done before and will happen again" something should be related to the previous body of the series, not just to the world as we know it. Making a new show in a straightforward and old way would have a definite stroke of genius. Frakkin Error <br /> 1/10 of 10.
