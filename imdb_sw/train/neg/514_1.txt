This is one of the most uncomfortable, uninformed, unfamiliar, and unimportant movies ever! Approaching if everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an interesting film. This is not more than a continuous series of films that try to get cash in Smokey and Bandit's success, which I think is the best film of all. For this news loss of film, Burt Reynolds lying on his way through the entire movie, Jim Nabors has lost, other actors are not given too much to do, civic cars are exposed to stock photos, odors are not suitable for work, and most of the events are lighter and non- life than looking at the wall for two hours. "Ace of Stroker" is a fantastic film with no exception or distinction on it.
