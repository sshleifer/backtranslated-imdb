My previous review of this film was just a word sh * t written about 2000 over. Although this was an accurate inquiry, I felt my opinion should be more detailed. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the leading actor; The expression of his face did not change once in this film, does not show fear, joy or depression. His knowledge in the body language very much comes to blow his eyes left and right and look like he doesn't know jack. He is a senseless pastor who I am trying to have a lot of botox. His lack of facial expressions on the outside of the film has already been released with a delightful feature and a leading actor that seems to be no place anywhere and makes them on the beach and falling in love within several hours of meeting. The leading actor, whose hair requires more attention than he did, was of great emotion and did not immediately do not feel like he was really dangerous. The only thing that does what is working is the guide, storyline and accuracy in the program. I found ads advertising more structured than this film. That's not a development in character, they seem to just say and do things that I can never believe a real person could. This video would not be as bad as it would be trying to lead them like a snake on a plane but it was very difficult to be a big flick point that I couldn't even laugh. I believe now I have a brain tumor from this film and think of all the different ways I could use the budget and the CG team to create something bigger. If I bought this on DVD I would cut into pieces to pieces to pieces to pieces to pieces. Don't see this FILD!
