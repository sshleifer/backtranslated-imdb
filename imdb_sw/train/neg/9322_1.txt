Please do not allow the cover of this movie to be stupid. And if you are looking for a cheap film to laugh: this is not the case. I usually go to fools if they are funny, but this stupid was a little stupid (or maybe made) to make me stupid. The quality of the film is better than the handheld, but not so much, and it is quite possible the music was created to develop the key Samba 2 on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be different from seeing a horrible movie but adding this awesome (right) cast, and you have a real humdinger <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his cabin family in Texas at the end a week. He adds an invitation to his wife to crush into his office. On the way there meets a woman in distress, who is supposed to come with other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying in the cabin includes sex and dirt and soon panties everyone is in a group one time the girl disappears and abnormal things turns home. From there you (listeners) and morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and soon begin to trust each other. In general I think I have made it sound better than it is. The great effort and this movie is that the characters have not been developed very much, the conspiracy emerged, not doing the wrong and the obstacles were not present. Sometimes this may be forgiving it was a little bit funny but not, it isn't. <br /> <br /> The last end is simply a perversion because no one thinks it because if they really thought back through the movie it wouldn't be wise yet. Please do not let this review prevent you from observing shear screening of this film. (Laam, my nose grew only eight inches.)
