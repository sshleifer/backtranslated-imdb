Trite, dialog clichÃ©d and arranging (the same kind of things we have seen all through the fantasy movies of 1980), hokey music, and color-and-color characters do this without giving birth to all but more fans. > <br /> What saves this film from the junk heap is a good work of Bakshi, rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. Violence is interesting and the orientation of the art and animation is different from the other sword & magic of this period. <br /> <br /> I would like to watch this sound, play sound sound on the first movie of Conan instead.
