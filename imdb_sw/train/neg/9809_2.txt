Others are wondering why he did no longer have Mrs. Murphy's movie after this. Is it because this movie really pulls snot. Disney was not a proper label to run this film. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but it would be the most adult). The film is also a child, as the series of book is not. Offer is the same for the characters. The characters don't even have to do in books. And why did Tucker become a man? She is a girl in frigging books! Was this done to make a film appeal to boys? Sheesh. Where is the Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is not from this dirt. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but allowing Disney to beat her work was bad. The animation feature of the animation, perhaps in the diagram of Don Bluth's image would have a much better look at Mrs. Murphy. In general, I swear this 2, because at least Disney made a film from a series of books below. But, I wish they did well. Any way, I still have my favorite books.
