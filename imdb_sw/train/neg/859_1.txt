I found this amazing bomb of the movie in the cable station, and was reminded of how I felt it was in 1980 when it was first released. Many outdoor viewers don't have enough age to remember the great hype around this movie and the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The most popular novel had the fans' interest to see the "master" director who is supposed to keep this unusual abnormal story on the screen. "Salem's Lot" has already been destroyed in the late 1970s as a series of mini-TV, led by Tobe Hooper (the "Texas Chainsaw" fame) and was abused, turning the main villain of the book into "Theater Chiller". The real harmless vampire however destroys the entire premise. Fans hoped that the director of Kubrick's size would succeed when Hooper failed. It did not happen. The few achievements, all of them come out. Jack Nicholson can't be anything but Jack Nicholson. He is always mad and he didn't bring anything to his role here. I don't care that many recipients here think he is all in the mirror, "Here is Johnny!" certainly ... he is very bad in this film, so it's everyone else, for that. The character of the Croaters, Dick Halloran, was important for the book's plot, but Kubrick murders is in one of the bright "shock" series on the film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this for a regular booing during the last 45 minutes of this flick, those left are ... many left. The King's books have not been able to translate well to the film since many stories occur within its characters, and often metaphysical. Kubrick rejected the tension between living and dead by fashion here and the mess that remains so far with the original material that I don't really care about. This video still reduces and why many think it is a jewel is more awesome than me.
