First thing, Jenna Jameson is the best actor in this film, and he is just bad. This film has everything to be shaken by the imagination, and everything has been badly hit. A young couple of sex. Joichi (si) horny jock. Chick cold winter. The local creepy color guy. Parents of parent type. Chick the little who surprises never dies in these films. These discussions are very serious and are given to the depth of the wading dam. It's almost as if you want that they would all die early. I saw a bad cut of this film before, but somehow, this was worse. Indeed, the funniest thing here is ghoul tries to install the implants of Jameson, but that difficult levels even rent this dog. Avoid at all costs.
