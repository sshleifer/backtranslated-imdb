Lack of a GOOD PLOT, the absence of good ACTING, the absence of a good CINEMATOGRAPHY, the absence of good progress of the SPECIAL ... need to continue? Evaluation may be SPOILERS. The characters seem to be READING their verses, and not very well. Most of the "executives" were doing as they played in the SECOND playing GRADE. The story seemed to be written by one of the second second investigators ... not all who are helped ... it's just SIMPLE and DUMB, that someone thinks they should have something so they think it is closed. So it's not, it's like SIMPLE if you think it is. I know "film", that's what I know that is STUNK! The film's great film had people sitting around to talk (read their verses), trying to look at themselves. The author was ANNOYING. "Special effects" were inappropriate. I love small budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry, and Michael Berrymore ... not only on this movie ... you can tell them they were not paid, or they were not paid much, because neither their hearts NOR their talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... nevertheless, he had just enough in this film. In fact, the performance of Tony Todd is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was in it for the entire TWO MINUTES (for weight)! I would recommend adopting a DVD for two minutes of Tony Todd. If I went to the theater, and paid more than DOLLAR to see this "film" I would have been P.O.'D and demanded my money back. We expect people who have done this to do better in the future.
