It is quite possible the worst films I have ever seen. When Hollywood ever made a successful film that attacked Republican? Why not learn. Dixie chats do not. These Lefties live in their own bubble of scholars who interact among them; they do not know the fact that most Americans are better than they are. Hollywood's best products are not a participant and not often politics. Dan Akroyd Cheney was bad. I'd like to think of Cussack would have the best movies. It was not funny.
