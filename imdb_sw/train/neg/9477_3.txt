This was one of the most powerful wrestlemanias of God and saved only by 2 matches. A hard match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was full and honest and almost sleeping, so the casket match was not worthy to have an undertaker seen in it and a match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a full Fill. If you are a great WWE fan and you have missed the early WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19 you will probably like this. But I have found that this Wrestlemania left much to want.
