If you can make "Meyer" titles / introduction, you can win anything. But would you like? I didn't find much there to dig my teeth. I think if you get into it with a low temperature expectations you will be happy (Angel's Charlie). But for my money I would like something more, more to see, more moving. More. I feel like I am asking for gruel @ the foot of the master. mans got the product. but he can not share.
