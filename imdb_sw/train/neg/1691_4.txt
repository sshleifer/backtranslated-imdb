This film is not a substitute for an appropriate series of timed intervention with "inevitable" gotcha. The end of each other. True, there is no development of character and no real plot to speak. There is only a psychological incentive for the characters to do anything when they continue in front of their inevitable dooms. All is only forgiveness to show a child of creepy spirit (who appears to have found a family of a family mixed in her ectoplasm) and her mother of spirit (and long hair hanging has been like "Ring"). under the discrimination of paperwork, two common barriers to humanitarian characters. This English language version of "Raw" is the same as the junk cinema; to meet for a while, but not really you should live. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
