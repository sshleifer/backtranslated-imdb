The same director takes the PURPOSE EXECUTIVE Director Nikhil Advani after starting with KHNH does his second half and waiting <br /> He performs at 3:30 + film which loses patience, time.etc viewer looks like 3 hrs sleep watching this film <br> \ t /> <br /> They had 6 stories so it was important but why? Story 6? We have an Anil-Juhi story that is convincing but not the TV news shows stories like? We have the story of Govinda-Shannon which is amazing and it works well <br /> <br /> We have the story of Akshaye-Ayesha again believed but it gets boring soon and the goal is on more comedy and that also slapstick comedy boring <br> /> <br /> We have Salman- Priyanka stories that are even worse, not just words to do, it doesn't mean all the time <br /> <br /> We have a story of Sohail-Isha to catch you with a trick working on a regular basis for The reason for the weight set by many more stories </> <br /> We have a story of John- Vidya good news for every kind <br /> <br /> But at that time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored with sleep. especially the Salman- Priyanka story Nikhil Advani's handling is best in areas, some stories are well addressed but weak in places Music (SEL) is good, but very many movies movies are beautiful, every story is provided a different look, texture and work <br /> <br /> The Govinda Shepherds, after returning back to BB he really makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well, though he looks out of shape and fatigue John Adds to its section, Shakes Khanna overacts for changes <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is on-top-over and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissed /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for for this film? Salman Khan does not just do it, he talks like he is in his sleep and that artificial fragrance oh god Priyanka overacts to the same level you feel like giving him something about him, he gets better towards the end Vidya Balan, Juhi Chawla is the same Shannon is the same
