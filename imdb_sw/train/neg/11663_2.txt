STORIES CLOCK Hold, why they did not dress like Black, Chickens, they would not look different. Is there anyone who can give me one movie of the Wayans where they are not dressed like women? Do not have a Class does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza spirit wrote that (other members of the Norton Trio acted as Directors). In White Chicks, they never have any joke. Only Wayans do as girls for 2 hours. No sets, no punchlines and no laughs. There is a lot of "I think I'll be able to play during the 3-time crisis." At least for me there was (5 times to be right). The person who tells Ivory Coast, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the most qualified), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans stop making movies. It only affects the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * out of ****
