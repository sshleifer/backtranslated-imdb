I went to see this movie in the college hall thirty years ago because I loved Bruce Dern at the Rest and Family Rest. To date (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still a red movie I've ever seen. It just continued and went on uncertainly and then - it just ended. The lights came and I watched everyone looking around the mix. Did he have a voting estimate? I have never been interested in knowing. All I remember about the movie is that it was not a dance about other basketball basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the film was looking after the words of the closed audience. Fortunately, this was just for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.
