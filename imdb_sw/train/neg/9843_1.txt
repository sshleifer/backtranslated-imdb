It's just Robert De Niro's film that I hate. It's a stupid film and a bad acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must make his films like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also liked the De Palma Message: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma twice as well, Greetings and the Wedding Association. I though that the Wedding Party was the same (I had no look at greetings). <br /> <br /> Screenplay is very bad and unwanted. No place I can boil at the same time. The film lost the opportunity to become a popular style even in the "Black Child" scene and also I don't like the location where the male sex link appeared. So, it's one of the worst films I saw! just worse. I like that.
