Is Miike as Chabrol, a modified art and dreck, sometimes combining these two? Does he compare fifty-fifty levels of Chabrol's claims? What? We see here too much or too little Miike? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I could easily fill only ten lines citing an example of the dedicated Chakushin (Mobile Lost Phone) stealing, allusions, and clich√©s. Some here will beat most of them, although it is not the Sail of Ochiai (Hypnosis) for improper material to advertise an unusual telecast. Just once, when Yumi takes the mother of a zombie into her hands, One who lost a Call has bothered a little. Another interesting way: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in the background of the violation of the inspection, and if Aoki or deadly sewage and more, can be a very bad actor who I have ever seen. So here he is a soldier.
