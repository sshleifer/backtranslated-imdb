After reading another review of this film I have the opinion that the high score can be paid to the label lackeys as the film I saw was so bad, and the wooden acting, scripting procurement and plodding describing predictable, one of several points and becoming a fantastic scenery like this film it has some stunning backdrops back and great vistas spreads and great sky and large open spaces, sadly when something more memorable in the film is the place laid out behind these actors should be a warning sign for the quality of the movie, all in addition to uninspiring and The western species which even with a very good price can be found on the DVD is better to avoid.
