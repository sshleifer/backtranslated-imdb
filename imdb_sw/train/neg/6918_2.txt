I went for this film to believe it had a good balance. First, it is concerned that they are producing a film produced in 2001, seven years later in 2008 in India. Everything in the movie appears on the date. Even in 2001 the movie looks like it has been made on the shoe budget. There is a place where a taxi is made to man to define how the low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long end to the end. If the film had a strong spark in the area, I missed it if I was lying in my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles the devil. She wears clothes that are suitable and appropriate for babies. For Alec Baldwin area where he may meet Webster for the first time should not forget. It's losing money! As Anthony Hopkins said, "Go home and write well!"
