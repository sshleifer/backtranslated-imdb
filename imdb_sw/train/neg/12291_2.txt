Humm, an Italian movie mentioned by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect too much, to be honest and in fact, I took even less than I expected. It does not mean that this film is so bad that I have seen because I have looked at the worst of this but the conspiracy was a lot of times of confusion and surprises and some of the beautiful scenes of the year are the only thing that keeps this. Apart from that you would like some special effects, they are really good and bad. Now I just want to look at "Troll 3" and the same director, surely it will not be worse than that.
