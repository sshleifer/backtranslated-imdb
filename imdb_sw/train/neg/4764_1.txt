86 lost the moment of my life. I slept the first time I tried to look, and I must say I was never sleeping in the movie. I've never seen such a useless plot that worked like that. in a forced way, and could only consider that the participants were as hard as the author of the protagonist claims that he was in the film itself. Everything is in this situation to deal with the bad situation is affected. And if it is not a wooden work, almost as if you can see the teleprompter, then set itself, which is overlit and interfere in a completely unnecessary way, and increased the level of thoughtlessness, it is enough to keep off the whole. In the case of a detective under a hiding place, anyone who does not see it - with all the rest of the good plot - telegraphed years earlier, should look at their eyes immediately. <br /> The worst job, and from two highly respected administrators, as well as the reduction of Branagh trademark caused by hyper-coddled, lets you want to use a real shot instead of locking yourself. Overall, there is a low voice of the appearance of homoerotica in this, standing to its end. All that I can hope is that this was flop if people did not try to imitate this movie standard again.
