I must explain why I have this ... "piece of art" 1 star rating from possible 10. Because it is hard or almost impossible to measure it unbiased. maybe it would have been the same if I put it 10/10 - details that would be following. I enjoy these useless movies like HOSTEL or so - I think that's funny and exciting (for all possible possibilities in the environment), but as I saw after watching this movie - there is a kind called "historical festival" - and maybe it would have been 10/10 cases if it had a lot and Tarantino would have more fun with it (and kill Bill 3 to shed more blood on the screen than here to show that it is possible). but something about the "historical festival" is that it is a small part of the "trash films" where John Romero is the pastor of undead-gere-of-guts and so can not be counted as your movie's default - like these are the wrong movies. for the purpose and you do not know if the worst time was meant to be so, or it was just bad. is for people who love to enjoy bad acting, bad screenplay and everything wrong. And on the other hand of faith - I am one of them too. there is a day where I need to see a very bad movie and look on the trash and here you go - the day is saved! but that's definitely my opinion and is not recommended by anyone else. What I wanted to say is that if you want to watch some awesome movie - then the Fellini Casanova is definitely the choice, but listen to my advice and don't get it through default.
