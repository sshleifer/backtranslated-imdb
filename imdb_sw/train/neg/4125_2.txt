Holy desires! What a horrible, horrible thing to the Spanish! I've had it for four years and finally started the other night. I looked at an hour or so before going to bed. I was so surprised by the whole thing. I ended the night and couldn't believe where I left the night before. In fact, I left the second before the movie declined. As I said, I was very interested and wanted to know this secret was going but the right suspension when Simon gets the bag in the bar. I took it while opening the bag to unlock the laser gun and then it has the "awesome" game of the laser label. Whew! Then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot to play the game of nerds. WHEW! You can tell the Spanish sector it was obvious behind the director Mateo Gil (the correspondent of the two-two-letter Amenary journalist). There are good symbols and beautiful pictures. But these phenomena of the state of silliness. How anyone sits for the last 40 minutes and the face is more than me.
