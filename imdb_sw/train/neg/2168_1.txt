After reading another review, I thought this movie would be good. I enjoy the "B" movies, but this can't even be counted as. Photography is probably only half the way to honor in the movie. But the left adjustment is very much needed. It was a very choppy and staccato. Anyone who chose music and sound made a bad job. Music was rough, especially any atmosphere or atmosphere. If acting would be better, they could pull the movie. Unfortunately, I found it best to act in porn flicks. If you want to see the "B" movie of the vampire, see 'Blood Relations'. You will be more acceptable.
