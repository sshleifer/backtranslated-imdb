Power Rangers, the worst show of the child since the 1990s continues to disrupt young children with full happiness, and bad environment. This show was not entertaining, it was an excuse to teach child violence to show children how to fight to solve their differences. Toys were mostly exhibitions in how to develop a show of television violence and such. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to find out what the purpose of this ridiculous show has been. Therefore, it is still one of the worst children that shows the rapture.
