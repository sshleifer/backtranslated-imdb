If I realized that John Wayne was in this film, I couldn't look at it. It is contempt for the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassment for anyone who thinks. But, many of John Wayne's movies are the same. Hollywood in fifty years still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still) different. Movie deals with the isolation of the nineteenth century of Japan. Perhaps it is Hollywood that should be unique. Set as much as possible as possible, this film is a claptrap of terrible jingo. (The Butterfly Type of Madama and bad music.)
