I don't believe anyone thinks there was anything original or interesting about this film. I am a fan of false science like a second person, and I can enjoy old movies and ignorant buildings for a long time when they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my delightful review of the Lands [1980]. they had a low budget - it's not that they care about it. \ t > San Francisco Architectural San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I enjoy reading the last two. film and hand camera, good plot and stupid effects, I will show these journalists and remind them of what they said about Receiving Fees.)
