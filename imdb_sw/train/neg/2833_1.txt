With Bo Derek's movie, the audience gets what they expect. Marked thin paper and a few shots of Mrs. Derek without clothes. 'The Spirit can't do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes are a regular TV festival, like Scott [Anthony Quinn] alive. He is a very good skilled actor in many roles, but it seems like a popular actor needs to work for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, playing a beautiful young woman or without clothes. Movie is a perfect waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, the Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see stupid women or acting bad, rent any movie porno.
