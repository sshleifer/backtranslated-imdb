My God. This was a real big mess that could not help. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man still living with his mother (Diane Keaton) and not a plan to go anywhere. His mother will meet a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) who can marry. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie if Heder did not play Jeffrey's so annoying, from the very start there is no chance to love him and it gets worse and worse. At the end, we should be loved by him, but there was no reason why he did not change from the stupidity that was the beginning of the film. Keaton is not looking even to try and is in a terrible form after 2007 because I said so. Do not say the terrible chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should they believe to be their mother and child? The only grace to save is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris though they are not very interested either. In addition to little smiles, this film is not recommended to be just a comedy because there is hardly anything to laugh! If you are in the recent situation of Diane Keaton flick look Mad Money or Smother which is much better than this unusual effort.
