This movie was a great disappointment on the direction, intellectual, conspiracy and how it dealt with its image, painting. It's a slow film moving set as a part of the wonderful years, with a terrible lack of depth though. It also fails to send its message in a persuasive way. The image of the painting shape is very elaborate, has been reduced to non-verbal and independent words as "beauty". According to the creators of this film, 'beauty' can be experienced only in Bob-Ross-style kitschy landscape drawings. Good art according to this film can be found using the base (like, primary school level) theory theory and lots of emotions. In the film section faces, k.m. for sure it is explained (rather, it is celebrated and played on the table) which people with mental disabilities cannot have a sense or explain through painting, their work by definition that it means 'bullshit' (quote). I don't understand how the movie can get a high level like this, then again, so far most people did not measure it, and they chose it only for the top class or the lowest.
