After checking this thing, then read the summary behind the DVD, then think back to the real movie .... I was a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I slept and dreamed that I was a low-pitched forest through an endless forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for other reasons and unusual lesbianism. Where (zombies?) Come from anywhere and (vampires?) Who (opposes?) Clean-hearted citizens on their way to save the world. Not a zombie nor a vampire especially meet. The only fighting I remember is to get the money of the walrus Bonny Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All! Maybe that was because we were looking at a great mirror and we were so cunning to change it to its original resolution, but actually made it more entertaining. , down the issue, and act at all of this film. It made Bloodrayne look like Fia F *** ING KANE
