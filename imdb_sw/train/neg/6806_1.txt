Apart from all technical errors .... What about a female servant who has the power to kill, all alone, 4 out of 7 terrorists (including old marines), 2 of them without even using a gun. Then, he climbs quite a bird. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a simple, fearful bird, but very good. : D How is the leader responsible for the attack, with full evidence (based on the logic of the script) to sleep-gassing everyone and to have someone from his team flying a plane. He only decides when a change of plans and instead will cause a terrorist attack, a strong gun, not knowing where terrorists, or how many, and get a chance to gain, so that all his team might easily be deleted. Well, it's using the old noggin. Only later you decide to use gas sleep anyway. And it turns useless for all good purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad as this movie was, though, I couldn't stop looking and wondered, what's next? : D I can't help but think of all the best, unemployed writers who think of themselves, not right. lol! : D
