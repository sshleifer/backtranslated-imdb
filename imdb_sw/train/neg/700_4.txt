I don't look at the quality; I am only trying to find the 74 most popular video-banned video in the UK. This was originally banned and reopened in 2001 for the whole 10 seconds to be cut off. <br /> <br /> Some college students spend their Christmas holidays to prepare a dorm for repair. There are some creepy characters watching about with four children. Who among them is the slasher? The real killings are not very good, so this video nastie is not so bad. There is a required flashing complement, but it has nothing to do with college children. I had a suspect very quickly and I was right. Maybe I have seen a lot of this. The last leg was clever; I have to give credit to the authors for that original reason.
