My first question after seeing this film was, "Why is LIAM name?" If the intention was to tell the story from the boy's perspective, it was not well done. In fact there was the use of the camera alarm formula on the boy's events, but a lot of important steps were done outside his field of view. Having a "great" character can not talk (obviously shows a person, a child's uncomfortable position) makes it difficult to give the character a deeper depth. Melodrama is described as: "great or other literary work known for the use of characters, pride and language, simple values, and disputes" LIAM fit this definition for T. Viewer is on the head and The common behavior of the Catholic Church of the fire and sulfur in the school of a school in the school and a well-fed priest reduces money from partners. (Example that is very disturbed.) What? More - Jewish characters are money borrowers and factory owners! Most of the films were predictable ... What did not think we would like to see Theresa examining the toilet after her mother told her "No daughter will pull another woman's toilet!" I am a fan of UK loyalty if you have done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
