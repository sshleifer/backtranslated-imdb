What this movie fails to answer is how this war is right (and many US wars are just made to get fat). Are there many innocent civilians who have been present, how many people have died and how plain they were criminals. So I would like to ask you - if the US soldier kills women and children away from the enemy, it is the same, but if the government kills their own army for death and kill as many people as well, isn't it? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 5 for consistent performance and 1 for everything else, 3 for total.
