I read the book Celestine Prophecy and I was expecting to see the movie. You are advised that the movie was not available for the book. Many aspects of the book attract even though they are not from the film. It's a "B" movie better. Many events, characters, how behaviors interact and encounter in the book are simply changed or not. The flow of events that are in the book is very smooth, it is choppy and fed to the comments if you are a child. The development of character is very poor. The traders of the characters differ from those in the book. The trend is similar to the Flick of "B" of fear. I understand that it will take six hours to film to present all that is in the book, but they play the basic screen didn't miss a lot of points. Search was very good.
