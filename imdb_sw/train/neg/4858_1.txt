Why in the world would anyone make this piece of garbage movie? The first two bloody zombie blood was stupid, but this takes a cake for a bad trilogy (maybe at all). The Todd paper is still a director, but no screens of the screens, who are not negative or good, thinking he is just like the boy who wrote this. The text depends on the word f, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times for nausea. Acting is close to the last bloody films, so usually it is some of the worst I ever seen. Specific effects are better than the end of 2, but still look godawful. The program has been very difficult for its own benefit, and it was close to the government's experiments and zombies fed. It also includes a mutant gray-colored zombie and school children who know how to travel time, leading to one of the last idiotic that I have ever seen. After the movie goes, it may be strange because all this film is accessible. Just look at this to enjoy it, because if you get into this with a great mind, you might kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 months.
