If half of the film's image appears to be normal, it means to look at the many ways of Italian craft! Since you see, Lucio Fulci is not so well-known that he did not only produce this film, he also took the freedom to reuse the genocide procedure himself (and more easily) "Cat in the brain". The opening part of the opening, which the harlot is brutally treated with copper, appears in the future of Fulci's films and thus makes a few more killings and breathing. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails to sadly like a giallo, since the search for a killer of vengeance among movie-crew shooting movie horror is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. An unusual script establishes a large group of desperate characters who are all able, but there is no bios in the bios that comes and is suitable and you can tell the killer immediately. Anything that remains to enjoy is the positive effects of make-up and good performances performed. Whenever there is no blood on the screen, like between the first and second killings, "Murder" is slow and cannot be connected to an inland conversation and photography completely. Thanks in the second half, there are women who are nailed to the courtyard and men are beaten regularly with spikes of rust. Music caused by the use of photographic sites is very visible. I advised me to fly this puppy and go straight to the "Death in the brain" above. That includes all the necessary "murders", then others.
