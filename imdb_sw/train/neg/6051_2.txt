urgh! 3 movie elements requires: good script, good plot and casting well. I expected this film to be very frightening and unfortunately disappointed when it was just awesome. I lost the will to live half through. One thing that prevented him from discovering my eyes out with the wall was Rose Byrne (who was the reason I was looking at it first). He did a good job as Rastus and his appearance was not very changed since he was 13. it was an amazing first attempt in the film. The dog was also very good. both performed good work and very bad material. Sandra Bernhard think it's a big mistake of the movie. she was quite clear, and I don't think she ever quite got a habit. <br /> <br /> I give 2 movie out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
