If you are interested in the nature of the SNL hit and shows you to avoid this film at all costs. When this first came out of my friends and I waited for more than an hour to get into the house of the sold movie. Half the way through the cinema movie was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave thinking it would be better. When the movie ended we were the only remaining remaining in the theater. The movie lasted only one day in all the movies then lost from the front. In an interview with "Mr. Mike" refused to comment on this film. The film was an internal joke in SNL sessions that came out after the release of the film and closed for one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and letter so that we can be returned but failed.
