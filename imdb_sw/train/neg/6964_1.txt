I often hunt MTV movie awards to look at witches, show entertainment that offers only a unique prize (Chewbacca winning the prize of life as a model). So this year was no different. While not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has been a wise-albiet for me. I have painted on Stiffler in all American Pie movies, and even where have I enjoyed my Dude? But MTV movie awards were just bad. There is nothing in common, pride, or entertainment. Justin Timberlake should be connected to singing and playing; he certainly if hell can not act. <br /> <br /> I wish to know who the authors were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar were playing funny (Lord of the Rings participating alone was worth watching the whole show), but this year was full different. What? Anyone understands Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They look at the film together, but they never met! Here's the ...") Where was jokes? Kate and Luke entered only in their misunderstanding, never mentioning "joke" and Timberlake. And Seann was completely lost as a talent, even to make me smile, but I just laughed. And what was the Harrison Ford coordinators? HAVE YOU EVERYONE TO ANYONE? Perhaps the MTV authors thought the small audience would only know Ford of aging like Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or President from Air Force One. I'm broken. And someone can tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this and what age does he think he is? The boy looks at 30, trying to do again 19 .... give him, show some class (like in an award-winning discourse) and do your age! I give 1 star out of 4, just because of Gollam's speech for Best Visual Performance. This was very creative, it has done very well, and it just caused a real laugh all the evening.
