Let's see. In the "end of another place" we found that there were no hospitals and that everything was a baby's autistic child. "Newhart" ended with telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended with telling us that all was done in his mind. Very "Creative". Surprise was like that. Yes, it was just a TV show and not quite realistic. Just so when you get on a big movie or TV show you are at least want to believe it is "real". At least away from the fact displayed on the screen. This type of finale series had been done twice before and was an old hat, sad and unpleasant to enjoy. Now "Newhart" that dream all? At least done in a creative way which exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea was not very engaging but it had been done carefully which seems to be the Finale of the Best Series. Roseanne let me hear it after being a loyal fan.
