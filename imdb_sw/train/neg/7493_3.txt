I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It begins very slowly, the nature of the Nuremberg experiment being a step-by-step, the Germans have a wonderful English voice, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, viewers get to see more amazing, awesome footage which I have ever seen. It is important that people can see the picture (although I disagree with people who say that there is no age that children can be exposed to this type of material), but in this film it was quite ridiculous. It had a real sense to improve the impact of the normal TV series. It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and of course easily. Instead of trying to squeeze us into well-done events, stimulating conversations or an interesting view, viewers are tormented by horrible pictures of prisoners of skin and bones. It does not show any respect to victims of sacrifice. I am very angry.
