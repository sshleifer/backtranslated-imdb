I tend to be a character-driven film. Also I think Hope Davis returns to good work every time, so I had a great hope for this movie. These hopes are soon lost. <br /> <br /> The great right with this movie is a trend. There are many cases that differ. The movie makes frequent use of the character of Denis Leary as a change of behavior to Campbell Scott character. It doesn't work at me. This would have worked better if you play than the movie. <br /> <br /> There are problems with conspiracy. It is important that the characters in the film take a trip and end up a different place and where they started. I did not feel that the characters were in the experience shown on the film. Finally, editing was not done properly, either. There was a very big sag in the middle of the film which was very interesting. Except for acting, which I felt is often stable, this film has failed almost every aspect of the movie.
