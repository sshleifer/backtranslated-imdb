I like animation displays. I enjoy the very Nick price, including Hey, Arnold. But to transfer the TV show on the Big Screen is not easy and this doesn't just feel enough. It was like a long part of the show, and it didn't just go with it well. Considering the behavior of the children we had, it was not a good mark.
