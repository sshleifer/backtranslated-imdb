Think of it, say 12-1am - your home, bored, you are not tolerant. This situation happened about, saying 4 or more years back .... I turned on the TV and I found several ways and I found that this film had continued. OH My word is the worst movie I saw! The runaway car that cannot be stopped (make a residue or something) to wipe the highway - what will happen? This movie was very bad - I think stunts cost $ 2 to do, there was one example where a child / baby is a winning from a car with a helicopter - to an exciting viewer - easily placed bridge approaching ... BAD BIT OF FILM EVER - shows a little child to lose grade but it looks bad - you can almost see the dummy which you used - Total budget size! Think of the end of the film, though I was GREAT <br /> I doubt that they will ever show this film again and I am glad to see this piece of rubbish!
