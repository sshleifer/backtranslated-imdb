This movie was displayed on the trailer as a comedy. It's a great tragedy. It has left me sick for my stomach. I liked it. I think if they want to make a film like this than they should be someone enough to reflect the real purpose of the movie on the trailer. I would like to see this film if I knew. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and purpose of the movie. I'm exhausted. I wanted to have a fun comedy and I was very disappointed. It has been a few days now and I still have a bad taste of my mouth from this film. I have never been more desperate on the film, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad film. In fact I think that the real fraud was involved in this trailer because if you expressed the real intention of the movie, no one would see it.
