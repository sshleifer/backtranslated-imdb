God, it's a bad thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the abuse of music and images here) but what really? The same thing behind the "natural killers" seems to be "clever" to look at how medias can turn into a full garbage but unfortunately the movie becomes trash itself. Please Mr. Stone, the next time you want to reject the fascism of tv shows using violence to get higher levels, try to do the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said quite openly about this film that it was to reject the fascism of media and movies of fascist movies. It is true ... It just forgot to tell us about the head of the head you get after sitting through this load more load!
