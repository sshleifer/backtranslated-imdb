I saw this film once ago, and I don't care anymore to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, preteen-lucked luck, who always seems to be neglected by his family and who always seem to be short on money. All of this changes when a bank robber rides a Preston bike and gives him a blank check as a compensation. Preston uses checks to remove 1 million dollars from the bank (surprisingly, the money belongs to the banker who gave him checks). Preston then buys a house and says that he works as an assistant secret assistant and rich man named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy for money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this looks like a great idea. However, on the screen, it's one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's very strange. I know some parts of the movie meant to be strange, but I am looking for a twelve-year-old boy leaving with a thirty-year-old woman, and being responsible for a small amount of someone's thinking. Also, this was an unknown movie with a weak acting, a plot of predictable plot and characters who are less memorable. The characters were either cheesy, high, angry, or developed. But "Juices" was a good habit. If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this.
