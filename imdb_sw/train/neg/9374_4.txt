This document is very suitable when it shows only the offices of the ayurvedic healers and the preparation of treatment. There is no rejection of grinding poverty in India and despair even their wealthy clients. However, if the medication of ayurvedic medication in general, this film fails to sadly. Although India's customers say they have seen "doctors of" allergies, these doctors have not been discriminated, and we should take an incomprehensible explanation of their patients to the value of the face - "the doctor said no cure," "the doctor said is cancer" etc. Well, "no cure" does not mean "no cure," and what kind of cancer especially has the patient? The film is very weak when showing a ayurvedic practice in America. There it is reduced, it seems, for a surprising proposal that having a work on Wall Street work can cause your stomach hurt.
