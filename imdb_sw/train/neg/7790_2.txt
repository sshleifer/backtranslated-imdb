Like some of the other people who have gone through this film, I was also standing on the matter ... before being unfortunate to look again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely unreliable, and Pauline's pain has now been revealed to be a shameful exercise in banal, racist, and clear film making. Even the presence of former benefits Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not win the rancid screenplay, the song's awesome theme, and some effects 'special effects'. In addition, the exhibition of African and Arab actors exhibits a painstaking inquiry, particularly considering this was done quickly with the civil rights movement. The original history of Michael Weldon of Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was made for the first time for television but eventually ended up getting the exhibition. Based on the results, that's a very reliable (and surprising) situation.
