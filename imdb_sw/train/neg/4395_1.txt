December's custom holidays, like Frosty of nature, should be enriched-produced by quality music and beautiful stories, but light. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holiday. Basically, they should look, sound, and feel ... well, "special" and should have a good and correct letter of December vacation. So when I saw the Legend of Frosty Snowman on TV list, I found my children (6 and 8) breathed in telling Frosty's original story and showed how much I enjoyed it as a child. As my wife and children had finished on the bed to watch the movie prospects were high, but 10 minutes in me children were gazing at me and my wife we ​​called "look" and give us eyes. After 35 minutes my children were praying to sleep - I think they were involved in a language that was meaningless and deliberately, cut-off groups. I was ashamed of their desires (and my) with this movie. Unfortunately, the Legend of Frosty the Snowman is like the worst part of the Unfaithful Parents crossed by the worst part of the Sponge Bob than the classic holiday movie. Do not do wrong ... these exhibitions are the same as I like them as a follow-up boy, but when I look at the Bad Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for a short time, off-color, a small zero, mind loss events) are always satisfied. We chose the best books and we read the evening together. The best option than the bad story of Frosty Snowman.
