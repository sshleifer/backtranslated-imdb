"This could mean the end of the white race!" it sounds as Zombi Native Zombi walks around the European battlefield during the "Great War". Safari sets the city of Kennif-Angor which has long lost, set back to stop this kind of thing and keep the battlefield open for good loyal older people killed by thousands of thousands. It is very difficult to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as acting is so timber. Even in 1936 acting conditions in this film are bad. From the last decade. It seems as if it came from a school textbook on 'How to Do' <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Pain- ----- <br /> "How to express fear and love (Female) Lock all fists Close one hand on the heart Open your mouth like shouting. Put another fist, contrary to the mouth. for 10 seconds more than appropriate then turn the 90 degree header away from any direction and hub ". "How to have a hard, sensitive feeling with an old wife describing your love to someone else. Do not allow your contact with the eye. Do not leave. Do not show any emotion. and the studio wall. "<br /> <br /> To give us a legacy from leaden lead director who is carefully watched for a long time where nothing happens but the film continues to run through the developers. So the 35-minute story is 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The rebellion of the zombies when it comes is slow! Due to the bondage of mind, the former zombie animal forces turned their old master by blowing slowly over the hill and then sorting a little door and blowing the window. "Yes ... let's ... oh, I dunnno yeah. Let's get him grrr Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (although I've got a little something hidden. Jagger is being shot by Native as some kind of anti-concern for all Persians are being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick. No, even contemptuous locals don't want the end of White Race!) Expulsion (you can call it that) in the previous rainfall direction is hilarious and has the value of entering the price alone. Roy D'Arcy has a camp at the time, but it's completely passed, like Col. Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting time in this film. The good order of the inhabitants of Zombied and the white delegates fall under the dirt of evil eyes. face after face, cross-fade into another. It works, though there is a bit of a little wonder in the middle of each almost as far as the shape is cut. I think these should be a fringe of Neg Cutters between impairment. <br /> <br /> Best look with friends and with a silly feeling.
