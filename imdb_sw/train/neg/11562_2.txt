The widow's owner Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a lover of sadomasochistic, and British Lord. He brings the red-red women to his castle, where he beat them and killed them. The black color Erika Blanc (like Susie) is leaving, for a while. Mr. Steffen is hated by "Evelyn" wife, who died during childbirth. As a cure, she decides to remarry, after meeting with blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). At the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more graves. "Evelyn's Night Came From Calvary" is a staple head, at least. <br /> <br /> ** Publisher notes Evelyn usc√¨ dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
