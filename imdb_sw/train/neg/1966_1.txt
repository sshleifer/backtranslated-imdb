I was created to see this film after reading a good review from another site and someone was me.I'd !!! it took at least 15 minutes to remove it from the b / c shelf I didn't want anyone to see me. then 10 minutes to build the courage to take on the counter and actually use real money lease. I thought that all my problems would be paid when I got home and watching the movies b / c review I read said the movie was a good surprise; it's joke! if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then you are lucky! b / c is not until then turn on the film to be afraid. don't bother with these people, the better you look at "dankness falls"
