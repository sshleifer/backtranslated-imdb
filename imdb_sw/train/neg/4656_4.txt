Remarkable and unsurpassed remake of the old, celebrated English film. Although it may be damaged more than a general disaster (which is not), it has not created any tension and provides the nature of the TV. Richard Burton sleeps through his position, and Sophia Loren is bound (in this film) the face does not show much enthusiasm, either. (**)
