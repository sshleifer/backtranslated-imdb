The first time (and only) I saw "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. It has never been in the first. I remember there was a staff of directors there, and don't forget who they are. It was a Belgian film, we had never heard of it, so we had no side, without knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he stands miles before all others. He plays an actor who has stopped standing for a long time. He helps to identify the film in Belgium with the title "Shades". <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, we've seen how much to swear there. There is no contradiction to the common word of swearing. However this was a much more offensive way. At any time Rourke uses F *** word to explain something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the cast, an English speaker does the word F **** or S ***, becomes proud and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lose calculation how many times they used F and S. Everyone was just happy to be out of the theater. And we had to vote, but it was hard for us because it was just from 0 to 10, and we were looking for -10.
