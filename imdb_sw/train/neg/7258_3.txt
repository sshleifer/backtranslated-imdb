This grainy film has the following ritual and one of the word-mouth elements that you should see. Perhaps hard to believe, but there is a rural community in Arkansas southwest, Fouke, which knows the story is true. This story is told in the style of the document shown by Vern Stierman and displayed in the exact locations that speak to real people involved. This story changes and tells them, but over 60 years and over 70s the neighborhood of Fouke was visited by a creature like Bigfoot which was traveling along Boggy Creek. For a long time you had three fingers and standing on the foot of the foot 7, this creature was constantly destroying and fearing 'bejeebers' from many communities. I personally crossed the small bridge of Boggy Creek in 1974, and that's the hair behind my neck increased. Of course it was about 1 a.m in the rain. When I got to Shreveport, I was laughing.
