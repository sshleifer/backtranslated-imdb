"Dog Dogs Time" ... "Trigger Fun" whatever you want to call ... is not eligible to mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe not like Gangster matches (like I thought Oscar, Johney's risk and Mafia also left them). Make that. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start by making it a gag once it was painful to watch. There is not enough changes to the area or the feeling that they were supposed to be. Most of the film can be placed in the "Club of Dreyfus" or various office rooms / dim. .. (what was it and that sitting down the gun stand something Goldblum kept winning?) <br /> <br /> Assistance cast was ... on the best Paper (great see Silva & Drago) but the characters were killed off before they were time to develop. by Richard Pryors cameo was Joke! The Romance feature and Love of the film also found it. I think I will return at any time soon.
