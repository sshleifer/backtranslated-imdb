This is a film that shows that the emotions and music and handling is not enough to make a good film. Indeed, the viewer is identified in many beautiful Los Angeles scenes in the thirty years - I was very interested in the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram lifted up the hill - but for this movie theater is winning, because it creates a sense that "something will happen" and nothing does. The script also continues to delete for a particular plot or action or injury - and frequently not recommended. Not even give (I think) the theme of the movie, the characters' misfit key. The leading artists, both very good for their roles, did not show any violation or pain, and the script has not given us any. Now, Donald Sutherland? That's another story. Her character was well done, so it played well, that I wanted the camera to follow her.
