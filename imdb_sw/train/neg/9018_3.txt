This is a B formula of fiction science fiction, and the director did not make bones about it. It is about a dragon who is restored by a scientific team. Everything that was done is things you have seen many times before. It's a weak script, without real characters. In fact, it is full of characters and situations. The director is attacking this by simply making a form of film, without trying to distract us, and this gives the film a desperation, but not something that you can remember when. It's best to be seen when you're cooking, cleaning, working out. A kind of unwise happiness. It has its place in entertainment, but it's not really something that you sit down with friends to watch, unless you are just a drunk and don't worry. The quantity of 3.2 is probably right. I don't think it is like so many people, but I wonder that some people in the ads thought this was amazing. That really canceled me, because I don't see an attempt to even make this anonymous film.
