Irene Dunne finished her wonderful work with this movie. She should leave the bang, as classmates were, not in this unpopular, unknown film. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is the same, but nothing special. The first half is very good if it gets ridiculous in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the author on the wall and stop. Even his high voice has led a little here. Rumor has he was not happy with this film. One can see why. <br /> <br /> Story reminds me of the 1950 television sitcom. Speaking about it, I thought David Nelson from the show of Ozzie & Harriet TV was in this movie but appeared to be very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Total, so-so for the best and the lowest end for the good actor.
