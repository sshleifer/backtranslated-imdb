bad, just bad! My old wife was looking at this junk look and running me crazy. The book is one of my likes and disgraces that some people don't know what is true because their first impressions come from dribble like this. they changed too much to be recognized. which testifies since the book reads as a soap opera, providing enough food for modern entertainment. it is like one of these Life-based movies that say "based on true stories" but it is completely false. no emotion or depth of the book, basically no meaning of melodrama. if you are a high school student to find a way to overcome reading, I give you a try another version.
