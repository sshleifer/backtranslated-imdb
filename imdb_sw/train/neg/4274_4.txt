We are not in the story of the king of honey. We can acknowledge the truth of what we see, without being ignorant, acknowledging, that this show is just a lot of incomprehensible things and that it is clear, that a lot of these were made without pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <br> Well, it's so many people like things like that. I am not. I would like to consider well and planned plans. And also I admit, that the show is great for my taste and boring ... love and narcotic stories ... There are many exciting detergents and a lot of doubts (Dallas model), but Twin Peaks can't catch my attention. I don't care about those people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
