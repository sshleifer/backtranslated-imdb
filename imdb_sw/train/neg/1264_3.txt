This movie is not widely available with the predecessor of "Robot Jox". This should also be why his common name is "Robot War" and not another name "Robot Jox 2: Robot War". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was a fun movie to watch because It had a nice premise of great robots to fight every day. This concept has been rejected for this film and instead covers an incomprehensible story that instead of a natural or crafty. Shame tried to be very different from its predecessor in fact, for another perhaps this could be a more fun film look. <br /> <br /> As "Robot Jox" this is a B-movie but and as a great difference that is not only very good. Maybe this also has the fact that "Robot Jox" was made during the '80's, when the movie B had still had some charm and class on it, although the movie was released in 1990. This really can't say about this film. It is only crippled, poorly done, poor looking and not very exciting. It also has an end that you are thinking about 'This is it? That's all? '. What the story of his story is missing is a narrow line of the main plot. Perhaps a good grandmother would be a good idea and other things such as a true story story, a certain point, or a suitable character. They mostly thought when they beat the actors for this film. They are not very interested in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is angry as the main character, who does as he is a gift of God to a woman and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone. Could they not only get actors from the first film? <br /> <br /> With this future film, with the idea of ​​having a great droids of war in it, of course this film lacks its action. If they put more and more action on the film, the movies would have to be more entertaining than watching. Instead we now have a movie that is not surprisingly basically every way considered. You can look good "Mighty Morphin Power Power Rangers", for more and more fun. <br /> <br>> 3/10
