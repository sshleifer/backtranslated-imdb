Apart from the Spaghetti West, I would put this immortal Person on the little side of that kind. It's not that the movie is very bad, but there is no beauty and flash of some other SWS I have seen. Guy Madison is doing a good job in the lead role, but they don't have the appropriate charisma to remove it. For one popular discrimination, all others are beaten not very good. The focus is not fixed and provides a very short time that I have never seen. There is so much to get very excited about. <br /> <br /> The discount I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is one bright spot in this unusual film. Unfortunately, his screen time is closed for 15 minutes. Neri for someone named John Bartha as listed in IMD loans for film.)
