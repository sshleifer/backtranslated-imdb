After much appreciated the performance of Mr. Brosnan as a cad in the "Tailor of Panama" (which I rate 10/10 on board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, speed, music, emotional effect, etc.) this film hard. I was shocked. It is a script not reading film, vulgar because of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that "the view of Panama" is rich and satisfying. To blame on writing screen and leading. I'm sitting in the theater waiting for a "good place"; never came. I did not laugh or silia, although one line of conversation made me reach. Has $ 7 worth? Not possible.
