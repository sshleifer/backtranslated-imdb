NATURAL KORNERS KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Kata: R <br /> <br /> Ward Director: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It is an unusual picture of Oliver Stone, but when I read it was on drugs when photography, I didn't need more details. 'Natural killers' are dangerous, mad, making all films that we can't find too often; A wonderful, psychotic, picture of art. The natural killers are a story of how two massacres were found and respected by the media; there is a huge area where the respondent asks some young people about Mickey and Mallory, and the boy says 'Kill is a mistakeâ€¦ but if I was a murderer I would be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey explains this for 'Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein '- Dr. Frankenstein is a media that has turned them into murderers. Oliver Stone's films are exploring America's mistakes, which the director likes and accepts. I think 'native killers' is about the impact of media news, technology and how to lose as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) about things like ordinary killers and strange situations. Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) killers are killed with amazement by two best actors who enter the lives of two suspected killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people deserve to kill, perhaps in the theory of Darwinism of Socialism (fittest life) - Mickey says in his jail interview, that some forms kill, we as human beings destroy other forms and use the environment; The script is interesting, but it is much less concerned how this film is the same, in the sense of making us think about the society and human behavior, rather than the blood size of 2 hours that we have seen. The last hour of the film is held in the top security prison; we see the reality of prison life; The observer's view of the same, freeing more prison - perhaps the stone asks you about the future, the way the community leads. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, the author who runs the show about the 'Maniacs of America' and has taken into account the rise in rates, that goes to any length to catch the story of Mickey and Mallory. Others are a police officer Scagnetti, insane, perhaps a sad officer who loves Mallory - also has a fierce quarrel with mass murderers, since his mother was killed during a massacre at Waco, Texas and Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good; different colors, shades, styles feel depressed; The most obvious green color of all is green, in order to resemble the disease of the killers (in the drug center when they are looking for rattlesnake drugs). <br /> <br /> The camera function is insane; shaky, buzzy, takes the decision to use and accept. Inorhodox very, psychedelic and odd. 'Natural killers' did not like the presence of prostitutes, asking how we as a society can give this reputation ... <br /> <br>> Although the above reference is good very much, I did not like the film. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script of the film, was not happy with the modified screen and requested his name to be removed. I can see why. While interesting at times, native birth is a mess of pictures. <br /> <br /> 4/10
