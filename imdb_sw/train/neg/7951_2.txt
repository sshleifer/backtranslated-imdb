I gave them a low score of 'Kôhî jikô' not because it was a bad movie, but because it doesn't do anything of value. I have not seen any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but with uninitiated (I included) 'Kôhî jikô' is declared as a worship service for Yasujiro Ozu. (The Japanese director whose final film was the way, the 1962 film) The film is too much work ... with very few conversations, stories, music or emotions. Yo Hitoto plays 'Unemployed' Yoko, a walking character who spends his time in a local coffee shop or exploring a Taiwanese musician who likes. Tadanobu Asano has a friend, who works in a cd shop and regularly puts his otaku interest in the train. And that's about all. <br /> <br /> We look like Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walks around ... waiting for the train ... fish train ... lying on the train. The kind of truth of everyone in Japan can see every day. Hou takes this ordinary time of this life of characters, but without any sense to these vignettes it is a very useless film to do or watch.
