I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and the wrongly produced film is for a film manufacturer who has been very happy. LADY and DUKE's experience (and no other word but "permanent" will do), I stood in a bad situation, the situation is only given by reading the IMDb user's comments and 112. Since Rohmer does not just try (successfully) make us see the world through The 18th century French art but, as stated by Ali, has shown (at the cost of separating his audience) the effects of all class consciousness and the revolution led to the eyes of a woman who is not of the woman's age. The director has fulfilled the uncertainty, but I wonder if it was worth the effort that was needed to do it - or for us to see the negative consequences of his work.
