I'd like to write on the story, but it didn't have any. I would like to quote two hard conversations from the film but "hinglish" is just funny for 5 minutes, after its fall. I would like to ignore the 'waiting for decision' but it was as much as possible if ... um mm, movie Yash raj (?). I would like to talk about the edge-of-stage action, but I don't like many cartoons. sigh * <br /> <br /> For all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people are trying to commit suicide - I promise it will inspire you on edge 2. Sado-eyeschists - this movie is the way better than barbed wire which Silas guy in Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People looking for alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I invite viewers from the hall seemed to have a sense of killing a man 4. Movie Piraters: The most powerful of them. If any movie is not appropriate to have the audience lost money to look - this is the one. 5.Bamba, many types of plankton & green seaweed - Because almost all living things require a larger IQ feature than what the film provides. Afterthought: The director of the movie, it is obvious, is its own kind. (And I hope that God is the only one of his kind. There is enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could make this excellent film: 1. Story 2. The painter of the choreographer 3. A Author of screenplay 4. Cheat coordinator 5. Story (Did I tell you that?) 6. Director - especially a person who was not mentally challenged (although even a person who has a challenge can work better) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Blow - Avoid at all costs 8. Legal warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is bad for your mental health"? The things I liked about the film: 1. Kareena Kapoor - Because clearly 2 Under English names - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is missing", "Charia Chalia Chalia" turns to " Im a boy of love, Im lover, Im a vagabond ". /> <br /> Briefly, Tashan to me, is like the rubric of the Rubriki cube - Cube should add the IQ player, Tashan promises to decrease your IQ, and that .. in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But that's just me. I would like to be wrong You've warned every time.
