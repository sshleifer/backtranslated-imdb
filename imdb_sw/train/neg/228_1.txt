I thought it was a New-York movie present: it's not right! It is a little plans for the UK. <br /> <br /> I thought it was comedy: wrong! It's a drama .... Well, to the end of the third, because after the story being completely "abracadabrantesque", a word for the French presidential authority. It means, close to the preference however the mind can bring a genuine sense. What has I left? Maybe, the good duo actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead police are a bit invisible to me. A great surprise of doctoress and punch it, and McDowell announced a good acting as usual, both in a stylish, smooth and close manner. This gentleness bothers me, because like other good artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated repeatedly. In his case, it's like, whatever movie, it's always the same character described by his feelings, his values, who lives a different story. I still don't know how to set a limit (or fusion) between artists and work. Another good way of this film is to touch it to women and attract different views. Women have all their way of living, even if they are all special. It brings great patience and learning to witness how real and unique situations can be seen in many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie looks completely, but the end ends the desire for the next vision.
