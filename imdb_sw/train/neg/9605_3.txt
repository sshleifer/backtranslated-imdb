This Italian film from 70 years is not in class with dog soldiers, theling howling, or even that wonderful American waswolf in Paris, but ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching a leading actress, a stunning blond, running amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about dirt, perfect ... it is clear that he is a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is hoot, SFX is infants, and acting (for the most part) eliminates. The only value of the redemption of this movie is all (and there is LOT) incidents of dirt & sex. Tame and HBO levels, but still happy to see when you find yourself on Saturday night. Okay ... WHERE IS A WARRANTY ... NO WASWolf (except in the opening area of ​​the grandfather's heroine (??).
