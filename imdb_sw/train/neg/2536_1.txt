My wife and I just finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. He slept during certain parts of the movie. I liked I would have taken snooze him, but the worst thing is that the voice of the main character is very large and sand that was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me listen to Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. It also does not have the characteristics of redemption. I was hoping that he would be beaten and then five minutes on the film. Do not get wrong, I would like an Asian movie of fear, but The Booth is very irritating and full of scenes that really do not make any sense. If you want a good Asian movie, see the two Muslims Book or Inside the glass. Avoid Booth as a blow, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
