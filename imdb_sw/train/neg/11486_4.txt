Because some people, like me, like to know everything about the movie even if they plan to see it, including the end. However, here is the end if I remember, because I could not be more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on television. But I will tell him, surely he was afraid of the little child I was, and I wanted about it the next day, and I'm still in my mind until this day, although some of these details are little. Abe Vigoda was in this film? I don't remember that! I did not even remember that Barnabus was in this movie, and I loved Dark Shadows. So, at the end, the leading attitude (Belinda Montgomery?) Targeted by Judge (Joseph Cotton, I think, although I remember if he is a family doctor or something instead of a judge, see how the memory ends?) At the wedding location, which I remember is in a graveyard of some sort? Maybe I've got a bad thing; and Shelley Winters there is panic, and the Judge has a cape on, and the angle of the camera is kind of looking over it, and he throws back the garment, and has the feet of the goat, and he announces he is actually his father, the devil, and plays in their hands (Satanic worship), because the "dead" boy has fallen in love and (I think Robert Foxworth) turns out that the man Satan wants to marry him, Demon and Yellow Eye, and yep, certainly, show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes are yellow. There's a lot of close-around in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone laughs and cheers, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, crying or shouting or something, and that's the end. The wicked prevail.
