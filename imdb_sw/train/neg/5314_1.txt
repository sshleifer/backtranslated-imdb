The muscle-cutting music like the fingers on the board board, doing so which is zombielike was embarrassing to lose the second film; casting everyone into it as a true zombie --- with a cast of Sabrina Shepherd of Youth as heroes ... the movie is so bad that if the "stones" were still around it could be considered to be a cult of worship — but, oh so amateurish, scripts can also be done next to the administrators, their line they read as they slowly shuffled through the movie --- banal, illogical modeled sets after LA subdivisions, props directly from ToysRus! Did it have a built-in film that enters completely and completely? Logic goes to the wind in this plodding, useless, and useless and "monster" so it is ignorant and unrelated that it can not catch the turtle in ice --- lowcut, leggy --- and amazon! It set my mind all the way; A terrible, ongoing way of sequence in a mist that involves many cars examining one to the end ... as, after fighting the ray-gun resources on another planet, the pneumaticaly-minded and unsuspecting intellectuals of the imperialist an additional refugee land — for the country! Don't let anyone p ** s on your popcorn, you can actually enjoy this look. It's bad!
