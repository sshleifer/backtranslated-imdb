Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> The lousy script is not a very large direction either. My main problem was not worried about any of these people. Not the killer is not the victims. The settings were a good shelf. Dennis Quaid's character was so badly written, I didn't care even when the end came. She got her baby back. Great plan! I wanted my money to return.
