Cast amazingly lost on inappropriate script. Ten or more older people in the summer camp they attended as prisoners. Could this happen in millions of years? It's just fantasy, and it's boring at that. Are they young again? Do they renew their plans, games, good times? They can try but eventually the answer is: No. Is there any conflict? Any doubt? Fear? Quests? None of the above. How anyone can be interested in this problem is more than me. I wanted to love this film; I tried to love this film, but my brain refused it.
