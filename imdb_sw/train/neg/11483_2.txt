I was so interested in seeing this film. I was waiting for the year to be canceled here in New Zealand. I should not build too much because it was so desperate and certainly Clark's worst movie is very bad with this film. First, some acting is good, especially Nick Stahl as 'Bully', and a red-haired girl (I can't remember her name), but most of them were not touch and very impossible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is an old Clark film now and was very brilliant in 'Children', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with lies as well as turning his events into a close proximity. Screenplay felt like written by a first-year film student. Sorry, a high school student ... someone who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't understand Clark's intentions. What? Was he trying to explain the meaning of these children? It is certain if hell did not prevent him from getting into a good perv. I'm not bright but I didn't need to see the breast of youngsters and buttons every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's strange and I don't think she will come on it.
