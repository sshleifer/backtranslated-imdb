Debbie Reynolds tiny fingers, tangos and, yes, tap-dancing its way through this ordinary thriller that has at least '30s atmospheric atmosphere. Two women were brought together when their children were killing, try to start their life by running a dance dance dance for Hollywood in Hollywood. The problem is, one of them faces neuroses. Can you imagine this about 10 years earlier by Robert Aldrich leading Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette never wanted to let Joan a lot of screens to lose his stuff, and I can't think Bette Davis in another role, tap-playing his heart out. This is a piece of the macabre brain, written by Henry Farrell who had lost (his idea of ​​a good "shock" is to solve the killing of a rabbit group!). Not one of the joys of honesty in the whole package. * 1/2 from ****
