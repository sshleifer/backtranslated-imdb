Shades of great music, this movie faces the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, has missed the mark of music, without "unlocking" the opening, and trembling to play. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for work in Bway music and explore their car & desire to work in this demand and not-always-reward rewards work. Attenborough gives us a new hope of optimism, considering that they are trying to get a "big break" in the show business, rather than presenting a mixture of characters created on the stage as a "gypsies" to show a live show, with several visitors. The film has one advantage on playing and that's the opening area, indicating the size of the original inspection and the actual rate of up to 16/17 on line (depending on how you use Cassie, who hides out the line in the film). Anyone who can get the light of the civil opera of the game will have more experience than to see this very unpleasant film.
