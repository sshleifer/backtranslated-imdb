Inapt, boring, and incoherent odd "exciting" which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a regular victim of hallucinations and dreams after a car accident claiming the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). I don't start to tell you how bad this is ... nothing of any importance is happening or there is no kind of real value of entertainment. I didn't like this cast in this special film - all caused by sadness (then again, their roles were not good). This promotion as a terrible film is a joke. Where is it wrong? No sense or insistence - there are a few good songs but that's about it. How did this project get green light? Author of the Author Steve Carpenter has no vision or talent that can realize that I can feel. Then more, the conclusion of the truth makes the whole movie possible. <br /> <br /> Expert of the "killer county" I watched is 86 minutes of clean tedium. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
