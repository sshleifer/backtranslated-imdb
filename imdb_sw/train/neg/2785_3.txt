I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are very bad films, are considered as big movies and some "critics", just because they are not American. I saw the IMDB logo 8.1 for this film and noticed the fact that this was selected for a big celebration. Don't let this fool! Unless you are one of those people who love movies to think like this, and call it a good future, skip! The film has one exciting place after another (similar, an Italian, a film into my mind, an awesome PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I like sea sounds). The problem with these films is that it is not just to stimulate, like other films with amazing features, but that they play almost like camping. I mean, let's face the face, acting is bad (I mean: the opera-level sample), the story does not have one surprise (this has been done many times, connecting several story stories: GIVING, GIVING, GIVING to GOD, just the best more), not one true character in it (some true shadow-seeing on the way, see a beautiful zombie girl), and so on and so on. If it is not enough, the film is 135 minutes. (counting!) for a long time, and eventually the director opens up its emotional capabilities. After a films of bad conversation and bad events that made the public in the preview of the screening laugh, it is very ... This is insulting to movies, and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in the "other" language, in this case Spanish . The wonderful world we live ... 3/10
