This movie is real. There is nothing good I can say about it, rather than the moral values ​​presented at the top of the film about people in the neighborhood involved in the fight against crime. In addition to all this, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good acting, and no good script. I give this film F and 2 out of 10.
