This must be, far away, the worst movie I saw in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I thought it could not be a very bad film since he had a very good film, and he was a very good actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this film. I sent it faster to 80 percent of it and I don't feel that I have lost anything.
