This film has been lost in the Secrecy Science section 3000. I think MST3K was the best when they beat this movie. <br /> <br /> Bad act, evil evil, adverse effects, chick in skimpy (1960's) underwear. I give them 2. <br /> <br /> The offender is hard to understand because of makeup. Helper says things like 'not you' which looks like NACHOO! (consider stretching). It's just poor advice. Long sores say about the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what a "planned person" means for the plot of the plot. I missed some beginning though. <br /> <br /> Is it on a minimum of 10 lines on opening?
