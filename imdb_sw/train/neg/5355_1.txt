Now I don't know cheap movies. I don't see just why you should lose any money for a film you can beat with your father's camcorder. If I lost a movie, I want to be MOVIE, not a group of people who think it would be a good idea to lose some MiniDV - Tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this very because the guy in the video store said it was good, and it wasn't. Perhaps I hate it because it is cheap, it has a very odd plot, many non-true EVER characters and actually, really, are struggling in the history of EVER film. Even Tom Savini can not save this. Overall, this is a complete waste of time.
