It is a fantastic movie, you can call it bad or if you live with friends can give you a laugh to kill. Wonder comes to mind again and again. Shot amateurishly, acted even worse with instructions, maybe no. Special effects are interesting but the music that matches the child of the demon who climbs will surely be a big hit. See if you have time to kill. But not, do not even try to take it seriously. It is supposed to be a tax for 'death of the' '. Since I have not seen, from taxes I can assume it is bad. It would have given 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets 3 many years, the only thing the man did. Stay away as you are squeamish, more than a year than laugh. Wonder if the creators were laughing?
