The view of this film to me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely beaten against a kind and demonstrated that he could handle an unusual position (for him). Hanks are often a good person in the movie - your favorite, anime and root. Sullivan was definitely not a good person. It is true that in the context of this film he emerged as a very good - his purpose is to take revenge on his wife's death and the younger son. However, he was already a gangster and a killer before the murder. So Hanks did a task that I would not expect, and he smelled it well. <br /> <br /> Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly can't call this enjoyable film. After the opening that I could well describe as unigmatic (it was not quite clear to me at a time when this continues) it turns into a very sombre movie, about the hard relations Sullivan has raised as a gangster - significantly raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is kind the master of renown, and try to raise his two sons and keep them "clean" by saying; solely from his business. After the older man is killed, this group tries to kill him to keep quiet, find an unwanted child (and mother), and leave Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) to run. It becomes the kind of pride of the father / child movie. Although it is about to remember a certain hope (at least in the general context of the story) it is very dark, the situation is enshrined by many events that have been struck in darkness and rain. I must admit that when I valued the performance of Hanks, the whole film did not cover me. 4/10
