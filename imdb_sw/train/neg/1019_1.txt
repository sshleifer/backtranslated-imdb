In fact before watching this film, I had heard many people said this film was a shame. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken place in this movie, and look at it for my soul. It seems they were right. I was desperate and surprised all the time during the film - why hell I watched this film. Of course I didn't have much expectation from Justin if he was not really in movies / movies. But Morgan and Kevin? I can't stop wondering why a few agreed to participate in Edison. Be honest, their responsibilities are foolish. Well, you can imagine if players play, then I should pay more attention to the story. In fact the story is based on the movie, but the boys ... believe me ... this is not a movie you want to give a loan to his story. Consider this, the journalist Justin Timberlake wrote a story about the system and at the same time learning how to become a true journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). These were all supported by a single agent who still has a right heart (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigation (Kevin Spacey). At the end, they hit the system for the last story of happiness. Jeez, I couldn't even continue with this. Just remember the movie is making me sick already. My counselors, don't look at this! Please secure your money and during another movie.
