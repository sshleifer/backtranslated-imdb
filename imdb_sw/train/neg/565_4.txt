The same difficulty I have with "Les Miserables" is used similar to "Oliver." Instead of writing to the singers in the stylistic period of play, they only wrote Broadway songs, which are not available in both historical and romantic. Also, brutal violence and inappropriate dramaturgy activities should not be confused with some of the sun's fingers that are increasingly marked. It is an uncomfortable mix that leaves the messenger with the evil. Oliver's release of the young man did not help issues: timbre and stimulating desires, there is nothing less than stable here. Fagin makes its traditional order enough, although the tunes he is responsible for singing has a little foundation in the period of the period. <br /> <br /> "As long as He needs me" is given a strident, throaty and problematic interpretation. Two numbers of large production, "Who will buy" and "Think of yourself" seems to be on the produced, and everything but sinking the kitchen thrown. It's one thing to go out, but another crossing the line to be extra. Evil / despair and despair of many novels are unapproachable on such claims and choreography. When the novel is considered to be normal, I must admit that I have trouble understanding Mr. Dickens, since his work tend to stimulate negative vibration. This may be due to the expansion of his unhappy personal life, which was full of despair and regret. It is not all of the merits of this production, or the back of the camera, can eliminate the unstable state of the basic equipment. All of this causes an unpleasant experience for me. <br /> <br />
