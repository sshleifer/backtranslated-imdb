The most effective star-star film of Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee were beaten in the role of sidekick which has not been seen as a gel. The step is on average, a bit of dirt facing and that's Tia Carrera using the body twice! The layout is a regular renegade striker who was forced to break a new partner into a big case, at least the attempts to try to make a form to make Lundgren soldier and East and Lee slicker's modern city but there is a development of zero behavior that makes it be very close, Lundgrens outfit the eastern heroes for a great showdown seems reliable. The step-by-step process by Lee (who would continue to do well Crow) is not available to show any transparency of military art. But due to his good parenting he should be under the hell for many pressure and was better to serve to live by his father by taking a very different place in The Crow which showed what an exclusive actor could be if not for his terrible death and earlier. <br /> <br /> Unless your fan of Hardcore Lundgren or a fan of poor 80-style movies (do Cobra etc.) then avoid. 3/10
