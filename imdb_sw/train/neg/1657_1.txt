This movie was worth five fingers on my "sympathy card". I saw this when I was standing in Virginia in the mid-70's. I saw it alone so I didn't worry when I looked at it. Crashed. It was very worried, the total celluloid waste I ever seen. I know that others who have examined this movie have thought it is amazing. I give you this: if it was amazing what box office to take? End of discussion.
