Forget completely. Especially because of the weak acting. This is the first movie I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he has been around since 90 years. I thought he was a stranger, since his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw him doing well in other movies, he gave Clare Cooper a wonderful personality. Liv is not a type of actor that will give a hot attitude, emotional as Diane Keaton can, but it was strange to see him saying his lines in a whisper state. It seemed quite that it was not just a very good continuous chemistry among actors, and I think Diane Keaton saw that too. He is a wonderful actor, but he seemed a little bit on this film. It felt like she just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I will not blame him.
