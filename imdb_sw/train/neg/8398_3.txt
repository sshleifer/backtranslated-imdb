Schlocky 'films of 70s fears ... of gotta love' em. Unlike modern boring flicks, these K-tel experts actually do something horrible and do not use the exhausted form. This is a B movie on the creation of the film B ... went very bad. Faith Domergue (This World Star) as a hill-top-hill, B queen queen to make a film about a series of gris killings that have been a family in their home. His partner / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump to view, is publishing on the scene and with a strict schedule. The co-doll of Ken finds the book of Tibetian songs that work on the script to add "authenticity". Unfortunately, "reality" is something they could do without. John Carradine, after a long time refusing to watch the gland of the 17th (The Unarthly), now shows the existence of humility as a guardian of property. She goes around her daily work, but always seems to run the afoul of the director. The fear builds slowly; The cat cat here, John Carradine coming into the tomb there, finally reaching seven, yes the seven killings. (At least there is a truth in advertising.) It is just sad that ghoul did not understand that there was a film made on it. The poor faith to know that those who received Tibetian songs would really work? To cope with that, you can't just go around the devil's coat and expect him to fall down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says doing freedom on the Seventh House Corpses.
