I saw this film in my cinema class. I am glad that I did not pay for it. I came into it with an open mind, and I even had a little excitement. I am very happy with Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast were interesting. I've never connected to this film. Acting was good, the movie was interesting, but the storyline, or rather, its lack, it was a problem. There was no middle, connecting theme to the movie. Was it a love between Norton and Wood? Yes, it is not true. Was it west? Type, but no. I am all traveling on the movies, I saw soon "Brick" and love it, but where this film went out there out there. It was very strange, and if I didn't have to sit on the whole film, I would like to walk. Writing was not terrible, but it was just about the place. When the film was finished, I was left completely confused and wanted to be gone earlier. There was just something about this film that has never been over, I understand more films like "Fighting Club", but I wasn't worried about the characters altogether.
