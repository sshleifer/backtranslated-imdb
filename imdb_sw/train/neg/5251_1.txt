This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily described a bad Spanish version of the 21st century. It does not show character development. It does not even show any content of violence and / or sex, and does not add anything new to psychological sub-forms. Therefore, the cripples should be shown in the film schools as an example of "what to do" in the first movie. BTW where hell is "talent"? there are cases that have been hit in a close; there are cases that contain two or more shots and are quite bad to see the action jump from one master shot to another without reason. The camera is almost never recommended, as a "very talented artist" feared to show his lack of visual skills. Supervisors who work with the main functions act as partners, and support is not accepted. There are more holes than a conspiracy in the script (if ever there was one).
