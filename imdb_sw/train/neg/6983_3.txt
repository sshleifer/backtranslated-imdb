The revolution is a terrible movie, I don't care if you are a teacher of history, a journalist, a fan of Al Pacino, there is no way that this film can get the money '10'. It is important to focus on the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) trying to get money from the information given to radical fighters to take his boat. Everything revolves around that statement. Tom's son joined the army to write, and made Tom join the army too, going to the adventure trying to try out of the army, years after the war ended and they could finally turn to memory for their boat. Finally. It was a few events of war, and they were very good for the best. Transfer between scenes used "five months later" and magically put characters in a famous history war. The story of love is a joke, and the movie is generally difficult to follow. So save your "Notes" and look at Patriot instead.
