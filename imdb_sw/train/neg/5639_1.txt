I saw this movie today at Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing a rave review, but I think critics were breastfeeding until Willem Defoe and his wife (director) who had it at the festival. It is definitely a small movie that I have ever seen with many trivial, ridiculously long-term events. In addition to Defoe who was honorable, acting two and a half others in the movie, Defoe's wife of Giada included, was ridiculously bad (how to beat part of salesgirl in the bakery is more than I). This film is a very good plot under the attempt to lose the common and the wall. The only event that emphasized any kind of response in the crowd was bad and did not come from any other place as simply to add the kind of shock to the gentle which is this film. Sorry to be very bright, but really this film is a waste of time and money. I appreciate the best indie movies, but this movie is not suitable during the movie.
