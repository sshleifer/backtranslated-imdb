This follow-up journey never comes close to matching the magic and the evil of the best adventure these boys used in their first film. This item tries to eliminate its prequel to catch a new blood out of joke, but it takes a bad lie and travel no place to attract or funny. It is about half an hour lost to show young people performing a rock festival (and many people watch "free TV" - since when it happens?) Indeed the author of the script could do something more creative; see how all the random elements of the first movie are well closed together and involve them in the presentation of science. It's not in this film, which ended very franchise of Bill & Ted. The joke was gone. The Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix, for any reason. This combination, like a whole plot, happens well and has no spark for drama or audience involvement. There is a feeling of ZZ, because it is for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But there is nothing realistic or interesting. <br /> <br /> Call this animation object.
