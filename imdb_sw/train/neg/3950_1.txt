I did not know before that at the University of Devry at the beginning of 1990 (or was it ITT Tech?) Added Film to its beautiful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well this film should be a product of valedictorian class. My friend and I leased the original Boogeyman 1980 on my Netflix and this movie was on DVD. Don't waste your time with this movie. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> The creator of the film adds 2 main character, the woman and its professional. The woman had a dream about Boogeyman and her victims from the first film. More than 50% of this film is a stock from the original film. Some films are the main character with a bad dream when his professional drones on the author. These parks are carried through the filter so the characters become light. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, repeat, bad. Don't watch this film.
