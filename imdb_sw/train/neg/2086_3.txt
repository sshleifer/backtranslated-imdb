Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. Ghostbusters, Evolution come into his hands of skill. Even its regular flop (Six days, Seven White) show signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I had found the problem that Reitman could not take the original plot (someone causes superhero, superhero gets a powerful revenge), making it something that enjoys. "Girlfriend" is a useless practice. The pony mark of the trick is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. Film can not decide whether to be a romantic comedy or a superhero game. The result is a flip-flops film between both, and no element to be very well done. Uma Thurman is a peak, as usual, and Luke Wilson removes his role too, though his antics of the slacker quickly grow tired. What is even more surprising is that, in some cases (such as when you turn too much. But seconds later, magic has been lost, it has passed quickly as a superheroine that cinema roam almost every way.
