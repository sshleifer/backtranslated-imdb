As a girl, I have always look for movies related to gay and elite. However, with this kind of cut out there - it would be enough to discourage any listeners. I continued to wait for something - nothing! - The story to develop, or for him just to make some kind of mind. Didn't happen. It was meaningful events, which were not connected to any way. Film has failed to send any type of story or depth to character. After one or more hours of this nonsense, I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this ignorance. 1 Star - and is not recommended yet.
