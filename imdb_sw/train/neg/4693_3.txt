This is the kind of film that breaks me more. Great big, good director, great storytelling, then they destroy it all with a screenplay which does not make any ... and does not say anything when going there! There is no detail here. No depth characters, no depth of conspiracy, no depth of surprise, anxiety, or common sense. We know what happens, we are told how they plan to solve the problem, they solve the problem, give us a surprise near the end that cannot produce any trouble, and then stop the film suddenly. Decreased opportunities. On the other side, Glenn Ford leads British characters (and one of the French) who are all amazing, doing very amazing work and direct text given to them. One of the most beautiful is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", who offers good bits of humor and warmth for black and bad films. I also thought the film looked good ... shades and mist ... very black film in feel. Even though executives are doing a good job and leading it is fun, it is still not enough for me to recommend using it during watching the film. There are the best movies of Glenn Ford out there: Great heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
