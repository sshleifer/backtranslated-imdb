The film was so full of scandal that it was the most sought-out ... anger, mystery, etc., everything had a large piece of film making, but eventually it fails every time. is a very bad comedy, a horrible movie of fear, film provocation film. DVD DVD 2 includes a good booklet and still, interviews, experiments on sex, etc. with many interviews with the most-wise director. for those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the bag will seem extraordinary until someone sees the film. 1 record has a edited film, which is translated into English but with good quality to see. The disc 2 has a cut of the director, in the worse transfer, in French <br /> <br /> What can I say about a real animal? The puppet hand of Kermit frog would be more effective and terrible.
