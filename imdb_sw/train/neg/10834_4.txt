Sorry I lost something? Did I go earlier? The first ten stories of unusual stories (and non-true!) Had me thinking "This would be a classic" But it was all down the hill from there! Acting was a brilliant, why it's worth William H Macy is wonderful and just becomes better and better every film I look inside. But it did not seem to connect. I was waiting for a lot of time where all the stories connect and then suddenly .. rain frog? it was like the author said "I've gone deep and how can I connect all these stories carefully ... Oh sod it'll just rain in the frogs". I love clever movies, I would like amazing movies but this was unusual and horrible. 4/10
