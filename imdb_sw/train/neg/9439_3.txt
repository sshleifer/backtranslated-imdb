The end of the finish can be very cool on the film. It is particularly interesting when misleading is right before our eyes, but we don't care. That end of the end is the person that makes people think. Then we've twist as this film has. He insists that if you listen or don't worry, you don't know what is happening. When they disclose this type of random loss, instead of shock, it's a certain amount of dumbfounded responses. This film begins as it will make it interesting, but after 20 minutes, it is not just a boring conversation and a stupid deviation. Three children are going to the festival, so they go missing the forest, and hit the tree tree. They live in the house of a young woman, who hates men, and is welcomed by her beautiful daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Wonderful miracles of happening as these girls are staying in this house for a few days instead of trying to leave or return home, and the violence continues in the dumb slasher. <br /> <br /> This movie is also experiencing these conversations, and is always among the few characters. We have three little girls, a wonderful spinster and an old woman, and any discussion of importance does not go beyond these five. To do worse, they have nothing to say. In fact it is completely debt sitting through their conversation. We want to know what's going on, and instead they talk and talk and talk (about anything). <br /> <br /> The plot is a lot here. This house girls sit when they get into their car crash that looks three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! Walking for two hours or less will kill them. Why did they not get a ride with a worker for this house who was driving in the city? Had one set? What? These girls never ask themselves to stop and voluntarily stay, rarely even look on each other? Why was this supposed to have a lot of dumb twist? Maybe the answers are on the boring script. <br /> <br /> Have a slasher film with five characters is a bad idea. It is not exciting, not recommended, and the end is obviously out, but of course it is dumb. My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 months. R for fraud and violence.
