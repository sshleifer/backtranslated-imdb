After reading the novel before seeing this film, I was very disappointed with the actions of the wood and the pride of the producers for the negligence of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the transparency of Bronte's work, and instead gave the impression of an unknown story of love. In filing the film for 2hours short, the film lost many of the key features that make the book clear and continue, leading to a certain jumpy plot and insisting a bit. There is no built-in love between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this seems rather unexpected and unfamiliar since two characters have an unusual interaction you can't help but think 'their love' is high. This is a violation of Bronte's novel, given a sense of Jane's cheek and a problem that attracts Rochester to her, and her pride impresses Jane. Though the poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were very displayed, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however the total production was bad. From the best scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) and Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for better production.
