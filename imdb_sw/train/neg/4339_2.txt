This film was not quite what I expected. If this film is called nothing else it could even be aware of the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> is amazing because I can't see the point. The prequel and sequel only allows you to say it is not meant, even inappropriate. maybe I am naive but not vol 1 & vol 2 has a similar meaning. Carlito was imprisoned in the first 1 and died in the original, and in prequel he lives and not going to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, but they would have to change both actors and some line of the story and the name of the film and it would be a good film. It is completely expected to put an end to another as it started. If one person has comments on this post please.
