That is very ridiculous, I hope many people are open to Muslims living around U.S., U.k, and around the world. Religion has more than a billion followers. I am born with bread in America and through my religious classes and doctrines I have been taught to respect my country and work to contribute to the community. I have devoted myself to adhering to the teachings of my religion that have been emphasized through life to educate and prepare for success through education to contribute to the world. I know many Muslims from all sides and I have gone to countries like Pakistan. I have never met someone who believes that we should hurt anyone or any other religion except from the media people ... I wonder why ... Also sad that those advocates are those who use the media to represent the whole religion. Its one billion people, and this is less than one percent, I am sure that other people of other religions do not want to be represented by the KKK, IRA and many more who are a small percentage of concerns who are spending less time and not actual textbooks honored to monitor their non-, regenerated, or commercial relics
