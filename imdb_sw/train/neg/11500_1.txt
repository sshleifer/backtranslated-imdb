It follows that the attempted and realistic form of Europe that they like to provide subsidies, which has never been seen, but that critics think it makes "something important". <br /> <br /> The movie is worth if there is no more to show great difference in thinking among Americans and Europeans about employment. In this film men still suffer from their injuries since the years and feel that it is the government's duty to give them work. If in the United States we know we should go there and create value for someone. Spain never looked again!
