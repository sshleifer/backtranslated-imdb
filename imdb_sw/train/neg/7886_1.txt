I have nothing against religion movies. Religious people need something to watch on Saturday night, I think. But what is involved is when writing on the DVD box does not show this fact to a viewer who can. Removing religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I was a religious person, I would like to agree with many banners here, this movie was a mess. Standing gently, not working, should not be changed, and a voice sounding was hilarious. Fake words were terrible, the characters were particularly discriminating, and continued to be out of the window. Just because we lived this way of losing time was that it was too late to watch another film instead. You must just go to bed. There is absolutely no redemption features for this movie, unless you are a religious type who will immediately accept anything that will witness your faith to unbelievers, even if it is a garbage collection. If not, try this at all costs. Do not be misled by the writing box.
