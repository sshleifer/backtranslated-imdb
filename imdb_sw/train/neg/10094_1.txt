A little child and I am a terrible movie gun. We've seen on everything, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen many good zombie movies, and a lot of evil. This BY FAR is a movie WORST I've ever seen in all my life. It's not just horrible, but special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" made it worse than I saw. If you can even call it make-up (the shadow of the black eye next to the eyes) This is a perfect proof that you should never judge the book for the lid. The reason for the identity of the movie is the only sweet thing. make yourself a permit and do not hear this MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was worried about this film I went off and put a controversial movie in the movie before returning to the film saying "this movie is coming, don't waste your time, return now" I don't want anyone else to lose a good night film on this POS film ! I don't even know how it measured the ratings, t should be negative
