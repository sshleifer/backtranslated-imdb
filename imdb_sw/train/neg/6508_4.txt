This is a deficit of the former Frankenstein Foundation. A scientist is killed in a stroke with his father, a brain surgeon saves the brain. It then put in the robotic body of its own design. His brother, an electrician, provides the inspiration of 'colossus' to transfer ideas into motion. The whole project goes bad, while creation continues to increase. Special effects have not been deleted. Script lacks. And it's exciting that this is not a little terrible. Yes, very young children will think this is good. If you are full at three in the morning and this comes .... night, night. Leaders play with Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played 'Colossus'.
