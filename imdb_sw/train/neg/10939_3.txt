This movie has some of the worst things I've ever seen! Other events are natural as nails entering the floor. This nail trap takes these bad guys. Other damage to the film goes. I can't believe that this film is not even available in less than 100 full-time films. I also can't believe that there are sequels! The next film that I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Can R.O.T.O.R be worse than this? <br /> <br />
