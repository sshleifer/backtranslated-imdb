This is the first non-zombie review of you've done but this movie is worth making inspections for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an open b movie. Dinocroc itself seemed good but I thought the movie itself needs a little more weight as in action and violence because every time a croc is shown or in a fighting area is not going too much unless croc is seen by croc kills or goes to the repeat process. Jane Longenecker was a fire that included acting was much better than the average and the amazing thing is that croc looks fleshy rather than a cartoon hat * curve of cough of the komodo *. I enjoyed this enough film to be happy that there will be a guide that is more than what I can say about some movies in general. Generally 3/6 stars and value watch.
