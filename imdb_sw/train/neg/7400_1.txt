I have seen very good movies, and this is above. No plot to talk, is like one of the worst incidents of coma on the soap opera. I wanted to beat a little girl because, just well say, she is quite realistic way through the movie. Monsters running around to wear some bling was funny. I also noticed a bit of "Silent Hill" there. And I read that this was done by, or by looking at the Finnish metal band, Lordi. It is not surprising that it did not make much sense. It seems to be a promotional car and no more. FX is very good, looking for film, monsters, and even work too good. But the story and the story, there aren't there.
