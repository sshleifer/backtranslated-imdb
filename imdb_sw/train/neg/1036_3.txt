Ho-hum. The inventor (Horst Buchholz) is a dangerous biological weapon is in danger of falling into inappropriate hands. His son does not know (Luke Perry) has been working on antedote around. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat-and-mouse car run with the gun. Also in cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and Roger Moore old. Moore seems to be angry to go through this mess is certainly not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is appropriate for the role, but it's good to look at.
