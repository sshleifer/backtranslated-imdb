I can't believe that the lovers of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger are involved in importing this trash! This document is written well and leading so weak (both for one person) which is difficult to find more of the characters in the film. The dialogue is a cripple that is known as thriller has been cut out of a few fools who entered the theater. Setting up is hard, inviting you to believe that you will look at the horrible and sudden look of the passion of suffering. Bassinger's behavior is dumb, that he really stops shouting to God "Where are you?" so people after him can follow, and then takes a mess! And then he has come into the smallest trees in the world, meaning, runs around and the murderers don't get track of him, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, is that really the best writers in Hollywood can find that they spend millions of producing.
