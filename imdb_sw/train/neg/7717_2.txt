When I heard the plot of this movie I was just seeing it, meaning most cities are happy with killing tomatoes! Unfortunately the head is about as it gets. Guided by Detective Dick Mason, a special military team and scientists (including Greg Colburn who has not taken his SCUBA dress and Lt. Finletter who has never been pictured without his parachute tracking back) 'Attack of Tomato Killer 'is a parody of B-Movies, especially the Japanese fear of the 1950s. The film begins with the size of the size of the size of the women found in the kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene like tomatoes think to kill this woman, and let tell you does not get any saner as the film continues! To be fair there is a wonderful moment, for example whenever a Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice known to America's emphasis, or when he hides expert Sam Smith into tomato tomatoes, someone can please adopt ketchup? . So this film was probably funnier in 1978 with its very good idea. Unfortunately for 'Attack Of The Killer Killer Tomato' films such as 'Birds' and 'Naked Gun' series have been opened and done this kind of very best comedy since. It is angry; there is a progression of zero in editing and it only feels slow and lack of strength. For a film to be aware of the work you need a lot of things happening once, one gag after more. Singing in the film seems to be useless and the furniture shop that appears on the screen is so amazing, even for this film. Finally, however, you can see why this film is a single worship; I can't see so many people who don't care. Unfortunately the tragedy would be the way I could write this.
