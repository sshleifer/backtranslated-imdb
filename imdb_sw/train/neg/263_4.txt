After the day of work, I sat down and turned to the movie stations. The movie came on the guide and looked attractive so I tuned just before you started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the inability to work in Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot made me stand up and get food during the film. If there is any credit offered for acting in this film it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the film interesting. All in all, do not plan to attract your friends by providing this as a host for the night of the film.
