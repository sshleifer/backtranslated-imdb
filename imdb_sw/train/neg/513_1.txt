Burt Reynolds came to the point in his work where he appeared to be going through that way. He would show, a party with his friends on the film, and take home a great charge. It did not seem to be important for him that the products he represented was pure skin. <br /> <br /> No more video than "Ace of Stroker" which makes "Cannonball Run" looks like a classic and "Cannonball Run II" checking look. Store for several image competitions there is absolutely no value to see here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson strikes bad as dumb blonde is a shame. <br /> <br /> If Burt thinks hammer and Jim Nabors and wear like chicken looks funny then this is your movie. Otherwise choose almost any comedy film and it will not be worse.
