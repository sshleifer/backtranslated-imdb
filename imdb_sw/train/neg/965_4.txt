First I liked the movie. It seemed to me good comedy and silly moments. Creator of clothes Albert Wolsky did a good job! Just like a wonderful composer Robert R. Benton - this man had a very good taste !!! But the script writers were very disappointed. Lastly it will be a place on the level, but instead, they decided that the father and daughter must be together. Don't like the end. The father becomes a lover of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and sees it all right. Although it is the same, as journalists will say for example there is now a different soul in the body, but they did not want, they just prevented the memory. Actors were good, they were really funny. The Cybill pastor was fascinating, Robert Downey Jr. was very good at the play area :)) But some time it even damages the feeling of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Pastor after her husband's death waiting for 23 years (it's long!), She was a woman, had no one but her, and when she met her and was just about making her a partner, after The event with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), he scorned the man who was interested for many years !!! It would be a good movie, if it was not the end of the non-human psychology.
