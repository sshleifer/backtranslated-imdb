In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives with his historian Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still grieves the death of their son Augustin some time ago. Colonel has been looking forward to his pension fighter in the war against the Catholic church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old war. Without possession or money, but a valuable gamecock, struggling to live with the prospect of acceptance letter from the government, recognizing the law and paying for late pensions. This slow and touching movie shows the social and financial status of many older people who retired in the three countries of the world. In Brazil, many retirees should live with $ 80,00 per month. Colonel debt in the story was given to pay the grave to his son, otherwise he would be buried as a poor man. The best performance of cast, in a very sad story which is a reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. Cheo (Brazil): ('Not yet' Coronel ') (Do not write to Colonel)
