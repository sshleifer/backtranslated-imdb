One night I refused on this at the satellite station Bravo. Out of curiosity I decided to look at it. The main character is good and his body is shown well. You think his talent would be lost as an executive but it doesn't appear after watching the entire movie! My real gripe is acting in support especially the actor who plays Melnik.The Christ is bad! Handi's prison Hank is also nervous. The drink and the patient's experiments in his wanda defense wanda though with good luck we viewer and for Hank he decreases with dirty and Wanda near the end. The music used is a good time and builds a perfect sense of murder. This movie is looking for alone for beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
