This movie is very fun. The audience actually makes the movie go away though. Without giving up the plot, I would like to describe it as a new favorite of the Bride's service that should stand the test of time. You see a completely different side of Robert DeNiro in this film! (Interesting admission price for that!) All things have been from the adventure to love, and well-organized comedy. People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Special effects, may be awesome for the younger. Movie the movie. Great for some run. It is worth A. (Hope fits in the box office)
