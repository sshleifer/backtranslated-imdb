I loved this film, it was good, and the participants were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many ancient singers, is very good at his work, when you see him on a music movie, you know it will be good! I would like to suggest that people look at this hot, sad, and hot film, if they want to know more about Richard! Better! Fresh!
