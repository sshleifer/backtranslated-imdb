This is probably the best Karisma, except Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives the best, without even trying. Stories are very good sometimes but at the end it seems, especially when Shahrukh comes to the picture. What exactly makes me as it was the show of heads, the delivery of the dialogue, such as the story, why it was. It can be guided properly, and edited. The case was very serious, including Karima's mother, even though she had one time to shine, it was good to look at her. <br /> <br /> Links were also good. I did not like their family photos of Canada, but once they enter India, it is true if it gets. Overall, I would like to give you a finger!
