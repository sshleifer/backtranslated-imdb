I don't know anyone can call it a fight against war, it shows war on the elite level. These are elite soldiers who know what they are doing and take great pride in it. Even when they are competing, they still enjoy the level of skill and defeat their enemies, even if it does not do and become a pacifist. The movie is slow and rather does not know and in many ways it is tame as the war films go further and so on today, there are no body parts that come out as in modern movies. It is brutal in some ways even when you see the killing of a personal level. This is more than a movie someone thinks. Once you start looking you don't want anything. Men's ideas in movies and their interactions, what the film is about-not fighting itself or a great storyline exciting. This is probably called the triller war. <br /> <br /> If you're a warrior skill, if you're in reading or seeing the app about SAS and so on, you want to watch this MOVIE !!!!! Similar movies are Hill (1965) and Sean Connery, Compatible 49 (1941) and all the starred stars, The Naked and the Dead (1958) by Cliff Robertson. It is all common in their way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
