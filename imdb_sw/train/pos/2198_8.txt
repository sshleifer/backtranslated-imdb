Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard's third film is worse than Hands In Table and Princess Comes All. It is still another shape to play Burlesque which appears to be known back in the day. The previous game Burlesque beat Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and is the role that Carole Lombard plays so Barbara Stanwyck came from Broadway which brought Hollywood. Nancy Carroll's version in the early days of the future and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version when My Child Smiles At Me. I really have a vinyl album of the radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler performed on the Radio Radio Theater. That's an exciting job, you believe. Any MacMurray and Lombard performs well with the old chestnut, the story is now installed in the night club where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet. See good performance with Dorothy Lamour as a Latin player who gets between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his first films as a wolf on to do with Lombard. Swing High, Swing Low holds very good today and I can't be surprised if we see again another version of Burlesque for the first twentieth century.
