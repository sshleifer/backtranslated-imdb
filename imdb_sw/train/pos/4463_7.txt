Recently looking for THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the desire to watch the music of many MGM music from forty-five years. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a smaller film than TOWN. The songs are not good, nor are the chemistry among the characters. But the film is very interesting for printing materials, such as Tchaikovsky. With the Hollywood Bowl area, with Sinatra and Kelly coming up from the top trees, and then taking the step, while several of the pianists play on the piano, it is the best place in the film, although the area that Kelly plays with Jerry Mouse is more popular. Traditional musicians will be known for the music that the pianists play. Sinatra then croons, "I fall for Love Easily," before you have an epiphany on her love. Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful and its mountains and air pollution (Can you think Hollywood in the twentieth century, except in the mid-1940s?!), And piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had the opportunity to build during sound like these.
