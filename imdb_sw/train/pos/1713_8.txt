This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol all seem very good. Soha very much reminds his mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born-born actor and will be raised a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. The way you fail to fail but if you are really thinking the truth, you realize that just the end of the wise was the end of the movie. Otherwise, it would be a great injustice for everyone. The movie is about a professional witness who comes a girl waiting to get married in court. His girlfriend cannot be shown and she has been helped by a witness. Slowly, on time, likes for it. It is not clear whether he has the same feelings for him or not. See the movie for full details. The movie really belongs to Abhay. I hope to see more movies from him. Soha is good but not very much on the film. His eyes, his innocence made a lot of talk.
