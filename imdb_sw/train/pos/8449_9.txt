I was a fan of the TV series "Kill: Life on the Street" at the end of the show, but it became a fan very fast. It was an indication of the distinction of any other: it looks different in its use of hand-managed cameras, taking the viewer anywhere, and casting all its forms and its distinctive and attractive features, and that they are covered with all the good and bad police departments , including corruption and humanitarian violence that escalates to the top. Killed: Modern, re-tracking series, is similar to the film made for television may be. After Lt Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), who is now the candidate for Baltimore mayor, is shot, members 'series' have come to help him find the killer. In addition, excluded members who left power with those who died, may also have their place in the film. The energy and fire that has returned to the series, and the script is full of the same fire that has been set. All in all, a great movie television. Vote: 9
