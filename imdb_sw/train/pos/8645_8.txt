I had seen this film many years ago and it had made my sense of permanence. Alas, I've been complicated by many films over the years and I did not expect to be 'Kalifornia' on looking again soon. I am happy to say that it is everything that is not stored and looks like it was ten or more years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that give this movie its potential. The first is cast. We have a serious problem with Brad Pitt as Grace Grace. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, as one of the longest heart of Hollywood's heart that has ever been, makes it easy to see him playing such a bad, odd one. Pitt draws a show without using a white-garbage cliche or parody, and manages to remain really awesome in the movie. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is the same as attractive as the Grace girl of sadness, playing character as a ten-year old old woman with experience of life of forty years old. Lewis can apologize (for his character's behavior in life) with contempt (because of his ignorance), but he does his work efficiently and the kind of trick that is not so much available to the young actor. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that Pitt and Lewis were not chosen for any prize for their exhibitions here. David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes both are completely thrown out as a yuppy couple who don't have the skills to cross the US and Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is very large and is not lost, and Forbes seems to be normal and fast, but all participants can show the change of their characters as they are very attractive, beaten and shocked by Pitt. <br /> <br /> to make a good and elegant seat seat aside, this film really catches us with the proverbial balls through its irresponsible pacing. At the time "Kalifornia" was released, Hollywood was offering the best-to-be-psychotic ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights'),' Running '' etc.). Many of these movies followed the form, the only distinctive nature of the relationship between the good man and the evil man. 'California' is not too lost for this area, but its first acts are a good example of a slow-boiling thriller, and we are taken to the edge of our seats waiting for a wave. /> <br /> When the penny stops, and Pitt is allowed to play badly, the film changes completely and the last twenty minutes does not last until the resting movie. That said, the action is thin and fast and the resolution is cool. The fighting is over, but scars will be there. <br /> <br /> Many details (made by whiny, before X-files Duchovony) are a contrived tad. In fact, it means to be from the book of the Duchovony journalist's book, so one can say that self-disclosure notes mean having difficulty in the style of style that most writers write. The film is a great achievement and certainly cut off more than 90% of the last twenty years. It is highly recommended, but not to the abdomen of the stomach or mind. This film bothers more than one level. But then, it means that.
