I love this film. It is a good film that combines English and Hindi cultures with feminine issues, such as girls who want to play games that were original for people. It shows a single Indian contest who wants to break out of cultural barriers and women who want to break out of gender-based barriers found in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that cultural struggle is more stressful than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike other views, I don't think this movie is something like Dancing Dry or any other chick flick. This action is preferred by many people, men and women, young and old alike.
