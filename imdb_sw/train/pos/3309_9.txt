This is a good film. If this is any sign, than Hong Sang-Soo is really a "hidden secret mystery of Asia". It is very similar to the Tsai Ming-Liang style and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and it covers most of the same places as clearly, but I think I enjoy this more generally than one of their films. The higher Minimalism is a little less than their work, although it is still quite suitable for the same style (the camera never gets one at a time), and somehow I have seen the film is not self-“slow” than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao -hsien, which I think is part of the reason I found it more. In addition, it does not cover these subjects as much as Hou did. I felt that the film was also more "completing" and less clear (just harder) than some of their jobs, although that didn't say it had anything similar to the ongoing plot. I would like to hard to believe that Sophia Coppola had no direct influence on this film for "Lost in Translation" (the events of a young woman surrounding him alone, losing in his hotel room wearing punk clothes can not help but seen skills) .
