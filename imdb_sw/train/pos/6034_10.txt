Last November, I had the opportunity to see this film on the Reno Film Festival. I must say that it was a lot of fun. A few technical errors aside, it was a good experience. I liked to write and act, especially from a boy who had a leading role. There is a lot of heart in this film, a lot of magic. I had the opportunity to talk to a few of the film authors after it was made, and they seemed to be very good. All in the whole movie was just a good experience, and one I'd recommend. The story was entertaining and cool, as a woman has gone through many troubles as a leading leader, and I could understand her problems for that reason. Movie has a great job to give us people we can sympathize with. Friends in the movies have written well, it's true. I know people like this, I just want Imy's friends and I can hear it as cool as these people are talking. The whole movie is just cool, I wish there was more film out like that. <br /> - Jayden
