The full cover of passengers is covered during the snow storm. Police have closed the bridge - they say they are safe and are caught on a little caf√© until the road is opened. However, over time, their patience has become a concern, for it seems that one of the passengers did not have the original on the bus and could be a stranger! This leads to a conclusion that is surprising but also rather funny in the bottom of the face. <br /> <br /> This is another part of the Twilight Zone. Instead of a general misconception or social definition, this does not have permanent features. However, it is also very much and it seems, so who cares? Certainly what happens you will need to see yourself. The way, this one star John Hoyt - the face that most of you will recognize from the past shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane at the same time), but the boy I love to see - as he perfect grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time.
