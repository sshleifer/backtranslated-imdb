To be honest, I didn't know what this movie was about when I started. That's how I look at the movies whenever possible. No infections. I thought this would be a movie about the stones in the forest or something. I was wrong, kinda. There was a kind of horrible first time but once it started to make it really closed. I know the feeling of being inserted into something else that you feel unable to do but do things you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but I beg to be different. These kinds of things happen. Sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world that nothing bad can happen and the situation is "implausible". Really sorry but the reality of the world is that they happen. The creator of this film together with the participants did a good job to show how things can only go bad and how people can make the worst choice. Sometimes things are good, sometimes they are bad and they are life. I recommend this film.
