I feel this is one of the best movies I have seen, I am an old man and I love more west. I like movies based on the least part of the truth, if this error is the movie. I also love movies of revenge, This deserves also in my opinion. Some of my favorite movie parts were the opening area with the beatings and buffet area. I felt that the corral area was a little but it didn't affect how I feel about the full movie. I saw what I think is continuing with this film in the smoke part of the gun. I also enjoyed it. I recommend taking the time to watch this film, I will look at it again. I also felt the romance of this movie was played well. I thought it wasn't characteristic for Randy Travis to play a kind of villain, but I always enjoy his acting.
