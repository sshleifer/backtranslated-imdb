This is a film that was suggested to me by my dentist, and I'm glad you did! The combination of British humor (I must say, Humor?) And the truth of the lost widow, the middle-aged trying to maintain her life was hoot. Adding to this combining the fact of what is needed to grow pot (the plants under the forest will not do without TLC's), and it is a hilarious film, still attractive. I laugh every time I close the vision of all the staff of the bar sitting in their lawn seats and sun glasses on counting lights! Maybe it's my blood of Mendocino County only, but Brits certainly got one right! 10/10
