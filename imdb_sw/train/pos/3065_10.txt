<br /> <br /> I liked this film very much. One of the most rare films that Hollywood is no longer worth. William H Macy It's just as good as a man who has been struck by a spirit, and Neve Campbell is a flat out as wonderful as a woman who puts her life through redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this film.
