I loved this film! Although it was not anything like books so it is still the style of Nancy Drew. I was seeing many advertisements for this film and since I was in the books of Nancy Drew I had high expectations for this movie and they actually met those expectations. All the characters were exactly how I did them to read books. I am so glad that I saw this film. All staff and practitioners did as they did as a series of book. Since I saw this film I wanted to read every book of Nancy Drew out there. All employees and artists went into their characters and certainly showed during the film shown on the big screen. In fact it seemed like all the participants and managers were actually in a position where the characters were in me definitely give this movie 10 out of 10.
