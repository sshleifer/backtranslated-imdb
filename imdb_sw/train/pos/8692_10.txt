I loved this. I did not know that it was part of a great series. I must have been 6 or so when it was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I was so passionate about something that was clear that it was in a bunch of prestigious masks. My parents had knocked off this TV when it first started on NBC. Tape even had an old Sanka coffee business with a few others. I plan to return home sometime soon and try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want copies can do so. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do that through the IMDb website feel free. I will keep them updated and let you know when I have a show in digital format.
