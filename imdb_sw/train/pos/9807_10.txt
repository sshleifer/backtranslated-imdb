I remember this series very well. It was very good - powerful and compelling characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from everything else to give in time - and now ... I am sure that it also inspired a good Canadian "Businessmen". The first 1 and 2 season are available on DVD 2 in the UK. It is a treat to look at the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 events and 2 season seems to be 10 times. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have stopped after 2 seasons. This series was very fun. Sometimes you can find it at Amazon.co.uk
