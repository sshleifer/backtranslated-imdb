I loved yet. Warren Beatty is just right as a hero of the comic book. What saves this film is set, awesome surprises and mediocre script pipes. I expected something greater in terms of action, or plot but I got very little. The main reason to watch this film is to look for the most starred in Hollywood at the same time in an unusual film. One person who did bad work and didn't even in this film was Madonna. She was not in this film and her work was very bad. The movie in some points just stand still. You expect something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino has a very serious dude and does well. He and Beatty make a good man and a bad person. It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman, and Warren Beatty in the film except Isthar. I didn't see Ishtar but I heard bad things. Something about this movie is good, but it would be better. I liked it as a child because I thought it was cool, and the movie was awesome, the sets are just wonderful, the text is just right, and for such a cast on the film I could expect better. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I thought exactly the finale was not big enough. It was surprising but with a very big film I thought it would have ended and a little more than a bang. The reason for viewing this film is atmosphere. The film only uses 7 colors of comic colors to make it all better to show it yet. <br /> <br /> Clothing and flowers were also meaningless. Makeup face for criminals was good. Beatty is not just a higher character than a lifestyle. Still, this is a good movie that can be much more. I am better than Batman, another book comic book that came out at the same time. Of course the movie was much larger for general terms.
