I have seen this film three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional. Acting is amazing, which is not hard to believe since it's the day of Daniel Lewis, who is an amazing actress. Brenda Fricker is a wonderful surprise in it, though. He takes your heart as a young mother with a disability, who cannot walk, or talk until his youth comes. I can't say good things about the movie, but I will stop here. I recommend to anyone who enjoys movies that focus on real events, or just enjoy a good drama in general.
