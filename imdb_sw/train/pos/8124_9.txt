In addition to the main movie of METROPOLIS, this is about the old movie of sci-fi. Sometimes the film is a little preaching and acting can be very broad, it's a good film for two reasons. First, it is quite original in style and content. Even in the 21st century, there is no film I can think of something like that. Secondly, in his time, special effects were quite amazing - using matte paintings, models and interesting to create amazing events of the post-stop world and tomorrow's great city. Sure, you can sit back and knock the film because, for today's standards, the effects are just so-so. But, you should be aware that this was a state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and should have a real audience. In many ways, the sets seem to remind you very much "modern cities" presented in 1939 WORLD'S FAIR. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think the movie is also interesting because it seems to burst and the question "is really people that are stupid or set to size?" The end result seems to be a bit of both! It's true! <br /> <br /> Remember to end: I saw twice on TV and just a moment on video. Three times sound and quality printing quality - especially sound. If this is available on DVD, hope is very clean and will provide free information. If the voice on the video continued to refuse, I would be accepting this!
