Imagine Pierce Brosnan and you think suave, dapper, intelligent James Bond. In this film, Brosnan has the opposite of the type - and has many fun doing it (such as the audience). This is a film about a hired killer who becomes a friend of the businessman who worked ... and works! <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable movie, with very beautiful scenes (riveting, Brosnan edge and beautiful, agreeing "off" Kinnear has good lines). My cavil alone is that Hope Davis, who plays oh-tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more often: she could be a wonderful foil for these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like matador: plays with listeners, while "going to kill". The end is surprising because the story of the story (positive morals!) Occurs: this is a free, fun and fun film, which deserves the audience.
