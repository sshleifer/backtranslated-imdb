Caprica (S01E01) period is done as a pilot. True, this part is the same content as the release of DVD experiments. That being said, part 01 provides a very important history of the famous series of "Battlestar Galactica" (both original and 2007). It is widely used for the 2007 series. If it is a sci-fi's late stadiums, this series looks at the life of "Virtual" or the environment. On top of this, we are given many background on the line of Adama family as well as their unknown and unknown (in the series of Battlestar Galactica) who created the Cylons. For the most part, this part of the first spinning the popular life story of "Virtual" and (as expected) early life of colonies, and the birth of Cylons. Most of all, I enjoyed this section. Although, it is not a new material for myself or anyone who has ever seen the DVD release of Caprica experiments, the series seems very promising. As with most fighters, section 01 leaves us with a hanger-so to ensure compliance with the audience (sci-fi community). I will surely go to look for solutions together with development. <br /> <br /> I offer these 8 star stars.
