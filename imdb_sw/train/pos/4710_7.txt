In addition to the popular films, there are few who have value and time. but for the recent shortage of bad parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and found again a funny farce like Johnny Class. When his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny is going to work for that group. What bags are a series of gags, which many work, there are, however, decreases constantly. But a foreign group that can not understand the American language (the evil of wisdom, at least), the rival gangster and the penchant to shoot his mouth off (... once!), Little Brother and D.A. who is out to find Johhny dangerous, and hot flames for his love Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, as every gangster-movie clich√© is skewered with talented writing and beauty writing. It's not perfect for a long shot, but it's really good for a bad smile.
