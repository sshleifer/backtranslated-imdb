Well these films climb. Make more suggestions. Gay or trouble doco great for anyone who loves film. Very interesting, sad and interesting. Never put it on. Great access. Filming with passion and interest in the matter. Some displays and just amazing. If you only get this film on VHS it is still important to watch. Great. 10 out of 10. I had to see a part of Doco's years about ten years ago and didn't understand what I was looking at. Interviews describe very much about egos of artists who are like heavy weight boxes trying to hit their way out of ghetto. The film manufacturer was considered to be the first timer so it achieved. Cool. Track down.
