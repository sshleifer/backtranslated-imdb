Kudos to Fawcett take on the roles which, at that time were taken by the complexity. In my memory, rape was still a modern phenomenon in the 1980s, and women's rights and feelings were not being investigated at the time. Fawcett is the only woman followed, then mentioned by James Russo actor. He is not enough if the psychopath is exposed, but sometimes it is clear. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a little role, such as Alfre Woodard as a home partner. Woodard worried about the legal consequences when Fawcett, a victim of rape, retaliates for the defendant. The area where he gives us a pot of hot oil in Russo is a classic, and if the opponent deserves it. Then he makes him a slave, and the result must be faced. The true story of the truth expressing the feelings and anger of victims of rape, physical, and mental. It is highly recommended. 8/10.
