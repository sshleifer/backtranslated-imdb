Live it <br /> <br /> Alive is a movie of SCI-FI entertainment from Japan. I have seen a lot of ambitious films that have been opposed to the first film of the director or his third Azumi film. I have heard that it is films and bloodshed with zombies and all kinds of goodies. In fact I went to a video shop to get Versus but I am alive to Alive. If you are looking from the end of the wall to the wall of the wall then it does not belong to you. There are a lot of steps however comes as paid for an entire hour of behavior that builds up-up. For the soul I think it is good and it's worth it. Certainly some of the conspiracy is silly as much as many of the SCI-Fi films and I think the heads that used an external foreign object can be replaced by parasites with great effect. This movie is brutal when it needs to have an unwanted heart to pray. They put the budget down and for the most part to close all the steps in one underground building (take a cue from the cube) but the film does not suffer for it. Another Bonus for this film is the sharp edge of the gothic which has been done by a great artistic flair during many Flashbacks and dream systems. Use this!
