This is a film I decided to go and see because I am a big fan of adult animation. I often find that the film does not work with a famous actor or actor but instead of a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art instead of showing actors the ability to vary its styles. <br /> <br /> This film is more fashionable than the story. I found a fascinating story (a fascinating story of a story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films), it was very difficult to follow sometimes, and you didn't feel like it all gathered as much as it could be. It is obvious that there is a mix of French animation and Japanese characters coming together. If that is good or soft it is for the viewer. Watching this film is treating it with eyes, and in this sense the work of art. <br /> <br /> If you would like an adult animation, or you would like to see a film that is different from many outdoor movies. I would recommend. All I can say is that I enjoyed the film experience but I came a little disappointed because it would be better
