I can't judge the movie because it works. There are enough film material to watch film film, but I think it's just in the group. Nothing is sinful in this piece, and that's where black things fail. Indeed, the disease can be considered bad, but I have a hard time seeing it. Film tips on the dark side: Blackie can be a human business, the New Orleans police are just ready to bind the author, the specter of the symptoms depends on all people in the movie ... but those are really just tips. There is no attempt to be made by the Reed arguments, like one of them to do with Marlowe or Spade, and there is no attempt to bring the human side to Blackie, which can make him even worse if human trafficking was out. The lack of depth is what fails the movie at the end. <br /> <br /> Stories are good, acting is good, text and direction It has been done well ... but nothing to do this film should come back regularly. It is worth looking at once, maybe twice if you remember it from years ago, and then remove it.
