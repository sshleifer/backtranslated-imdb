Gerard is a writer with a few ideas. He is also a gay and Catholic dependent on Catholic guilt and something of clairvoyant, or so it seems. On Flushing's trip he 'loved' with Christine. When she learns that Christine's new partner is a bit of a very bad business she has been loving from far away she decides to cling. After all, the practice of fornication has its compensation. He then knows that three of Christine's three men have died violently. Did Christine kill them and she is a boyfriend, Herman, will be a 'fourth person'? Verhoeven's favorite melodrama, is a mixture of Hitchcock's taste with David Lynch, full of OTT heroes and religious pictures with many red colors. It is often seen and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see is real or thought of Gerard's ideas. Fun is in making it out. Also the fact that Christine is the most beautiful character that can be interesting Gerard or Herman's meaning means we don't like roots for any of the men on it. In fact, it's okay to say that coming to Gerard is not coming soon. The great exhibition, also, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and the best film of Verhoeven to his amazing piece of sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
