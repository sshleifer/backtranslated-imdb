My children recently began to look at the references of this show - all the first events on N, and later on ABC Family - and they like it. (I did not know the show already declined the first or second season) I wish to know what caused all the changes - I have seen it described as "well-known," and still the half-hour search on the web does not reveal anything but endless comments on how early were better than later periods. (Personally, I do not see many variations - scripts and themes remain exactly the same - but they lose many people along the way) My daughter has put a DVD on its wish list, so maybe the country's specific features and definitions will give light on all of this. I also want to make a sense of self-reliance on change - such as "Coming Boy" where they give a little sister for a whole season or so, and when a different actor later shows a play with him, they ask where he has been and says "upstairs," or when a score The series of geek "Minkus" shows for the high school graduation, they ask where he has been and says "there," explaining the part of the class is not shown by the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and run the screens (Mr. Turner to be another character who lost) Oh well - maybe there will be really E story Hollywood on this or something? I was so happy to see Aunt Hilda pointing out for the end - she was always one of my favorites - it was so bad it would have never been reunited. (Zelda Candle not only denied)
