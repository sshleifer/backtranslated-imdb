I thought earlier that this film was a light of the Muppet film. I would now repeat those words. In my opinion now, the film's absolute brightness of MUppet was the movie TV IT'S AERLY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, Is it a beautiful life that has been terrible. MUPPETS IN MANHATTAN is not special, but more miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. The best songs are that 'You Cannot Take No Answer' song, that Muppet Makeup singing and songs for the great finale itself. As I loved the show of Muppet Babies TV, I liked the series of children of Muppet here (I am told that it led them to the children of Muppet's Children). for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in its last line 'What's the best way could end?'. But I would like to be what was at the beginning and the end was more entertaining. There are cute watos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great series of drums from Rizzo and Rats (choreographed by late, Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must say although MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER AND MUPPET Christmas CAROL is three of the MUppet movies describing.
