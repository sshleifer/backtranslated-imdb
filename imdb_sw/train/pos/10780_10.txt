In addition to my favorite favorite cartoon favorite Spielberg made, after Animaniacs. Even if that level was low, so what was, I enjoyed it and liked it, it was amazing and I loved her, any Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were inside and were just wonderful, cast for all there was a brilliant, especially story Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this cartoon again, it was amazing and joke was brilliant. I can also remember the time of the craft that the brain of the brain is in, you hear its voice and sound the sound of the PATB theme, which was just wonderful, I love it in those cartoons when it comes to coming. I would like this cartoon and Animaniacs to return, I loved them
