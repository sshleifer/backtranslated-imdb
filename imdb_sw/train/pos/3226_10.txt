I don't remember this film to get the freedom of movies here. I saw only when you got on the cable. The film deals with children's dehumanisation in killing machines. Particularly one person, the way he gets and throws (literally) in a distant society of the world where he finds himself unable to cope with the coming terms and who he is and he feels. It seems to me that many people expect this to be Rambo in space, and would be happy if it was. I'm sure it is' '' t - Kurt is doing a good job of expressing the emotional cripple. The place where he sits outside the compound shows this, although the decision of two replays slower prevents from now. This is not an ordinary SF movie through which Bladerunner, Alien, Running, Run for Logan or THX1138 were, however unfortunately almost I have seen it for a long time. It turns on the film to a reliable level, does not know Arnie one of the joints, it doesn't have to be a Snake Plissken and there is no sustainable end to happiness. That's why this film did'nt do well. It did not follow the form, and among the 18-25-year-old viewers of the United States, it was not forgiven as it was what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <br>> Always.
