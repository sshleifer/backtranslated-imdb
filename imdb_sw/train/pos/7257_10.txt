The reason I say this is because I wrote a screenplay and I knew little about being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote to other producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I had to hear about it. I just wrote the first draft so I was worried when I heard that it was down. I asked Peter Collinson, for my agent, if he would like me to make another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost. I was told, it's too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and I gave my name. I didn't know the idea they could do on my screen. Then I was invited to see the completed film. I was so surprised that I quickly prayed for my name to come back. It was a well-made piece, from the first draft quickly, I expected to be asked to work more on it; Maybe if I would be not very good. I'd like to see my original script if anyone knows where? I would also like to see the film again, I saw it immediately on a small show at Soho.
