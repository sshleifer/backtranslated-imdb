I started riding soon, and, if anybody ever had to come in, know, I love horses and their world. I lost the Spirit with a blow, trying to get my life full of horses related to the horse as I could, and I was surprised by the results. What I expect is a Disneyesque movie that has a good feeling with animals to talk and displays every five minutes. I found it an amazing film, full of beautiful themes and animation, and an amazing story that has great potential to attract a person's heart. <br /> The Spirit is a wild Mustang in West-West, whose whole world brings around under it when it gets human beings to take it slowly over its land. The story continues with many types of characters, some people, other animals, all written well and many enjoy looking at the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good news, and who has thanks to history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel important, is that animals in this film do not talk. It was a great holiday from Lady and animation movies that everyone used.
