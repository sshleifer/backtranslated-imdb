And that's how great TV comedy has started! It has been 12 years since the very first part but has continued with the same spirit until last season. Because that's where “Friends” depend: on certificates. A wonderful situation takes place among six friends who never give up our hearts: Let's say a great thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! In our first encounter, we see how Rachel tells someone (church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for "perfect man" (no perfect man, why do you women take care of?), And how your marriage can destroyed when a lover of your life realizes that he is a sex. Until we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the following periods ... ENJOY FRIENDS!
