I just want to come back to Jedi, being led by someone else, I mean, there is so many pictures, they don't even need it. Apart from this time our heroes seem to be different people: Princess Leia has never fought with Solo, Luke looks strong, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda just dies. But there are many wonderful things to go to this period that I just can't hate. 1 / JUSTICE 1- JAPAN BACKGROUND 1- Jump of Sail Bar attack. 3-King (now bad) 4- The Speeders after the endor forest. 5-final battle. 6-Location of the illusion of darkness. 7-Return to Anakin on a good side of power. 8- And the last celebration. Some of these are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some events were cut, and another director was hired, this would be perfect as part 4 and 5, but it's still amazing. 9 out of 10.
