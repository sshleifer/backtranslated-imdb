Failed not a great TV show in history, but not far. It has no plot or character of the West Wing or perhaps even an early ER, however, it is clear that it shows more of the continuous and everything. I love the way I can't guess what will happen. I would like to tell the stories of the characters that often provide for new tests for us to see. In other ways I want the show will live forever, but I think they can get a 6-7 season from them before they finish on top of glory. The combination of characters and their nationality as well as demonstrating the balance of moving back and developing so expanding dead characters "life spans" all adds to a strong feeling that this show is something different from what we used. Happily, surprising and (here are some small ideas for all of you who build a plot) more than a brief interaction - keep this web chat going ...
