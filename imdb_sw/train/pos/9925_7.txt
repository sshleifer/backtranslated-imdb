When I rent Domino I was expected to be very dumb. I hate films that have flashy films and movies and Domino are also very bad reviews. The only reason I looked at it was because I love Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, and Tony Scott sometimes. I am also relaxing only according to the legendary story of adventure. Yes, editing and movies were furious, the story was weak, and acting was not good, but I still loved this film for other reasons. Domino was very entertaining and very often. It was very scary when it was released I think because everyone wanted an emotional journey like Scotts last film Man on Fire and instead just got an incredible entertainment. I really understand why everyone hated Domino very much, although I loved and recommended it.
