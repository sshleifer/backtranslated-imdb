Mario invited to the castle of Princess Peach for a cake. When Mario comes there, he sees that Bowser has kidnapped him! Mario must save again that day. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore whatever he wants. He can just around, plant trees that try to look 1-ups, get hidden in the levels, and more. You can spend four hours at the same level. There are no time limits. There is a 16th world, with several stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter the stars of these stars, you must go through action and fight Bowser at the end of the action. To get a certain world, you need several stars to enter. You enter the world through color. There are many things to do with many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone can love this game. It's good. The theme of this launch is a game that used gamers to be N64 will have a good life. Each 3D game form we know has something similar to SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are models that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have N64, you buy this game. It's hard to get used, because no one sells this baby for 5 bucks in a pawn shop. 10 perfect.
