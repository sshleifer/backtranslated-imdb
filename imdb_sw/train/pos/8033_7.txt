Zane and Beringer will put you on the edge of your seats. I don't usually go for military / war movies, but this was worth my time. It was bad, but it was also exciting. Beringer's behavior proved to be heroes and honest. No matter what, you know that he has your back. Zane's behavior was developed in the film. She was not just a suit, she definitely showed that she could be a hero and handle the gun. Finish through me a little bit however. It didn't go with the whole film, but I'm glad I saw it, however. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking out.
