Little Little Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (despite being just on TV) is very good. I wasn't very careful with the differences in appearance or accents, so I can't comment on that. Acting in this was very good I needed to stretch myself and say "Remember, it's just a movie, this DIDN` T REALLY HAPPEN". When I was sitting and listening to Harris and Quinn talk, I knew what it was John and Paul would be talking about if they had this meeting. The sentiments and scourges from John were similar to his character (especially in the restaurant!), As was his depression when Paul was very simple and quit. All the workers did a good job and I was glad to see this film. It's a bad experience for any fan of Beatles. And prepare for a few surprises!
