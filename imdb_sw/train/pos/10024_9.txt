There are many things to fall of Aro Tolbukhin. In the mente del asesino (Inside the thought of the killer), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this film is like practice in movies but in fact, it has been very successful. Made with super 8 shots, black and white, 35 million, colors, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a film that made a document or a viceversa, which is the only thing that leads to a question that leaves you wondering, do you? Has he ever been? The movie follows the future of the Hungarian ship arrived in Guatemala, worked in religious religion and then killed other people. The act he was arrested and the death penalty was sentenced. The movie started because some French document got interested in this character so that they interviewed before his death. Nowadays, more people are involved in conducting a detailed study of behavior. The one we witnessed the movie. <br /> <br /> For the main part in history we are guided by the slow phase of going into the Aro's mind, especially to understand why he did what he did. However, the important thing is that filmmakers do not get one-side view; They left the decision for all of us and even if we could understand his actions, we would certainly never justify them. Therefore, the first half depends on the information to remember; things later turn into Aro's childhood, and give a movie as a new power of wonder (even hard never existed weak or itself). so the only thing left to say is that if for any chance you get this film around you, I believe, the trip to see is more than deserving.
