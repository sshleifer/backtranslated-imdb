This is a long time (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it was the famous author of Pearl Buck in it. In other words, a lot of lands to cover. It was a soap-frequent but it had a certain time of photography, too, was hit by a locust attack at the end of the film. That was amazing to see. Focusing on this film is about 70 years old, the staff of special effects on this film performed amazing work. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award winners in their day and did not make fun of it here, all giving a powerful exhibition. The only problem is trust as all Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, don't have a real look. I would like to see this film again with all Asian actors, not because of PC but just to make a look story and sound more reliable.
