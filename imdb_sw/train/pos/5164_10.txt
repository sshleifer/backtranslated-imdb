I attended Camp Chesapeake. It was at the head of the Chesapeake Sea on the North East River in MD. It was a kind of summer summer and cabins. Founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young boy and later became Junior, Adult Advisor and later, the Waterfront director. If the camp continued, I would do anything within my capacity to become a camp director. The power of YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the MD. I visited the old camp several years after the boat and I was worried about ignoring the MD situation and the natural damage to the nature of the mother. The 350 acre site served many and all the benefits of communicating with natural offerings. A black man named Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and keepers. Lord Curtis was my friend and counselor. I despised everyone. Even if he could not swim was a waterman. If I asked where the fish were playing, he could show the place, and I would have a ball. Ther was also a Camp camp at the end of summer. These records will be with me forever.
