This amazing flick from "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad has some of the most amazing events they witnessed in a TV film. In addition, one can predict the most results from going. However, it is a small enjoyable movie that works: it enters. That's all it meant to do and it does. Stunts and blast are fun and exciting and plot is not half bad. Acting is also a respect, which is not very surprising, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of a variety (and the "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will surely like this. If not, don't waste your time. 8/10
