Be honest I watched this film just because of my pubert needs. I mean, I couldn't find women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old) so I thought the look of Elvira was something in the cell for sex. I came to have a good time with this classic ritual about comedy fears, Halloween parties, sassy humor, and some evil displayed by Elvira. They just don't make movies like this again ... It had a sense of amateur effort mingled with the night's talk show to show a fashion show. The fact is that you have produced a lot of fans because of humor and ability to do with Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is a classic which reminds us of the beautiful American Up Night All.
