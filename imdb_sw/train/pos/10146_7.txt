As we all know the romantic comedy is the type and end known. Twice leads always to be together. Later in the third act I was trying to figure out how this would close and how to end up together. The clue was given from the beginning, but you will never realize until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It was in order to keep many common places, but it takes a new spin whenever possible. I liked all the NY characters and I liked places. It's a NY card. It was also good to watch movies and not get anything wrong in it. So, if you like a good old movie romantic film ... then this is for you.
