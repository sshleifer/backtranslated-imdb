Etienne Girardot is just an actor of character - the kind of people who almost never knew by name. However, he again plays the coroner - one of the actors only in the Philo Vance film which played his role more than once. I've seen him two times and loved him all the time because he was so nice and fresh air. This film is also nice to look for in addition to Girardot, there are many wonderful actors for the trip - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is an amazing throw, and indeed they did a simple job by leading a man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. These high-quality artists are one of the main reasons I like these old B movies. While the secret itself is very rare, because of the writing and refusal in a pleasant voice, these films are enough. For this film, Vance is played with wonder and Lowe but, as I said, the secret itself is the concept of post - for a silly program involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't cheat anyone to do anything like that - I have a training in clinical hypnosis and if I can do anything like an evil person can do in the film, I would do! Used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have clear goals! Overall, while not the best Philo Vance film, it was very good and it is a shame to lose Lowe just played this role once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five), the series was blocked by long and long-term supporters such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) play Vance. This is the same problem which also condemned the Bulldog Drummond series - the most active players who play. It is good to watch and exciting - though it is also impossible.
