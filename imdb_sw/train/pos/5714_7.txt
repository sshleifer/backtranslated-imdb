I was so excited to see this film because I had heard it was very frightening. What is interesting about it is that the Japanese film decided to bring America, but actually did it in Japan with the original staff! I think this has made the film ... more Japanese (which is probably why it has been successful to vary the opposite of a lot of Japanese-to-horror movie flops film) but also has made it impossible for the American audience. The difference in what causes Japanese culture and what harms the culture of the Americans felt in the film. This worked well when they meant to capture the fear of the main character: the fish of fear in a large, busy, unknown pond in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> Story story was also controversial too. In a typical Japanese style is very complicated and combining. The beginning of the film is true in the middle of the story and from there we move every day forward and back to the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. Continuing on time was a very controversial issue for me. Also, I didn't think some things were explained well and I needed to ask my friend to explain to me (he had already seen it, with a sequel which seems to show more information). Overall, there are many of the US viewers to love, tons of photo details and romantic text generated by health events.
