I didn't know when I heard this news. I was thinking how dumb is Disney to get. I was wrong. I found it very good. I mean not the King of Lion but it's cool to see the other side from a certain point. It was very funny. It was also not one of these corny sequels that was an animation, it was like the animation of the King of the Lion. The only thing that has missed me is any movie cinema through the movie. It's not giving anything but you will know what I'm talking about. I am also happy that it was cold to have more cast from nature to return. It was the most beautiful movie.
