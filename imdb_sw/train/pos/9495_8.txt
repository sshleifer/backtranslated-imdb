Huge degradation and wonder for humility 80 exploitation, hooray! Opening opening events provide a false impression that we are playing an interesting and disruptive game, but you need to be afraid for ten minutes later we are up to our necks in the chains of chains, fist fight, lurid discussion and dirt free! Bo and Ingrid are two brothers who have no extraordinary and very close relationships. What? Can you imagine playing with a towel that covers your sister's body and then looking at its unwanted organs for a few minutes? Yes, Bo does that for his sister and, judging by her laughter, she doesn't care. Sick, dude! However, if the children fled from Russia with their parents, but the strong soldiers were killed by the mother and father. The friendly striker kept them, however, and even raised him and taught Bo and Ingrid in the barriers of professionals. When the real plot goes away, 20 years later, it faces their final efforts as a fire of the historic Fire and a very valuable value in the mine. Very few things in life made for lesser meaning as the plot and the story of the story "White Fire", but it is certainly a great pleasure to see. Often you don't have a clue that strikes you or why (and I bet bet the understandable even less) but nothing! Violence is very strange and every single effort of the plot is to lose it. Script goes to total maintenance over repair when suddenly? and I do not reveal why? Bo needs a place for Ingrid and Fred Williamson to enter the area with a big mouth of his mouth and his black toes on the inside prostitutes. Bo's main opponent is a Italian Chick and a big milk but a destructive force, the original but interesting theme has at least several times in the film, there is a project of "we're-falling-in-love" and loads of other attractions ! My God, what a wise experience. The original title of French describes itself as “A Life of Salvation”, which is the most suitable because it makes a lot of insight like all the film: No!
