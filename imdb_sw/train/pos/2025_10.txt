Anne Brontes epic novel IN WILDFELL HALL should learn and read in schools and libraries and living rooms. His wonderful story and describes the "true" truth about drunkenness and destroying marriage and mother fighting to prevent her son and her cruel husband. It is similar to today's stories we see and hear and I believe people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the practical experience of the author who was behind the 1840s. I'm sure Anne himself would be happy with the way produced. <br /> <br /> Best and beautiful places.
