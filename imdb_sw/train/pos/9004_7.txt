I was skeptical about another story of love where people with disabilities find meaning and liberation through honest communication. And it's still not on my list. But the exhibition from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh with an example, close to amazingly, and save this for another player of tears. The Carter's manifestation of the victim of ALS is strong, perhaps even increasing in other times (sometimes his conversation includes unknown mutterings). But the overall effect is interesting and rewarding. Branagh can be a perfect compliment for its performance. <br /> <br />
