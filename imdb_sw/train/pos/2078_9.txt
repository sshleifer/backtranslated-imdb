This film film Pearl S. Buck is very common. The real epic of Hollywood, has all the elements of the famous Hollywood film which has: Reproduction, death, happiness, sadness, exciting, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that puts me in. I know it was a sign of the times, but there are no two main characters playing with Asian actors. Paul Muni was a good actor, and he does a good job like Wang Lung, the owner of the farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. He even look at Chinese! I think he tried to get a chance, but should put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Mrs. Rainier is very good at the film, but they did not try to make her "real". Stillm is a good film, especially if you are reading a book (I did in high school, a few decades ago). Its must see, just look more cast. I think you can.
