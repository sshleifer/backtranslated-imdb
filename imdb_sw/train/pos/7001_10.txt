I've never commented on the film before. I watched this film with my girlfriend last night. I have read the comments saying this film stays with you. It takes. It has been around 24 hours and is still quite affected. This movie has left me questioning myself. How can I compare myself with behaviors like Ben who does not really. I loved this movie. I love movies that protect me and think it is surprising to the end. I feel two emotions largely, happy and sad. Modern feel good and very sad. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but at the end, they were, forever. If you haven't seen this film, find and watch it. Make sure you have no restrictions. You will need to see every creature in this picture. One to my library.
