"Batman: The Secret of Batwoman" is about as entertainment as Batman movies found. Even though it is still true for the comic books, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in animated series. Bruce Wayne looked like he had before, but now he looks very little. Dick Grayson Robin has been transformed by the youngest, the youngest of Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, gives the voice of Batman better than many living practitioners. Kelly Ripa did the most beautiful work of sound than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the life of Batman, films live or die according to the quality of criminals. All my dear time, Penguin, is here. Its design is sleeker than it was previously seen, listening more to images of Meredith's Burgess '60' than the image of Danny DeVito's 'Return to Batman.' David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the sound of Penguin. The penguin is finally portrayed as a modern maneuver, as is commonly seen in the community. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane who is remembered more than a forget-off version in "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a secret to solve, put "Detective" back in "Comic Detective" (that's what "DC" stands, after all.) The revolution is a secret twist sneaky. > <br /> Scores add to the mystery of the film. It looks like a combination between symbols from "Poirot" and a logo from "Mission: Impossible." All in all, it is more entertaining than your average cartoon.
