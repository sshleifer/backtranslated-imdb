It is rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy which is not so interesting in short doses in the whole movie (eg Big Wedding Greek wedding; I, Myself & Irene). There were just a few unwanted jokes in this film, nothing was caused. All around, it was a good movie with the interesting characters. I thought that end was limited. It feels like they should end on a series of world with a real finish of bang up. Acting left a bit desirable, but it was created with the speed of the story. If I knew it was a brother's Farrelly movie I would like to have a belly to turn a piece of garbage and not look at it, but it seems that they are even able to make it a movie accident. Good to them, I hope they remove their heads out of the way and start regularly making a good film.
