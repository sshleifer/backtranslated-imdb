People expect not less brilliant when Steven Spielberg leads the movie, and this movie is not different. Some movies I like do not work well at the box office but, I'm glad to say, this film is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, which I don't think is bad at the time). The characters were excited, the animation was clear and non-fuzzy, and music was modern, too, which is typical for animation film. I did not think Professor Screw Macho or "Scary Cirus" was also scary for young children (targeted audiences for this film), but I thought what happened to a creepy professor at the end was very dark for children 'movie. In general, this movie is a fun and fun classic that I have enjoyed for many years.
