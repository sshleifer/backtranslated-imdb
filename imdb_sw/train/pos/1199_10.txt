This is a very good and excellent performance that Robert Taylor has ever given. It even passes her amazing performance as "Johnny Eager" coming 14 years after the film. His appearance is still amazing to see, but he is now mature that gives him an obstacle to this role of anger, responsibility. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the end of his birth, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His wild assassination of buffalo is not only human but it is a stunning look. In fact it is a man alone, he needs people around him, but he does not like it because of his social behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick to hunt, and he just keeps, because he is a failure of anything else. On the way Charlie kills the Indian family and capture Debra Pagent beautiful. Charlie tries to deceive her for nothing, but finds that Sandy is also interested. Granger is a kind of sad look, so fed and hunt, and the desire to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drinking skin is amazing with its prudent cracks and play for the accordian. Russ Tamblyn plays half-maternity trying to fit in the white world. The group is a wonderful mix of good and good, young and old. Finally Taylor gets destroyed by the buffalo, as many hunters before him, and runs off to stop Sandy and the girl. After returning, that night Sandy leaves with a woman, putting Charlie away and killed in an effort to get a sand and have a girl herself. The final struggle comes in the storms of the snow and the last area is so incredible that you never forget. It's a Taylor film all the way and was a real actress of that period.
