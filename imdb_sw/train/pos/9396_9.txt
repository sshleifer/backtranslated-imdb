In any number of films, you can find Nicholas Cage as a powerful hero, silent, Dennis Hopper as a maniac of murder, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp, and late, cried J.T. Walsh as heavy. These types of these tasks can play in their sleep, and they have done so often enough to see them playing with them again on the cliche. Therefore, it is a pardon that John Dahl, a master in getting a lot of emotions out of a little bit, inspired this exciting noirish thriller. The hopper manages to stop over, Cage shows a little more detail than its ordinary ordinary heroes, Boyle is by converting sultry, innocent, and planning, and one finds the meaning of the hard metal soul between his character, Wayne. The direction of Dahl provides a sense of a weak state of the Sky where the story takes place while also being too close to show how the surface of the wrinkled can show a great change of plot in the shop. The pieces of the conspiracy are high, and one of the most important aspects of this film is that some of the real helpers act as if they have intelligence. It is not often that small actors like deputy members are more intelligent than their head heads. But with the director as smart as Dahl, you should be surprised by the understanding of anything connected to this film. The best modern.
