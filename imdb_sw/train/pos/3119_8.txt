"Ultimatum of Bourne" begins without considering in the middle and in the blowing style that emerges from there like Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, very good) he follows under the back of the black-ops of CIA-ops that turned it into a perfect killer in a final attempt to learn identity his true. David Strathairn as demolished as "the back of the veil" is added to the frequent return including Joan Allen (better) and Julia Stiles (absent) <br /> <br /> As a second entry into the series, I wanted Paul Greengrass' shaky's camera will go down for a few minutes to decrease. However, that being said, it is a perfect way to capture time, a sense of claustrophobic of scenes close to hand-hand combat and similar work in tracking scenes that are on the feet and on the roof and constantly pressing a big pile-up. The fun section of Bourne's series is a regular world-walking and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to contradict the laws of physics and current capacity. Bourne movies appear to be in some form of truthfulness that is full of technological magic. It is not appropriate that everyone seems to be in a good place at a good time, but I will be damaged if not a blast to get there. The absence of emotion and involvement of Franka Potente, authors try to integrate emotionally between Damon and Stiles, but he is an actor with an empty face and causes nothing. However, this can be forgiven, in conjunction with "Identity" and "Majority", this "Ultimatum" reveals all and ultimately we learn the truth about Bourne's back. It is an enjoyable and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have a good sense, and Damon gets its desire, this will be its perfect end.
