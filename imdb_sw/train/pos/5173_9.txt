I often see a film I have been involved with; this was one of them. It had a good job, discussion, conspiracy, and environment. I laughed loudly, especially in the kitchen area. Comedy slapstick made by the contribution of the daylight was I was one floor, but I admit that I am a sucker for slapstick. The story dealt with a 30-year-old group when they returned to the summer camp they had attended 20 years earlier. It was a weekend of the camp, if the place was closed permanently at the end of the season. As an adult camp seemed different, and they felt different about it and each other. I recommend this exciting, moving movie. <br /> <br />
