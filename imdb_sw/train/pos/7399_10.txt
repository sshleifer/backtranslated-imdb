My choice for the greatest movie ever was used to be "Night Hunter" of Laughton which remains good in my magazine. But, it may be made by "Shower" which is a modern movie of Daoist I saw. The way of caring for others is represented by the water around it, and the way water can be made, and comfort, and purity, and etc. is the essence of Dao. It is possible to claim that the theme of NOFTH and Shower is the same, and that Lillian Gish in the past represented a clean type of Christianity as the bathhouse operators represent the pure form of Daoism. I can in no way dispute that argument. All movies are happy to see in their cooperation of the idea and image. However, Shower offers an uncertain view of the holiness of everyday life that I provide a nod. I respect both.
