The Pickup of Samuel Fuller on South Street is bad: the movie "Red Scare" without hysteria, where the Communist threat is nothing more than McGuffin that convinces the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark removes the free woman Jean Peters of her bag with a microfilm line; unidentified to any of them, it preserves vital secrets for the Cold War. Peters, as it was, was under surveillance by FBI agents who were not engaged in theft as a runner, comsymp frightened Richard Kiley. In trying to find a valuable film, both sides seek the help of Thelma Ritter, an old roadwoman who is always and willing to sell what she is getting. <br /> <br /> Fuller comes from a powerful palette of tempos and disappointment in telling a story, which becomes a race against an hour of increasing violence. From the highway to the front of the water, his middle Manhattan takes a sweaty sweat that is very close. The love ceremonies between Peters and Widmark have been mixed with the bidding of bidding and tender tenders, and standing for "Again," a song brought by Ida Lupino on Road Roads, also by Widmark star. The action reduces the suitable Ritter written and played - in the middle of the most vignettes of pain in everyone, and the type of mirage-oasis in the emotional fatigue. This is the author / director of Fuller's sole work in the most severe nightly constraints; His future observation of the American disease (Kimono Crimson, Kiss Naked, Underworld U.S.A) did not occur as previously as satisfactory as Pickup on South Street.
