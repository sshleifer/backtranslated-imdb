Dwight Frye steals the show in this as a stupid boy (who seems to have a mental disability) who is responsible for the murder of a vampire especially after revealing his love for bats that he likes to have a stroke and giving it to uncertain friends as 'gifts' ! In addition to all of this, there is a story of secret entertainment involving the above-mentioned murder. Despicable.
