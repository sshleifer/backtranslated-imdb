This feature of independence, B&W, DV is constantly buzzing, surprising and exciting with its ability to create more serious conditions and then get humor and interest in them. It is all things that are hilarious and ignorant, but it is not surprising that many films should be, there is a heart and truth here that puts the film, putting it all around from stimulating to full sluggish and there true message here. This film is about how we all live in the world has become mad. That seems to be the heart of the film. Since it is insane and far from the wall as it gets, Leon, aged 30-year-old, is always trying to put it together. He is like a child ever trying to catch a balloon that floats off so that everything will be a good job, so that everyone can have what they want. The work in the film would go off on top but the cast usually continues to form part of the piece. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the group here and the performance that shines through its tics of incredible disease. As the characters in the film do, we are looking at his sudden sudden to see the real person down. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a real professional here. He takes a great deal of ignorance and puts them real. It is its script and cast it to which it helps to keep anything. It is a true covenant for the knowledge of Majkowski and all that link to this film, as well as plot plot and characters, never never makes our nerves. Majkowski has taken a film that would have led and ignored, and somehow gave heart and humor. This is a special film. You don't have to miss. <br /> <br />
