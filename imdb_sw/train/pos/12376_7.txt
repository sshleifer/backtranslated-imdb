Enjoying all the stars is so interesting that it looks like "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of the horrible pictures, "Sentinel" (1977) is still an amazing film based on an unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, she has a model of style, Alison Parker, who goes to the Brooklyn Heights gun which is (and I don't think I'm giving away from this late date) very near the entrance to hell. And as a tenant in this building, he suffers a worse condition than fishing pipes and water bugs regularly, making it gently! Indeed, the area where Alison meets its neighborhood apartment is really terrible, and certainly should send ice water under the muscles of many viewers. Despite many complaints of critics about the potential of rainwater, I thought he was very good, more than joining Was Gard Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture creates an effective conclusion, and although some points of the plot are explained, I was left to hear more than content. As well as the book "DVD Delirium" that says, "any film with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as an elite non-competent elite cannot be bad"! In the side magazine, yesterday I walked to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to see the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and though the hard of his heavy coat of ivy and the blindness of blindness / nun in the top-floor window, looks the same as it did in this picture. If this house does not sit on the door of hell, I take it to hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we of New York know that for a while!
