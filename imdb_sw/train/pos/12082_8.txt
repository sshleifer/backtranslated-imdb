After watching this film with power on the testing of consultants I was very happy. Although it is clear the bottom budget, bears the sign of wisdom. For example, when Julia goes into a strange house and checks out the window I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation could be enhanced and the outside shot took into account her face and then moved back to include a house and a place. And behold, behold! The next area was the last shot of the house standing alone on rock on the edge of the water. There are other examples of how the clever director can raise his film with the thriller thrill. Savvy viewers will certainly see them but they have to make sure they don't want to. <br /> <br /> About the exhibition, George Macready is the most irritating person, cannot maintain its stability while demonstrating the potential of unrestrained violence. I have Foch was awesome as a girl who does not know to present without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, he even doubted to me the eyes and believe he can overcome his evil plans <br /> <br /> This real diamond in the worst and not to lose.
