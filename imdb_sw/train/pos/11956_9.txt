I would like to say some of the shades of Hitchcock ... this is better than MMM, which looks like a pleasures of guilt and some if not most of the Woody fans. By the way, do you? Do you know that Annie Hall was the first conceived as a mystery of murder? However, Woody receives some importance in this interesting film. The turn tools are good and stable. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some actors are very little to give their lines, but stick around. Scarlett Johansson affirms well in the role of Diane Keaton, and at any time there is no time to be concerned between her and Woody's greatest. No one can focus on the most perfect actor for Peter Lyman's position than Jackman.
