It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically I think it's a comedy on a drunk drunk foe who loves to love a girl (younger) poor, whom she wants to marry at the risk of being rejected by her family. <br /> <br /> It has a funny time, romantic time, and time it touches. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes its self-pleasing character, Liza Minelli is a foil of inducing as the opposite of attracting it, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It is a corny but very enjoyable with a memorable voice, and run for almost 3 months in our domestic fleapit.
