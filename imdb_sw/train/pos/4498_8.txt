Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen And Robson Green! Wow, it's a trio ... Well, so this is not Anna Karenina, but it's a beautiful story of love, well written and well done with all. Even a few 'laughing' sounds mixed with a very good study on honesty, age, and aging for parents / Alzheimer's issues. Quirky guitar songs are added to the story too. When I have been a fan of Mrs Annis' since 'Lillie' (in 70 years) and Mr. Kitchen since 'Buccaneers' and' Enchanted April ', I've recently won Mr.. Green ('I and Mrs. Jones', 'Touch the Evil', etc.), makes me ask a question - why didn't I see 'Could' until recently? More than 'flick flick' than someone will sit, it is perfect for seeing rainy daylight.
