I can't lie, this is a good movie. I saw about four months ago in my theater. I saw it a second time, and I was very tired on the slow scenes. Sid (sloth) is not all pleasing, but Diego (mountain lion, I think) is very good in the movie. Animation is the best, and the story has the end of touch. It is worth taking 10 children and less, but young people might find something sad. Also, the only in the characters is very interesting. As I said, it's a very good movie, but I'd rate the "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" of the top. 8/10
