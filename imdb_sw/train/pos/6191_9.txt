It looks like Hal Hartley films are kind of hit or missing by many viewers. This film will not be discriminated against the law. Fay Grim acts as the goodwill of Hartley 'Henry Foole' in 1998. This goal is on Henry's former wife (played in full with Posey Parker always welcome), who is pestered with CIA goonies about Henry's book published about all of the activities its shade. In the short term of all, Fay approaches odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc.. The film does not get a little less than the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is one that shouldn't be. For the first Hartley presenter who has just heard about his films, you might want to watch his original films before taking this (especially if you haven't seen 'Henry' yet). I enjoyed the camera work, which once reminded some of the early photos of Man Ray.
