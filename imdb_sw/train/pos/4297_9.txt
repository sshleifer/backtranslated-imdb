Every now and the filmmaker brings the life of a special group of people and enables you to see things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did this again. I have always seen the Bg Rock was his old age and has been able to do again at Grand Canyon. We always find ourselves when we have the opportunity to choose life and we often beat it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of the choice. The juxtaposing of small and large events that enables us to see how basically small things that worry about are really confident. I have watched this film several times and I am surprised at how deep it feels through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline are doing their roles with great sympathy and effectiveness of Stever Martins to implement the film is very valuable. Thank you also Mr. Kasden
