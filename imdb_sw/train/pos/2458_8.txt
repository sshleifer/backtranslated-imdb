When I sat on the movies I had a cool climate and I had no plan to change. But this movie is a great power. I had a sweat and I needed a shower later. So what do we have? Theoretically coming to the old story of a little Turkish girl who lived in Copenhagen, Denmark. It came to my mind recently that the conspiracy seemed as planned from "Piga as Beckham", where we had a Indian girl playing soccer and destroying her sister's wedding. Here we are transferred to a Turkish girl destroying her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we have the story of love and competition of course, too. After accepting this, this was an exciting, emotional and expressing Kung Fu good (not expert, though). Semra Turan's leading actor is not only a Danish female but also provides excellent performance, so it seems to be safe to assume that we have a natural sense here that we consider that this is his first movie and that he has no education as an actor. Some of the cast are the same, good camera, Kung Fu strict. Sidenotes: - A Turkish audience showed respect so that they could do the right thing. - The audience began to beat when our heroine finally fought to attack the boys who were making a big deal with their brother for revenge. - Xian Gao, the Chinese teacher of Kung Fu / actress (The Secret of Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the master of the role of leadership / guides to do this, perhaps you will have experience nice and powerful and I don't know if this works on small screens too
