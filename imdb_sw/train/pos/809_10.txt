Very good movie. Modern sci-fi film and humor, action and everything. This movie offers a large number of visitors. We see the leaders of the Rebellion Rebellion and a lot of Imperial forces. The king is the original character. I loved Ewoks which somehow represent the natural and Vietnamese damage. (Good references) I loved a flower between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In the Jedi Return, the epilogue of the first trilogy falls on and the Empire finally falls. I also thanked the victory ceremony which fulfills the redemption of Vader and return to the spirit of Anakin Skywalker with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives sadness and tears. Great scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader Returns King. Luke looks and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version is not Hayden Christenssen). The best part is when Luke strives to return to Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a great part of this film though there is a good end. I felt there was much more than facing the eye. And like John William's music you will bring classicism into the Wars Wars world.
