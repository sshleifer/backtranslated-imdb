Pull the car from the mirror, someone plays someone else's latest song, someone else did not comment, according to the high voice. I just wonder how it was done. There were so many events in this film that I wondered about how the camera came. As the incidents where Warhols came down after the BJM party is actually then it was an indirect exploitation for max, if not, then it was a general formulation, or a way that made me worried, if that was the purpose? All the way through this film I kept wondering how the picture came. Taken to the value of the face, beautiful images of genius (tortured) we all believe ourselves to be.
