Facing the movie, this film is increasing. So there are also many acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80 years were <br /> like (For most of us in anyways inside) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation, and breaking the play were like real. great, big <br /> <br /> play! It almost looks like a document of time now changed <br /> <br /> when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see New <br /> York looking like a zero of the ground from nuclear attacks. Other observers aren't too small to remember that it was poor, run the city <br /> <br /> during the 70's and 80 years. This is the best hip-hop / break all <br / > <br /> drawing movies from around the period. Of course <br /> <br /> 80 is considered as a joke now and all the shows of bad movies and / or <br /> movies, but those of us who lived through you will not always remember it </> fun for a moment when music, play, and graffiti were clean, yo!
