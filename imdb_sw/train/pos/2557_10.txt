I, I am a little child, because I love to watch cartoons, still do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a child, she loved him yet. I thought man, this was a "show" good on TV, and my father said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and I am like, "Dad, Bugs was not there when you were younger". So I think he is happier than one generation, maybe 3. I love to show it best for children and adults, alike, everyone. It's amazing, my husband and I, both in the 20s, we like to watch the exhibition, and we don't care anymore. This show brings many memories, fun. I love special Christmas too for Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's good. I can't choose my character of Looney Toons, because they have changed over the years. When I was a little bugs of course, and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always love him. In fact, I must say there are all things that are popular. I offer this 10 show out of 10, because it is a great show for all the years, very funny, sound sounds are wonderful, just flaw is that unfortunately died, 2 years ago, but re-runs is good!
