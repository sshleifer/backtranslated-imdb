I went to Deathtrap expecting a good and exciting stimulation; and then it's something like this film is; I also can't help but I think that it's just a poor Sleuth. The 1972 common film is an inspiration for this film; not exactly for the plot of the plot, but certainly it is the case and implementation. The release of Michael Caine in the main role proves. The film depends on playing with Ira Levin (who previously wrote Baby Rosemary and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; A sports player whose best days have been behind him. After his recent playing bombs, Sidney finds himself down; and this has not been helped when playing the Deathtrap; It is written by the amateur he taught, came to his door. The death of a death is a successful business success, and Sidney begins to refuse his own plot; which involves inviting an amateur author, killing him, and then passing the Deathtrap off as his own work. <br /> <br /> With all of his diversified tricks; Death of death falls on one element of the foundation, and that is the characters. The film fails to provide one of the best characteristics, and it is very difficult to keep information when it is not over-rooted for any players. This is not supported by acting. Michael Caine puts a good and fun performance as you expect, but nobody else is proud of himself. Christopher Reeve is tough in his role, while Dyan Cannon in some way can make a distinctive characteristic that is characterized by hatred and performance of anger. It is lucky that the story is good; and it's just about enough to save the film. The plan is around a lot and turns around; some work better than others, but there is always enough to ensure that the film remains attractive. Director Sidney Lumet deserves credit as well as the style of the film includes the other bigger. The main area is very attractive, and the movie is well suited to the film. In general, I must admit that I enjoyed this film; but it can be a lot, better.
