Surprised by the independent film, Insomniac's dream shows an amazing picture of what it would like to suffer from sleep. Very strangely written, and guided, it creates a state of dreams as a viewer is taken through one night in insomniac life. Dominic Monaghan star as Jack, we see everything he sees as long hours of night alone climbs. Describe it is almost misleading, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn. Surprising and disturbing, it shows how a person can cope with the lack of sleep, balancing to the center of cleanliness and spirituality. <br /> <br /> By perverting and circling every corner, Insomniac dream is stimulating and engaging. It comes highly recommended.
