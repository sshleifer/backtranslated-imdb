Well, I saw this film as a child and I loved it very much. My parents have never bought a film, but I think I'll go and buy it now. I am a sucker for the original 2000 films. WHAT IS GOING: There was a real picture of heaven and hell, one of the few that I have seen in animation movies. The power of character was present! It's easy to classify characters in this film (ie: Charlie is a mutt of selfishness, Itchy is stupid but believes Charlie, Carface is definitely a undesirable villain, etc.). I also liked King Gator's song. I have always loved older boys, worried, flamboyant. This song probably got random, but it was very fun. Finally, the animation details were good. You could tell Charlie was mixed with things and nature was good. WHAT / SIGNATURE: A real show of heaven: The way Charlie made it, "no surprise", made it really seem very bad. He denied heaven and STILL returned to his return at the end. I remember a few lines of some songs such as "... you can't put a good dog down", "... let's let the music ever", and "... we acknowledge that dead" but I can't remember many of them. Those songs were not interesting, honest. Whippet Angel: Sad and that NECK! RIGHT! What parents do not like: very few (according to viewer) images of hell are shown during the movie. Carface completely threatens. Beer also means, but not really beer DUBBED. Gambling is an important feature in the film. A good man dies. <br /> <br /> THERE: I love this movie, even if it's a little forgetful sometimes. Examples of terrible children are always my favorite. This was developed back at the time of manufacturers and writers were not afraid to give children a little frightened times. Nowadays, perhaps it would be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or children worried easily) should not look at this. Other than that, I offer 9/10. :) Viewing Happy!
