This is very dated, but that is a part of the charm with this movie 1933. You can say the same to many films of the Pre-Code; they are just different, and usually in an interesting way. It was a short time, the good work of Spencer Tracy and a beautiful face with the sweetness of Loretta Young's character that has made me look at this beautiful-but exciting exciting movie. Would you like to be very tough to find a girl more beautiful than "Trinna," played by 20-year-old who was ready to make her 50 movie! (He started working as a little child. That, and the truth made a quick film back in the old days.) The camera, though in a narrow direction in many parts of the film, came into the face of Loretta and often and was caused by its beauty. Trying to trust a person with a positive attitude about life, Tracy's Bill "was gradually transformed into a loving person, because of Trinna. Spencer gave his line here to the same nature that you did not know that he was doing. Though they have little responsibilities, the helpers of Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave long-term views after seeing this 75-minute film. I was particularly impressed with Connolly's role as a member the minister / father of the camp. The story is very little considered but - hey - that's the cinema. This story refers to two victims of Depression Deficit trying to live in the "Hooverville Camp" and sends it a very touching story.
