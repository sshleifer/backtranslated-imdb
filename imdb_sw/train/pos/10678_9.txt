One of the 1970s series. It also has the best sign of any show of comedy. The story is about three people living a flat more than home owners George and Mildred. Comedy sits on a mix of people sharing. Woman and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is attacked by Paula Wilcox. He played softly and not the way to consider which why this show was a great success. <br /> <br /> The text and stars were always giving the best performances and the love of frustrated love of Richard displayed by the charming charm. The last names had a joke to see which you did not know in the early 1970s but it deals with flat partners living arrangements.
