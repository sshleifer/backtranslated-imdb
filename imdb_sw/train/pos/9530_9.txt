Conrad Hall came out with bang. The famous photographer of the film finished his amazing work with this movie before proceeding. He was so proud as this is one of the best crimes you see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not wrong when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman leading! The amount of actions here is just right, too: not too much; not too small. <br /> <br /> No characters here, in fact, are "good people" like Hanks is a hit-master master of Newman's master. Hanks' the only quality of redemption does not require his young child to kill a murderer like him, though he teaches him how to be a man getaway in theft! Huh? As good as acting is and interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is a cinema cinema, Hall who creates an area after a beautiful location with its lens. His work is just amazing.
