As I drove him from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a few years ago and I was fascinated by the environment, I can't help but want this film though it has a beautiful color and good views would have been hit in the real location. Jasper in Canada's Rockies is a good place, but it is still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story goes to Dawson, that's when I feel Anthony Mann, who used the outdoors very well, could do more if he gave birth to a real place. James Stewart here is no one who fights in it, one side does not want to participate and help people who stand in his way of making money, and the other side can't look away from people who are being killed. Ruth Rumi is a proud woman who does not care who takes her, Corinne Calvet is a beautiful girl. Mann is the best leading shootout, but the top stage of the film is how well he does in the scenes out. He uses out as much as he can and is assisted by the winter, white background, as was the case with the "Publisher of Naked" and brown in "Man from Laramie". Like all of Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional west, with a distinction in the definition of the Stewart character which is more complicated.
