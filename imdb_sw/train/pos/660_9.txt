9 / 10- 30 minutes of fresh vacation. Okay, so it's not scary. But surely it's fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt of the Crypt (John Kassir) says the story of holidays Fear, throw all the goose of Christmas ... GosseBUMPS That is. Bwahahahahha. You should be careful what AX Santa for. Have a scary Christmas and a new Fear of Joy. Okay, I will quit. Right, therefore in the story, the greedy wife (the best player in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, a coach who gets a death stroke in ANOES 2) for money. But, his plan has been destroyed when a male killer is wearing a Santa (Larry "Dr Giggles" Drake) suit comes his way. <br /> <br /> If you look at YouTube, you can watch it for free, but many of you have already seen this (my third look). But if you haven't seen it, I tell you to do it.
