This is a bit of puzzle for a lot of the crowd of Lynch. They tend to try to write this as a certain type of Lynch project that is useless, useless. If this is a Lynch pass gas between its real pieces of film art. Well it may be a fart, but one of these fascinating horses that detects and is embarrassed to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Dumbland has been hit down beyond this art. What? What can you do with modern life but laughing. If you have taken it seriously you would go to peanuts. You go into it, smell, taste, feel its pain, unintentional foolishness, and then explain it in whatever you choose. It is called art, and art is not dumb. But it's Dumbland.
