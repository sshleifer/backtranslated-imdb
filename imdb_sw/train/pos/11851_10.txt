While Hollywood makes money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, comes this film that reminds us of the concept of "improper spirit". If you hear the beat down, this film will open your mind and will keep you growing. We all know how difficult life can be, sometimes we need to be reminded that to continue with courage will give us. That is what this film has done to me and I hope it will be yours.
