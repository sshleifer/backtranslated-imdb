I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I didn't know who any of the actors were, and I didn't know that movie would be different than it seemed. I certainly loved it. Warren Beatty stars as a 1930 crime detective Dick Tracy who goes after the older bosses in the city. At this time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is outside the city with his partner's partner Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who has her eye on Tracy. It becomes worse because the new criminal is attacking and the worst part is: these criminals have no face. He is very unknown. More, popular villians have come from a collection of comic book. I thought that this film was colored and creative. It was fun and fun to enjoy exactly as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond of the 1930s how he played Dick Tracy. The image of this film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. More More! Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for the family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
