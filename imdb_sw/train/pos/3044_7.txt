For anyone who may not know what one actress is, this is a good example. This program is stupid, and worthless. Filled with excited conditions, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you call it! But Amitabh Bachchan can do anything that is persuasive, and this film should not be different. Everyone returns to good performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But it is Megastar who leads everyone to its great presence. Without him, this movie would not be the first ... Stories are about the decline / bad identification / misunderstanding / love / hatred / trust / good vs evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a good performance on all accounts, in other films! And I said that it's ridiculously funny?
