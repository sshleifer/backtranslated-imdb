Walking with Cavemen, hosting Alec Baldwin, is looking back at all hominid (that's yes!) 5 million years ago: they were, what, and how they died. With a very interesting view of the information we have about these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what makes us human. I waited a couple of weeks to watch this, and I had no desire.
