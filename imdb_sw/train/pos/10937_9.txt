For all the hoopla, the respect and recognition of this film derives from the Kung Fu historians, still not recommended in two important areas: action and anti-events. But I must say that the plot is better and original that I have seen in the military film. Five things of death are certainly necessary to see, not just that, movies can look again and again; but I must also say that after watching it you would feel better. Somehow there are leaves you want something, want more. Producer Chang Cheh puts the storyline for beauty with great potential but does not follow and give us more than we want. The style of fighting in the movie really attracts the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, lizard, Spot) and is displayed, but the battle is very good. Rope and Snake styles are especially amazing and would have shown much, more, in fact Fishing is killed by the middle of the movie. Amazingly enough with this film, the absence of normal action or fighting leads to the development of a good plot, this is one of the few kung fu movies where you are very interested in stories and you care about the results. This film has a dark and evil sound and is attracted to the vibe. Cheat tools and torture techniques are used in all movies and add to movies to feel. To start a movie and set up a producer of Chaison Clan Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy prison. The end-time events are real but they seem to be beaten and somehow expect more. However this movie is one of the best Shaw Brothers and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the film would have been complete with this: The styles that the fighters used are shown to us only and do not show in detail, the sad thing, the director had a product for something that didn't exceed the right and did not expand on it. I'm left wondering what can be this movie, it's still one of the best. 8 out of 10 to the standard.
