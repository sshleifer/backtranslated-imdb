Colman's performance is supported by a brilliant script script. The 30-to-40-year-old studio studios were able to copy some of the German films that emerged and featured in Hollywood films. A very good use of shades and light and silhouette. I really liked the place where the colman closes light in his closet room next to the film, and he begins to read Othello when his face becomes dark and evil. The already viewer sees the texts and the game of Shakespeare to get "Tony" and away keeps his journey to the penalty. I also enjoyed a great death scene in the play, when he was falling emotionally and emotionally and accidentally very costly for carrying. Its application "tony stop you are hurting me" is cool and suspenseful. you don't know if he will go up and kill him at any time. The cat and the mouse chase the murderer well 2 / 3rds through the film to speed up the speed and also add the feature of the film story. Good work from George Cukor. He is like an experienced director. Good film. The worst do not have 'em as they used ...
