I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it makes them the same, I haven't seen. I love the quality of the movie story. I even like the story of love, although I am proud to think back to my mind how heck that part of the story could actually develop to see if Ned can't touch Chuck or another ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I don't see him completely, and I hate it with a good sweet, beautiful, and perfect characters. I even like the voice of a journalist, even if it offends one of my family and bares resembling some of the Walgreens ads. I could nitpick about all the other things on the problem of Ned and how the authors would go to address it later but I would rather watch and wait and see what the authors weave.
