... In action, TV or in the book, 'Mama in Black' is a story of good spirits. Some observers have just said about all that they might say about this film, but I thought I would add my little review too. The movie made for TV has the first act intentionally, which writes the great man Arthur as he goes on his business as a lawyer in 1920 London. I can understand why this can't appeal to all mice. However, for me, I love this British style of stories like the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" to change the great work M.R. James. In the second act, the spirit story runs as Arthur is sent to the provinces and his boss, in order to achieve the death of the client. The third act includes the decision decision ... Like Londoner, I've seen playing. I have a book, DVD-R and have an audio book that is unknown to my iPod, too. What is true to me, 'Black Women' on each species is a story of a fairly balanced spirit. It's about when we had a valid DVD tape release.
