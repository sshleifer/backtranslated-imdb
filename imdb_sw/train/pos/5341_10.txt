JOURA OF CAROL is happy to enjoy many reasons. Clara Lago acting is just amazing for a very young person, and he is one of the special actors who can say too much in the face. Director Imanol Urbibe gives a solid and controlled film without resting continuously, thereby developing a plot fast enough and just stop enough to ask what the nest area will bring. Screenplay of Angel Garcia Roldan is a story that explains the best, which, apparently, as the main goal of the film after all. The plan cannot be predictable, but events as they define are quite logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film as I describe the story of the Spanish Civil War as it affected people. It was a major event of the 20th century, but hardly any Americans know about it. In fact, in the 40 years of university education, I had an average of one semester who had heard, however, under anyone who could say anything about it - and a large number of students were qualified, all who spoke to A large amount of control in American education. So, in one way, this film is a good way to start learning the event, remembering that when one thread is made with a great history of history is closed. Therefore, thanks to this film is related to the amount of one's knowledge. Watching this film as coming again to the movie of the age is miss the movie completely. The left elbow list considers seven aspects of the film - acting, production sets, behavioral development, conspiracy, dialogue, continuous filming, and crafts - at 10 for the best, 5 on average, and 1 for support needs. . CAROR'S CAROL is above average on all accounts, except a moderate test. LEI level for this film is 9.3, raised up to 10 times equivalent to IMDb level. I strongly recommend this film for all ages.
