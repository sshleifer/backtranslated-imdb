Put it completely, this film is scary. It starts just as easily, it looks like a little girl's research and it continues to be an awesome film with beauty. <br /> <br /> Don't expect a year, or zombies. This is psychologically, and as he would also in Candyman, Bernard Rose can convey a fear that is not credible. Every time you watch this film, you know more about what is happening, and about how the whole world in this film is connected. Graphics has never been bad.
