One must confess, that Dev has an eye of beauty and talent. He gave the rest to Zeenat Aman, a successful style, and also a winner of the title of the head, by placing him a chance, which was made for his first. Watching him with stones, looking at the stones, and singing him in the music of the senses, making him an instant partner. This movie is a treat for the eyes, and a village area, ethnic people, Buddha temples, and chirp, lost mumtaz, who looks very attractive, in her tribal dress, and playing skills. Dev is true, interesting, and this is one of its successful business achievements. Hare Rama manages to set interest to go, with a well-written script, editing, and interesting music. Like Des Pardes, his other movie, Anand has dealt with the subject of teenage drug addiction, and their idea comes from troubled families, and childhood fears, it is quite obvious. Good player, this movie continues to clean up to date!
