This is the best of 43 films that Rainer Werner Fassbinder made; its success at least. He was one of the leading directors in Germany after WWII. Hanna Schygulla was as good as Maria Bruan's cold, counting, who lost her husband to War, found her after taking American soldiers as a partner, lost again after going to prison for her, and found her at the end. His day and half of the marriage before disappearing was longer than their time together. <br /> <br /> That's life. Things come and go, and you do better. You can stop or modify the way to consider living. Although Maria changed her mind and did what she did, she did not stop the loving Hermann, which makes the end of the catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Best player.
