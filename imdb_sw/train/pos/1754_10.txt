This film comes from hilarious from next to the second second, and it continues throughout the film. I can't remember the area I have never turned to look at people laughing with me. he is a perfect actor for this roll because of the way he sees and how he dressed. Comedic parts were good to see from artists not very big or popular. Since you can see people like like this movie has now been tested 7.9 on IMD. I think it should be in 250. It will put this way I haven't seen this funny movie since the pie of America or the original holiday. see if you want to laugh. I offer this 2th film on thumbs up which I have ever since I found out about IMDb, a popular movie site.
