When I was chairman of our college coffeehouse, one of our jobs was to explore groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original foundation was that it had been shown Broadway in the cinema where television monitors were placed in the audience, so everyone had a high seat. The cluster was that the skits would change from time to time on Saturday Night Live, keeping a clean thing. They decided to make it a film for general distribution. I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on the film. Watch him run naked though the trees were hard. As many comments before me, it was Saturday night before that thing was there. I highly recommend this. I told my 13-year-old about Koko clown- Can't wait to get a copy!
