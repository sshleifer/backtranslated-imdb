Make a funniest flat of independent art films. <br /> <br /> This flick opens all the clich√©s, and then some! Downs-Syndrome! Key personal discussion. Events that should be surprising but fall flat. Editing layout. Point-to-Point items. They are all dressed in the smirky form of disrespect for the audience and the mysterious psychological input. It achieves exactly what has been made. The satire of the seductive films made by young sponsors of youth, to show their parents when they asked them what they have done for the past two years! After "What is it?" received his Cannes award, producer Werner Herzog had explained that he was told that the film was really spoof, part of his own films! He thought he screamed over the news. To this day he refuses to talk about the event. However, look and laugh, this will be normal for humor for many years to come.
