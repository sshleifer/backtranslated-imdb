I was very surprised by the film, which is more than 60 years old. It's almost two hours long, they don't have quite a star in it, there are heads but it is still interesting and exciting to look at. What is very interesting is the origin of the film. You can almost feel the cold of ice, because you can see that the storm is real. This is forgiveness in the world of CGI as our day. I asked myself that this work should get to van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to copy the film. Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' again? It is a good film with a good message and I would recommend to future directors to see how big and real movies can be as if they were only guided by reality instead of visual effects.
