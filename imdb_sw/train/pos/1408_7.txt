The Pentagon Science team seems to have been completed serum which causes not to be seen but when the boffin's try tries to himself can not turn the process. He is broken with a strong drink, returns to psychology in the story of the classic HG Wells. This is a horrible non-visible story of Man, presented with joy by Verhoeven and Bacon every time as brilliant-loonytoon-maniac. Like many of Verhoeven's work, it has a very strong humanity of Boys-Own adventure (underground secret laboratories where scientists work is just amazing) with horrible and caused images (women in their underwear are beaten and attacked for non-visible fiend, animal deaths, real blood and general murder in the last two reel. While the story does not have any new input on the idea of ​​the past, special effects of CG and Scott E. Anderson are a priority of eye seeing when we see nerves and nerves, cardiovascular systems, muscles, bones, bones and the entire body appear not to exist. Specifically, the sequence where the team brings gorilla back from the invisible state and the area where Bacon drives the Devane into the swimming pool, is an exciting experience with the invention of harmful art. Film also has great sounds of Jerry Goldsmith and photographs of the fear of the movie by Jost Vacano. The release of young people is a huge shadow for technical technical generation, but Shue and Dickens all do not know at all. This is a very good movie to enjoy.
