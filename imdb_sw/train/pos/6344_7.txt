I have been troubled by Jim Carrey's work. I continue to find this movie has ended my head. The Grinch love Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very angry, his good temper) who tries to get a grinch in the Christmas spirit, the childhood of Grinch (very funny!), And more clear weak ending with Christmas is' t all about gifts . I say, I felt uncomfortable walking out of a reminder with a group of newborns and babies laughing and so on, but this film was a good long-standing film of DrSeuss and IS for all ages.
