I use the opinion of another reviewer for the simple reason that this is the FILM of MYSTERY, not the most common! It's not the only film to have a "normal" definition, but it becomes a very common part. Other movies that come to mind are Edgar Wallace "Before Dawn" and (the most popular) "Mark of the Vampire". The film has a work of WONDERFUL in creating a very “shade mode”, similar to DRACULA, while Renfield meets Numbers on its staircase, or at MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when two people look for windows the ruins of the fortress and see the "dead" to play the instrument, while Luna uses the wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If someone likes these (often silent) touch the sky, this film is a must! Norm Vogel
