For those who say that this film deserves anything under an extraordinary grace shown, I disagree. This is an amazing document about a wonderful day. IMDB asks us to give you this film. I ask you to consider the fact that the document was made. The courage that took place to make this film is very important. We find that the two brothers are split at the time when it happened. They continue to write a brave letter without knowing about their own safety and eachother. Judging whether it is a refreshing video of the tragedy or saving lives like those amazing fighters, amazing they did not mine to answer. I only know that in 30 years, the full class of children will never know one without the second. It is a whole-hearted version. To capture the natural feelings that the real life provides. You can put your junk of kung-fu. Romance is good. The action will not reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will have no time for it because it has not magnified itself. It had no sneak-peek. It did not have all the nonsense clearly known that the lion part of many movies on multiple screen screens. It had a class, stability, substance, and had a modern-day record of the modern American state and even the world. It talked about things that cannot be avoided by the camera's eye. Please see this film, as it declares itself, a tax incentive for all who have fallen because of the free name, the American beauty. How can you give anything under a movie showing, not facing, the natural courage of real people who make the wrong time. I love the "Godfather" but "9/11" is forever a kind of movie like this now is a different kind of world. It is an art without question or questions. jf
