For all of you who say swedish: the title of the [original] movie of this film; "Rånarna" changes to something in the "Businessmen" line. This fact is the biggest problem that I have with the film, because it is not true about the perfect bandages. It is about a young woman who works for Swedish police investigations. The work of the desk one can think, but this girl comes out in the field taking things with her own hands, as the news goes, even beat one of the host ... In particular: We've seen this before. The fact that there is a very surprising act for half of the plot is not as true as the end is as cliché as the first two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What saves you from being just another film is the fact that it is effectively implemented by all means, that administrators are as good as they are and not overact and that the director actually manages as exciting exciting as it is for more information. One thing that I liked most about this film is the fact that music puts the right feeling when needed, but it does not exist all the time, which gives a good sense of truth to the shot and car-expels in all films. Good touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish participants who often get depressed is very bad to the film as you know that he will not just come to play with a heroine girlfriend and be a helper behind, but that's something you should refuse. It is all an entertainment film that carries more money on the plot than it is from you. 7/10
