1985 was a good year for the film - maybe even big - but this enough on the gong went for a long time to convince fans that ol 'Oscar is a little more to be a hood ornament for a good party members. Election 11 and not one name: such as Academy's hatred for one of their chief directors; and one who had been waiting eight years before any discrimination prevented them from giving him a statue before he was allowed to give him a list of Schindler's list, which is really not good (and I am Polish half). br /> <br /> Do not get wrong, Schindler was normal. And I'm not knocking 'Central Africa' (which will win that year) either; but it was, in my mind, the class behind this: the epic story of suffering and hope that brought me tears - and not a great cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was music (superb), or movies (sumptuous), but more likely only acting: Whoopi, who confirmed us all that was more than comedienne; Danny Glover, whom I could not hear before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> Other is history; but, at that time: who knew?
