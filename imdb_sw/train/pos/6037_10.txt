What a great movie of England, a good laugh laugh and sexy Gary Stretch too, and oh, a lot of bicycles and beautiful country of Welsh. Our club members ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club are seen in it as an extra! Hooray! <br /> <br /> There are real hilarious bits, good acting, good idea. <br /> <br /> Call director, Jon Ivay at show at Wareham, Dorset. Good man, down to earth with a good laugh. This film should be supported, as all Brit's films should be! So please go and see if you can, have a movie site and show, so get one near you! <Br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the DVD. Some of our cycling friends have seen two films or three times already and can not get enough. Amanda
