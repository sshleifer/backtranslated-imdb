I saw this film more than 25 years ago on a TV TV and just got it last week on a copy of the DVD bought ebay. I remembered a series of music, color and a beautiful dish of fashion causes and clothes but the plot is weaker than the early film of Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding Spring in Park Lane and May does not stand well for years. But Michael Wilding is happy in the film, charming, funny, debonair, seems to have great fun and on his form. Prefer to view him alone. Anna Neagle looks a little bit closer to her, and very little to the part she plays but in the late 1940s their movie partnership was started well with a movie going to the public. Spring in Lane's Park was a hit on 1947 with a huge financial farmer. In his knowledge of Wilding, he wrote for a long time with his respect for Herbert Wilcox director and insistence of this London film series.
