I watched this film for an accident, having bought it as B on DVD's Omega Man. Omega Man was a bit of lust - except at the beginning, which was inspiring for 28 days later, all that was the television series. But Soylent Green is located in the rest of the league. I bet this is one of Tarantino favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I have never seen anything like before. Heston enters the bed with "furniture" while pointing to something else that is totally unrelated! A huge crowd of people are hit by a boat of mechanical diggers! The priest takes the confession and is shot by the concubine. Ok probably has been done since - but there are not many films that have been of this nature. And what is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? What? This is the most impossible couple of couples ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the end - which looks normal. Then I looked again, and enjoyed all the small signs that make long-term performances. Very good script - and other sets too. Only when you thought you would see everything. . .
