The best modern military games took place. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee did. A classic and quite culinary and brutal. Jackie Chan is the king of military movies and the true king of kung fu. It's a great pity that when Bruce Lee has been more powerful, it took Jackie Chan to be ever popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules!
