This movie was looking for a fascinating culture and society in which few African people know. My two children are for the grandparents' products that the father was a member of the paint de la color free by a woman of black skin whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off by his family except for one sister who had pity on his brothers to hurt them; Bringing 8 children during the great 1929 depression; give family and food whenever they can. Of course he is helping each other in this family for fear of his old communication. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We have made it part of our library.
