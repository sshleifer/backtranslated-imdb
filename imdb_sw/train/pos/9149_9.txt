I've never seen Richard Thomas playing bad man. I did not know that I would like him in this way. And I didn't know that he could remove it. But this was surprising. He sent trouble on my back and led me to look for people on the street. The movie is engrossing and fast paced. Bruce Davison is persuading but all he can play is a good boy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was small but perhaps the real way people can fight ... If you're a fan of Tomas you should see him here as bad!
