Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars will not be able to get the distribution in Western outdoor films. Why? What? Your censors can abdomen the film where police stalk up the male and female suspects to send them to talk (and the victims are happy) or see an old woman has her eye broken from her skull? These are just a few of the wounds in the shop for the audience of this ultraviolent cops and bandits. It makes Orange Clockwork which was banned for years in the UK looks like a cartoon of Disney. <br /> <br /> Do you see this film? YES It is a wonderful and important view for Asian fans. Wonderful times are there to describe what is going to the world of these characters. If you like this make sure you are dead or who is very similar (to prevent the end of insane in DOA of course). Great for Japan that they have talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. A good opportunity to see this film out of the retashispective Takashi Miike at the film festival is DVD. If I haven't stopped trying to try hunting in Hong Kong's web site if I am sure it will come out of that country.
