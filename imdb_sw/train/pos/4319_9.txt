In the second look of this film, I love it even more than the first time. It is filled with nuances and life-style as often and often frightened but what stimulates this film for a long time is not considered to be the focus of a few events in our lives which usually only provide an alert event. Here the movie spinning on these events, the truck driver's meeting with the client, the player who hears the baby's cry from the forest. Talk, acting, throw and directions are best. No two to four, no good revelations. What I saw was how true characters were in their original nature and how their lives were strengthened when these were kept. Kudos for all involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
