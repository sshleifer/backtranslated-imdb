This is not just one of Jackie Chan's biggest films, but it is also one of the biggest kung-fu movies of all time. We look forward to the stunts of things, and quickly, the creative action in Chan movies, and this sets a benchmark for others to follow. It is two hours of pure entertainment, which attracts all the way through. With the best action we have, we have good stories and trusted characters, and Chan take something that seems to be the most western way to write, combining east solutions (ie beat ass). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's funny, bad, entertainment and decreasing. For any fan of kung-fu, at the same time it remains accessible to the wide range of films.
