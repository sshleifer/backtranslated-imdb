Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own film ... <br /> <br /> 'The King of the Lion 1 1/2: No Matata' is a new absurd to take a classic story. What is the most common story, you ask? Why, 'The King of Lion' is true! Yep, if there is one thing that Disney does not break, is narcissism. It does not mean that this is not a good film. It is basically the events of the 'King of the Lion' as he told from Timon and Pumbaa's view. And because of this you should know the story of the 'King of the Lion' with a heart to see where they come from. Still, at the same level I was looking at this and thinking "Oh my god is crippled ..." and on another level I had a ball. Huge humor is predicting - I mean, when Pumbaa makes two beds, great for himself and a small for Timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that Timon will take one big one. But that does not prevent him from becoming angry, which, IMO, is 'No Matata' in short. It's not happening, how. <br /> <br /> With a warning mark: there is also a fart joke. To a large extent, do you? Are you looking for anything else in the movie where Pumbaa takes the center stage? But if the fart joke goes, these are very good, and they should satisfy even the most connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The purpose of returning the voice is good. I'm kinda surprised that some actors were ready to return, what for most of them have two or three lines (if they were lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the beginning of 'That's all I need', the definition of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut off from 'The Lion King' and is very clear in this body), music leaves me and nothing to complain about. At the end, Timon and Pumbaa are amazing characters, and when it can be considered to be 'no Matata' is just a reason to see them in different forms of fun and connected. so be it. It is rare to find characters who just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Do I start hearing creepy? Anyway, 'The King of Lion 1 1/2' is great if you have seen 'The King of Lion' very often. Especially if you now think "Do not be ignorant, there is nothing like seeing" King of Lion "very often!"
