'Mama' is a wonderful piece of film - it makes you think, draws - and finally lets you think. It is very open as the fate of the leading behavior. Anne Reid (which I knew only briefly from his exhibition in some of the projects directed by Wood Wood and I think good comedienne) is really good here. It was not a woman who was a widow who was a perfect widow and mother at all times. And not all are free and bold at the first time. He likes his character only by the correct note that the ring really (well, is me). Powerful sent. Great Script. The Renaissance of European movies really;)
