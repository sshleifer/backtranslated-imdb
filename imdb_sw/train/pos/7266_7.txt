I remember having a very low issue for a project like this when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy actress, and the title of the play in John Hughes's form. You can't pay to pay 15 years ago. But, I look at you when you lose Sunday morning, and attack me several levels. Fairy Story (part of a beautiful woman, the back part of a beautiful woman), very dangerous, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance with Kelly Lynch, escape. Above all, gently pulls the best conditions. It is very difficult to fall into the story, develop crush on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, love bad boyfriend, and laugh curley sue lines. It has all the events and down, with the end of fun, and the type of message you want to hear. Continue, spend your time on this film, it's worth it.
