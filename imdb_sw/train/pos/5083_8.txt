In the hands of fewer actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film can be ridiculous and terrible. But, with the two experienced scholars who were leading the way, I have seen the "Secrets of Secrets" to be an exciting and very interesting secret. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who says that Colbert has already been married, and that he was the best person at the wedding, one can see that there is some kind of plot against him at work. As Colbert, Ryan, and his attorney offered to accuse visitors claiming before marriage, they meet every time with further evidence to strengthen the claim that he is already married. Although it is not very difficult to identify just who "baddie" main, it is still a lot of fun as the level and speed of the story increases. All for all, a good film, solid secrets and beautiful performances by two leading actors and nice help support which include often underrated Paul Kelly.
