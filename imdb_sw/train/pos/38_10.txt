One of the best shorts of Three Stooges ever. The gray house filled with bad people and "Goon" challenges the best men of Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is located in the top form in the famous dark-dark area. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in the role of Mr. Goodrich, as the aim of a conspiracy plot. Before the expiry, the "little ferry" of Shemp is used for great impact. This 16-minute gem goes quickly as any stooge with a double pack of wallop. It is highly recommended.
