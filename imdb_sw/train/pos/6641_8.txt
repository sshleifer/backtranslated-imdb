On December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris, the history of the film was written when Louis Lumière showed his short films, every single shots, for the audience to pay. 'La Sortie des Usines Lumière' was the first film to play and I'd be there, not only to see the film, but also the result of the audience. We start with the closed doors of the Lumière factory. It seems, since the picture looks pictures, people thought they were going to see a slide show, not something that they were expecting. But open doors and people come out, moved home. First many women, then other people, and one man on a bike and a big dog. When they are all out of doors again. If this is the first film or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'une Train to la Ciotat' was the first film Lumière recorded), it's an amazing piece of early movies. Be bored with this is almost impossible for many reasons. The simple reason: it's only 50 seconds long. But also for people who usually just like the special effects of the film should be something interesting here; you can't see historical events like this every day.
