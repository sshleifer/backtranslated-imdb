This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! "Dragon master" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy", completely made a movie of fun, meaning, and just plain silly. The movie is a rare combination of the fight against the evil of war and (somehow) the wonders and joy that grows. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon master" (called because he is the son of a rich family) and "cowboy", which includes implementing clever, ways to avoid learning (with the help of the whole household, including the teacher), to compete through the boy (and idiotically interesting) to find the love of the inner girl, compete in the "soccer" (you will see what I mean) and the list continues. Somehow find themselves in the middle of the war to save the shipment of essential antiques and lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The movie has its great time. But they have no trouble, but rather to encourage. Boys' play is not lost in this exchange, but it is actually employed against evil. I liked so much about this film is how it works. It is not a common struggle (which was really amazing), but well, you will see. Let me just say it really gets the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> lazy, wise, meaningful, and nostalgic. A great movie.
