I teach Japanese to a high school online and I also have cultural activities so that students can learn about the country and the language. And look "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. Exhibitions or not, this helps pupils see that other people see the world and their life differently than we do. Many of my pupils told me that they were very happy with the film, they will have a copy for themselves. It is amazing to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just want to get the TV version of the cleaner. I am not really in a foreign language automobile workers use all the time.
