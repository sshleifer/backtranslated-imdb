First of all the movie, it is the art of art (movie). The plan was full of surprise, the little child pretends to be a big one who earns one million dollars and how he uses it. I mean how to delete this. Walt Disney have emerged themselves this time. Comedy is many times expected but sometimes unexpected. I mean this movie OK or was this movie OK. It also teaches a lot about wise young people and this child is wise and a bit of smart pants. But it also takes. How the guy as a child gets a child of a fire police and his father allows him free. That's like let the murderer be free for ten years. If I had to do that I would be beaten with a 'role' '(a big stick using your hardest bench). The child is truly lucky. Back to the story. The creators of the film knew what they did when they made this film but still not perfect. Acting was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry nor was the father but bros were better '. Special effects on the other side were lame. Plus this movie does not accept the truth. I hated and loved it at the same time.
