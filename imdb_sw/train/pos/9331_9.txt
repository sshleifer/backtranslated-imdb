This film was last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movie is almost never good (at least here in Mexican TV), I couldn't change the TV. The story about Madelene Moore touches you very much. He did not think of the kind of tenderness at first, but seeing the whole film, you just want to succeed. This film lets you think. And I think that primarily due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson. I have never heard of it before or seen him in another film, but this was very good to act. Suggestions for Brooke. I hope to see him in another film soon.
