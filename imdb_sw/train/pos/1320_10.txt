At the beginning of the 1970s, Clifford Irving made a recommendation to write the final notes of Howard Hughes, claiming that he had spent months preparing the book, conducting interviews with the delivery owner. While all of this has been proved false, Irving was charged with conversion and spent several years behind bars (although he always accepted the results were correct). The year 20001, several months before September 11, a book called 'Love Needed' (published as US 'Honor Has Lost: Love and Death on Jordan's Current Day') by a well-known writer Norma Khouri, a woman from Jordan, who reported on the death of his best friend Dalia, due to the fact that Dalia, with Islamic history, had a relationship with a Christian man. It's like the story of Irving on Hughes was revealed as a hoax of possibilities. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski tries to enter the quagmire which was Khouri's attempt to get out of the lie. Over a period of 104 minutes, the film is trying to reveal it to Norma Khouri who speaks the truth, or is a fictitious liar, and an agenda / vendetta himself. Interviews with those who know / know (including an old man, his publisher, and others) say their side of the story. This is a dinner, which has a well-produced document that can denote many of the many parties to the crime. It has not been counted, but it has a very bad language and the effectiveness of the gris killing area, which has been played a few times (but nothing looks like an example and a bad one as a person will see in the recent suffering persecution, like Saw: Section 84). It is not a good option for young children.
