This is one of the best comedies that have been on television. One season was a hilarious as it was the following seasons. The only reason I give this show 9/10 is because of the last season of unfortunate. The only good part of the last season was finale. My favorite part of this show is events that have been cut off from people's minds, often showing characters in popular TV shows or movies from 70 years. trying to develop a new character and fez was not as close as pleasing. Red foot in your opinion the ass was not old, nor the ignorance of Kelso. Bravo for the dog to keep such a beautiful show for a long time, even very long.
