I.Q., in my opinion, is sweet, pleasant, and romantic to find a good person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was a very good man. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. However, everyone involved in this film did the best work. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this romantic, delightful, and proud to find the right person for you any Tim Robbins or a fan of Meg Ryan who has not seen. You're in a lot of laughter, then go to the video store, stop or buy, call back with a friend, and watch.
