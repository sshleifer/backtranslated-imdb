'Gray Gardens' (1975) is a wonderful document of the Maysles brother of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy and Onsisiskecricric and the first cousin who live like a pig in the run-room of the 28th room at East Hampton, Long Island.'Big Edie' Bouvier Beale, 78, swift and dry with her daughter, 'Little Edie' Beale, 56, (emotionally over 13) A beautiful woman who once had a good time, lives for exclusion from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in bed. They are bothering themselves by fighting all the time, listening to the radio or singing to each other (They don't even have a television) Their fall from the community is wonderful to learn and the viewer is attracted to these two special, though obvious, non-working people One of the best documents carried out and is still a tribal worship today.
