After watching this film last night on Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first held on this film. Here we have many similar elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea of ​​the media being a common source. Instead of the cursed videotape, we instead have a haunted label and amazing pictures that appear on the film. In fact, the amazing pictures that appear on the film bring the once-off video to the RINGU memorable. One thing that was lost was that of the water that is running the future of Nakata. The last events are frightening, and a little of Murnau, what is to open the door and the soul that comes into the room, remembers once the hell / NOSFERATU The terrible movie that will make you think twice about going on the catwalk.
