I love this movie! Animation is great (for movie pokémon), cgi looks amazing. I love music in the movie. They liked the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> If this information is great. It has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very good and powerful pokémon. Ash is so great in this film, and I would like his friendship with Sam. The only thing that I didn't like is to be seen by Suicune, she comes suddenly, helps Ash & co little with leaves. They could make part of it in a little film. <br /> <br /> But in general, the amazing movie! Can't wait the US version on dvd!
