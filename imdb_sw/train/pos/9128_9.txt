I acknowledge that Rain Rain is one of my most pleasurable pleasures. The Purple Rain is not just breaking the borders, it has put a decade, dress, music, character, and play! To this day, my friends and I are still running on the sound of Purple Rain and pretending to be Prince and Revolution. Now the movie itself, I had the meaning of what I said in the head, because for the most part, this film itself is done by music. Acting? Please do not let them judge for this because it is one of the most interesting pleasures of guilt, because I know that it is not Oscar worthy of any means. But I think the duo that took this film was Morris and Jarome, their speech about passwords was out of hilarious. I just want to measure this movie in a concert because I felt it was the one that made the film. <br /> <br /> Prince is a music professional and created a good music. While the movie and acting are very bad, this film is still fun to see at night and even dance too. This film defines 80 years, so enjoy it. Prince would like it that way, just to the bottom party! Oh, young man, that seemed to be fools. <br /> <br /> 9/10
