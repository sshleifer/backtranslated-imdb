I showed this to my sixth grade about 17 years ago and students liked it. I loved it too. The story of the termites and their interaction with their surroundings is amazing. The events of creation are deep and all play their part properly. The battle between the two frost-cool buttons is a typical picture. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has done an amazing camera and this should win Best Documentary Oscar. The text I have Orson Welles is writing (Derek Jacobi) and is not called "Wonderful Clay Houses," just "Castles of Clay." This makes me think that it must have been done by Welles added to the power of the stars and push Oscar. I was lucky to get this VHS soon and now it's a movie of my favorite children. They brought it to a recent family meeting instead of the Disney movie. If you can find this film is really lucky.
