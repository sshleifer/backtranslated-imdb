Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion. Even though their house was dirty, this is understandable in some way by considering their mental illness. In a message message board writes that "Little Edie has the ability to deal with age eight." This reminded me during the year of the dramatized 2009 version, Big Edie says Little Edie, "If you are stuck, it's just by yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, strong faith in their views and actions. Maybe if Little Edie was not so hard for the first time things did not work, losing her hair, her work, and her love of life, she could do it. This somehow connects to what I believe is his mental illness: the inability to pick up when times are hard and to see that the best time you expect. The world does not know what happened if he did not listen to his mother, "Come home, Edie! Let me take you!" But these uncertainty women still have to be brilliant, heartwarming, and loved, even in their dirty home. These women were wonderful, and their interaction with each other brought humor and sadness. When Edie was emotionally devastated, sitting on what might be, or about how she wants to leave her home because she feels like a little girl, someone gets a strong urge to hug and tell her that "everything will be right!" <br /> Big document document! <br /> <br /> 9/10
