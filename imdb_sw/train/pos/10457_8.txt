Forget religious 'religious' movies that have made monopolized the television market / film ... this movie really feels true. Although it may seem like a cheap-looking film, it also has a message of forgiveness, and a good general ethics. However, I did not like the lights in this film ... for the film related to the issue, it was very strict. I felt that it was taken by the general rejection of the film, which is almost unforgivable sin, but the beatings are recognized, and their exhibits are facing this care. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth seeing ... buy DVD.
