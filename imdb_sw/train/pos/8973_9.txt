I saw this film when I was a little child on television (thank you to the Canadian Advertising Agency) and I had a dream about it for several years. Trnka was one of Bratislav Pojar's consultants, one of the Canadian Leaders of the National Film Board. Pojar was, and so consultant with a major Drouin. If you would like Trnka you should see "Angel's Night". The symbol is obvious, but it was used. The resistance to beauty and life (plant) is placed against the unknown hand. The hero of the poor heroes is judged despite the lack of political agenda. The more I remembered was the feeling of repression in decoration. The little room where the action takes place is the whole world of character. The hand attack is a complete violation of the world. <br /> <br /> Good movies and haunting. I got this short and good copy of Trnka in the public library and showed it to my children. Must see.
