I loved this film ... when I started watching I thought I would get bored soon, but was surprised ... The characters are honest and we must say that I have loved by Brian Austin Green again (the first time Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but I agree with other comments made earlier, that the end is a kind of despair. I would love to turn a little different! Never worry, a good story to promote.
