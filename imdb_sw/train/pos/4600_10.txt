This is a sad movie this head should be at least over 250 movies here. This is still the best movie of Action done. Today's movies have been done badly. just some not how to do it especially from Hong Kong as Jackie Chan. Stunts are clever and wild do not think we will see love forever. Beginning where Chan and his team go down the hill car to follow through the hill city is just amazing. Stunts to fight the last is for me the best stunts to fight the ever put film. The end of the closing lock under the blowing through the glass Jackie was very hurt.
