I wasn't a big fan of awesome movies. They often try cheaper techniques to frighten their listeners as loud voice and interesting children. They usually do not have natural defects and contain mixtures. The only movie of fear that I liked was Stir's Echoes and Kevin Bacon. It had done well, and it had a good story. But it's connected with maybe even beaten by Shining Shriley Kubrick, it is quite possible the worst movie. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the author (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to check on the hotel when locked for winter. There was a rumor of the place where haunted and the last host went mad and killed his family. But Jack believes it is the same and can use quietness to overcome his author. After months of calm and quiet however, Jack becomes grumpy and future violence. Is it a cabin fever or is there anything in the hotel that drives it? <br /> <br /> One of the creepiest parts about the movie is a sense of isolation that Kubrick does. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are great, but they are always empty. It is also quiet when Jack's son climbs his bicycle through lowways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of the best, shaking in my hell and making me sure to leave immediately for a while. My favorite part is when he speaks to the spirit from within the fridge's walk. <br /> <br /> Shine is on awesome movies in my opinion, hitting snot out of the crap like Ring and Blair Project wizard. It can be oldie, but it's definitely goodie. 8/10
