This film is definitely an unusual story of love. Although this film can not be loud, Nicole Kidman is running the only film that can be completely forgotten, though Ben Chaplin does a very good job of Hertfordshire Life and Shots of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead city center showing the true essence of the area. Something that starts to appear as a regular part of the popular TV series "Heartbeat" soon turns into a gangster getaway point of view. There is no great thing to remember in a small film and it ends up as a good weekend recreation. A good looking man, and if you love a hero John is a lonely thing of thirty you can find something to recognize and in his character.
