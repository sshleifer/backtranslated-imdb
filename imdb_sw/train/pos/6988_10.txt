This is one movie that will take time from your head once you have seen it. Discussions are closer to the perfect, which would have to be expected if they have been changed from play. The actors offer only the best, the story is simple and interesting. 88 minutes of good fun! Yvan Attal is completely loyal in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blue (but not dumb) to give much joy to the eyes as ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is giving the best of the total (and boasting to be), and Marina Fois a dumb friend who always loses when you expect to be at least. <br /> <br /> Stick to Bernard Rapp and collaborate and fix this excellent game, and better for future production! <br /> <br /> I would like to have more of these in today's production. If you liked it, you will also enjoy: "Un air de famille", and "Cuisine and dependances". Both were written and played with Bacri / Jaoui.
