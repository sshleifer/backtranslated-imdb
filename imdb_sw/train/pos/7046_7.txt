In War, Inc. we are experiencing the expansion of the current activities related to the war we are doing now in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are learning with antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root with Blackwater water abroad you are already home to fully understand the satire of Cusack more piece. Cusack has a lawyer named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a business show in a republic published as his cover while waiting to achieve its latest goal. While there he finds himself attracted by the anti-establishment writer Marisa Tomei followed by a pop-sexualized star of play with Hilary Duff. We describe the past of Hauser, which includes a tragedy that has been a tragedy since then and a company assistant named Marsha Dillon who actually runs all the work for her (and played with subtlety with Joan Cusack). While at times you are well played up, not always when you expect and a little touch often attacks you. All leaders turn into a strong exhibition. The Duff bond comes and goes but otherwise he does a very good job and may go a long way to chase his Disney image. Tomei is interesting but standing when Cusack himself has almost every area they have. To be fair, they are given good material. Authors turn to a beautiful script and wait enough with turns and knives to keep you from all the way to the predictable end. In fact, the ultimate prediction is the only thing that stands out from the highest level as the story turns out and comes back to the right conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your favorite and physical content, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like to enjoy it easily with satire wide, this is for you.
