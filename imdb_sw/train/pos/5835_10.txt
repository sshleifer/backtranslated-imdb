Stan & Ollie have SAPS AT SEA when their moving boat is organized by a sharp killer. The boys are wonderful in this feature, which starts with one of its hilarious pieces, the ivory factory. It is always a small measure of syncing with all Creation, Laurel & Hardy living in a world where gladios and billy goat beds are governed, not discrimination. In short, the film has more style and their regular lessons, which defines its natural background. Boys only get credit screens, but films will see other known faces: James Finlayson looks like a loony doctor, Richard Cramer has full right to his evil role, sweet Mary Gordon is trying to work around worries. That's Charlie Hall as the clerk of the desk house clerk and comic silent screen Comic Ben Turpin shows a special technician. <br /> <br /> One of the authors of the film script was silent comedy Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan & Ollie is the main goal, however. Watch Hardy go berserk with the sound of the horn, or antique Laurel and bananas, for example, reminds the viewer why his colleagues have a huge residual cinema.
