You always have the satisfaction when the investigator protects the case and the offenders are brought to the book. In this case the peak gives me more joy. To see a smug grin to wipe out the face of Abigail Mitchell when she knows her victims have dropped "the testimonies of death" which of course her guilt is very satisfying. Please understand: when I admire Ruth Rordon's performance, its true character, * really * hears me. He is selfish and claims. She finds her own way to keep the match of 'little girl' with shame at her age. Worse, now he has set himself up as a judge, a good man and a worker against her dead husband. When Columbo is very close she tries to take care of her by deceiving her in making a towel speech for women of high-class women. He overturns the table in full by giving a very warm and human speech about the reality of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from the right track. Abby's last appeal for its good nature is rejected because he is very proud to do his job well. Here is one condition that you can't get away with Mrs Mitchell!
