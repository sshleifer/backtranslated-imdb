I remember seeing this in Salem's movie (where I was attending "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a little boy and I never forgot. It's just amazing with my friends. I wish there was some way I could see it again! I have tried to find a short partnership or something like that for free. I just recently realized that it was a Cousteau film and that struck my mind even more. How heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding. Fish are the same in the CAT River at one time, if I remember correctly! If anyone can help me find a way to see it again I would like to thank you very much!
