Jim Carrey is as good as usual, and even though there are very few "Jim Carrey when", it's definitely not "Jim Carrey movie". It is the most targeted for children, and I managed to enjoy it as a movie. It was developed in Israel as another movie of Jim Carrey, so those who hoped to be surprised on the top comedy lost. <br /> <br /> Movie has a good time and works as a movie for children. I can't say I loved this movie, but again I am not his audience of the goal!
