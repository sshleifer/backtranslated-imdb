ABC has made more for this show by allowing television fighters James Garner and David Spade to join the cast to this show. At first, the show was visible and even predictable by John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss has accused the world. Katey and three children are really professional solid cast. The hour's lesson after John's death in real life attacked me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and can hear and understand their pain and pain. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even store this if you want John end. This show has grown and developed because of the impossible situation. They should be paid by Emmys.
