I love this film / short story. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are French words and in the title of the opening while the spatula soldiers cry "SPOONS!" I lose every time. I would like to recommend this movie to Knox fans, and people who enjoy other movies of Jason Steele. Its animation style is very natural. It takes a few views to see the detailed nature. His humor is also hilarious, and it is definitely not something you would like to hear before. As a devastated Max Spatula who has a voice and light in his head that makes lighting and fun music whenever he talks about his sad life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime anywhere.
