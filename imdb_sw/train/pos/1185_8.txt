Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the roles of goodie-baddie who held in "all the brothers were heroes". Taylor seems to be worried in his bad position of the guy but Granger plays his part fully. However the real hero in the story is bison and northwest. The film has been made perfectly, and the state of the time provided is amazing. The direction is taut and although the film is not suitable for heart entertainment, it is my way of thinking a great film, neglected correctly and cognoscenti.
