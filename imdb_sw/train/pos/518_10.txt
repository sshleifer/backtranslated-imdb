Also known as "Skills to Go to Heaven" in the United States. During the British WWII, Peter Carter (David Niven) is being shot in the war but he lives on. He meets and falls in love with a beautiful June (Kim Hunter). But the error seems to be done in heaven - he would have to die! The French spirit comes to find him but he refuses. He will soon ask his case before the Court of Heaven to be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> Sad but this is really a fantastic film. The script is good and the characters dictate direct roles and dominated by beauty - World events are in take-breath Technicolor (I've never seen the beautiful blue sky) and the Heavens are black and white! Niven is a little hard sometimes but Hunter is good (and very good) and Roger Livesey is as good as a doctor trying to help Niven. The photo is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final sequence of experiments) with special effects are true (based on the age of the film). There is also a mysterious chain when Niven runs a little boy boy shepherding sheep! This is a very good, stimulating film - it is highly recommended. This is still unknown to the United States which is shy.
