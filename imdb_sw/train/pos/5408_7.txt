Among these Pokemon films (which should be better for me): Pokemon Movie First, Pokemon 4Kote, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, this is probably one more about the environment, of course one good and highly more calming. If these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever," has still attracted many. <br /> <br /> With the three points mentioned above, this movie of pokemon includes good humor and good CGI (with anime). During the film travel is shown in a good way with the Rocket Team (comic / baddies compounds) end up with quite good gags and end up becoming more characters than groups. The worst is, as it was, the violence and unnecessary actions and baddie are not very good, even more than a few baddies of Pokemon films. The wonderful Pokemon is followed down by the Pokemon striker in the forest. The little boy tries to save the pokemon and takes his place ... <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ash, Brock and Misty enter the big forest ... <br /> <br /> Want? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all fans of Pokemon and fans of the movie "American" anime, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! : -) \ t
