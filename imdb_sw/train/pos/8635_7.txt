"Kalifornia" is a beautiful Odyssey of Hollywood to emphasize the fear that describes two couples who move to California to share the cost of gas: Two builders (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, photographer and author (Duchovny & Forbes) . Pitt "nails" his character which is the goal of this predictable desire. Good caution for those who enter psychological flix.
