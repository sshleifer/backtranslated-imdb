I absolutely love this death game. When I was 9 (now 15). It has good graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the amazing formats finally! I still tried to remake, prequel, or sequel in this amazing video game. You are playing as Dart, a young tenant who has the ability to become a hero. On this adventure you meet the strange creatures and fighting the boss. You also meet other friends on the way they have their special feature. Like Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Lightning / Lightning, Earth, Light, and Wind. There are also known as dragoon spirits, which enable them to change the magical creatures of the story. Dragons, witches, so-called wing and evil creatures will deserve a face on this adventure of action of action and excitement. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
