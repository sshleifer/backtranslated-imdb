Answer: although the fact that this film is written and guided by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and irrational more than any zombie that ever lurched the world. <br /> <br /> Acting in this free film is very good, in spite of no less than an incredible script. It takes a very good actor to give a printed line, clich√©d and make the sound possible. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, puts a very good performance. Fortunately, this film's program is much better than talk. Try it, especially if you're not a fan of monster. This is not an awesome flick. Although all adult women are very attractive, and although all adult males do as their minds are paid on the original zombie film, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adults. <br /> <br /> Total, this time, is much better than the total of its parts.
