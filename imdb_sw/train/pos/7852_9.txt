Ladislas Starewicz's sponsorship and insects and films are in the short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, artistic artist, and Bi Beetle. The most simple story of a female female couple who all want to stimulate out of their marriage is similar to biography or graphic time. From Starewicz on the story is using the beetles buried with the wire removes the legs in the frame-and-frame animation. The story builds as Mr. Beetle feels on the camera and sculpture from the local nightclub and the envy of the envy. When Mr. Beetle comes home to look for his wife in the hands of his artistic friend, he chases him out of anger, but finally forgives him and takes him out to see the movie. However, Ms Beetle recently learns the loyalty of her husband as the movie they are looking at is the footage of Mr. Beetle's jealousy and the joint with. Bi Beetle defeats Mr. Beetle and his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screens, and both of them are arrested after the project they break the fish. Insects are placed in human conditions such as home or night club, and are given human traits of envy, anger, greed, and revenge. Insects carry carts, automobiles, and even wear shoes on their seats and open their powers as actual insects. The story story is not wearing out, even after a lot of look, but as water as a movement, the film continues to slow. Steps occur in good detail, but fast and speed photography is lost in the process. With its speed, the film is a good example of the first puppetry of Starewicz and it is highly recommended.
