This piece on adults who return to the summer camp of their youth was very interactive and more interactive by the movies in the Autumn 1993. I would like to say that it was embarrassing, but again, some of the best movies are releases of stability that is not very accessible or praise. Diane LANE, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who are a great pain here) are a group of actors who do these works like people who have grown up in good, bad and wonderful memories of the last past. This film covers a gambit of emotions, more interesting, and the film never gets away from the viewer to feel the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to interfere in their own memory. Since I am an observer of the film who screams gently, the damage to copper in the film, this is something I know from the author / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This film is a good tax tribute, a very good tax and even pretty stay in the flick of the theater. You can run here on TV, and I would recommend a look-check.
