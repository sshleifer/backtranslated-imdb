I really loved this movie very, very much. Not because of that plot, act, joke, no. I liked it, because it is one of the worst movies created. It's so crippled, very bad, that becomes very funny. Some Jokes are true, but others make a prayer for unemployment for the author. "Men in white" are dumb and stupid, that you can do only two things. Keep the TV or make a low laugh (beer helps very much :). I chose the second option.
