This effort depends on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher / baseball, who has been encouraged by his players to try the advantage and fulfill his long-term dream of playing in the majors. Dennis Quaid, no guest for sports films, play Morris and enough guilt to make the section work with producers to make a reliable work of restoring real world events that led to a short stitching as a forest aid for woefull woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first half of the film, dealing with its junior High School Players (who are all too old to be in High School) are ineffective and may be too long. Overall the film is subject to pacing issues and many other things that we might do without. However, it still involves a movie with a powerful theme that proves again that baseball is a national time because. GRADE: B-
