DANIEL DAY-LEWIS performs a wonderful job of playing with Christy Brown, an artist who grew up with a brain disorder but was able to have a good life, dealing with his well-being and becoming an artist and a respected author. This video, however, is very difficult to explore - or even to watch. Fortunately, I had a feature of information on catching every spoken word that was not difficult if I got a film in the theater. When I respect it as a piece of work that deals with a difficult issue, I can't say it's a kind of film I would like to see more than once. However, my thoughts were made to a story telling story, flashback and now, which we see Kristoy honored for his success before seeing his youthful delays and his efforts to talk to those around him, who indeed they gave him a service of love. br>> <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly amazing as a worried person who loves a professional (FIONA SHAW), very much for her mother's fears that when love has not diminished her heart will be broken. There is a lot of pain in a restaurant where he admits his love in front of others and then gets into a rage after drinking too much. BRENDA FRICKER does a great job as a mother takes care of her, her father and brother brothers while they are trying to keep the roof over their heads until the day when Lewis begins to succeed with her work. He completes the Day-Lewis performance as a warm mother and shares a good time with him. <br /> <br /> A detailed story of family aligned together under unusual circumstances to pay attention to the details of the time in each film frame. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is a father who spends a lot of time in a local pub but likes a boy. <br /> <br /> Combine up: Elmer Bernstein's music is an additional reason. Very good, but not the film for everyone.
