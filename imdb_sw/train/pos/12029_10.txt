I love the movie. The proposed tradition was Jeremy Jordan, one of my loved ones and one of the most active actors. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I have seen many more movies but all of Jeremy Jordan. What I did not like about the proposed Theme is when "Nick" is arrested by "Jennifer" strikes out. The proposed desire is my second favorite movie. My first is Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
