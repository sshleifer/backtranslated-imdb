I think I am part of a few of those who enjoyed this film. What is one of the best of the "dream" series? Maybe not, but I was so happy with that. Freddy Krueger reaches its worst possible potential. Since 4 and 5 parts had reduced the series below, I heard this last unit ("New Nightmare" is the real end) that brought out a series of shortages. There are some great series of dreams, including one where Breckin Meyer is stoning, sleeping and stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is the original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of dreamcape, spinning like Super Mario. And Freddy drives the string directly, "Great graphics." And since the movie was made nearly 10 years ago, it brought memory when Freddy began to control the game with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers Nintendo's first 8-bit remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> Posted by very good. Lisa Zane is beaten by leadership. I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since "Man Race," and I think last time I noticed that the film was about 5 years ago. He is another good, unknown actor who has a powerful screens. And who can forget wasos? The best is for Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") who plays an anti-drug businessman. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really amazing! So for those who are looking to watch this film - please rent or give it on DVD! Hope all versions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video version has a 3D feature removed. <br /> <br /> I didn't have too many bad things and films. Even elaborated on the backstory of Freddy. The film is a great mix of humor and horror, and the external outcomes are huge. Can this be the best right of franchise? Of course it can be. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And getting the perfect conclusion is easier to say than do. <br /> <br /> And in closing, I loved montage on the opening credit. Fans of the series will be happy, and they will look at it as a reward for loved ones Freddy. My logo: 7 (between 10)
