The Father of Pride was a new show of the best television broadcast since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece from talented artworks. As The Simpsons, the display centers near the nuclear family (the white lion, in this case). It also has many memorable characters accepted including Roger orangutan surly, Vincent of Flamingo of Italy and America, white tigers Blake and Victoria, faux patriotic Brothers Snout and Chutney elephant. Other stars show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are so wonderful and they do everything in a great way, making many casual activities of entertainment. A mixture of animal-to-animal interaction with controversial issues (drugs, hatred, etc.) is a source of care. <br /> <br /> These failures of this show are located with NBC. They decided to announce the events without a special order (perhaps it is affected by the visitors' stars that can promote it) rather than the mechanism of production process. Several times, the show was tested for half an extra hour such as The Big Loser (like about 60 minutes of that is not enough)! In fact it is the worst of the future of the television as art as an original and surprising show if this fails when the Fear of America and America Idol reigns. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the full series was released on DVD and show now you have the opportunity to get the following great. 10/10
