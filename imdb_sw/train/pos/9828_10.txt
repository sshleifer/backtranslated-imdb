I will be faithful to you ... I loved this film. It's a great flick of a full-filled zombie, original thought, acting good, but also full of evil effects of Zombie. Part IV, with the title "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to convince fans everywhere. > ya <br <br <br <br <br <br <br <br <br <br <br Photo flicks.
