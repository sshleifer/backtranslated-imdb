The best view of the mature woman, which will lose everything (even pruner has credit). The way he is involved in this special "business", the lack of innocence, and the true love among the people of the small town, has been fully cooled to give us as a result of a new, lighter and amazing comedy. I could not stop laughing and the most amazing scene of two old women in a drugstore. I love European movies, and for movies like this, my opinion is growing stronger. The movie which I also recommends for my eyes closed, in the same kind, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Save Grace, comedy that many friends enjoyed as myself. You will love it.
