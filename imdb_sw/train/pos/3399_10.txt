This was the 101 movie of Eddie Robinson and his end, and he died of cancer nine days after the shot was completed. All that makes its location useful in this film is the most poignant. Though some hair styles and dresses are dated slightly (also see video game shown in the film), but the subject of the film is very good at a time. Heston said he had wanted to make a film for some time because he believed in fact the risk of overpopulation. Some things make this film normal. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> Acting is a top-notch, especially between Heston and Robinson, and also beautiful performances with Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is completely perfect. The medley of Beethoven, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky as well as pastoral elements make up for certain moving events. This was icing on the film cake. And the theme (or "point") of the film is one important. Yes, it is a film about the increase, but with the most important note is the story of caution on what can go against the Man's World Management. It's in a little text that you get the real message of the film. Beware of what Sol says about the old “old days” (which are current), and see how Sand does not understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my top sci-fi movies at all times.
