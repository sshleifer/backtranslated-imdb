I am not necessarily in the target audience for this film. I am about 50 people who has recently stumbled into the world of free film. This happened quite by accident, and the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I saw on the film was that it was 1) a specialist and 2) written clearly. When I read an interview with the director in the domestic paper and said that one of his influence was Advocate, I started to get interesting. When he said his main influence was The Agent Station, the movie I saw on DVD before, I decided to go and look at it. The results can be explained in the same verses as the authors, although these two films are not the same as the content of wisdom. All these films are faced with a technical magazine that fails to write in amazement. When writers are a day in the life of a person who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a person who seems to be involved himself to be always busy, he always run one way or another, filling his life for small things so that he would never do with that great. The themes and ideas of this film are powerful and powerful. I can say from the fact that not much has changed since I was growing up, young people still have the same problems. The author puts these problems with the theme in modern contemporary, professional characters, and makes them the most reliable. In addition to the indie movies it goes, this cannot be perfect due to the technical perspective, but from artistic, it is very close.
