I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I enjoyed the film. Two days before the film festival I went to see his festival. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I was completely considered. I was wrong: instead of a good movie I helped one great! The FELT movie. it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it shows LOVE .. I can't even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I don't say I am not a movie critic. I can 'T describe it in more words. is because the play is left without me speech .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thank Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. More! :)
