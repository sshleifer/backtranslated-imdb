You have come to this time of delay - you believe it was the 3rd, and the last part, the first time to look at it - and it was hit by a social definition that has not been seen on the American TV since 'All in the Family'. It was amazing CBS could even run this for the first time. That is just saying the last time CBS 'was set' - if you know what I mean - was back on 'All in the Family'. The most controversial decision that is ready to deal with today is the amount of eye-making up Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a realistic group, mad - let them discover the truth about themselves. And if you want them to pull the strings, call, and get the work of the Artwork - let them know the truth by hearing their own words from their mouths. The Aardman people always have a way forward to the horn. And this show is no different. Somehow it snuck under the CBS 'radar / social / political / censor' order to get on the schedule (maybe 'big brass' never seen true until finally open?), But once a good 'ol middle' merika hearing and felt it themselves - well, they can beat that field to be a message, or a messenger, it will not last long. Now, if only 'missing events' can find their way to Usenet or Little- torrent ;-) Asante BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
