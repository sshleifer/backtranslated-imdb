Finally he saw this TV movie on an informal non-registered shop from the old VHS, is the main piece of fear. It is more sympathetic to this obscure corner of fear for the issue of official radio on DVD and VHS ... the movie's fear of television. It has been suggested for all 70 films of TV as well as trilogy of fear. Those who love should find a book on the subject by David Deal - Telefon Fright Films 70. Send me an email to the opportunity to see it ..... enjoy watching again. It has problems such as many television movies that have to be impacting on the effects of departure and even on 70 years it may seem to be the most likely drag we all used for more modern editing but still great things and better than many fear of the exhibition presented today.
