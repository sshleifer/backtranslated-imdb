Directed by duo Judei Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Rubber Machine" seems to be the remake of the movie of the 1999 movie of the same name. I am sure I will ever have the opportunity to see nature so that I will continue to insist on this. First "Machine Meatball"? Simple in the budget below the low-budget industry around the flick full of devastating effects and gore. It's not something that you will finish writing books about but it's still entertainment if you give this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> "Rubber Machine" follows a known plot. The boy loves the girl but he is afraid to ask her. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl is infected with an alien bacteria that turns into a homicidal cyborg. The young man, in turn, also changes to the spoken word, and continues his efforts to save his love. Will he succeed? Who gives the damn, as long as there is murder and death I have completed. <br /> <br /> The program is simple, relatively clich√©d but it works well enough to movie it directly in front of the blood struggle between the two leading characters. There is a small part that focuses on how insects infected the girl entered their lives. And it is also by chance to show more violence. I am happy. What to do is what you expect from a non-budget film splatter. It is not very painful for the ears but it is not exactly the same. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film instead of violence and gore (if I have never said that already prepared) are cyborg designs. It has been done by Keita Amemiya who works in creating foreign creatures and clothing for all movies and video games known. Necroborgs as called "Meatball Machine" appears in detail in detail. Without the use of the CGI Amemiya structures is a fusion of respiratory body and iron, surprisingly with their appearance. It has the ability to transform different parts of the body into good weapons such as sauce, rocket passages, blood clusters and so on. Although you can easily identify low cost of film, necroborgs are a class of movie. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" all made in the low budget and additional ketchup mode. It is a great film of entertainment that ignores modern contemporary effects and proves that the genre of splatter is still alive and striking.
