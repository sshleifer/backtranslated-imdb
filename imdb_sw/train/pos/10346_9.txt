What about 1939 that helped to produce many Hollywood films? Well, whatever it was, magic can also be found in this image of Columbia. It's long forgotten comedy screwball that Movies Turner Classic begins to show. (Book of Maltin's movie does not stop.) In almost every department, Mr. Mr. Williams is a stone. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the first detective of the police who cannot find time to marry her goal. If wedding bells are about to talk, they are called to the scene of murder. The woman in question needs to learn in a difficult way not only to enjoy the movement of criminals but to be the police. There's a lot of laugh in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas again demonstrated that he had a few peers in a light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is happy. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The film goes too long, but who cares? Screwball pieces can always be interesting, and this film is right there and much better.
