Robot Jox does not suffer from bad news or bad effects. I mean, this was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used an animation to stop as many of the movies did in '80 years'. If you look at your great blockbusters this time, most of them did what they could with special shots of effects that were available to them at that time. It was not until Terminator 2: The Day of Judgment was released the following year that the effectiveness of technology took place, and journalists began to use it. But you will have good memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this film. Robot's enemy is very dangerous. It makes you unloved by that person without a good plan to go back. And there are some moments in this film. The traitor / spy works in them. Who do you think is on your side, supporting you in all ways, can be someone you didn't expect to be. And that's very hard to think so, don't you agree?
