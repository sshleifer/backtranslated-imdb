If you have had a role in your life, either yourself or someone around you, the pain of this woman (but, in my opinion, would be someone too) it might be very real. It's a film about not being able to cope with your pain, about not knowing what to do to help you find that way. Obviously it is also a movie about not knowing how to help someone around you through their pain. It's a movie that lets you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It is a movie that can push someone on the edge ... which hardly looks like suggestions. I don't know I can recommend someone to see this film, especially someone close, but for me ... it's a movie that sets things out of perspective, which shows real pain, and so it is very important to be alive. It lets you realize that he, you or the person next to you has survived the pain, that he, all things you are concerned about now are very important
