How effective and excellent filming itself can be. This film describes the story and daily events that can attract the hidden discoveries inside. It is true as others have said, how this film makes it quite clear how lost mobile is in a special, more emotionally higher and higher end of the climate and forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told by simple realism. To a large extent what these characters are experiencing is described by the area rather than mentioned in the speech. One thing I enjoyed very much about the film was different from the two brothers, one clearly in his way of the child and the other stoic quite but all can encourage a deep feeling. The older brother needed to say a little, as he did the usual, it was there in the face of death! Beautiful movies, good acting, good direction! You don't have to miss!
