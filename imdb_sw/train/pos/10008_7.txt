You know, Robin Williams, God is returning to him, he is constantly attacking the latest leg and all the dumb organs that he has made this decade (and perhaps except "Death to Smoochy", which hit the bomb when it came out but now the classic worship). The concerts that he has done recently have been wonderful, especially "Insomnia" and "One-hour Photo". "A listener of the night", despite a mediocre review and release of the DVD fast, is among its best works, the period. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting story, though it does not involve a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for it. The concept of the film depends on the actual case of fraud that is not recommended for official verification. In high school, I read the story of a man and a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who got violent and eventually infected with AIDS. I was transferred to the story until I read the report online that Johnson can't exist. When I saw this film, the sense of frustration that Robin Williams showed in the physical mind. Tone Collette may offer its best performance and also as a social “guardian”. His role was a great cry from those with him in the movie as "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even times he looked into the camera where I thought he was looking at me right. It takes a good actor to play such a role, and it is this proposed role (it is still well checked) that makes Toni Collette perhaps one of the best managers of this generation who has never been appointed for the Academy Award (as in 2008). It's amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and scary too. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, black film which I recommend very much. Be prepared to get involved, however, because this film leaves you with a wonderful feeling end.
