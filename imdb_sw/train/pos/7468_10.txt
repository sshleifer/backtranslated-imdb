As a summary of the one verse says, two movies have left this comment on me when I left the playground. This was "Echoes Illustration" by Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It is one of those movies that sit in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop asking yourself what the end of the movie will have to just leave the speed of the movie you want ... Walking out of the cinema was a bit strange, as the impression you get when you're sick and not thinking anything. One of those movies that you and the person, and feel that nothing else surpasses anything in the film. One thing is sure. The artists are amazing, the sound of the sound is good, and everything in the film is 9+. In fact one of the best films I saw, and the film that made the best and most frightening of my life and my purpose in this world.
