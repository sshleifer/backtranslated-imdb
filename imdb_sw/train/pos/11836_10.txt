This animation movie is a masterpiece! Presentation, music, animation, and all the wonderful stories. My brother and I saw again for the second time and we have more knowledge from them. We invited two friends to see the Spirit with us and were very happy. I asked them to come and see, they thought it was a movie about horses, but later they found it was more than that. I loved Esperanza, Spirit, Rain, and Lil 'Creek, who reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who is Smiles A Lot in Dance and Wolves. The Spirit has a great sense and an image that I have seen to be capable and inspiring. I saw the Spirit for the third time and I want to go back to see. I enjoyed the "Spirit" because because it appears to the Indians of the Americans is true, of respect, and non-varying from the movie "Road to El Dorado", which was a general farce because it shows the Indians of the Americans through disrespectful and stereotypical. But the work of Dreamwork has separated themselves by making a great movie movie that I have found acceptable! I hope they continue to make movies more animation like the Spirit, and I would like to see sequels or spinoffs for the Spirit if they were done with respect and without interrupting the American Indians. I recommend very much to others who have a clear mind to go and pay to see Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron.
