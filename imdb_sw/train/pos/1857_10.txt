This movie was wonderful. I would like to recommend to anyone, better than what I expected. It was definitely an interesting movie of the movie. It's an amazing story, with wonderful actors and creators. Certainly another fine film with Denzel Washington. (should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a good job too.
