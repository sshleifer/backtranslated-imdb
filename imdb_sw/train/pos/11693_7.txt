This movie is a remake of two movies that were better. The Last End, Heaven Can Wait, it was good, I tell you to see that. This is not very good. The third part of the film is not bad and Chris Rock begins to show some comic fun that has brought him where he is today. However, I don't know what happened the first two parts of this movie. It includes as a "B" movie that people sound as they are on a bad TV set. The situation is compulsory and it is as if they just try to get the story so they can start a real movie. It all looks fake real and editing is just bad. I don't know how they could open this film. However, the last part is not bad, then wait the video and see it then.
