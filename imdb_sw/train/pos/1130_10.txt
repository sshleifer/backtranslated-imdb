'Iphigenia' is a great success of Michael Cacoyannis. This beautiful play is done by screens and brought to life by an amazing cast. Cacoyannis reached impossible. He was able to edit the Greek tragedy showing without losing its efficiency and importance. The Greek stellar source helps him in this. Tatiana member Papamoschou is very attractive as Iphigenia. It is surprisingly similar to Irene Papas, who even sometimes looks up, is very real. A beautiful Greek film, modified and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with a beautiful color music by Mikis Theodorakis which fits in every area. Rumors say that the film has lost the best foreign language Oscar for only one vote !!!
