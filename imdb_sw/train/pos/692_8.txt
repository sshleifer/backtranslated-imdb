I saw this film first at the concert. There were many beautiful movies, but a few insisted on thinking about him for a long time, and Insomniac's dream was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a film player. Shots were beautiful. Compose was perfect. Dominic shone in his role that he worked perfectly. There was not much to know about his behavior, but he wrote a story in such a way that we cared about it. And Ellen - I can't wait to see where she ends! He shows many talents and I hope he makes more films. With all the budget dollars a million dollars trying to get cheaper happiness, Tess shows that not everyone needs as long as there is good news and actors. Kudos for everyone involved with this film. And thanks to Tess and cooperation. to distribute on DVD!
