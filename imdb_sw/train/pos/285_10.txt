I would like to say, that no matter what a small budget is, it needs to be displayed around the world for sure of these movies. We don't read anymore, instead of people want to see movies. After this series on the DVD, it made me like to read the entire series, and you want more. WE NEED TO MAKE ALL STATES 8. Please do not alter any of the characters or, damages the effect. Because I have grown to love the actors who have played the characters. WE NEED TO MAKE ALL STATES 8. I want to see the message, and look at the messages that these books and movies are currently here. We no longer have enough anymore. JOBA AU!
