Yes, Giorgio, is a good movie to feel. Romantic little, beautiful music, beautiful surroundings, comedy, (great fight fight), and a little taste of delicious ingredients are Ndio, Giorgio. Any movie tool enjoys this film. Those who need special special effects, should look elsewhere. Many of us need a little escape from time to time, and it is better to do it, than to the eyes, ears, and hearts? You must see!
