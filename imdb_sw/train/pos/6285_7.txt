What's in the name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer expects to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> In the latest movie manufacturer of Bruckheimer, It's gone in 60 Second Seconds, all on nomenclature. For character characters such as Kip, Sway and Sphinx and translated cars and names like Diane, Sue and Eleanor unresponsive, it's just a stop point that stops you from just wanting to play a game name. It is not a comprehensive script in any way, but it's a great car to act like Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of retirement with a car to save his brother's life by stealing A list of 50 foreign cars one night. The renovation of the 1974 service was hit, this film cannot have a place of worship of worship but it is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Surprise, it is a step that lets you look not to act. Although they are full of stars, no one has a standing stand, including very weak performance and one of my loved ones and my loved ones, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, leaving the win of the latest Oscar, is just the interest of the sign of the sign and any time of the screen. <br /> <br /> Does the series of good cars and car drive them involved in making a good film? I think so. The film is fun to enjoy and although some area takes you to an area of ​​unbelief, the point is not enough and insisting it is compelling. Beware of other drivers fighting for the stability when you leave the theater. 3/2 out of 5
