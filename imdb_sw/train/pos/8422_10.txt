An additional publisher is required to play a total in the film about the Russian Revolution. However, he is not extra ordinary. He is Serguis Alexander, the former head of the Russian army who is now obliged to join the same area, which has suffered a professional and private tragedy, to meet the director who was once a Russian revolutionary and had been attacked by Alexander. It may now be the time of this broken man to finally “win” his last battle. It is one of the most powerful movies with Von Sternberg, giving the greatest irony in Alexander's character in every way he can. Jannings deserved its Oscar for the role and performance of moving forward to play in general at its peak and in its deep basin. Powell provides permanent support as a director with a sense of retaliation and Brent is perfect in its place with its face and movement demonstrates a very express expression as the love of Jannings. All the beauty around. Testing, 10.
