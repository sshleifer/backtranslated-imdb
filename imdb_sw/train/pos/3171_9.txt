Cross is an original and amazing movie. I think Adam Jones brings a new effort to the comedy music and actually hinders it in a good way. This film is smart, concise, and frequent and fun. As a writer / director, Jones shows full control over its characters who are both nonsense and loved ones. The story is definitely something that has not seen before that is good. It is unique and fun, and will be able to work in the best elements of fun as well as the loss of slapstick lost for a long time to create a comedy of heart. The first one is promised.
