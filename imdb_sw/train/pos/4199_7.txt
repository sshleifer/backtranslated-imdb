The only thing about this film that is happening is that the DVD is very expensive. It is too big for my budget at this time, or I would sell it, because the film is a good example of the film film ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion offers many DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit. That's right here for the 80-minute black-and-white film, a mono-sound film that is good but no wonder, cinema-wise. <br /> <br /> Stories are stories here (as opposed to illustrations, executives, sounds, sets, etc.) like candy (Widmark) without wind winds and microfilm of wind in his possession after blowing money to Peters'. (say three times!). Everyone but Peters is a trusted character in this film: Widmark, fighters, U.S. agents. and the Communists and, especially the Ritter as "Moe," skillful. He and Widmark are the stars of this film. Peters does a good job of playing floozy cheap but loses his early loyalty and "falling in love" by Widmark at the first meeting even though he is bad for him. Just in the world of film! Such a bad, because that romance interesting part of the story takes away from it. <br /> <br /> This film's average film that has a good idea, but it's not good and certainly not worth to buy at $ 25- $ 35. For that price, one can do very well in the film film .
