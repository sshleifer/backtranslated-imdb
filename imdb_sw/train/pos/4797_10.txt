I have been a fan of David Lynch and this Lynch film has assured critics that he has talent, style, and artistic integrity to make a film out of a surreal aura that he is known for the last ten years. Also the film is counted G, it is Lynch fresh in style, pacing, and tone. The film goes to the speed of feeling and is filled with real and powerful emotions. The movie is strict, as expected from the Lynch film, and the transition of the transition is interesting. It is also a great pleasure to see a film where all the characters are friendly, kind people and not the characters who are not encouraged to be "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth returns good performance as well as the rest cast, especially Sissy Spacek in good performance as its player, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but very serious role. With this film, David Lynch assured the critics that he could make a powerful moving image as he did in the 80s and 'Blue Velvet' and 'Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the last decade after producing surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but for this film showed that there was a FWWM and LH route, and it seems like critics finally did not get the film recently 'Mulholland Drive', based on the great features received by Oscar appointed by Lynch. 'Story Straight' is to me one of the most moving pictures' you've ever seen. It is a story of love about family, friendship, and kindness of strangers. I would recommend very much.
