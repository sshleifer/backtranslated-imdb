Interestingly, a good look at the film that led Martin Scorsese better. Many movies he says are easy to relate to his actions, especially the original, era of silence. It's very enjoyable despite being a bit, I found this to be one of the best documents on the film yet. Need to check if you like Martin Scorsese and his work.
