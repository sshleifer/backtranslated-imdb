This is one of the most spectacular events of Twilight Zone, and other fun conversations and exciting characters to break down some interesting tension. There is a common dump of "dancer" (what it likes and Serling's behavior for that kind of behavior, as it continues to show at different intervals?) And other characters, but it's "old man" of Jack Elam who is completely robbed. I think this is a beautiful, illuminated version of "Monsters From Maple Map" - or perhaps, Twilight's 20-minute "The Thing." In another note: I thought the little boy of that period might be someone who eventually went on with other things - he looked good - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" was lost after two TV titles in his name.
