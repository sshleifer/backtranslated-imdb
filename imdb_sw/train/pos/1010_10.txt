I love this festival! Every time I look at the section repeating this line and remind me of how good this display is. I am a great fan of sci-fi and this show has foundations that are important science (fiction?) To show in film / TV history. There are many theories in this show about the world I could start religion. Interestingly, the season after the show season becomes better and better. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 now) and I am so wonderful that my 2 favorite TV show star at all time Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how the behavior of each one is opposite to the other. Come back when I saw the movie Stargate first, I liked it once and saw it one of my most famous flicks, then heard the TV version would come down from them I got a great excitement, but it didn't have time to show up until the fifth season was close. Although, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a trilogy of the movie but the studio chose a series instead. It said it though it looks good. Maybe it's better. This show is amazing, and I hope never dies. Atlantis here we come!
