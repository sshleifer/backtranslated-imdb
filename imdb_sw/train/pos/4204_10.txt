and anyone who watches this film will agree. This film was directed to the day when the plot, the credibility of the character and the head really were appropriate. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the watch. Ritter is in the top form as the author "Moe" lives in the Bowery section of NY, doing as a dove's dung for NYC police. The only film that I saw Peters is "Niagara", and certainly shows his ability to do here, complete with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark should be risky, as a hero to fight and must recognize what is right, despite his need for money. <br /> <br /> Images are very good. Neon, the subway station (although it seems to be more clean than the real thing!) Shadow of the port where Widmark lives as short. Good use is made by the city, and "Louie's electricity" in Chinatown; The most delicious and the desire of the city is addressed here; The political situation of the time is a bad situation. 10/10.
