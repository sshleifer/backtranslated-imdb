The first feature of this highly unpopular series provides a woman with a trap with a group of black-colored people who torture her for several days before killing her. He has been severely beaten, around the chair for a long time, with his fingers fingerprints, small animals are thrown to him, hot hot water is put on him and finally his eye is fastened to the needle (sick and unfamiliar area) The creators of this non-verbal declaration attempted to make it as real as possible and for me one is very close to the film on the bottle which you can get without making a kill on the tape. Of course some special effects are poor but the idea of ​​making a bottle is very good. I have also seen the "Flowers of the Meat and Blood" which is gory and more sadistic, but less disruptive. At that time, this is a must-see for fear fans. !
