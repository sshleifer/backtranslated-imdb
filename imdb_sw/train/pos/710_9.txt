When I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to leave the child Jesse, and it is something I will never do, they were trying to do what was best for the child. This way of film is written, you feel you are bound to the story and wonder what you really believe, from all the different things. Patty Duke? Rival? Welcome to hear, even if I'm concerned. But during the film, she persuades her to have psychology, or at least, there is something very wrong with her. His character is the meaning of "emotionally humiliated." The movie seems to end abruptly, leaving certain things unchanged. But moreover, this film is very big. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you want to jump back and relax and look at something good that will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to resist your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and discover a little thing about yourself. Caution: you can even grow when you watch this film! And it's all worth it, at the end.
