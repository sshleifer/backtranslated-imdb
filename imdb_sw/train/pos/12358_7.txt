The movie is more modern and intelligent is its observation of sexual tension than the US trial as 9 weeks and a half ... the court area itself ... and the couple copying in the castle when the heroine are asking for their orgasm. I have not seen this film in 20 years ... but it made images embarrassed in my mind ... is rich in texture and success in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activities, and under it is an angst of a walk that lives in us all. ... the plot is Europe, and makes little, but also life ... especially when you are 17 and have always hard ....
