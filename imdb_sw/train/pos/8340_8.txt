This is a real, delightful, joyous, romantic heart. You can't go wrong with the difficulty of Meg Ryan's beauty as well as Albert Einstein's skills. Normally, I am not a fan of fictional stories produced entirely by real people, now they are dead and cannot defend themselves, but I think Einstein at the end of them could lose them out of this. It is the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. This story is about a skilled woman, many years old, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who has been married to a jerk, a character researcher named James, because she only has the mind he wants in her father. However, it is love at first when his car breaks and meets a car manufacturer named Ed (Tim Robbins). If he does not think Ed is intelligent enough, his uncle, no one except Albert Einstein, plays a match, was helped in his efforts with three evil killings, all theoretical physics. Uncle Albert must have Ed seem to be intelligent, and thus confirms the connection to him as physics ... usually for exciting results. Walter Matthau is a typical hilarious man, and eliminates Einstein's character completely effectively. Along with his three teaching partners, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, many have laughed. Einstein actually had a real human side and this film takes one step (outrageous) more. If you stop all the logic, you can almost think of this romantic story happening! It can be a rocket science (despite its main character) but it's a nice, fun movie. One of the best music comedy romance.
