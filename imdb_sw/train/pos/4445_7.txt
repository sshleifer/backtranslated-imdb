This Sirk melodrama's first, black-and-white color, is a small film, still showing German minister of power in strengthening the lines of fatigue in something similar to art. In 1910, Barbara Stanwyck is a woman who has committed a sin by leaving her husband and her husband of a small town in the action of Chicago. He has not filled his expectations, and has returned to the city from a letter of desire from his daughter to inform him that he is also happy at the playground (secondary school production, ie). Returning to his old city he sometimes comes against minor motives, and he needs to deal with his eldest daughter of hatred, and a man who loved (and loved) (Richard Carlson) and a former partner. The plan is not new but Sirk separates itself by creating meaningful songs, and each chapter is carefully handled, and he helps a lot with Stanwyck as his leading wife. It runs 76 minutes, and that too, because the material does not have feet to go further.
