I can't believe that I see this film now - I think I probably thought it was another movie about oppressed slaves, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - as I haven't seen the Schindler List - I don't want to be "welcome" to other people's pain, no matter how true or information should be. So I think the main thing I saw about the color of the color was that it was not about black people being oppressed by whites. Black people were able to lay their own daughters - or give them away as a slave to their "men". It was a painful look, but everyone saved himself, and acting was wonderful! I couldn't believe Oprah's character playing 35 years! And I plead with the Holy One to begin with - he was wonderful. I am so happy I had a good feeling yesterday afternoon and Showtime was a colorful color.
