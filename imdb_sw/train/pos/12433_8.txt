This is a good movie, though unknown people and the Community of Glory Blaise and books can find it slower and missing work. For a gentle fan, the film will be very enjoyable, especially because it is very faithful in its presentation of "Stability" history. Peter O'Donnell is listed in the features of "Creative Consultant" and film makers should pay him a priority as the plot follows closely the details made in comic books over the years [although events have been decreasing in modern days]. The only thing that a true fan can get desperate is that Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is no longer loyal to Blaise's mildness since the movie takes place in the very early days of gentle work. Alexandra Staden makes very little humility who looks very much like humility should look. Change welcome from the destruction of the image of Monica Vitti of Mildness.
