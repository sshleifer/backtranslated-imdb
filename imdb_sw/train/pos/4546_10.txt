This movie will drop down in history as one of the greats, the same side of Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and On The Waterfront. Someone please please persuade Leno to make a layout! Leno and Morita are duo of comedy, which is not available since Abbot and Costello. The evil that emerges from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you damage. Dingman's behavior as offonish yaf hear back to Shakespeare's day of comedies. And the peak. My beauty, peak. I'm not going to destroy you, but it makes the Star of Death a comparison. If you can track this hard-get-gm gem, make you and your family have a permit and stay immediately. I still do hope for a special edition of one of these DVDs.
