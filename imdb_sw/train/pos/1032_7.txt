Movie's message, but it's more beautiful. Casting the best, up to the bottom. Interesting in the plot line of Bette Davis is essentially the story behind! Very bad reviews (name on the screen / player games, sharing this somehow with very bad comments about 'Angles in America', etc.) something to the movie that also preaches on Germany in WWII. Gosh, that's just a very sophisticated sophisticated moral code for me. <br /> <br /> Exhibition shows and movies, and the styles of act vary in time and of course 70 years later this movie is not suitable for this way. Yes Casablanca is the best movie (I think), but though made the same year with both of them with Nazi, Casablanca is especially the story of love. The story of love in this film takes the second seat to the spy program - more exciting. They both have a greater number of certain acces of cheesy and actors of good behavior. Children are little to stimulate and could be edited
