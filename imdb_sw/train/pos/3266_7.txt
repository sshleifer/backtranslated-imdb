Another downey must-see! If you are a fan like me, you should see this film! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale who knows that his life is a life that he came from 26 years ago. Alex is a new body of Louie Jeffries, a dishonest lawyer married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed during the one-year anniversary when she is hit by a car. He asks to go back, this time only in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughing at the age of 15, still makes you feel like something like being inserted again. And if so, how often do you meet the same soul after life. I don't know the answer. But I know that you need to see this film. It's corrupt, and Downey looks SO good at tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love, and true love will not die. Just gets published.
