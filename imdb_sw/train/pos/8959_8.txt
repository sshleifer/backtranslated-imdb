Although I admit it is good but not a great movie, because many other banners have explained, I still enjoy it. One reason is music: I will listen very much to the brothers of Candoli - Conte and Pete - in a place that is well placed in the nightclub. The Jews were two of the best jazz trumpets of their day, and they could influence Jimmy Stewart's mind by playing the horn of the trumpet, one of the trumpets in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis really played very well, too, although I think real music for the area was mentioned later with two of them. I don't know a lot about George Duning, who gets credit for music (except that he seems to have worked with three employees more than the event), but sent to the brothers of Candoli as a jazz-playing battle really good.
