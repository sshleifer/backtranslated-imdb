The real state of screaming faces the horse in the middle of the 70s this film was a great hit for 5 minutes and disappeared away from the surface of the world. I always wonder in other comedy films that are offered for a week and then destroy: IMPORTANT IMMUNIZATION, CLEARANCE, EXAMPLE EXAMPLE, DIDN'T SEE THE WORD TO DO ......... and have no information today. NORMAN was a new comedy at any time in 1976 and everyone seemed to see, laugh about it and never mention it again. Known for being beaten on a videotape and being transferred to the film, the attempt at that time, NORMAN is an improper political party of the slamming farce which Brother Farrelly should look to fix today. If they had put it first there would be no complaints on its content and planting. It's very funny and yes it is so bad and cunning everything is wrong. As appropriate. In fact if the 1976 groovy film and all the awesome colors and clothes are really working best today.
