Telemundo must definitely consider making a DVD collection of a nova Xica! I know tons of people including me who would like to be able to buy and emerge Xica! It is novela of the most entertaining entertainment in Brazil. Clothing to wear for actors is beautiful and the city in which no novela takes place is good. Xica has many history of that time. I would like Telemundo would be television again even if it was 2 am. I would like to strongly recommend Xica as shown again in Telemundo. I have sent Telemundo a million times to show you no more but my prayers have fallen on deaf ears. The only precautionary information about Xica is that it often has a severe exhibition so I would suggest that children under 14 don't see Xica. In general Xica fits 10 out of 10!
