Ossessione is in a very bad situation but is now being fully restored at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is "Good Teacher" 2 original from Visconti to publish to hide from retirees. It is identified in the 4K Spirit (like 2G RGB data) then used to use DaVinci Revival to restore the app. After this some are the manual work and we do not expect to end before early spring. Sometimes next year should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on DVD DVD. This film is good and we hope to restore it to the future.
