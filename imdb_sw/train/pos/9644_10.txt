I will give you directly ... this movie is amazing. Foreign gay films are the most recent gay films of the United States in acting effectiveness and stories. while most of the American gay films are destructive, rough sound, amateur act, trite story lines, and any lack of any magic or aggression, movies on foreign gay fans have been popping up like this from France. The movie is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. The story is adult and complicated (but not difficult for anyone to follow), acting is intense and professional. All leads are wonderful, with the whole cast. The boys are more than just looking good and there is full soil ahead. you follow the whole year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. every little thing of the relationship, the details of the fall, and the outward, of love being done well. has left me need more. look!
