This film is a good example of beautiful stories. Acting is very good. Stories are stimulating without being careful or fake. There were several points where they probably made people tad more beautiful or worse than they were really, but considering it is a movie of Hollywood, expressed an amazing block. There was no explosion shown on the film, although they had one chance. The film, when you have some stages, did not take place in an action film. So the story is made to focus on the extraordinary person of the unfortunate times. Well done!
