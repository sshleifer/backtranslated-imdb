great Ramones fan. I like ramones, and I think if you hate them, then, instead of being a Bush assistant, you might not like this unusual. It is much better than john tomatoes reminds you of the boy's films and it is full of 80 years. It is better than the American Pie that gives us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great secondary films: Sisters Switchblade, Fast Times ..., Standard '84, High O'Clock High, and cheesy still enter (doesn't seem possible) Edge River. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it is funniest and more fun, as well as you can rise and play with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. 10/10
