Anyone who has recognized the fear of divorce will be dealt with by the indie actress, a young boy who believes a zombie hides in his closet. Can Jake (Anthony DeMarco) be able to simply "transfer" the pain of two parents talking to a simple picture? Or can the creature be real? The author / director Shelli Ryan has a balance of both possibilities and makes the audience think. His choice of use one - suburban housing - adds to the sense of despair and claustrophobia. Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Activists are very persuasive as angry, but loving parents. However, it is very minor characters, Ms Bender (Barbara Gruen), a child who is not bound by Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a real estate agent who sits in mind. Jake's Closet is a picture of the nature of youth as a special form of hell.
