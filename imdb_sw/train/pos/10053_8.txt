I must admit, when I read the description of the kind of Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a little bit worried. "Steamy"? In the film from 1968? I was ready to desire. And when I realized that it was shot and white and white, I knew my hopes were lost. <br /> <br /> Boy, I wasn't wrong! Not only is this film with all the love of the first love - the discovery of the first love, the fear of the secrets found, the sudden end of unexpected - but sometimes this film was enough. You will soon forget that it is black and white shot. The movie should be approved every year. And the performances from two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. Okay, so both in the mid-twenties are trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Is it? Do you really expect young people from '60 years to be able to effectively investigate the story of lesbian love like this? Many adult women were still trying to come up with their sexuality at the time. Anyone who looks at the real young here expects very much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was the way before its time. Superstition was an unexpected pleasure; but it still managed to leave a lot of ideas, rather than choosing to give us an explanation of poetry to add to what we were shown. I don't doubt that the scholars will recognize them and the characters here. For you who are just interested in looking at lesbians in action: Although not all you expect, I don't think you will be too, too discouraged.
