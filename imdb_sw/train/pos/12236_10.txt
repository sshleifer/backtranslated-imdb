I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old in the sports room with my family. I was like that at the time, I thought it was very funny. . . even though I was very sandy to understand 90% of what makes this amazing movie be fun! I saw it again this morning on "Turner South". As I watched it, I was really tired with laughter! "Mating Game" is a unique classic from the previous age. If you are too young to have an amazing experience in history that produced this film, I feel very sorry for you. There is no way that you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) give that beautiful piece of heaven to "old time" like me. After saying this, all I can do is to pray with respect that young people don't know how to comment on the film as "Mating Game". Films like this were made by the previous generation of your people. And as such, these films speak different languages ​​than anyone can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words? if you do not understand the issues that the film is talking about, please do not feel embarrassed to comment that? say the truth? have no meaning.
