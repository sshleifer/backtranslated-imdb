I had seen this film back in the 80's and I was about to forget it when I saw it on tv again and watched it. I remembered that I loved this little girl when I first saw it, and I liked it better for a second look. All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as a 12-year-old boy who feels he is responsible for the death of his brother's accident accident) ), it is very good. The film feels realistic - something that has emerged, a quiet, encompassing family of grief and sadness. The discussions are few but they say, and the odd job is better. Such a simple type, the rural version of the common people without psychiatrist but the dynamics of the family's interest. The stone boy is the value of time and emotional energy involved in looking at it.
