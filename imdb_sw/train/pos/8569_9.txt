This is just as good as the original 101 if not the best. Of course, Cruella steals the show with its bad trends and clothes, and maybe the movie was made because the public want to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of this time round. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, instead of talking to men. Using Paris as a peak of the movie was a clever idea. The movie is well worth checking whatever your age, provided you like animals.
