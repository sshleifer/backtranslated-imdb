I did not give up "Mr. Blandings Builds His House of Fantasy" 10/10 due to a factor that makes us in the 21st century a little reduced: the fact that a black man is a faithful servant (somewhat remember Stepin Fetchit). But moreover, movies are hoot. To show the new partners of New York Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) are trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone. Grant is his usual size, while Loy performs quite well as a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds real laughter as Jim and Muriel Bill Cole's lawyer, who seems to have more plans than he makes clear. As for the house itself ... in many movies, perhaps you will be concerned about whether you want to live there or not. Builders, contractors, and others also offer the right to laugh. <br /> <br /> For all, classic comedy. It also includes Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
