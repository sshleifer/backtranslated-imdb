Visual Tsui Hark Advice is in its image in this film. Unfortunately the terrible act with Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the desire to take her while watching this, is that bad :) has made it difficult to watch when. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real efficiency in the visual department. When I first saw him, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought myself that I had never seen anything like that but this is how it should be done to make full justice to the historic history of the Chinese kung-fu history. This is undoubtedly one of the historic historical kung fu fues of China. But the trouble, Tsui Hark has not been very strong in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather young people (its obvious vanity and the false and long-term false and unwillingness of the wicked did not help either). To get worse, this film has been sent too much. They decided to use Hong Kong's famous "hot pictures" as leading actors, but unfortunately all Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are not found at the historical kung-fu drama because they do not have the skill and mystique that such characters should be present. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 edition are much better. I would like that one day Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join power and produce a film that has the visual art of Tsui but with the maturity and poetry of Zhang story.
