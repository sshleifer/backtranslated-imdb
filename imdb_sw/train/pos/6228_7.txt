Another fun, bold, bright RKO music and Astaire and Rogers, Follow FLEET is an interesting film. Although it does not sound the SWNG TIME (though the last number "Watching music and dance" is one of the best and true teams), it is very happy, since these two could not do badly together in the 1930s. Once again, the plot it is lighter and not forgotten, but watching the dances Fred and Ginger together are in heaven. These two showed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in the film do in a great love area. Although there is the best music for Fred and Ginger, this is certainly worth seeing.
