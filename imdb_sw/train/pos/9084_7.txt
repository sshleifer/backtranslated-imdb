Yes, some people said that this film was a waste of money, but I am a type of dragon die hard / world-finished / holy holy fan of the film. But if you take from my stand this color movie had some of the best flowers of work were pretty good dang. But that kind of film that everything just fell in good time, or just about when evil had something that came to save them at the right time. Although there were rhythmic and funny lines in every surprising movie. 3D images were very good. I mean this kind of movie 3d effects were great! The great battle that was displayed in live trailers until whatever the movie hype was. The clashes between good and evil at the end was, I must say it would be a little longer and a little more, it was still good. <br /> <br /> Now in places that I think would be better. Origin was very good to show the pieces leading up to many battles. I mean if you don't want to go to see this movie in movies then at least this is a DVDer!
