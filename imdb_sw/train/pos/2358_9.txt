Pushing Daisies is just a good story of text, and the shades of "Amelie" of the most beautiful and romantic. It has a good palette, its shots are well thoughtful and deep, its names and romantic and dirty conversation also be true, its good ideas, and its deep romance. <br /> <br /> See the blue sky pop out of you, if the blue color cannot be found in all sets or sticks (for less discrimination). Check out the original and quite satisfying song from the location. <br /> <br /> His score is very good, their cast is highly recommended, there is good music, and two leading romantic stars cannot touch or die. What? Are you more likely to have sexual tension? (Actually, I wanted them to find a way around this, but it's life). It's just to show that it's fun to spend an hour and, and I recommend very much. There was no other television like that, and I'd like to see more. It got me through one week of flu, as it makes a good company. Repeat!
