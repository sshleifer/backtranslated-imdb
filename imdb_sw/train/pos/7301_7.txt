When I heard about "Hammerhead" released on the DVD and finally found it in the shop store, I thought "well, just a movie under the monster from Nu Image". Those boys close to Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced B - Leisure gardens very much in the past few months but also awesome movies. So I didn't have much expectation, especially after seeing the horrible “Shark” area for just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" became a better revolutionary of the 1950s of monster movies. We have a shadow scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, shouting women and women in stress, eating plants and of course we have a creature, a great mix the mutant between man and shark hammerhead. Everything you need for a monster entertainment movie. The only thing lost is sexual sex screens and dirt you expect in this kind of movies, but since the movie was made for TV it is understandable why these events are not missing. And it doesn't matter however the "Hammerhead" is an action and entertainment of fear at the best. There are two reasons I gave seven points out of ten, though: Firstly, the creature is not very visible and the destruction of the organism is very fast and not well done, and secondly, William Forsythe is not only a good man of the "hero" section. and for the fall of love with the beautiful Tylo Hunter. Other than that, I can recommend this film to any fan of the monster film out there. Grab a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this film and enjoy it. Jasper P. Morgan
