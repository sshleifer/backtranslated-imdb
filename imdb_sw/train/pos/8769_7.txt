Mr. Jim is another case of publishing a legend, and Errol Flynn is playing a legendary striker as a tribal surprise but proud in rollicking entertainment that is not recommended for breath. It is like looking at the accuracy of historical accuracy here as in the Flynn's Charge of the Brigade of Light - this is the sheer hokum and all things have been removed out, published in a very dramatic and given a real sense of energy and clear direction of Raoul Walsh. Flynn is still on his authority (you can never think he suffered a heart attack during the production), along with Alexis Smith a lovely lover and a lover of Alan Hale for a good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes over string this time). In fact, even the galeon pirate from the original Flynn movies makes it come out of the place in the dockside area! Just 103 minutes of heat.
