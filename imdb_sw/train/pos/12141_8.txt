Of the three scenarios of W. Somerset Maughan, this is the best, and not because John Cromwell brought it to the film. The movie should look for a break through the performance by Bette Davis, who like Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry was a star. Finally, he struggles with Jack Warner and his studio paid for the spirit. The movie is headed by Mildred from the beginning. We know from the beginning that Mildred doesn't care about Philip and never. He does not hide his shame for this kind of person that has fallen in love with an unworthy woman. He will be eligible again with Mildred again, and again, for it does not make bones about what he really is. Wrong Philip Carey, instead of being disabled, is someone who is weak. When she tries to hold Mildred, she rejects her. It is when Mildred returns to him, when he is weak and failing, that he rises to the event, conquering his own dependence on this terrible woman who has been robbed of her will by her mission. Mildred is a wonderful picture of Mildred. This was one of his best duties and ran with it. His hatred for Philip's kind is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When he tells him he will push his mouth after kissing is the most powerful time in the movie. Leslie Howard took Philip and made him more obvious than him. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in small responsibilities. <br /> <br /> This is a Bette Davis show, don't forget!
