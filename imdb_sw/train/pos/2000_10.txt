I participated in this small production when I was 8 years old at school and my mother bought me the video. I have loved it ever since! When I was young, it was the music and dancing system that I enjoyed but since I watched it when I was an old man, I am enjoying the most beautiful character and behavior. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were wise. I can't think of someone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy as an excellent character to me. He held so much to those boys, I think he is a strong character and his last place when ... Well, you know ... Always makes me cry! Best music for my opinion at all times. It has continued all this time, you will live for many more years to come! 11/10!
