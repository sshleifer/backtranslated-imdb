I couldn't agree more with Nomad 7 and I commented on HVR. Movie set behind the movie on Sunday morning. Humor is a trick (the exact opposite of "slapstick" as one deviated artist described). But what stops the surprise is how often I find myself getting back to this film on a regular basis. I wrote a preliminary copy of this film on VHS 12 years ago when it was launched at one of the weekend checks for free of the last Store (HBO perhaps?). Never heard before. You do not know why it was not delivered properly. ?? When the DVD was released, it was one of the first movies I changed. A great mix of cast and write. In addition, the backdrop of the Montana desert does not matter either (or good) <br /> <br /> Probably not a comedy for everyone, but what is it? If the items of Adam Sandler come to your area, perhaps this will not be your tea cup. This movie requires your full attention. Humor is more in conversation. I believe that my upcoming vision will be closer to my 12. But I still know that when you come to events such as where the police cars hoods start to blow, I'll open it (Ed O'Neill's face is important!). It has been recommended 110%.
