Jeff Wincott is not just Hunk, he can hit the butt! This film has some of the best martial arts that I have seen for so long. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I was hired to play an uncomfortable politician, he did a weak job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by a professional martial arts / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So he is not Cynthia Rothrock, who likes? He's just fine, if not BETTER! (see his last battle during the film, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this film as much as possible, because if you have not seen it, you are mistaken for a major military action.
