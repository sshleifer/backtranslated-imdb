When I was a little girl (and my father had a video shop), this was among my favorite movies. I have never heard a lot about it since then, nor have I remembered anything about it, since it has been forgotten from other Don Bluth, perhaps the best movie. I was able to track a few weeks ago, however, and I was happy again. To put New Orleans in the 1930s, animation is interesting and songs are remembered. There are tiny buttons to keep on looking hard, but they are generally not found in the story, which leaves you exciting (and maybe even less, if you are a pet lover). The characters are honest (maybe even too little for the small audience), too. Two paws up, and for those who have not seen in time, certainly worth re-check.
