Fidois non-standard film. And in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after checking, how is hell going to the market? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic partner with the zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story is mixed with fifty years of playing with zombies. Do not go out of the language. Fido is not a bit of Shaun's murder, gore & belly laughs. It is a very different animal (pardon pun). Fido leaves a black and white film describing the story of the past - mankind has won the battle against zombies by developing a cage of control that overcame meat keepers in dumb workers. At first I thought we were in a 50-year battle of paranoia parodyia, but recently thrown into the world of basic colors and mid-five years - glass nostalgia. Young Timmy Robinon is the only child who is not good at school. Her mother will be a social player, and her father is nervous and blocked. Trying to continue with Joneses, mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has found a zombie. Jimmy has not been heard for the first time, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) recently shows a good friend of Jimmy. Until his kola continues ... Fido is not a terrible movie, but my problem with movie shows exactly what. A lot of humor is a kind of light family, and sometimes a line of conspiracy is also dependent on a young man and a dog / family at a time. But the film is blown at a dark, very strange time, which at the time of being welcomed, will ensure the level of R, why, the long, comedy of the family. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, and it is done in amazement with all involved. <br /> <br /> The problems with the tones of the tone, I hope this film gets a niche, for it is a little gem in this year's film's trophy.
