Narrow, well-documented Mardi Gras disease. I have loved this way for making films - communicating ideas about something bigger, more complicated, and often legitimate to break the issue into something familiar with the home. I am sure many people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the fundamental intentions behind the benefits and capitalism, and the impact of the world on poor nations (however people feel about it). Instead of meditating on these subjects and waking up in a soap box (not that there is nothing wrong with that, except that the document tells the converts), this document only shows Mardi's disease, how they are made, and what people, and under the circumstances what, and then how it is used by users at the end of the process. Obviously and by observation of the inquiry of everyone involved in the process, including staff, factory management, US importers, and finally, the user end of the sequence. I felt a bit of this disease; similar to Mardi Gras, but also through Chinese workers have accepted their status as usual and for courses (even if they have restrictions on how they can manage). Footage of road sweepers cleaning the beads off the street at the end, made a certain impression. But that was just my response; I can see how another person can read this diverse document. <br /> <br /> Unlike the other document on this issue, I don't think you should have any political views to be affected by this. That is finally the story about humanity and our relationship with the products we produce and consume. If you have ever purchased a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to reflect. Excellent and recommended. You need to see more documents like this. Kudos for all involved in creating this film.
