This movie is a good entertainment to watch with a spouse or girl. There is a laughing galore and some very strange story nudist story going here. All employees are very interested and are certainly looking to look at their natural beauty. The life of the Maslin beach is full of different types of nudists and personality. The Australian coastal arrangement is, just, royal to see. What a chance to visit, say the least, and one day may be my secret. I am very happy with this film and every time I explore it more enjoyable. I would like to see more of these characters and always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is smooth, this movie is, of course, the main pretext of just sitting on the bed and enjoying the wonderful and famous beach of the Maslin with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
