The Black Otto Preminger style works as part of LAURA ... when the film was bright and the Clifton Webb's top shows, this film is a multiple seamier. Dana Andrews is a small striker who is killed by an accident just a person who is likely to be imprisoned for a girl's favorite girl. Preminger continues to move on a piece of the piece of the street so that it disappears logically easily ignored. Andrews is quite good (very low wooden than he was in the past) and beautiful Stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the victim of anxiety. HERE IN SIDEWALK ENDS we must see a large piece of friends for Preminger's lurid WHIRLPOOL (also Tierney's star).
