this may be War and Peace, but two College titles will not be as if it were not for James Wong Howe's professional ... . if you have interest on what provides fictively or not, BB & C is a feast of feel. I don't mean it's his best job, I'm not an expert there. but looking for this film is amazing. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, city of retro-middle; but the way in the film is to breathe. <br /> <br /> I even like to vary on this page above, with "special effects" that appear back now. all builds the real world.
