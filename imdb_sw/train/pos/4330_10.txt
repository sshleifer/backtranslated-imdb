The "Bleak House" is the hands under the best reform of Charles Dickens's novels on the screen. Alway one of my favorite novels, I was so surprised by this Television Mini series. At the end of the week, the great Denholm Elliot was thrown down as John Jardyce, the renowned Diana Rigg, was perfect as Ladty Dedlock. This film catches the essence of the Dickens era and is very reliable for this book, making small crops that do not affect the story. on all the brilliant, moving and sky film.
