Hi every I am a witness of chess since the age of about 6. I thought I was completely obsessed with chess, but hope is not like a central character in this film. In this film, the middle character shows a real player of Chess named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for the game played against Steinitz, where a good mix was played by Steinitz. Instead of withdrawing, he came out of the competition hall, never to return. The social deficit of the main character is unfortunate to treat some of the older ones sometimes find a chess competition. Chess I think it's a very great sacrifice, and sometimes you can end up balancing in other areas of life. A great example of this is the story of chess Bobby Fischer. Although he is a professional, he was also very troubled in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, the World Championship match is shown, like the Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The form is a barrier, which in fact the World Fide Management organization is sometimes employed as a structure itself - from 128 to only 2 final players. But this was to hit the group - which also shows the actual structure, where each team winners. <br /> <br /> Position before transfer makes an interesting puzzle of chess itself. In fact, I've made a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
