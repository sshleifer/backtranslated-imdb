The best modern and a good example of how the scary film can be without showing anything of the viewer. It is a set of all four stories around tenants of a delightful home and their terrible and horrible events, all locked together with a story of wrap-around about Yard Scotland inspector looking for a terrible movie star. It starts with a story about a secret writer whose main character becomes too little too, followed by stories about two former romantic rivals who appear on the net figures in the museum, then the story about a little angel's angel who is anything but, and fast and the story of what happened to the star of the lost film and what he does to the inspector. It is a good magazine that lets you know the work of Duffell's director and what he can accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that acting acting Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you have a movie that can enjoy again and again. Sibu answer phone if anyone from the Real Estate Stoker calls to give you a business in a beautiful home in the English country?
