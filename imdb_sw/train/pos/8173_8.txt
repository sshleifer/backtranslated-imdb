The beauty of this film is that even a skilled dentist can be awesome. It is one of the first fear of man. This movie is a night picture of every child passing through the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives an incredible performance as a dentist who thinks he is trying to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not working out. In a particular area of ​​gory we find so-so actor Earl Boen to have his teeth completely destroyed by digging and whatnot, which I think is the worst you can do when you are a killer teeth. It's a normal situation for Brian Yuzna, not well written but there is age. This plan is shade and sometimes it seems to be on the spot but hey, it's a movie dentist, we've thought all but did it first.
