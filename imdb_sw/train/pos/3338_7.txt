Fever's temperature is enough movie. It has a lot of fun time (including an interesting swimming area). As the most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she broke with me" things happen, but more than that continues to be funny until the end. Although the plot revolves around brutality towards the red market, it is not influenced by games. You must be a fan to enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> Of course it is easy for me to say: I've been a fan of the red Market since I was a girl, too. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
