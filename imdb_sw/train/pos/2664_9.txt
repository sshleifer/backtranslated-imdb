Although Shining is located on a quarter of a century, I urge anyone not to be cut off by Jack Nicholson's madness. This is a rare example of something unique that no one could destroy; rather it is frequently mentioned in pop culture. Twins, blood elevator, RedRum, "writing" of dirty things ... this should be seen, if anything else, to understand all that is in everyday life. The movie is scary at the same time, amazing, beautiful, and exciting psychological. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the fear of modern thriller. And it has awesome movies that usually don't exist: a great script.
