I love the series! Several events showing South Africans as tanks are very obvious, but these people are very often. The South African Government also says the truth, but sympathetic actors remind one of the good things about South as well. Other things have not changed, and we see "good boys" every day! There is Lucas Buck in every South town which you just have to make a call to make things happen, and a book of "po 'white garbage" all familiar. In addition to the common elements, everything else can happen too much in the modern South! I somehow think Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
