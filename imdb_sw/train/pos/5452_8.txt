Stunner before the code with Stanwyck play the prostitution of negotiations that lays up to the top. These original code eliminates everything to go with anything left in mind. Stanwyck is better as Lilly's daughter of the negotiator / father who sold more additions to his servants (johns). After an old man dies (good) Barb leads to the capital for good things. She uses her feminine attributes for the highway. John Wayne makes the poor "cameo" and confirms that executives get better with age and acting coach. I liked the ban and powerful lines between executives. I highly recommend this film for all the buffs of the film and watch Stanwyck who is good and beautiful as Lilly.
