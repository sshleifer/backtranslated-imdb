I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They are funnier and better than any other movie together. They can also stop making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I think they would say that there would be no better? The best person of this film. Burt Reynolds needs to dress like a chicken and drive around a lot of trips, and Loni Anderson's elegance is around, looking at the fire in eight ways. Burt and Loni, that was a day! I had this magazine that had Loni Anderson inside of the advertisement for a trip. I certainly loved that advertising! More is this one part in the movie where the audience of racetrack faces something of the Stroker Ace (Burty R.) that does, and shows one in the audience moving and putting his finger on his butt to show his desire! I laughed so hard close to the night! If you can find this film, lease! And then you no longer see another film, because I tell you right now: there's no point.
