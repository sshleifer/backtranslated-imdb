After the success of Die Hard and cheerful is not a real surprise that in the 1990s, the glut of 'Hard Hard on .....' movies are experiencing within a bad person, a bad position, a concept when concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on the mountain just when saving the work of Sly 'Stop or My Mom' Shoot 'Stallone. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one big dream dream, especially for those who are a professional climbing mountain, jump base, at least, facial, practical skills. All in all is full of claims to reject the film as one bunch of extra junk. Stallone even managed to eliminate the horse! However, if you forget all that is worthless, in fact it is very interesting and delightful that it offers as much fun, and without fun, there is much to laugh. Would you like to love John Lithgows sneery evil, call every box of baddies, and better, a "turncoat" agent who is tortured and abused permanently, Rex Linn as Tractors. It may have been Henry in the 'Serial killer image' but Michael Rooker is well known for good performance like Hal, insisting to continue exciting for his concern because hostage 'did not hurt anyone' And when he can't be, indeed it seems like Frank Ralph Waite character emerges as a girl strikes her death. Also say you must go to the former 'Burning' actor of London Craig Fairbrass as a bad Brit, who comes to cropper when he has Hal as Human Football, Yes, you can't help to enjoy a bit, Hal is needed A good beat. <br /> Then forget your best judgment, who cares if it 'never can happen', reduce your expectations of implementing, giving much and enjoying! And if you are looking for Qaulen, he is wearing a helicopter.
