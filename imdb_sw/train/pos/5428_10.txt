My "Imperialism" and one of the best works of all time. Grants, McLaglen and Fairbanks govern the screens with bad cracks and consciousness to enjoy all but the "PC" more than the filmmakers. Recent events have increased - 3 leaders and their 20 sepoys are fighting with hundreds of bandits; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote a blow to "spiked" ("some safe to elephant"); Cutter for MacChesney - "I am a trip"; Cut the break out of jail, for the fork ("do you think I try to lose?" Pudding of bleedin?!) And the mysterious location of the temple and sing to Cutter and then delete, courage like copper - "Indeed, you all caught!" br /> <br /> I could continue, but it should say I am trying to catch this film whenever you are. For armchair fighters and generals, it's hard to imagine at 2 best.
