This movie is finally located on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film many times and I have seen it even today (2003) when Italy is again experiencing a type of brain dictatorship (or the US for it). I am glad there are people lost as one played by Mastroianni in this movie who can sing out; maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. Return to the film: as many people here are already mentioned that acting is amazing but sound history is amazing. I must think that unfortunately something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language but I can assure you that the display of destruction, the destruction of the truth on the current radio radio to Hitler's Rome might actually make you feel depressed! <br /> <br /> Kito! <br /> <br />
