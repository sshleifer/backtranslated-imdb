The only version I have watched since 90210! Why did they leave? It was the only show that was captured in Hawaii and made you feel like you are part of all! Few should make it open on DVD! I looked at similar exhibitions, but nothing was nearby. The cast had an amazing chemistry and I looked for every part and expect too much. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake to attract the show. If someone has any information about where I can get the American Shore DVD please send a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
