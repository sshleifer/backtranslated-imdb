I am not usually a fan of severe romantic movies but this hearing was good. I was surprised. Easily a romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. It's amazing. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is useless as writing and leading. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are both natural and sweet together you really think is a couple. <br /> <br /> The movie takes once and does not allow to go. You can't look away and you can't stop listening to them. Even a short time separates your heart. <br /> <br /> This has dropped into my favorite array. The masterpiece.
