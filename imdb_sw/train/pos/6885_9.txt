It came with amazement. . It will affect & solve this film had my direct way to be reactive for people & situations. More clearly it was provoking the anger of emotions. Much like a destroyed child will be when he responds without getting their way. . .a fierce anger if you want. Thinking I was hiding this anger from others was the most difficult of all. What was this for me? Soooo love so much. . .aoo many blessings. Now I am in a submissive way to hear myself, and have a continuous attitude of gratitude for life. . Why it happens this time, without my wild prospects for life that somehow, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film has contributed to the freedom I now have to connect with others, without limits and expectations. . and connect with true love. . without fear of losing. . love first, and accept love offered.
