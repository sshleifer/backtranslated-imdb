Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come, the length is now standard and gone for a long time without it. (When a home video started, there were three versions of sessions and out of place.) Everything that you have read is true. No advocacy, and no live without it. Colors are lush and amazing look, and the production values ​​are good for Saturday afternoon kiddie epic. But no question. Santa all of Vs. Satan angle is so the jaw stopping STRANGE has made a movie hit at the same time and a fave cult once a home video actually has continued. It's good / bad / wonderful / is it? I only saw the TRAILER as a child, and I remembered IT for about 30 years. Including Murray on the highest voice. I told my older sister, and called me a liar and did not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where Santa against Add items such as Santa asking for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before leaving the Christmas night, the children want to seize him and make her a widow. dreams of 60 years. Like others here, I look at everything the holiday season now. (My election edition is Secret of Science 3000). But any old way you choose, the film is a closed and general interpreter (including Brianiac, by the way.) It has never made me. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS WANTS MARTIANS. Its parts can still make you come in or just inspire you. (How many parents do you know to go out to the visa on Christmas day? "If you get bored, just go down and leave the piano." DANG ..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, newborn, wonderful ... ?
