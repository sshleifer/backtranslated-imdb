Okay, this film begins as a movie of cheesy life and it is not good to even close through the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and cast is not properly addressed for the most part. For the first half of the movie the little girl was hit by my nerves. I don't think this is one of his best employment jobs. The only reason I bought the movie was because it was sold and it was Ellen Burstyn in it. He is bright but this is also not one of his good gigs to act. The story depends on the real events and which helps the movie. Actually, I didn't even have a movie at the first time and I was disappointed when I saw the ballo travel still, I mean. But all are forgiven when you reach the destination and the story is approaching. If this does not bring tears to your eye, nothing will be done! It's cheesy and predictable but it also makes you feel good about the world again.
