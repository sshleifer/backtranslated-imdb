I saw this movie on the movie when I was 6 or 7 years old. I loved him, and soon I have a VHS version. My 4-year-old children love this movie and have been begging again and again to look at it. I have enjoyed watching it again. Although you must accept it is not good on a small TV. I don't have older children so I don't know what they will think. These songs are very good. My daughter continues to sing to them regularly. <br /> <br /> This hope helps.
