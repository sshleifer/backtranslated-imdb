If you liked the "Pol politics" Roman Polanski, you should possibly look for "Planner" because it is such a concept, only with Polanski coming in and playing schizophrenic wacko. This is one of my favorite movies - second, after "Baby's Rosemary", of course - and it is a direct trip to the fall of the mind to the person who enters the old suicide victim. Other residents of the building are flaky and stickyers on setting the noise level down - even a little 'titter' becomes a great deal with Polanski, whose stars, it becomes paranoid looks and suffers from its loony more hallucinations and more like the film carries on. It comes up to where she is wearing and acting as an old tenant and you realize it's just a matter of time before deciding a tor re-making her bad leap out of the windowâ€¦ the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you've ever seen a film The Roman Polanski, you should know the expiration and bang with this flick does not disappoint. It is also better if you do not doubt the worries of the premise and just make it as an outbreak to be mad, because it's pretty trippy surreal time. Polanski is as beautiful as a concerned, shocking woman who, somehow, attracts a man known to Isabelle Adjani. We also see him running around the drag, which competes with all the tricks at the same time! Damn, makes for one bad chick! Therefore, fans of Polanski - who can actually look behind his thirty-year-old charges - should enjoy the "Planner" as a psychological journey of head ...
