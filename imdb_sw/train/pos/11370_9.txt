Traders - as much as I described the characters and their relationship with the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a high-quality film. This feature is immediately wrong and substantial. Stephen Rea's character striker, Burakov, is only interesting. For apologizing for him, his hangdog, always put-on the expression serves well. He is, as we in England would have to say about the characteristic series of the Taggart Expert, which should be bad because it sees three killings a week. That is not quite correct if Chikatila was run over several years. The key character (and I am writing this as the destruction of the Body Attack on the BBC1) is characterized by Donald Sutherland "Mikhail Fetisov". His stabilization of Burakov is stable. And it goes through Perestroika, and causes FBI's involvement to hide information. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is a must-look, even if I am concerned.
