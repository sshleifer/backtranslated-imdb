By the way the actors are working on their project they have many kinds of cast. The beautiful CGI of starship in their BUT's green screen requires a certain task. Anyone who has heard about Adobe After Effects 7, should buy their keying best. <br /> <br /> The story is well thought, a lot of things to go on in this setting in the right setting. But the idea of ​​kissing the two people makes the wind go on that place. I am not a self-discriminating person but is an improper support that I do not find men kissing (they do not have women's minds). However ... For a series of fan this is a good thing. For little improvements on their green screen, push work and leadership leadership of this series is stunning. However I recommend this series for who ever enjoyed TNG and DS9.
