I don't know how Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actor Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this but see this again remind you of all the doubts about Mrs. Paltrow was in the first place! I had been away from the woman and I still feel that it is slow in her "Shakespeare In Love" operation of Oscar but she gets all the beats here - it's close to Emma Woodhouse. It may have won its Oscar for Shakespeare but it must be remembered for this. <br /> <br /> Of course, surrounded by the great support of support including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and al ... Jeremy Northam is very interesting as a love interest, even if the script allows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all the tension to get out of their relationship); A couple of years over, Ewan's hair is much easier to take than it was '96 and, personally, I find Alan Cumming breathing presence of subsidies in anything today. But standing is, of course, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this edition requires is where Emma agrees with Miss Bates, if she is the character of our fate we are looking for. The film should look at (again) for its own performance. All of them, this has grown up with amazing charm and spare parts and more than enough fraud to solve the UK class system. Such a lease value (because it is impossible that Paltrow will no longer be this - but we will have Emma).
