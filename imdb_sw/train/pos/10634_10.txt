In order to stop his gay friend Albert (Perry King) from the Belgian dismissal, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry her. The only problem with that is that Stella herself is a girl. Two have a different life at one night after Albert's birthday party, they fall in bed and then in love. Later in the film after the fall of love, Stella Albert accused of cheating and reflects his work one night after being closed. What she finds will go away with the viewer wondering. This is a good film, very natural. King Perry and Meg Foster are very good in their roles that are amazing that they were not well recognized for their work here. It was very controversial about his release in 1978, "R" was tested for the current film "PG" during this period of independence. <br /> <br /> Recently released on the DVD, the disk has a part of "Making" on special features and in it has said that the film was the basis of real stories so viewers who say the film is not "real" is wrong. Everyone is an individual and the difference falls in love because they are different â€” these are investigations in this amazing film for everyone who has ever loved it!
