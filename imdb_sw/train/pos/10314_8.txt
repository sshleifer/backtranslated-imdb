This and its "Pilgrim Soul" are two parts of my favorite likes in the new Twilight Zone. As mentioned in my comments on the new series, there is something that does not exist in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize a lesson that should be learned. It's a little more than a mawkish and more emotion than the Serling version. However, this passage can be considered emotional as well. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never connect. I remember I was not surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later went into the "House of Lake".
