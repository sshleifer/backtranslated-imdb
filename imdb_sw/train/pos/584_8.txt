A good film dealing with an adult's life as he looks back over years. From 1910, he reminds him of his boyfriend and youth; his family, friends, romances, etc.. The biggest piece of the finale and the horrible .... "All things in life are gathered like one, and the river flows that way and the river protects me." Value to see.
