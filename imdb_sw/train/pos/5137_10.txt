Interesting, fast-fast and exciting. I am not one of those people who look for loads and loads of television. I refused on this show when home patients and bad cases of a fever one day, and once it was discovered. I was very low to John Burke. Both she and Claire did a wonderful job of attending the show together. You can say that all liked their work. <br /> <br /> The super collection groups were excellent. I found myself interested in things I had never given to one mind. <br /> <br /> What I would like to know is: Something happened to Jack dog? Did one of the soldiers use him?
