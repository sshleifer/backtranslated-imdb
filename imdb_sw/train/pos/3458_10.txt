Giving Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin had a great transparency. The humanitarian glory of Cassidy, courage, charm and wit - all for self-degradation, a little slight smirk on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best killer (seen three times) in the Columbo series. This performance (and the first), is my favorite part of the ever-hands columbo. Steven Spielberg witnessed a new camera function (yes, there were shades of cameras on a regular basis with the characters) making nuances and banners in different angles and striking between Columbo and Franklin. Also, panoramic and tight in shots in Big Bear Lake, CA (the home of Franklin cabin) were very surprising <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen this section, then you commit yourself to doing so - it's truly a jewel. Jack Cassidy was a good actor and singer. His creativity was very infectious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and was indeed sad - indeed he had better years before him. Rest in Peace Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
