JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This film was worth Gene Siskel, but after watching it I don't know why. The film is obvious and original. It even has a fascinating dialogue on a regular basis, at some point of winter, and "black" that attracts. But it's not just entertainment. It also does not do much of the mind, in the plot but especially in the impulse of the character. I don't know anyone who acts like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a complicated continuous film - I say don't accept the challenge.
