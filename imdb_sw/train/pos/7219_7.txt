Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY!, The screen shot of Jay Presson Allen's famous Broadway film of Ira Levin could not wait for the stage to install the body before putting it on the money screen, so manufacturers decided to do better. The White Way! The opening and closing films are shot in New York's Music Box Box where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even the last fadeout of the film on the marquee of the theater is the most popular version of the stageplay. (Although the color symbols decided to go with the Rubek's Cube icon the most fun for the film.) <br /> <br /> Now on the release of DVD at low prices, DEATHTRAP looks like clean and inclusive as it was. Healing is just the same (better than their counterparts) and areas of the area should be grateful for finding a suitable house for "one room, its two" activities. Opened with simple and innovative ways, the director Sidney Lumet carefully searches for "new" devices at the beginning and end of the film and chooses the Levin center of evil only. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is the main departure of Hollywood from the board, and it undermines one of the Levin Symbols from the beginning of the film [Helga (about dagger): "It will be used by another woman for play . "]. As Robert Altman's player, however, our new finale helps the film on itself once again and turns the lines between action, screen, and (can it be?) Real life!
