My school subject club will show this show at the end of 2002, and I can just hope that we deserve this! I watched this film recently as a kind of "study" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I would just say, Vanessa Williams is very cool! Wow! Offer to this movie was the same-for (for one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything that he can't do? He was the most beautiful Albert Peterson ever - I especially love all the funny face face and play during "Put on Fun!" He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said earlier, is more cool. She was a good Rosie, and her change from the secretary to seductress was completely reliable. Tyne Daly was a cousin as Albert's proud mother and George Wendt was as good as Mr. McAfee's angry (however I loved Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 edition!). Brigitta Dau broke me as the Ursula Merkle; he completely finished! And Marc Kudisch was a wonderful Conrad Birdie ... "Wait!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting which I did not understand, and, as you will see from the previous view, many others didn 'telephony. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was it? I mean he is very good and very talented, but ... he looks too old for the role. Eh, maybe I am a fraud. <br /> <br /> Properly anyways, I highly recommend this movie. It will leave you exciting! <br /> <br />
