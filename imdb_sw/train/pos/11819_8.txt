It just took on the DVD and watched it again. I love white color against dark pictures. Not a big fan of Beatty, but this is the best movie of popcorn. Pacino is surprising, as always, and well, this film showed a period where Madonna was completely sexiest her. I wish he stuck with "Breathless" looking for a long time. Charlie Korsmo is the first great responsibility, except "What about bob?". The effects of the makeup were cutting edge and are still in many parts. Good conditions and emotions that transport you directly into the comic color environment. Cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even road lights and loud sounds, not to mention the full lighting, although the red color events can get tad sad, because it causes a little stop. Just want Beatty has found the opportunity to do the sequel. All in all, a few hours of happiness.
