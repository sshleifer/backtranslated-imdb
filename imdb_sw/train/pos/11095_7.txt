I've always loved this film John Frankenheimer. The beautiful script with Elmore Leonard and the main reason this was not just another exciting is because of Frankenheimer. His direction of taut and attention to the little details makes all the differences, even employing the porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case in which its last film Roy Scheider made. I have been saying that Robert Trebor often made a very bad performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity and his awesome performance and he is also good but I thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer should not be proud of this film as others but it is a very successful thriller of heroism, murder, sex, drugs, and realistic porno actors are seen in the wrong places. What? What can you say about the film Ann Margaret is being shot by drugs and raped? The pleasure of guilt say the least. Discrimination has a truly interesting role with a young boy Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. Wonderful exciting unusual that should not be forgotten.
