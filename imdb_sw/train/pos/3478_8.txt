This was really my series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought every part was more intense and uncomfortable had a lot of creative ideas placed in them (and even awesome and reliable too). Some of the good events were "I left my Neck My San Francisco", "Thousands of Twenties Between the Sea", "The Ghoul, The Bat And The Ugly" and "When You Want On The Stars" If you have never seen these events please do. This series was a mixture of although there were other events that did not seem to have such a sharp edge like "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "Ransom Of Chief Scooby". As a series before it, it was very well put together, an interesting and derived story. If everyone says though, it would be better without Scrappy Doo. This attitude was tired and revealing the story that had been told.
