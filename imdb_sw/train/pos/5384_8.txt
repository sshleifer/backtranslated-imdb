I thought the movie has done well for the film planned for TV, and it had many stages and humor. I have seen the value of entertainment worth watching, and could look at it again or show the same. I am disappointed that Sean had no reputation here on IMDb. I can see the possibility of a series of steps according to this concept or sequel and Sean again playing for more advanced financial tests, since his life would be on the line again. I felt that Sean played very well, and reminds me to actress Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux Our Days of Life - Opera's Soup.
