The mission was good, and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, who I love from previous films. The movie was a great movie of the family, there is nothing that makes you anxious to show young children, a line of good news, lots of lots, lighter and fun. If you want to entertain children without exhausting this tears fits the bill. Kid fun, and not difficult for a parent to watch, either.
