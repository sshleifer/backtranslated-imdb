I often enjoy watching movies that make you think, and don't answer answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and although most retirees have said that it is difficult to follow, and a little of the accumulation and open mind I have found. At first. True, it does not compare to other mental buttons as "Participant characters" or "Memento", but to its right is an intelligent and stimulating film. Another thing I liked most about this film is how good it is. Every area, every angle of the camera appears to have been considered for a long time. If you see it you will know what I mean. So, completing ... look for a clear mind and you can please it. If not, well, nobody ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
