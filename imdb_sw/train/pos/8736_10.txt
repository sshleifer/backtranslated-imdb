You will be surprised by the amazing modern animation of the computer, and the money should not wear first, second or third to watch, but it will be directed by the characters that are simple but interesting, so that you can actually find it in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel like a little child because of the middle. Disney continues to hold the title of "The world's largest animation", and "Bug Life" stands as one of their greatest achievements. One of the most creative “out-takes” buttons has been added to the end of the film. The DVD has two outdoor sets that take place where I have told the VHS region has one version of the change for each tape. The DVD also has "Gerry's s Game" which is a bit of PIXAR short version which was also shown before the film on the movie. It is the best film of insects in comparison to Dreamworks? "Antz", which for all rights is good, but it has nothing in the animation and in the development of stories and characters. If you are looking at both stars' stars, "Antz" is largely thrown by the stars "star" stars and the stars "star" stars, where "Bug Life" is the opposite, full of "Star" TV and Kevin Spacey as a unique variable. But the difference in quality is different and is obvious. It can be judged or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your job to refuse it. This is a kind of film that almost makes me like to have children to share with. Don't think for a second that this is just a movie for children, though.
