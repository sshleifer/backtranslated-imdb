Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte's fans!) And it has to feel somewhat, but all to make and act is very brilliant that you don't want to watch any other versions! Timothy Dalton is Edward Rochester ... it's easy. I don't care what other critics say he is very good. Dalton is interesting, certainly, but no good boy. In fact he has a craggy, an angular dark charm which, in my mind, is quite in the care and wonder, very masculine Mr R. And takes Rochester's sadness, suffering persona so poignantly. He shows a breach when the area calls, but it also reflects Rochester's tender, enthusiastic, emotional as well. (IMO new production of A & E facing the Hindus of Ciaran - who I usually adore - apparently bluster and distracted its way around. I have read the book many times and I've never seen that Rochester had meant to be known as nonstop snarling animal.) novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Mrs Clarke, to me, is like Jane as she identifies herself (and is described by others). Small, like a child, fairy ... although it is really an actor not watching 18, shows the characteristics of Jane well. While some reviews have claimed that his acting is a wood or an odd one, one must remember that this habit spent 8 years on the Oyod to be trained to hold his feelings with “natural passion” in the look. His great leadership was his childhood friend Helen, who was a portrait of presenting a liability. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to be angry and seem to be good, based on school goals for her students of love who will enter 'service'. Jane becomes an elder in the house of the rich Mr. Rochester. Certainly not * say him like the same. Even when he gave as he had, he would always be sure to remember that his station was under his employer's. However, if you read the book - which this production is approaching in a striking way - you can clearly see a small problem Zelah-as-Jane tolerates as she overcomes her feelings to remain strong and even angry. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just the same, I think. No, not less than Hollywood (thank God! It's not a Hollywood book) but they are romance which is true, dedicated and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never had any love * to come, she is a little miracle. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The behavior from the book is here. So, too, is a lot of initial conversation of poetry. This version is the only one that I know of including a beautiful, gypsy “and general” area, which reflects more humor than other versions I have seen. In particular, the mutual separation between leading characters comes directly from the book and is very fun! Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first female women. Finally he agreed to love for his own and self-reliant, and, finally, like the true Rochester. Very good!
