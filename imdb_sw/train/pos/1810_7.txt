I can understand why some people like this film, and why some people don't. For me, however, I love it so much, even if I saw good bits, and not very good bits. Animation was very good, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, Anne-Marie's best, talked to the late Judith Barsi. (I was sick when I read what happened to him) Also, Carface is a very villain lobby, especially saying with a wonderful Vic Tayback (I especially loved "Morons surrounded by Morons") and with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat perhaps it's very memorable for attackers all of Don Bluth. Charlie and Itchy just didn't have a mixture, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the films are very haunting, such as Annabelle "You can't come back", what kind of fear is still. Unfortunately, there were bits that I didn't like very much. The story had an unhealthy and unpopular character, but Disney's Black Cauldron had one problem. There were also other dark events, which young children could get upsetting, but the latter is very poignant. However, the big flaw was the bland songs and the way they sang. Not one of them works out, except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Love", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has made the best music. All in all, the visible movie, which can be more, but it is obviously remembered, and I'd look at it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
