It was impossible to understand why Jeremy Irons saw it was important to show the most amazing priority, spoken of the burning teeth, and from the back of his throat. In fact it was damaged by the film, and confused with what was probably a good performance with him (very irritating). No other actor or actor was seen to have such a smell and when I was always tested by Jeremy Irons as a good actor, I don't want this movie class to be one of the best. The film has made my desire, as some comments have been made to this film, which I have found very interesting, and interested in reading the book now.
