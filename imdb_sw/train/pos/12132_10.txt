It enjoys despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard has Philip as a flat, irresponsible character. One should feel compassion for this person; however, I enjoy Bette Davis' Mildred. Mrs Davis gives her best performances (obtained a Academy Award for the Academy Award). Thanks to her performance she brings this very unpleasant movie to life. ** Make sure you don't lose it when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels about it.
