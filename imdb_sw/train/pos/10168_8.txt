See Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the movie about a dead girl hate a new partner. It is Gabrielle from the housewife and boys who were wearing "Panther cologne sex" in Anchorman. If you expect the Golden Globe selected movie then you should rethink how you look at the movie. However, if you are interested in stopping the truth for 90 minutes and you want to watch a wonderful film then you have come to the right place. All characters are funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He was wonderful if he was on Friends and was funny and good looking at all at the same time. I went with my wife, he enjoyed it and I did it too.
