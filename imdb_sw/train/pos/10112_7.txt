I originally got back in 1996 in one week to run to the cinema. I was fascinated by this and my feelings were never changed. <br /> <br /> Documents on good Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life with movies. There are interviews with people who worked with him or know him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are shared with videos from movies or some amazing restoration. It is interesting (somewhat) but it was really needed? I've seen all the films of Wood and they're just awesome. Wood had expectations but not a little talent to do. I can't say he was the best director ever but he is down there. Do we really need a docu on a very popular film manufacturer? I like as a fact that they did not try to make Wood out to be some kind of saint. More than a few of the respondents (especially Lugosi Jr.) liked the person and came in a great and clear way. They also ignore their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. It is still of interest if you are a fan of Wood. The best interviews include Vampira (who weeps Wood) and Dolores Fuller (long-term girl).
