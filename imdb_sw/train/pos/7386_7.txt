Okay, so Oscars seem to get a little hyper just every year. And I was riding "Gosford Park" to win (coming, Robert Altman was eligible for Oscar for years!). That said, I think it was a good time for Africa-American to win the Best Actress. In contrast to the passing inspector, the role of Halle Berry in the "Monster Ball" was more natural than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I've never thought of selecting the end for anything, especially the year that he saw "Mulholland Dr.". Among the things I had predicted were the things about September 11 attacks; I knew that they would go to say something about freedom. Yes it is. Robert Redford should know well. But again with the passing inspector, Whoopi Goldberg is not the largest host (among the former forces Bob Hope, whom I have no respect); I loved his jab in John Ashcroft. So, although I did not offer "Good Good" Photo, "The Year's College Awards 74" still enjoys me (I must admit, I enjoy Oscars over my own birth).
