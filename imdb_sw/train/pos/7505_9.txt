If there is one type that I have never been a fan of, it's biopic. Always lose, filled with false information, more dramatized scenes, and round fraud, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (Good Beautiful), it often makes great freedom for people who try to capture on the screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of values ​​and many of the biopics that make their way to the big screen and Notorious Bettie Page was not different. Some critics and journalists opposed Gretchen Mol were given a chance to Bettie Page, saying he was no longer a celebrity and did not have chops for that part. I never had any doubt that Mol could handle parts since, but I did not expect to have a blow as far away from his performance as I was just watching the hours of the film. Mol provides the best performance of Oscar as the style of the 1950 girl, who, after a life of abuse (shown false and mildly, something of a few directors doing) is undoubtedly one of the most common examples of all time. The picture refers to a lot of land in its 90 minutes but despite less than a third, there is still a sense that there may be a small part of the story. Director / journalist Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is just marred and also suddenly and not clear if it should end up. However, they should lend to two women by creating a biopic almost inexpensive that can pay taxes to both its subject and the decade transfers skillfully. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should receive a selection. No doubt it will happen, though there are no more likely three women. 9/10
