Is the film showing music for Curtis Mayfield to be bad? Unable! The groove Tube is a series of black-colored sculptures that feature anything from 2001 to Olympic. The top, (clown clown, easy recipe of steam) over the lows (very long "sellers"), but even lows are funny. The best is the dance of Ken Shapiro of manic under the busy way of Manhattan (Hipi is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Only You, Just Me). Of course date now, but at that time the Tube Groove was not honest, bold, shy and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this small ritual, then 7 years later made Christmas day open a bomb, modern problems (though I loved it) and since then, unfortunately, there is nothing (he may have dance in jazz group) Groove Tube remains to me the burst of good energy, the movie which 26 years after my initial look, still brings me real pleasure!
