At first I saw this part as a shock to me, it was the first time I saw "24". The faster things are happening, it's amazing, exciting, and even interesting, almost as if you read the book; as soon as you start, it's very hard to stop. From Richard Walsh's minutes was speaking privately with Jack on the possibility of having a mole inside the CTU, I was sitting at 6:40, which means 10 pieces !!! (Sounds of funny and mad, but I'm kind of a guy that when he is interested he just can't stop) This series is one of the best of the kind. And it's building through having several different stories that are connected together. Recommended for every way!
