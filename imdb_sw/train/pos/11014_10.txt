I enjoyed looking at Cliffhanger, at first the woman (Sarah) filled with fear when she dropped, I thought it was a horrible scene if I wanted to think that when you see it, your nerves in your body come to you because it makes you full of fear and your heart blows fast. I liked to look at Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a good actor and I think it will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
