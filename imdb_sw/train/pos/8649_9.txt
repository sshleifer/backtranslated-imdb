I bought it this time but somehow I have refused to look at it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis though I'm not different from Brad Pitt. After looking at this I must admit that it is quite good practice - its character was quite reliable, and I did not think "Brad Pitt" completely. Unfortunately I can say the same to David Duchovny. I am a X-Files fan and I needed to double-check the date of this film, as I thought it was made a few years later. I love Duchovny but I've got its two-dimensional character here, except where it makes a voice-overs. That part was strong, it seemed to have a character, a good attitude, etc. Otherwise I kept thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was treated. Why didn't I see him before? (I'll have a look at seeing some of the tasks that he has done and see them asap) I'm a little worried about voting for Lewis, this film, and "Natural Born Killers" (favorite favorite). Although I see different characters - in NBK he is an already accomplice, but here he hates violence and tries hard to recognize the dark side of the woman until it spreads his face. I enjoyed this film almost completely. In addition to Duchovny's behavior does not appear fully-formed (and perhaps "lighted" to some extent with Pitt's), it was perfect. I was also happy at the end - I am glad that innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was true, when, it bothers. If you like NBK you can also have this film, and vice versa.
