This fascinating and very effective sequel with great success "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is just a track for name. The stories are full of fishing, the Bigfoot fishery known as "Big Bay Ty" which resides in the Boggy Creek basin. Two brutal brothers and their older sisters, the most sensible (good feisty performance and good future, pigs "Strokes different" star star Dana Plato) goes into a deceptive rock to see if the story of the inner story can be true real live being. The three have lost to a severe storm and a fierce and furry, bear-like, humongous storm, but the gentle and compassionate Sasquatch comes to rescue the children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> A simple story of self-reliance, with the ability to ring for a rural town with deep detail, drawing characters of the country with warmth and great love, and with gratitude to develop The feeling in the organic, barrier, which does not exceed the stick-mappy mushroom.
