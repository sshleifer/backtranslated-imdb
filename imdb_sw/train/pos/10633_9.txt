This film is unique if it is ignored ...... The different stories are just that, it shows how out of the need to live or maintain, one can get the ability to love if you have a clear heart and a clear mind. I first saw this on the cable at the end of 70 years and showed the barriers to the homosexual community at the time. I believe this movie was before its time in displaying a small piece of a way of life hidden. In fact it is a classic for that it was a precursor to what is now shown as extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that it is not just a common show of Meg Foster & Perry King can be identified, but to show how we have come and yet we have to go where relationships are involved.
