This movie was beautiful! It was the best artwork of the old story. This animation was unusual, but nothing new from Disney. It was better than expected for the Disney movie without singing. The original animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the people of Disney. Some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made for beauty and beauty of the environment. Music was very important but that was perfect for film. This was not a film that needed characters to check the song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
