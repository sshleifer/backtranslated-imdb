This movie is perfect for all the world romantics. John Ritter has never been better and has a better line in the film! "Sam" blows near the house, it is nice to look and very happy to play together. Ben Gazzara was best cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've got Arthur on my trip somewhere. All around, the best option to take any evening.
