It seems Ruggero Deodato came out, early, that his story would not be used if he had reached it very carefully, so he decided to set up camp. The result is a film that can be viewed as a hard sword-and-magic epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. At the moment of the well-conducted year, Paul Brothers clearly states their material (even hits an apartment with each other in one place!), And there is also a good, powerful, beautiful and beautiful Eva La Rue, as a girl who includes " boys ". Plus, where else can you see the insides of the dragon shines like discotheque ?? (***)
