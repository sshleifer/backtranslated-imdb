I read the preliminary view that says this film is losing steam towards the end of the film and also has the same end as Cape Fear. I disagree completely. I will give them a simple review to the ordinary people of the movie out there. I thought giving it was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed's best exhibitions. What a bad psychopath! I have great respect for her acting after watching her performance in this film. I was sustained in this movie. If you like the exciting exciting then this movie will definitely want to see. I also saw Scarlett little Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of top stars and I highly recommend!
