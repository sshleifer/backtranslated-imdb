I should say despite the views of the Angels of Outfield were very good movie. I love the fact that it teaches children to have faith always and never refuse because it is a miracle that can happen. Unlike other baseball movies this one movie came out because of the amazing hits amazing surprises and beautiful music of the most interesting music. Although I loved this film had some flaws such as deficiency (ie at the end when Ray Mitchell plays a homer is not appropriate on the plate and therefore it will not be a mark. don't leave it.
