Easily budget sub-less awesome movie at all. I saw this film first when I was about nine years old, and I must say it was scared from me. Since I have grown up, however, I see this film why it is true ... work of courage. Everyone, or at least everyone who has any taste, has seen a snowman going around people, even if they don't. I've been discovering the real thing about snow people, so naturally, for a junkie of fear like myself, hiimovie was a real dream. Some people say that this film is romantic, or no sense of any sense ... is a movie about the surprise striker of the sir, what are you expecting of the spirit? Anyone who gave this film the lowest score is also eligible to sit back and have a good laugh for the stupid one and inexpensive cheap. I love this movie why, comedy, and until the movie industry has risen and makes the worst fear on the killman snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) I ever hold this great piece of indie fear around my heart.
