Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-story-and-full-steam-in-front budget-scientist about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become a witness of a series of events that increase in the level of cunning; it seems, they have been found in time, where previous, existing and upcoming. This is an apology for a special effects of exciting effects - natural light and voice sounds, such as dinosaur organisms that have each other, friendly and small ET who entices the grandson, and so on. This picture shows a few ideas, if nothing else. Very good music by Richard Band, special effects of working from David Allen's loved ones, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and important, a suitable family is an important asset. It produces a sense of surprise like a child; it is possible that it is more than a loss for children (or children in most of us) who can delete any errors in the information or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; is a short and sweet player (80 minutes), with a good loan to director John "Bud" Cardos (the famous "Kingdom Spiders") popularity and executive executive Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
