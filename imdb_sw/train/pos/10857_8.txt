Johny Make here one of his best practice exercises, and make a powerful film with a beautiful story of Yakuza. The choice of the new Yakuza boss is the beginning of the war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the violence is wise to use in the environment, making the film very severe gangs. I love the way he tells history, moving around all the responsibilities within the family of Yakuza, and making us see violence, as the only way they have to solve their problems ... A good example of the film suspension, rhymmic and arrange the way. One of Hong Kong's annual films. It's like the Infernal elements, but without the simple scenes of abusive acts, and the story of confusion. It is highly recommended for all Asian film lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, best doing in Spanish language lol)
