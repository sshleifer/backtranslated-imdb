We declined on the document, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and "we have remembered" without warning. Everyone who came into the room was opened on television and bad pictures of Edith and Edie who seemed to live their lives in one room of a large house raised on the beach, eating ice cream and cob on a cob (which was cooked on a bed table) - and the cat running on the edith bed with its unbelievable words, "I enjoy [smell]." We did not see the beginning and wonder what we were looking at and how these historic women could reach the position they had. Spellbinding! you must see !!!!
