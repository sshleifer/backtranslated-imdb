I enjoyed this film. It was able to do something that the little movie does now; provided the family values ​​when you despised me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a good example for young girls looking up. The little girls I had enjoyed the movie and we kept talking about Nancy when we got out of the theater. The movie has fewer problems with the family and I don't think parents will get bored in the theater. No, it will not succeed Oscar and it did not show any special effects or even to give you a terrible mystery, but it acknowledged me and stood by the spirit of books. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a little girl (will love him!) Or any fan of books. Not eligible.
