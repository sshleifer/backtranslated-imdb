I approached this film with low expectations but I was very happy. It is very good and blows hands down the movies of recent football play, especially "Strictly Ballroom". Although music is good and play for color, for me movies is not about playing. It is about the Japanese institution that offers male office workers long to work with free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have a complete family with a large rental house and a restriction of life. She is fascinated by the attractive appearance of a young woman in the dance studio during her journey and this prompts her to try to play football. Also Japanese is the fact that the interesting purpose that introduced its new passion is clear but somehow accepted, at least finally, with family and audience. The soccer play, as shown in the film, is obviously not Western, although discipline and music are obviously imported to Japan. Therefore, cultural differences are interesting. Even without cultural knowledge, color, dance and passion for all players make this film enjoyable.
