That movie is not all that was good. Book is excellent. But movies were not so bad. It was interesting to say the least. The plan was sufficiently worried to keep me looking though I didn't say I wanted the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabbath Jr are both very good to enable you to look at :) They have a few of the wonderful places that should appeal to romantic. In general I would like to give a 7 or 8 film. It was not bad, a little plot of ignorance.
