Although I had no feelings for Lance's behavior, and I felt his wife could do better with anyone else. It could be a more powerful film if they had spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance- I would like to be better. However, I need to agree completely with DoyleLuver, when they said "And quoting the character of Glenn Quinn Ben: 'I'm a star in here, that's really a talented!" "If you watch a movie, watch him only, even when he is back ... his face-to-face words, all in the eyes, you know why inspires Ben, exactly how he feels about the view, even if it is looking quickly back to the back of the character. Great in the right film.
