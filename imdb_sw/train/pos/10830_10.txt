I enjoyed It is still more Crazy than any film I have seen in years. The successful band from the 70s decides to try another attempt. They start by playing some gigs in European seedy areas, with hilarious results. Music is wonderful, the script and acting are strict. The characters are the top spot, especially the lead singer and the loud sound of metal, makeup problems and personality. The last festival was not possible. Go see it, preferably in movies and good sound system :)
