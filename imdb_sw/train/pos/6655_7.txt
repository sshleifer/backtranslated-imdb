It is one of the best Indian movies I have seen recently, rather than a dance song and dance or slum movie dog. All executives have expressed the correct sense to the appropriate level and the right time. It marks a beautiful cinema, which makes the viewer come back and reflect the subject, which is exactly what I looked at Harilal. I often enjoy the trick of Akshay Khanna's trick working and surprisingly had a tough relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, though not as Gandhis and wonder how to help him describe this character. I was attracted to the direction and 2 thumbs up to Anil Kapoor to produce such a classy movie.
