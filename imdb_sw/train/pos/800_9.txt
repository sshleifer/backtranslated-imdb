I can't be more happy; Just eight years old in 1983, I watched the movie Star Wars on the theater! The good day of my life was about to happen. At that time, my experience of Star Wars was just an exhibition of a few HBO Star Wars. I did not see even the Empire faces Back. <br /> <br /> And the boy, that day gave me a miserable eye. Jabba. Great revolt periods. Emporer. Green-bladed lights! Wow! Since that magical day, I had to watch these films. I can't even create accurate estimates at this point. With these many comments, I have certainly noticed that this film - REAL Episode III - has its own mistakes. <br /> <br /> Of course in the film's Star Wars mode, these "errors" are similar to "quirks". Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had a mine. And this was my movie's Movie Wars.
