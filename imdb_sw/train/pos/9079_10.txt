This show will be successful because it attracts all adult adults regardless of their relationship. As a married man for 26 years, I feel Patrick Warburton's behavior: he loves his wife, but he thinks he knows it. I also enjoy its monotone delivery; it never gets excited or very low. A beautiful chapter of characters. This will be a good supplement to Monday night's line. I don't know how David Spade will be in his place. It is best for small doses. She also seems to be a young man still kidnapped by women. I enjoyed the experiment and I hope to see how the series progresses.
