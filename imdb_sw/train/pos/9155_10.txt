Who came with the story is one sick person. I leased it to the sleepover of the party's sleep and all six of us had a reason from all of us in a class, and we know a few of the class participants. In addition to everyone crying all night, I had a wonderful pain. I continued to think oh my God, if I would go to the bathroom to go to pee I would be hurt in the middle of wiping or something. I couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this awesome movie. I also thought why all the girls do not know about this film but we have no boys' links? You should make a terrible film where the killer is a girl to stop units. I would like to watch regularly. Call hard or soft or something like that. I only give this film just because you define MY EXPERIENCE.
