I think the comments on the show that cheesy is a little too exaggerated. When someone comes to watch TV, what does he watch? It is a pleasure that he looks at the show, unless he / he criticizes or someone who tells the story. But most of us are not so watching and relaxing and relaxing. HOUSE Full is the best show to look after having a heavy day in office / school. It laughs and not humor. Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a family of thought. If any family were in the real world, it would be a good example for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in showing the family of thinking on television. The very fact that the show can run for a long time shows that people enjoyed watching it, whatever that comment later. <br /> <br /> Another nice tip on the show is that anyone of any age would just enjoy watching it, but it could restore the message however that boy's message. Yese's and Michelle's conversations are very important, if one does not think of being a child. Overall I would say after watching every House of Full House, there is a deacon in your heart which is rarely present after many other exhibitions.
