After the "good work", everyone had been waiting for Claire Denis to make a follow-up seat that had never come. Now it has. Denis performs a relatively leap in this film, orgy of beautiful movies, elliptical editing and deliberate events of a clear story that feels amazing and even alien actions. There is a name plan (based on Jean-Luc Nancy's same name) about an adult who needs a heart transplant and who wants to give Tahiti's old son; but in particular is the observation of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a few views to fully understand, and has problems with hurrying to the end, but it is still higher and higher than anything else I have seen this year. Don't lose your risk.
