If another IMDB commentator says, this film begins slowly, but it gets very good if it goes along. Yes, it is given by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes on a single environmental landscape as a forerunner of high budgets such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, juxtapositioning of the wife's work as a singer singer singer against a collection of lonely and almost Freudian husband need to fill emotional and physical "empty" or "hole" when he away from the use of the wisdom of small impact and the environment is well done. Using a very small number of sites and characters, and also using water around each area as a sign of cleansing and sinking, this movie, though facing a small budget, reminds me of many ways to fully identify and recent trends, ie the film French "PIMMING POOL" which seems to me at least can borrow ideas of benefit from "UP IN AMANDA." With a small set of containers, UP to continue with AMANDA continues to insist on him with a negative, positive attitude to a constant temptation of desire, but it does this better or better than another film in this type. The destruction of Amanda's abuse in the past (again, the most freudian) is also very unique in this kind and interesting. I agree with other viewers about unexpected and sympathetic responses to Amanda's problem of the story is appropriate. Sent is the best guess. <br /> <br />
