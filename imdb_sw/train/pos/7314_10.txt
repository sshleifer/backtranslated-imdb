At first I saw this film, I liked it very much. What was the atmosphere that got my first and first thoughts. I expected to despair, but instead I had to look at the confusion of mind and head on the sound of the voice (it is really my ring now: P). The fact that I can't predict when he would kill and when he lost it was the main in my book. Scary films of predicting me came. Now, I know that story had a different difference, but, if you are like me, you don't know even long after the movie and sleep on the fact that you have seen the epicenter in motion. Finally, as I said, the sound of the voice is not available. It is one of my most beautiful features all the time, so I was very surprised to hear that Rob Zombie leaves it without meditating in his remake. Speaking on remake, I read a very detailed article on it and, now I know that Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, I have great hope to take him on this classic. This film is good at any time you are interested in a spine, but it is a perfect addition, opener, finale, call it to the movie's movie Hall Hall. :)
