I knew that I was going to see this when I got the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one reason, but the topic of holding your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a movie for children, but I think it's movies for babies who are discussing with aging, pest parents, our own deaths, our growing children and leaving us, and other things that we didn't think would happen to us. <br /> <br /> Movie does not fall into the trap of calamity; it's about what your life means when you have real life. Marriage is too small for a pitcher but it looks good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as a wife in good performance, emerged. The camera function is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left nothing unnecessary. Very good.
