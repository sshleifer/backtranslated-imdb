This film is one of those films that have long, long-term effects on you. I have read a review or two from angry people who I think are either of the republics or the attackers of children, and their harsh words say the film's power to deal with people and their secret secrets. There is no piece of art that laughed and laughed in me before and that's a miracle of the movie. The reality of the film and the performance of Bret Carr should not be. The closest situation is the interaction effect, will cause people to leave the playground or free to question their own identity. Bravo on the second level of the movie.
