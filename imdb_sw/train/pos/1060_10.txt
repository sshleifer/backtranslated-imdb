The Angel of Darkness is a cross between Huxley's New World Brave and the Percy Love in Chains - to show it not so far as a mixture of chaos and chaos, both in the worst sense of the word. Once a person can reinforce that all modern technology can be stopped by "Pulse," provides an enabling environment to explore the characteristics and relationships between the two primary characters - Max (Dark Angel / bike bike) and Logan (rich rebels). It seems to be different, perhaps the results of various authors, but it is held with effort, good, and charming Jessica Alba, who seems to be both strong and worried yet affected by the sensitive. I think Fox has done again.
