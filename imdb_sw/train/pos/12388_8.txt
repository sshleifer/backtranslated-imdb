I have read the book and I must say that this film remains true. I think this is the beginning of psychological attractions in the same type of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives the best performance as a guest, and Burgess Meredith gives the best player as a neighbor. I have seen this film at least twice and I think I'm going to buy the book with the movie for my collection. Waiting continues to build up to the end of the weather, misleading will not see coming. If you like movies like Signs and Village, Sentinel will be a natural introduction. Also, what is interesting is the actors in the film-you don't know if you have not read the credit. By the end of Jerry Orbach is as good as the business director and Jeff Goldblum is the best as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is less lying but is the greatest.
