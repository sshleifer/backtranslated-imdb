Anyone said that fear was not a kind of educational film, huh? Thanks to this wonderful film of hammer hammer, I now at least know never give it a wonderful visitor to every wine with a piece of bread and salt in my own home, because it can only be a hypnotist and this mix will give him the ability to control my mind & mind forever! Thank you Nyundo! The tenth in the series of Horror House is one that I have been expecting to see, because because the boy in the chairman of the director was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers but still sadly stood up. Sharp had the role of the hottest hammer film, like "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: Monk Madness", as well as self-ignored production as "dirty place" and "Psychomania". His contribution to the House of Anger is quite simple in a series, with a fascinating and exciting lesson that surrounds the beautiful theme of magic. The parts of the plot for two ancient businessmen who are caught up in a phenomenon that is similar to a mirror, but in fact it is an old rejection device that can be used to call Choronzhon; the guardian of the demon's pit. The mirror is very much needed by satanic worship because they need to celebrate their ceremony, but Michael is striving to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. While taking a frustrated girl who runs out of worship to avoid being a sacrifice, Michael is even given more in the magic system. The stories of Satan and the physical sacrifice of young women are a common topic of Britain, but David Fischer's screens are not available and provides a twite of a good plot, in the middle of which is the peak of innovation. There is also a lot of interesting tension, the dialogue is wit and the practice of the exhibition is royal (especially John Carson as a religious leader is actually eerie). Recommended!
