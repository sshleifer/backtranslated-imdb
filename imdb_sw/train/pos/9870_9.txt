With a very small budget of animation of only $ 60 million people in Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done a wonderful job. They have linked high-quality animation, Ray Romano Sound, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a powerful family-friendly film, friendship and take care of fellow members. And how sometimes it takes various creatures to form a cow. When watching this film I got a strong political message about collaborating with people who share your position - perhaps it is necessary to look at all the leaders of the world! David Newman - still another member of the Newman family of Hollywood - offers a very good score which is not yet recommended to encourage action and, sometimes, it is advisable to hit. The overall look of the film is amazing; fantasyland of snow, gases, mud, rocks and ice. Individual characters were also trusted too, and the face of Ray Romano's face Manfred's being treated exactly. The entire sequence and DoDos will leave the course as to whether the word "Secret as DoDo is from." - but true yet. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to see in the theater and buy for a house.
