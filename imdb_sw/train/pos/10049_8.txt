I am not a parent, nor am I a husband. But I was able to identify with everyone's heart and pain. <br /> <br /> This is a young movie film. Maybe that way they will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. Sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is good to see Ben 19 Affleck, with the ability to move and true. He showed at a young age, that he has the ability to act from the heart. He should be given greater responsibilities. Remember Hollywoodland ... its first major role in years and went to win the Best Player at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie can be counted by people of all ages. Perhaps not should be looked after by children under 10 years because they may be afraid that it might happen to their families, but I recommend to the whole family. I bought this film on DVD and watched it as friends often. Because it shows values ​​that are important in life.
