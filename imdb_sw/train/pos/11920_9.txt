Christopher Lloyd is funny and really reliable as "Al-angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has special effects that first did not have a conspiracy with the best writing. It is written for children, but adults are very happy as children do. Tony Danza is doing a very good job in his role - but this is not a taxi association. Danny Glover is really good and even seems to be human very much in his feelings such as showing the real talent of acting for change, positive change. See at least once - it's an attempt to capture.
