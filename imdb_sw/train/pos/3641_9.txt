This movie has several things going. It's “feel good” story. The characters and actors are proposed, in fact and now they show good performances. The most important thing, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to catch and throw baseball. Robert Redford looks good at all throwing and batting the bat in "The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in" The Love of the game "and" Bull Durham. " "In" the Premier League, "Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed like they knew what they were doing, but many of them did not, and the picture was very clean - and not very funny. , even when the story may be interesting, showed a lack of baseball capabilities for part of the headings, they were older in this regard. In Stratton Story "and" Air Command Strategy, "Jimmy Stewart looks like as credible as a professional player baseball, like your overweight, is not athletic, an old uncle in a softball game in a family corporate. Dean also showed the level of baseball capability that will put them in the late round when "select-up" for the game on a Sunday picnic (even if it is locked, and even if your uncle was involved). > The Quaid school team's secondary school show, which she attends with her efforts by Ray Ray, and those who play in her two small leagues and in the American League, are all believed. Participants are honest and competent. In addition, he is a participating actor who always offers talented and accurate works (except, by degree, some of his "top-up" events, and his forced force, in his show of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely on the goal here, and this movie is "9," good, or better, like all others of this kind, except for "Natural."
