When the two authors make a screenplay of the fear of Breakfast at Tiffany's Breakfast, you know something is going straight. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope, and Sally Kellerman are the best actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. Events where Patrick looked Holly up and down as a sort of objectifier, those were just amazing. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Visitors nearby, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a great place. The little gummy animal was very strange. Nathan was a very good cat. But what was the area that Patrick followed Holly on cesspool and Mr. Gooding won? And the area with Dr Wallace? What was he doing when he came down there? And not every man has a woman, like Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew out of Victor, it was strange.
