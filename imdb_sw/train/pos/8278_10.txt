If you want to scream or anything like a great label brand that encourages us today, don't worry. This well-written film has made me think about all that said. The importance of stories in our lives to be wise, how children interpret the world (and violence in it), our destruction of the environment and the ignorance of history and all its stories here, but not on the face. You can call the "movie monster" even if Wendigo is not suitable for the physical form until the end, and then it's up to you and your beliefs as it happens with the soul of the creature / story. Some of the most exciting aspects of those who just look at the foundations and films never change, although in fact they are not less than the visuals of the creature, it is better. Fessenden continues with the traditional success of George Romero's use of genre as an example and as a forum for discussion while we still keep it creeped out.
