My name is JULIA ROSS is the great joy of 1945 of Joseph H. Lewis, of course, one of the leading directors of Hollywood films. This 65-minute Oddity from Columbia Photo came after a long lecture of Lewis as a supporter of the western line of poverty, East Side Kids squares, horrible melodramas (including the wonderful Lugosi The GREAT shorti). INVISIBLE) with a typical BB studio (SECRETS OF CO-ED, BOMBS IN BURMA, FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, etc.) --- all that will put the step easily for what come from great talent and mounted Mr. Lewis. My name is JULIA ROSS (with SO IN NIGHT from the following year) he founded a director who had learned an unusual and stylish art to tell the problem of dark and irrelevant and efficiently in a smaller budget. Later Lewis's production as GUN CRAZY (1949) and BIG COMBO (1955), despite the widespread scope of their story structure, continued to depend on the function of the bridge, lucidi and basic lighting. And much resources. My name is JULIA ROSS probably wants more of the British secret (installed in a closed studio with Britain) than it is with a typical view of films and events. The little woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take a place in the house of an old woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after the arrival arises from a deep sleep in a very strange house, and by surprise, with a new natural identity â€” an old woman-in-law. He explained that he had been affected by nervous breakdowns, struggling to understand the negative and seemingly hopeless condition of his problem. But before a short time he begins to combine the mysterious truth of the mystery behind this dark secret, that his "husband" (always causing George Macready) probably killed his real wife and that he has been excluded from participating in a sharp and evil plan. Much of what is describing this unfamiliar story is a lasting touch that Lewis brings productivity, indicating that it is the first of its real efforts as a film director.
