This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this dead (so-called zombies) they have been eating food. However the company has developed a cola which, while around the necks of the zombies, makes them weak and perfect servants. The mother of Robinsons Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and Timmy son (K'Sun Ray) employers zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim mentions the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things don't work. As you can see this - among many other things - take on "Lassie" series and Fido to Stand for Lassie. I have been very pleased when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the eating zombies! It's also a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk film where everything is bright and colorful - but the dark secret is removing people away. (Moss is always in clothing) - instruments, settings and cars especially are in the 1950s in red color. Even when the script returns to repeat there is always something to watch. Everybody here is the best and right on the goal. Even Connolly as a sensory zombie feeling does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every line for all its value - but it is not available more. br>> This not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost to many people and gore is pretty tame. Gore is done so often and with fun music playing on it is difficult to take. So, for some people, this will really work. I offer 8.
