'' Sentinel '' is one of the best horror movies done in the Film industry! I think it's terrible as very few films are real. Alison Parker is an example with some features. He puts a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has a good friend, another example is Jennifer. Everything was great in his life, until he decided to live alone for some time and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is its neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly Alison begins to have health problems and rejection and rotation; He also remembers some of the agony of his past that makes him dream of dreams or deception. But everything has a reason, and it relates to a new home that he lives ... <br /> <br /> I find myself a 'Sentinel' movie with a creepy movie, and with '' The Exorcist '' is two awesome movies which I have looked at. When we find that Alison's house only takes the priest and my own blood is rising! It is also shocking to see that she needs to be blind at the end of the movie to be a new slave to get rid of this world.
