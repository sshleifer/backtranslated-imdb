I walked from beginning to end. Great fears come from the disturbing images and the shock of an organism that is created not to do you, but to make you go "What is the f * ck I saw only?" All the other participants gave a brief summary of what the film was about, so I can't get back what it said. I was telling others about these days of film after just seeing them because they are still haunted me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I am a fan of true fear, not easy to be destroyed and beaten as "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What he gave me a bad dream was to hear what I felt about what I would do if I was in this cell with those boys. What will my personal fear be? my knowledge took me there, and it was not interesting. That my friends are what a good flick of fear makes you! The best part of this movie is that it is a trick. It is not about Bogeymen who appear to you, invasion of aliens, or tons of year. It's the opposite. The fear you create in your own mind. The anger of the four characters is that fear does not give out of the external force that emphasizes that it is power over them. In fact, men ask one thing they want, and they get it ... but not in the way they thought. On the one hand, they find what they want from the magic book, but eventually they would not be. Sometimes being locked the cell of prison is a good place to be!
