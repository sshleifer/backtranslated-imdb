I first met seven minutes of Linda Feferman in Heaven when I was 14 years old and I worked in a video shop and I loved it. I recently watched the film again and I realized it was a lost treasure. Star films Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before going to win Oscar for Good Beautiful, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The movie is very obvious, interesting and advanced version of Pretty in Pink and some amazing 1980s, which is why it is very good. They are honest, not compulsory like these films, and parents will enjoy watching this film with children there. <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on business trips, Jeff convinces her that she should move because her home life is coming. With help from a friend of Natalie, Polly, played a lot with Maddie Corman, allows her. But this film is not about putting children in the situation and seeing what they can stop. The third guide is common with the script, surprisingly so honest, that what comes to the best in their performances is breaking the heart. These characters care about each other. It is a good film to show children who are teenagers before teenagers. <br /> <br />
