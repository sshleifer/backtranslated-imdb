This is your typical MGM fun and colorful color from the beginning of the 50's and it is evident on the best to look there. <br /> <br /> The movie was led by a specialist Vincente Minnelli and star Gene Kelly in the main lead. They both made very small movies back in those days, which may be more popular. Movie itself could win the best photos of Oscar over the year, which meant to beat movies such as "Place in the Sun", "Caravan Street", "African Queen", "Quo Vadis", "Blues , "Death of Sellers" that year. True perfection of course but at the same time is also a very small loan for this interesting, bright and entertaining movie. When you watch this film you will surely be welcomed by all, which also thanks to her film to look beautiful colors and many beautiful characters within this film. Music numbers have also been done well, which is not a great surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. But, in fact, could not have everything said in this film for an hour or so? I mean, we already know where the movie is going on but it still manages to make it all as long as possible. It's not that makes the movie present in any place, it makes it a bit more. The film can also be done with the low number of music in it. One of the best MGM's music, which is not his fault yet. <br /> <br /> 8/10
