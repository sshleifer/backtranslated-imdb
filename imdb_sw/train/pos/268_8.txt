I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (what is that right?) In Cybil. He did not come to see him for a while and forgot how much I missed him. I thought he did a good job in this. Support support was also good. At a certain angle, the daughter even appeared as a young man Nicole Kidman. Abductor was very good and the story had a good problem. The boy was a hottie. I thought the husband had nothing to do and certainly. I got a Modern Life Network for Christmas and I love these movies. Have my interest and I will look at it again when they re-enter it. Can someone else suggest any movies like this? You can write a board or send me a personal email if you want. Thanks in advance. Welcome.
