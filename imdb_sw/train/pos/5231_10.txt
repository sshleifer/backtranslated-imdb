to communicate in the most important film life - if what life is, it means? - it's sheer impossible. Of course the possible answer to these questions is shown in every film (story), but communication needs to appeal to an understanding. This happens if the input from the sensation increases the “input” from our mind, ie our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate important things. Tarkovsky, is one. Its "Stalker" shows pictures of existence, talks about life as it shows itself and still running your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing that.
