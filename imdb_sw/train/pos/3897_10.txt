This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends overnight and for some reason or other had channel-surfed for HBO in the evening. One person in the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried to laugh very much with his first joke. I did not want you to be “responsible” for the fun of something that was killing me. After you hold in my laugh for more health, I allow you to go - as we did the rest of us (we are not stones, by the way, do not speak insurance and pensions ...). We had followed it after that. The story line, conspiracy, incredible but skilled connections are not very short. I've been sent by every Eddie-Izzard-piece-of-comedy I can get my hands. His work is very professional. His comedy looks without power. He looks more like this very good friend who loved your home and was running on this or that ... It's very hard. He gives you the impression that jokes are between you and himself, the only aficionados of humor, after all. If you are disappointed in this video, you don't mean to scream - or humor, as they say in the UK.
