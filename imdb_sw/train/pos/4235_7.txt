.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally misled me !!!! Whatever happened to former Burton who studied "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as a study of his preparation to direct Batman back in 1988-89? In his opinion Burton did not study the book nor the reason the movie got everything WRONG! This film takes! It is not the same as the original and not associated with the same subject. If you want a good movie to ape look natural. <br /> <br /> ** out of **** stars
