I think this show is funny screamingly! It's not for every taste, and I can't lift or defend people who don't get it. I am sure they are good people who work in different proportions. But if you like it, you really like it. Sarah who lost self-called "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in human incidents (ie "Homerian" as "Homerian Simpsonian"). I remember Sarah Silverman from her short gig on Saturday night to live in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> This view is funny-your-food-and-rain-your funny pants. So I was constantly fast before watching it and wearing adult diapers. Look out!
