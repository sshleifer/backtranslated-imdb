After seeing his two pictures, I have agreed with Altman. Before, however, I have always written his style of making "film". You just need to have a good understanding of his knowledge of things. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is low conversion, and it is certainly very published. In fact, I don't think it's ever even given to VHS. Why is it? What? All the crappy films are getting daily releases, this loses back for good reasons? In fact, I didn't have real problems with this film. It was, for the most part, frequent and pleasant. Almost all things are interesting for some reason, whether it is a good conversation or a trick. There is a real skill here. And the stint of Paul Dooley down the beach half in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to get a copy of this little forgotten gem. It's not perfect, but it's better than the sludge out there to get a DVD audio. Hell, I would like to have fun with a good VHS copy of this thing. Most often in the Fox Center, however, see.
