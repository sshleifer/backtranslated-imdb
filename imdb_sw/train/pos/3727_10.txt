Tigerland is one of the most beautiful movies that I have seen, and in my opinion it is out of the perfect coat of steel, the same original film. Bozz is played well by Farrell, and is a character that stays in your mind long after the film is completed. The end is cut with a brilliant and schumacher - and a voice of harmony with the slow pace of the soldiers preparing to leave. It's a film.
