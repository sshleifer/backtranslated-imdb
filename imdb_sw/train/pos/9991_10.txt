I thought that this film was modern. I have looked at it often and strongly recommended it. Mel Brooks, it was excellent. The release was amazing. I don't know how this movie gets 2 out of 5. I liked it. this. I want to be regular but never enough for me. People who play homeless people were to compare the funniest levels as well. Please place this film often. I can't see it enough ..Leslie Ann Warren was also my other loved one, since Cinderella. I always thought that she was not very happy but loved her acting. In this movie was very funny .... and she and Mel did good work together. They should put more films on TV.
