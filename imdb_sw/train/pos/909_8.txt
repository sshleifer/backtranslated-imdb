I liked these movies. The other film of Yash that you know will look good on the screen, all the good qualities are very good or very discriminating which you know will eventually hide that good ... Another film of Yash raj is that hero or heroine; s has one parent or no. Think again of all these films. MPK Suman did not have a mother, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and the last rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath cried out. . It's a bit slow for the first time but lets you accept. There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. The little child (the nephew of the hero) is well placed and provides very good liners. Legs are very good but embarrassed you can't find it in real life. This film does not have a very happy family living in BIG's house which I was good and allowed to have different films and other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the film. There is no powerful message from this film but it is looking good. If you are married (the marriage process) the film will remind you of what you have gone through. And if you are not going to inform them and may be afraid of them. There are not many plots or small but very soft films, such as normal sound.
