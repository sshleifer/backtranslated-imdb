Perhaps the big achievement of Bigas Luna for her reaches a strong balance between sleaze, strife and surgery. Delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of the Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is something of young Biel Duran's pre-boy. He cannot get the stomach of May out of his mind and he wants to absorb and suck his own mother's milk too. His work in May is a film. As in Luna works like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a little understanding of sex to his wonderful but beautiful story. Ordinary suspects will be sad, but those with an open mind will enjoy this exclamation of the female breast. Jos√© Luis Alcaine's pictures are beautiful and the symbol of Nicola Piovani is sweet and rich. Interesting cinema movies of anarchic beauty that Spanish makes it usually.
