One of my favorite films, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotions, that is, humor, mind. The story grows, as with the lesson of life, just a very good film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Release is also a fantasic ..... a good choice of the most beautiful British talents. I loved them all for anything brought to the film. It should be a part of love to create a story like this, - everything about this film works. <br /> <br /> I love you :)
