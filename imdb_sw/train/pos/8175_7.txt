Before you start, I'm afraid of dentists. This movie gives me creeps and even makes me cringe. That's what I like about this film. The movie is kind of boring. So, I take 3 stars away! A / A * Alert Spoiler * <br /> <br /> movie refers to Dr. Alan Feinstone who has found out his wife has abused her. Recently, he begins to become more familiar and begins to disrupt his patients, kill co-workers, and even torture his wife to kill and kill the person he had. <br /> <br /> * Last Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is bloody and normal. I would like to recommend you if you are logged into a year. <br /> <br /> I give this movie seven stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein Sio Dentist of everyday!
