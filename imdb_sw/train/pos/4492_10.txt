but I want to say I can't agree more with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a very good film. I was thinking about this morning only, wanting to advise some dopey sod who could lose money on his debit card through fraud, and wanted to say "Put your money in your pocket" and realize I was saying as James Mason. Even though he didn't have those words, I still think he could! I've never forgotten 'Do you carry?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: 'Always have money in your pocket!' Good advice. Not enough children who have a father with an unforgiving attitude but a better sense. Or any father. It would be good for us to repeat 'you', 'your' and 'your' in our language to show that we care. It is similar to 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in Germany. Addition: I found that a lot of my words were about James Mason in the Way of Family! I think it's because I confused Susan George and Hayley Mills. Well, a simple mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand for a comment. <br /> <br /> And Spring and Port Wine are very similar to Family Way. When you found a girl in the picture those days, you had something to say and talk later, something that affected your world skills and your personal development. Exercise displays are real, and are important in helping young people grow. It does not happen now, I think, that young people can go to the picture as we did.
