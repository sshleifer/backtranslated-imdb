Certainly of course is a bright game that I have ever played. It is not unusual to shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually do not care very much), but gfx accepted, an interesting weapon and magic, great surroundeffects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and above all the wonderful circumstances . I love Scrye, which lets you, somewhere in the games, see or hear events that happened in the past. The only game I've got to take a normal break after a few minutes of play just because of the atmosphere of the atmosphere. I am a great fan of fear, especially in the story and movies of Clive Barker, and participating in a horrible story like this makes me love for more games that emphasizes the situation and more involving stories. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps, and maybe the game was short?)
