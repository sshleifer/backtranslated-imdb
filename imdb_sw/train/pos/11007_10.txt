Jeremy Northam's authors of the book of sirlivan's fight, silence and watch him allow his identity and pieces of his true identity under the influence of one malt handbags and under the winds of Lucy Liu's existence are brilliant and fun crafts. . Give him a cigarette on the bar is an old character, made without thinking or even asking and he loses his face, neck and lips. Regardless of the brain, love has a way to withstand it. Love also cannot "have a brain in" with her two fake men. In a slower pace, he begins to spread with his glasses, walk and talk differently and even his face is different as the film continues. Music is wonderful, you think, appropriate and drive at other times. The extensive use of black and white tones and gray makes this close to the "film film" in the culture of many classic performances. I would like to have the greatest risk of being shown to Lucy Liu, whenever she sees him in her different shocks, someone who loves and who works on the basis of blind faith, some prevents the possibility and stimulation of genuine sympathy and worries would have made limited performance directly on his side. He is not just a match of Northam's talent, but all in all I enjoyed this film and rejoice to know about other screenplay written by the author.
