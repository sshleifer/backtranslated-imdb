I remember this game. It was always sitting on the shelf alone, even one day I decided to try something new to change, and get this game. I watched very much, because it was the first PS1 I owned which had four records. When I played it, I did not put it under the controller, for weight. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is very good and deviated, it is almost like the final text of VII Storyline, and that's hard to complete. When you play the game, you get a lot of share with the characters that are just a PS1 game, if you feel like a film. And I believe it has to be made a film. <br /> <br /> This evil game is very unhealthy of the game and there is no one who has played or loved, for it is one of those games at the end of the shelf, and twenty 50% signals aligned on it, trying to sell. Yes, I am one of those people who always look at the last, and try them out and many of them are ready to be good. Heck, that's how I entered the Final Fantasy VII, looking at the list, and getting it. But this is different from the Last Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Dragoon's story, is a unique game or RPG which is better than many Squares Square games, surprisingly. I can't be surprised if it was done by Square Enix but it wasn't. Hardly any games I played are better than a series of Final Fantasy, or a Dragon's Eye series, but this is. But what is happening is why it is very unknown and should not, which should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics is very good on PS1 game, but can you expect from them? It is a PS1 person, conducted in 1999. The story I mentioned is amazing, almost to beat VII. The characters are amazing, you are very involved with them, and their actions. Sure 10 out of 10. Definitely deserves many features, and RPG done very well with another company except Square Enix.
