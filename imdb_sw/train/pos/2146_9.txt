I saw this favorite Japanese film in Roger Ebert's 5th film which was ignored at the historic Virginia Festival in Champaign, Illinois. Although this film, with English headlines, has a dance of the ball as its heart, this film shows the world outside Japan how strong family structures, jobs (salary), and entertainment are still in modern Japan. <br /> <br /> Author / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of submitting the family name (last name) first and the given name (end)] does not use the most popular theme to play for football to display of Japan. Also, I will not use the names of the movie character when world readers do not know the official Japanese names that can combine. I will refer to the executives of <br /> and their professional academic name as listed on the Basic Data Database.] <br /> <br /> Adds the support of his wife's real life, professional ballet dancer Reflective Tamiyo in its first picture and, so far, just a motion. He is a dance teacher on his father's dance studio. However, his real desire is to compete once again in the International Dance Tournament which was not sure from the past. No, I won't say "why." See the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. The 25-year-old movie film since 1979, offers a good performance of the company's 40 company that has a good wife, the daughter of a young man, and buys only her home. <br /> <br /> And yet, something is missing from its inner joy. Look at this film to learn how he is concerned and to play with the ball and goes to lessons / knots. Most of the characters play are saved from traditional <br /> Japanese leadership of social structure. Of course, this differs greatly from how the Japanese community is built and "everyone's place and everyone in its place" philosophy. <br /> <br /> The movie has many times funny. 1,500 exhibition games broke broke / scored in a lot of time during the most comedic moments. This confirms the knot of a foreign language. The former Takenaka Naoto actor is funny and brilliant with Watanabe Eriko, they are two characters of a funny character. begin to understand how <br /> <br /> the Japanese people grow in the structure social power. Watch movies "Will we?" is a fast immersion in further research and viewing others <br /> <br /> Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all. It's amazing, it's wonderful, it'll make you a little bit, and it'll warm your heart. <br /> <br />
