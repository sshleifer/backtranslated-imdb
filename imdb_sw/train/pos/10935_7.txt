Well, I must say that this was a jahan one of the enjoyable movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was very good, and there was an unusual time when the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, I had no desire. The story was very interesting: the last member of the poison family must follow up with five other members and identify who among them uses their knowledge of evil, and who uses them for good. To catch that during training, all the families had been covered, and all had returned to the community by hiding and changing their names. <br /> <br /> The fight is fun to watch, as each member of the family Family has a different style of fighting: string (favorite), snakes, scorpion, lizard, and centipede. Events fighting with executives jump everywhere, and thanks to the camera remains planted and uses a broad enough shot so that you can see all the steps. One view on the film is that the story relies slightly in the first half until the first sequence of fighting. But hold on to it, and you won't despair!
