TCM insists me all the time ... they continue to come up with films that I've never heard about ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... very early film with Visconti !! ... wow ... The Italian version of Postman Paint always double ... brilliant !! for the beauty done and directed ... Never heard anyone who was the best, Clara Calamai, like Giovanna, and especially, Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what is humanity !! more muscle and more attractive than anyone on screens in 1943 !!! His look was ahead of his time ... many of the men from the 1950s were led by him ... he should be the biggest star in the world! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and the lower edition than the MGM version (which I liked) by John Garfield and Lana Turner to remember these white dresses? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more than true and with a very different end ... see I look ... I'm going to buy!
