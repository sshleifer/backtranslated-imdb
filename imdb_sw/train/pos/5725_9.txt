That's what I wrote to my friends early: <br /> <br /> GIVING IN, A brave is, faithful to God, one of the awesome films I have ever seen! I nike get very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Photo performed the KICK A **! (Can't wait for Boogeyman!)! I swear, there were many jumping events that were not expected! I felt stupid but my nerves didn't care! I had all the movie edge, from the opening credit, and the music was awesome. I continue to think of that voice, however, and SIPI DO! I shouted for a few times, crying, "oh" in one place! Oh, yes, I even half my eyes covered a few times! The Word for the wise, though: I thought some of the events were a little psychological. My DH hated the Horizon event and thought anyone who wrote it is sick and psychologically, but I don't remember the movie so it can't compare. I can't say "I enjoyed" this film b / c I was afraid, but it was very nice and scary. The last part, too ... who! Being a 32-year-old mother, I think I can have a dream from this movie, especially because of the sound. Please get from my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a flick of slasher as I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a time-of-time movie spooky movie. Suitable for Halloween. Two big trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and Ring 2!
