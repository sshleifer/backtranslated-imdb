Great sounds, a lot of skill and clever conversations makes this movie very good. The addition of "behavior" to the three leading animals provides a detailed and more meaningful story, especially the relationship between the great colleagues, the Shadow, and the Hellraiser boy, Chance. Early versions of this film was not able to give animals a real personality or goal, which takes place perfectly here. Sally Field is recommended for anything, but actually shines in this film as a prideful group, Sassy. The main difference between the view of cats and dogs on life, and only the right amount of fuzzies of spirit and heat to make a plot with better resolution. There is even a positive and beautiful mark of the mountain. Exactly perfect for the evening or for children. Hats off to Disney.
