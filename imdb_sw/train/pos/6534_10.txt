I was hearing this film was good from many of my friends who saw it, and they all said it was strange, so I had a very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded these great expectations! It had interesting places, it gave me a sense of excitement and all the dudes trying to kill him, and Emma Roberts was wonderful like Nancy Drew. Some of the cast was very good, too. I would recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why those people tried to kill us?" Corky: "Well, I was surprised that too. In fact, it's kinda descending!" Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me." It is a pity! "<br /> <br> Nancy Drew
