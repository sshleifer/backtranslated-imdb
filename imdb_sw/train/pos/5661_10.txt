I see many people on this site want AG to come out of the DVD. Yes, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, not less!) Although it's good to have this bad show in the form of DVD boxed, I am angry with the fact that they added very few through "extra" (director views from Shaun Cassidy on the Experimental Times) The events are shown in the same format set on TV. The lost episodes that have not been displayed before running on the Sci Fi station are placed in the box, but are placed on the final DVD. If you are making a DVD, find out exactly what you should be looked at and you will be more happy. (You will need to convert the DVD into and out of your player to see it, but you will be glad you did.)
