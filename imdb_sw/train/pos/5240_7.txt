Some of the actors were a minor suspect. I remember that telling Alexander Walker (critic of Standard Standard, see OK, now dead) launched a film about this film saying it was embarrassing to show an ISI protest as killers. Now, according to all NI Protestants, this film was independently according to Shankill Traders (who were honest) and who walked in Belfast in the 1970s. My main moan on this film is shows no light light or hope, it is punishable and heavy, I mean a little girl at the end will die. Maybe this looks corny but it could be considered confident that not all Prods & tiags are bad or quite good either.
