First of all, anyone who is looking for a meaningful movie that gives them a social message and a meaningful presentation and a spiritual conversation spoken by the voluntary, emotional, emotional, and heart-to-the-present thespians. You lose your time and life is short, go see a new Brangelina Jolie film, cry out, go out & buy a diversified car or remove your diamonds that will make you feel better, and just leave it. br /> <br /> Do not let the door put on the outside. MELTING TRAINER is a B class under the ethnic tribal shock in Oklahoma's youth and youth, the internet and a friendly website, and engages with an affected astronaut affected by the effects of strange radiation, wakes up in the hospital, and finds that the body his disgusting him as he sits there to hear as chump. The smallest person plays with Alex Rebar, who is known for the first four minutes of the film. But once he started oozin 'with a wonderful special makeup of Rick Baker he resembles a lot with something you can get into a tin of spam before running all the powerful blue, greasy oil. The film has zero definitions and is not available for points of conspiracy: There are several cases relating to the type of scientist around the machine of an incredible conveyor machine that actively says a few lines should be on the effects of radiation. The film does not matter, really. It is a common and amazing show for the impression of a sense of humor to those who have abdomen - one laughter comes when a mortal man stumbles on a little girl in the forest and it is so lost for what make it one of his eyes pops out. Hilarious. The "hero" of the film is played by Burr DeBenning, a good character actor from the 1970s and 80s television movie who was the original model of Kevin Spacey; lose a little, neurotic, and one step in front of everyone in the room even if it seems confused. He was seen only after this film was made by an amazing anthology TV called HOUSE OF THEAD (or ALIEN ZONE) which is considered one of the best films made in Oklahoma, where it is alleged that this film was also made. The rainy, rainy rural show, is the same, and the stream that one of the unfortunate fishermen he chooses for his day of sports seems to be the same as that Cameron Mitchell fought with the guest pancakes without a note ... which also had a sense of a sense of humor, a friend of television, and some very good year. I feel at least the relationship of poetry between three movies, including SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is not surprising because Jonathan Demme's director is part of the cast of MELTING MAN. In fact, if others have explained, this is a 1950 movie B for the future of 1970s with special effects and inevitable boobs. The film offers a lot of ideas from PHANTOM from SPACE and Peter Graves as a astronaut who also returns to the world after being exposed to the effects of funky radiation that has put him in the murder of the killings. One of the things I like most about the film is that it is quite inexplicable because of a mortal man: He just comes to the rampage and the movie comes coming to ask if he will come into pieces before some characters are affected by his madness. The film budget is also very good and every dime spent on it on the screen, the effects of Rick Baker to contribute to the part of any lion's use on this. <br /> <br /> Patient, the best most enjoyable enjoyed with many friends and beer. Why can't people make more movies like these? <br /> <br /> 8/10
