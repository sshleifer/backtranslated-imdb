... why is it in those who have no 10 minutes that were so bad they had to be cut from the original film? We had three years in the production of film ... Barbara Stanwyck had a star in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard has Maggie King. Star Co Fred MacMurray is known for "Double Indemnity", and Stanwyck, with his television show "My Three Children". Beware of little Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and Franklin Pangborn who is also a very good manufacturer, who chose almost every film to put on the tape. Of course, he works in a salon on the ship! Add Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. A beautiful Banda and the beginning time. Maggie Ella's friend is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Raising Up", Maggie tourist meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie loses his boat when it comes from the port and is beaten by soldiers. Quinn 20-something object has a small area in the bar within Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) has been playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid Band together and try to imagine how to return to the Nations. Some singing to Lamour. Good (but short) performance acting with Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", wise, useful in the local saloon in Panama. While others have mourned how bad it was, it was not very traumatic, and even a little foreign, and the Central American state of the first place for the first half of the film.
