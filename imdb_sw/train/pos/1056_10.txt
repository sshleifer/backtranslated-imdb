How anyone can say this is worse than me. I liked to show this before I even saw it. For three reasons, 1. Stories are interesting to you, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the negative views and Please check all the first season before deciding to be bad because I know that if you look at the first season you would like to go and buy 1 Season with 2 season on the DVD and join the campaign to get season 3 conducted! I hate the Fox and I am sure many of you fans of "Dark Angel" hate them too. They have something of Canning Good Shows! Do you all disagree?
