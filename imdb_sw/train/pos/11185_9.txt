If this happens to be one of my favorite novels, I was very happy to see the transfer. I had no desire! Of course there are a few things that I could take, but I think that the movie is actually booked, and it was a very good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films find bad reviews, but this is one of the best. It's a dark story, which I think is why I love it and it's better than the dead who come to life .. and something about the animals coming out of the grave is also creepy too. If you have seen the movie you are interested in yourself and now read the book! It was a good play for the text, the executives could do a good job (I just say this to Rachel, and Ellie .. was so whinny) I liked everyone else much .. and important to me.
