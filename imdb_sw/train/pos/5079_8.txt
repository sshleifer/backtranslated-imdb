Well, first you would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and translated for meaning means to "protect". Khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). Also, Tamil film industry is an integral part of commercial partnerships, any of the film Rajnikanth or Vijay could stand by the law. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the last area, especially the last love (which is certainly unexpected!). Gore is rather much time, but surely this is a good movie!
