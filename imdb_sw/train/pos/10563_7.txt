Wow ... what a ... tornado. 30 years are ten years and many films of all kinds I can think of, especially during the initial phase of talkies. There were movies that were hurtful and unpleasant, like "Dracula" and Bella Lugosi, and there were those who should not relax, sometimes in good ways and sometimes. This is one of the films that don't stop for a minute, and that's wonderful and compassionate. Lloyd Bacon, who also led the "42th Street", must be the king of Era's music music and perhaps had the excitement of the voices brought to the movie world, because he filled this picture with it. It should not have a minute or two without music or someone who speaks. It's absolutely crazy! I was thinking that the movie deserves 5 (or 6, up) because walking was so bad, as it was very fast and sometimes I didn't know what was happening and what to think about. The characters seemed to only take the place, and talk about things that were not interested and maybe nobody else. I thought I would have been given a head of a little head. I saw Lloyd Bacon also casting a female leadership in the "42 Address", Ruby Keeler, and "42 Address" was a movie that ended up was the best part. And you know what? Happened one thing with "Footlight Parade"! The end is so amazing! It's been, hands down, amazing music I've ever seen. The last part gives us a number of music and that is, I believe, something that makes you see another suitable movie. These numbers are useless! There are three big and interesting bits are certainly the second. Suddenly the screen was filled with a good camera function, good people and an open entertainment that helped me forget my headache.
