I found this film to be typical of French beaten to the face of America. The cameras, too often, take into account the people of the fuel, in the wrong houses and in rural areas. While these comments seem to be kind and pleasant to the young people of the city who are brought to the viewer, the movie shows are caused by them. There was, of course, a thin people seen in Glencoe and a beautiful house, planned, but Malle chose to show us what was more visible. I can only hope that American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst things. I can assure you, as a regular visitor to France, that all is not there. Foreign immigrants are not easily accessible, leading to a serious social crisis. But Americans are not interested in opening French because of their disgusting personalities and envy by U.S., so we can't see the film on the subject.
