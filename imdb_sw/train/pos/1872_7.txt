I have never seen a film in the release of the original exhibition, I was surprised when the DVD arrived, since this film did not have the entire distribution appropriate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br/> "to envy other films about the same topics as the most directors have arrived. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He brings different angles to this film. br>> One of the best things that the film has, is of course, good performance with Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the correct guide, will go away, of course. The trouble and suffering for the worst life of the hand, so far, has done to him, it is very realistic. ”His symphony is a beautiful picture of a man who is very good and has a lot to give, but no one seems to see that side of his character. br>> <br /> When the worst of his despair, Antona was sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, to a very large extent, if somehow failed. Because of the angst within Antons, he misses the opportunity to give to this person, who wants to help, but because of the restrictions placed on his office, only have three sessions and then he must dismiss his patient. <br /> <br> Things work, like Antone can persuade the doctor to continue working with him. Anton's history has been revealed in detail. The abuse that holds in the hands of Mrs Tate, the mother of the generation, is cruel, to say the least. The hand of an adult woman's household in Tate's sexual abuse home, gives a tasting taste to Antona, who lives with her throughout her adult life, if she is distressed by the shame she carries. <br /> <Antona gets love and ends with Cheryl, who is sufficiently ill to make her see a different world with love and help her give it. <br /> <br /> Lead shows are really good. Dr Denzel Washington Davenport has its problems too. She is not a happy girl or either. He can help Anton, but he cannot help himself, or his relationship with the adoring wife. <br /> <br /> Talent in the film is amazing. Joy Bryant makes Good Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a good actress is as good as Mrs Tate, a abusive mother. <br/> <br /> <br/> The reunion of Antons and his unknown family is also sugar and feeling, but of course, if it is to believe that Fisher finds happiness at the end, someone needs to accept that part of the film too.
