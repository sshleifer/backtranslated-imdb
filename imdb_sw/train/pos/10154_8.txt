This is the first film of Michael Vartan I have seen — I have not seen Alias- and I was curious to see if someone can act.He certainly can and looks at this movie. of the act, so I have seen him very good and interested in this different “sweet” teacher's role. Some of the negative views I have seen are true, movies are full of clichés and stories are not really good. Also, although every character in the movie says how good they look together, I don't think there is a chemistry screens there. However, I enjoyed this film. These areas are good, the characters are good and they love the best and the best actors are very good. If you expect to see a good romance, this is not. But if you want to see a beautiful innocent and interesting movie and interesting characters are very good.
