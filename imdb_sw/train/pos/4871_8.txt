It takes Serbian or at least the Balkan skills to understand and enjoy many situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' with many other Kusturica films. See for example opening events, and a remote village from the Serbian mountains, and low-tech technologies that advocate the integrity and way of life of the local people, a good day of the Communist rule, and wake up to young brat looking at her teacher the nude for the voice of the Soviet song. Kusturica not only tries to leave the tragic history of Serbia mentioned in its previous films, but it creates a whole world in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or a non-political film in any case. It's an enjoyable film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters we care about. Music plays a major role in this film as in all its movies. His style is straightforward and appropriate, now we feel about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The area that develops current links, history and magic, and colors appear to be the Dououer Rousseau of modern cinema. This is not a perfect film either. The main feature is the length, some editing and summary would be necessary, as at some point when the director appears to have left the ideas and repetitions. It is still one of the most exciting, exciting, moving movies I have seen recently.
