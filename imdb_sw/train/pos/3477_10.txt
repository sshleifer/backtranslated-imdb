Some people think that the second series was where the scooby was destroyed. It did not agree completely. The quality suggests that you did not climb up or down and photograph, win my opinion, like a very good chrecter. looked at the choice on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the second scrappys second was scoobys downfall.OK so loads yes yes but 28% still don't get bad.I do as more than episodes focused on comedy.i believe the show would have gone as trash as was 5 people the same / dog solving the mystery in the same form.scrappy was the breath of fresh air for show.sure, some people tuned out but when scrappy was founded to watch DOUBLED.Back statistics for show.All episodes and categories were very funny. facing the shorts of the bear and but at the end of the day his opinion whether you like it or not is a matter of opinion, certainly no matter. But in my study this was a very good series that has given the beginning to draw a new form and lease life.Nuff said.
