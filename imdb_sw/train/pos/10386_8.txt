what is wrong with you people, if you are not cut off by the mechanism of action and the jessica Simpsons body fire then you are very broken head. Of course the film is not a masterpiece, I don't think it was intended to be. It was fun and surprising, I had never seen a show when I was young, i recently noticed one place, and when I watched the film, I felt it had that kind of atmosphere. The seats of the film were shaken, and the vehicle tracking was good because it did not carry me and jumped out like some cases in 2fast 2 fufu. and jessica Simpson is a blazing fire, I just want to use him more in the order of action. All in all, I had a hell of time looking at this and I would like to see it again soon and I'll buy it on DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
