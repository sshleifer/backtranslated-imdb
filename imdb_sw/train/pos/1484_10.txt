"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before the wedding, just last year. It was also the first movie I searched for, after marriage, because we have promised to provide a copy to our priest. Sometimes, the truth is not that far from lies. For all those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" are not in real life, I would recommend to visit my Pri Priority. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To all others, I would just recommend to see this film, before and after "Do it!" day :-) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
