I have seen this film on the Sky Cinema is not too long. I must admit, it was a very good West which has 2 major names. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, with a notable law and retirement Samuel Burgade. On the other hand. At the end of James Coburn played Zach Provo of the village .. wishing to take revenge on Burgade regardless of the cost! The best thing about this film was some very good characters. Most of the actors played very well. In particular, James Coburn, whom I see was really meaningful in this film. But that was how it was .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, whom I have seen everywhere in the film The other .. Play Hal Brickman .. I felt his character left out on the cold, but he can join again and cooperate with Burgade, bringing down Provo's posse's! It's all good, it was a good film. Very good looking. Good score from Jerry Goldsmith late .. <br /> <br /> A wonderful piece of Western persona ..! 8 out of 10.
