Christmas Together really came before my time, but I was born on John Denver and songs from this special is always the Christmas music of my family. For years we had a distorted corridor from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track the video on Ebay, so after listening to all music for 21 years, I saw John and Muppets in my work. If you get a chance, it's a lot of fun - good music, warm and cheesy. It is also interesting to see 70 versions of Muppets and compare them with their new versions today. I believe Denver actually took the heat to make a show like this - I think the artists usually do not affect their image by making singing-longs with Muppets, but I'm glad she made. Even if you can't track down the video, sound sounds are also worth. It has many traditional buttons that are not recommended, but also some of the original Denver tunes as well.
