Movie's trotta rosenstrasse is the best movie I have seen in years. I'm not really interested in film and background of history but for this he won my interest at that time! <br /> <br /> The only thing to despair about the movie has been the events in the new york, and the feeling i had to "try to be as US as possible" ... which I think has completely failed. <br /> <br /> The previous events reached my heart. The German executive riemann deserved his award. he is one of the most interesting actors I ever seen. in the future I will watch more movies. good luck to me that I'm a German speaking language =) and just a year in us, so once I come I'll be able to buy some dvd riemann. <br /> <br /> so for all out there who haven't seen this film yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it will be too long to describe what is still, especially to return to the flash and it is often hard to explain, but just watcxh it, you will be zesty !!!!!!!
