The second phase of the axellent which manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, throwing is very strange. I like how the first and second parts have nothing except the magic and cunning. The second part is very amazing, very stupid and very interesting. It is the first part of Christmas, about a woman who is tortured by a common killer dressed as Santa after killing her husband. Just like the first part; karma. The most exciting part is the tie between her husband's murder and her phone, first makes her fear until it becomes real.
