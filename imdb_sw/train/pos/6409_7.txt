I've never heard of Brashear before seeing this. This is the story of him and the man who taught him, to help him become the first North American to North America. A powerful-powerful story. This program is well documented, and goes well. This is what it looks, the most common thing, and it does not surprise too much. It's also Hollywood, but hey, I don't know the real person, maybe it's close to how it appeared. However, it does this work, with great events and problems along the way, and this encourages anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" say about their long-term dreams. Acting performances are excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. all shine whenever they are on the screen. Rapaport is amazing, too. The characters are well written, reliable and consistent. This has been changed well, and shows good movies. Production values ​​are high, and this works to persuade us to bring us back to 50 years. There is an average amount of strong language, otherwise there are no strong devices. I recommend this to anyone who finds something interesting, and / or fans of those who have made it. 7/10
