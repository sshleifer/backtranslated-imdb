I remember watching this is an original voice chat in 1962 as five or six years old and actually enjoying this. I recently had the opportunity to look at it again, for the first time since, as shown on "Walt Disney Presents" at the Disney Center. I would have forgotten a lot of that, and some of them were targeting children, but it was still enjoyable. I can't wait to show her little and my brothers.
