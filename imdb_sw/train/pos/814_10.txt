Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of geeks walks around saying that Jedi's return is not good because it's fun to enjoy. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it worse! Everyone liked to return to Jedi until someone in the movie Kevin Smith made a negative opinion on it. Now all the people are watching you if you have some kind of illness if you say how much you love. This movie is better than anything Kevin Smith has ever considered to create that reminds me of that person that he could even think of refusing. This movie is a good fun! It's amazing if I remember being six years old! Enjoy this film why it's stopping stealing the views of Kevin Smith! Its not right! And the Ewok song finally ruled! I bet you people don't even enjoy "Ekoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'll put them all hot!
