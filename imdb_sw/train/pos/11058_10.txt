I would like to say that this is the first romantic quality I have ever seen. it was deep and although you knew from the beginning who would end up together there is still a desire and expectation. The idea that maybe they won't get together ... is an indie film after all. This movie was well written, directed and done. The play on the side of the road was very good.
