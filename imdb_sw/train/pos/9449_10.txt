I watched this film during the morning morning when I was asleep. This, itself, was a testimony that Redemption was a spell film. I think Boorman did a good job of leading this film. How to take care of the early location and the people of the hill and banjos triggered was done. Demonstrated well and early on how nature was kept and simple people of the area were. Case in action - near the end of the "duel", the boy playing banjo screamed (loved his coverage), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the child was also protected to respond. The river trip did not leave you tired, indeed. The rape area was brutal, but it is important to show what this group was against this area of ​​Georgia. I think Beatty's shock shocking was later done well. Some said he was good and not harmless. I did not accept - if you paid attention, he did not have the answers during the next stage, which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and drove the innocent man out. It was confused when Ed killed someone else later, on the rock. It was almost apparent that the arrow was struck when Ed was being beaten and expecting to die, but then he realized the arrow he struck earlier had finally taken effect. Still, a great movie, and I was turning between 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a delightful voter who gave "1", I gave it "10". This person's opinion was based on personal preference, rather than the focus of the goal, and his vote was a non-inclusive attempt.
