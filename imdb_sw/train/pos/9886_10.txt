This is a very good movie visible. Pictures of the Mexican Desert, the ancient house, the characters in their amazing dress ... all come from the actual work of art. The story seems to be free, but that's because it didn't say it was true. It is taken from a book known as One of the Millennium of Humility, and is considered to be a unique barrier, the South American world "far from God, and near the United States". The biggest debt that Erendira wants for her grandmother is a typical debt burden for South America, although there are many strands of meaning. If you can understand a slow, moving movie, this is for you.
