Read all the comments It is very exciting. but one can please tell me the name of a true artist who built a picture for good advertising times. I know that everyone explains j.j. as an artist in the family but, there was a real family that has a real artist, and has never got any credit for these eyes yet. So if you don't care if someone can call the name of a real artist I would also like to tell him "work done well". I know this appearance is for GOOD TIME beaten but, do you not accept that he also touched our hearts all. I would like to know if he still has a color or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.
