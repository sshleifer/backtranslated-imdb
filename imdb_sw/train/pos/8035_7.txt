Sunday will not be Sunday without a movie of action, and when you want to fight with power, it will break out with Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here the sniper plays in the jungle to go after the rebels and the heads of drugs. Life of the bitch, so it gets a kind of green office (Billy Zane) to help in the mission. The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who reduced Anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but Berenger makes the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Of course, it may be a long time - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's nice, act when it's right.
