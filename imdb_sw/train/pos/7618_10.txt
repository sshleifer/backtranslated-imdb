Okay: <br /> <br /> I heard about the lost from a co-worker who had a clear difference of opinion on entertainment, he liked it. Well I looked at a part or 2 in the early season and I was bored, so I saw it. After a few years I stumbled over the lost; bored with current sci-fi prices. Wow I was surprised. What? You can say the best influence, I have come. Dimensions and script are very good, some flash / back flash is similar to the characters of lara, but on all good. My famous characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are very obvious, they are very damaged and are declining. Kate 1 step on them, Juliet was the most classy way than Kate. Mr. Eko's way down to the level and on the level of Charlie if not more, the worst they both died. A boy wearing black talking with Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. As a very good, very full series: look for more. <br /> <br /> watch
