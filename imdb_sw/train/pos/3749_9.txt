I laughed very much when I looked at this. It is a beautiful and beautiful act of beautiful music and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor of humor. These discussions are extraordinary and often not expected, and from the first to the last, everything seems to be spinning around. There is Max, who seems to lead a terrible life. And there is Edward, who doesn't know what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's insane leader. Tom has a short-term but I don't remember. It is highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. And you can get online now, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all cartoons of Jason and can't wait to see what comes out and next.
