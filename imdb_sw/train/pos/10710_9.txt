In fact I disagree with the rey-yardley-rees who (he would have watched the entire film) he would see some of the scenning scenning of some of the Scottish (some of the best scenarios Skye) and found a hard-to-start film coming together in a painstaking whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a great film budget. Instead, it is a powerful feel. I can't say the 'standard' films that have been given - pushing the same material again. Seachd doesn't seem to be over that. It seems to be trying to give something more real and more than Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. OK, so acting is not a blockbuster style. That's because actors seem to be real people. In fact I thought that the important roles of the young man and his grandfather were influential - and sometimes very good. Seachd actually bears a second look, for there are many passages that become clear next time - which actually feeds in the end. Overall, a mixture of music and (sometimes) amazing performances, along with a community approach to the acting and abnormal structure has made Seachd differently different from a non-memorable film. More of these please!
