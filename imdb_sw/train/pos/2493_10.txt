Common comedy 90, comedy of the same situation as our modern day "My Family". Thecher has been the height of political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for whatever he can. "Bloody" can potentially collaborate with many of us. David is a young boy, cut off his mind and knives, Jenny, a young little boy, is only interested in boys and boys. Bill and Ben are working as they can make sure their family continues to strive in an economic environment in the early 90s. generally this show did not find the best moments to watch and should have lived for a long time. clear that they could not continue after Gary Olsen die but I think they should eliminate "Catherine Tate" "office" "little Britain" and return to the classic!
