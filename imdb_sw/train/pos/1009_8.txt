Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a series of cheesy sci-fi TV. <br /> <br /> No facts to run. How much you try to express yourself or explain that Stargate SG-1 remains a series of sci-fi TV cheesy. Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas quickly. Specific FX is not as close as if they could have had no action to stimulate the seat. Or bed for that reason. <br /> <br /> But, and this is where I think that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit that it can get, for every part or idea stolen I think you can count at at least one movie of cheesy sci-fi which is worse than one hour of television. Certainly some events can be 90 minutes long and still better than many films. <br /> <br /> And be able to set the same quality in the same period and keep putting up and pushing the storyline more than what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very picky with my choice. I follow one or two television series and put the highest standards that made me even more surprised when I found myself. "So those who decide to mix with Stargate SG-1 are still another tacky sci-fi show, not. Close it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
