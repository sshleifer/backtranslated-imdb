This has to be one of the best movies about the secret killers I have ever seen, and this comes from someone who loved the quietness of the Lamb. HBO has hit the jackpot here. This film forces from the first to the end. This video has many basic themes that are hard to understand exactly what. It says the search for ten years for the Syrian killer Archbishop killer. Stephen Rea gives a very good performance as a scientist who is put in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives a more active participation as his human head, and the only person in the Russian government he wants to help. All their exhibitions are masterpieces of craft --- Rea begins naive and does not want to stop, when Sutherland begins to be closed and hated by the situation. To the end, Rea becomes more exhausted by the world and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds herself more passionate and ethical. <br /> In any other movie, I would say Sutherland's performance has been shown to others, but here it is against Jeffrey DuMann, as a typical native. DuMann builds this character here that encourages compassion instead of hatred we think we will get it - he is a monster, but they don't want to be, and we get the idea that he is just broken by what he does like us. He is tortured, embarrassed, but also evil. If you can take the subject of the dark subject, and (and * it is very troubling), then you should see this film.
