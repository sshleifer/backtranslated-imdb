The first thing I thought of after looking at "Men's Secrets" how could this movie be highly unlikely? I have seen this movie interesting and amazing that the situation as a bomb is a logical logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will hit a cult, and you can count me amoung fans. <br /> <br /> Just set, and would give away too much, this movie is for comic books what "Mrs. Mrs" made story stories and "Who put Roger Rabbit?" made by ancient cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the sound of the film then the sales commitee was registered in luck (this is one of the events as "Iron Giant" where the label had no clue with his hands). Use the future when you feel a little something. You will listen to BeeGees for the same light and ever again.
