I first bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the lid and I thought, hey! Another film that attracts Aishu and Shah Rukh, I did not know that Aishwarya would only be seen in the item number in the last quarter of the film in which he lives with SRK and helps to develop his character on the film for just 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about the mother's love and patience. It is a film about change, ignorance, age, entry into knowledge and accept the realities of life. The number of goods that SRK and Aishu are not related to the film. In fact it is a series of dreams that occur when the alcoholic behavior of SRK is closed without understanding and booze. He dreamed that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows on her popular hangout spot one day, very dressed and began to deceive her. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (the opposite of translated as "Love bitch!") And it is just a smoking of fire! Don't miss it.
