Film opens by Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) describing a story about how his best friend - making a client - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are locked up in New York's small apartment, with enough room space and a bathroom channels very much. At the time of Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to restore the apartment, broadcasting Jim's love for (or located for!) Announcement of the house. Once bought a house, bills and frustration will interfere rapidly without everything that can fail and the building of Jim's 'dream house' is not recommended. <br /> <br /> One of three partnerships between Grant and Loy, this is a very little comedy - not very stirring, without real authentic messages, but a good way to spend an hour or two. Laughter is certainly from the beginning, when the alarm clock is off and Jim tries to close it, just avoided on every side by Muriel. Time and delivery of comedic lines and comedic conditions can only be given for many seasonal benefits, and so what Grant and Loy give us: produced, simple chemistry, and many fun. Myrna Loy is an irresponsible role (it is obvious that the character of Jim's character receives a lion's string and acting, and Grant, as usual, draws away from the amazing aplomb), but gives Muriel color, life and bite that Myrna Loy only can give the character. Melvyn Douglas plays an amusement for the whole too, never rejecting one bad mark. One of my favorite events should be when Bill finds himself tied to the 'shop room', and Jim may 'save' ... just get everyone tied inside! Any problem that comes with the Blandings rehabilitation project - including the envy and 'Wham' advertising campaign - seems to bring together everything that * can * act badly by building a new home but it makes it reliable and fun. 8/10
