What? Anyone knows what type of John T has run? I looked like the middle of the late 70's. This movie is favorite as well as my wife. It was the first unfamiliar film we saw as a married couple. Take it to interest if it is the same as the first truck I drove and I just got another like that. I would like to restore the download I must match the film. Also music was amazing, and acting it was good. Where is the woman shown to John's aunt? Did John have a stunt twice for a tower area when he was about to fall? It is also a year of Mustang made Debra W drive in this show. It looked like an example of 60. Thank you,
