Nothing is more interesting than me who is - or the concept of emphasis that makes you think about how everything will end. And so what is happening in DEATHTRAP, taking into account the playing with awesome and Ira Levin ("Child of Rosemary"). And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE are doing a kind of stunt which Caine and Laurence Olivier came down to SLEUTH - and puzzles as skill and many puzzles that have been present in a very unusual game. But because it means horror, to surprise you, and to keep you thinking about the results, it is difficult to write a review on the plot. Let's just say what we know at the beginning we must know about the film now. MICHAEL CAINE is a jealous envy player whose recent play has failed miserably. When a boy who loves the author CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him a script to play him, Caine realizes that he adopts himself as he solves all his problems and gets his reputation back. From that time, it is a fun and sporting experience for listeners like the story of Ira Levin's fatigue, managing to blow up Agatha Christie trumpet for a number of losses. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play gently, each bringing sharp tension to the tale with some humorous touch that comes from the script that laces the game with humor. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is pleased with the end.
