1933 it seemed to be a good year for satires (eg “Soup soup” for example) and this is well suited even though it is on the bridge and bridge. Tons are like a beautiful piece of New Yorker, suitable, as the film begins with the "Goings On About Town" page of the magazine. The only thing is odd. A few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. However, after 1934, you will not have a modern-day sexual act, a young and beautiful Loretta Young in other blond and slinky outfits, or a group of prostitutes who oppose the race on the radio. Even if you don't know anything about the bridge, you can still want to look at the unusual example of Hollywood satire.
