Harvey Keital performance up to now a new century. It is very well photographed, beautiful pictures of Cuba before Castro. This story is about the boss of the little crime scene that promotes friendship with the United States and Hollywood. It is true about the time when a young man will revive the fact that a small circle of people he knows really live in a much larger, more complex world that still does not know. Above all, a professional career that really fits well with the American cinema. One weakness is the decision to beat English voice equally instead of Spanish - perhaps improving sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this only makes the film less enticing. But if you see more of this, you will find a heart trip from another world. Recommended.
