Get ready: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know David Mamet (author and director) another job but after seeing this film half times (it's always fun to enjoy), I can say without hesitation that he is a professional. This film is very well written, and quickly draws it into its own fraudulent environment, text and room. The feel of the film is similar to The Sting (1973) and also promotes the film film. It is quite a complicated psychological film and certainly will make you think about various twists and plot of shady characters. It's a certain time of prediction but an amazing peak is exciting looking. Overall, acting is good - especially Joe Mantegna - but the person I watched the film told me that it is not a good idea to have a Lindsay Crouse who is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief but also sports The rough hair of 80. I agree, but I think he is much better in the role. When you don't know about this film program, the better, like the latest Mamet film, the Spanish prison, because the latter will be more interesting. Just sit back and be ready to be brought to the trip with the movie coming to danger around and careful.
