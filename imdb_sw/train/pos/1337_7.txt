......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not make a mistake, this film is not clear (or even) than the Pretty Woman, but it was (was) a new topic in a voice. The lesson was accepted but it is far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, topics are presented in a very clean way. But the plot has a number of clich√©s. The beginning of the film is provided through the "filmi" very much. There are very few holes. The movie takes once Rani has its disappearance where it feels that you are looking something else than an ordinary movie. Otherwise the whole family family felt from the beginning. Acting could not be better. Salman Khan sometimes attracts, and sometimes it doesn't. Over here gave one of the best performances. On top of that his role is well written, that he appreciates every time he solves the problem. Rani Mukherjee was enough. In the same movie, you feel his character more, but hidden by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is a perfect image. Of the three, he gives everyone to run for their money. It is amazing how he can influence when he is guilty. And believe me, Madhubala is away from your girlfriend. This role is one of the reasons I am measuring its high level. Support is like a family you see in HAHK, where they have no importance to the plot I have seen here. These songs are very good. My favorite song is all with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Mioyo). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (See Sight World) is a two song that is suitable for film. Preity number of Preity, Councilor Councilor (Crazy), could be reduced during Punjabi 1 when he was boring though he was playing well. Otherwise the movie is very suitable to watch.
