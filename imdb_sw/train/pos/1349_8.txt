RKO was characterized by making folksy, piecespun pieces of Americaana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) was in the film since she was a little child. In 1933 he loved to play with Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on the Match" (1932) and the "girl of flowers" in "Away from Heaven" and "The Key" all in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered the work of Anne from the previous film and that's how he got this part. He also used Anne Shirley as her name for action. Unrecognized stories - Lady of Shallot in a leaked boat, brooch "stolen", the occurrence of "red hair". Anne was so right for the role of chatty, orphaned heart. He had a strong heart in his strength, his delightful desire and also his burning anger. O.P. Heggie was as wonderful as Matthew Cuthbert's understanding and Helen Westley were as good as Marilla's company. Tom Brown was the best Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in the film as a little child was good like Diana Barry. Sara Haden demonstrated that she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the series Andy Hardy, was Mrs. Barry.
