Well, what can I say after watching this amazing film, when my nerves are still happening! Jacques Audiard director must be making his own name in France, and so on. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz either, but these two are wonderful actors, and this is a taur and forcing a thriller which starts slowly with some of the crafty behaviors to create and then start to set up tension on tension to an amazing climax. Others have written about the plot, so I can't say more than anyone in this film does their work in full, director, executives, down to the camera, and everything seems to be real, no guns to play, war when it happens is reliable, words, emotions, are almost as if you're there as an observer. Are you gracious, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, a low-lighting lamp, take a phone off the hook and enlarge yourself in this Hitchcockian fun!
