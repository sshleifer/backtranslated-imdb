Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people living in a beautiful, old house and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a journalist who sees the killer writes about living. Sometimes the destruction and deviation at the end was good. The second has Peter Cushing taking into account the figure of the net that is similar to his dead wife. The third person has Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid. It all leads to the end of a terrible horror (though the end in the story was worse). The last is the comedy out and out with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing environment) and cape which turns people to be vampires! There is also a good line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anthology of terrible - no horror but the first and the end of the third gave me a few bottles delightful. Also the fourth is very true and Pitt makes VAMPIRE OF VERY sexy! Also the house itself looks good ... and highly creepy. Directed by some good touch of the atmosphere. A very good and unusual movie also. All in anthology a bit good to be good they should look for. Try to see it on the DVD - The Lions Store looks amazing with strong colors and loud sounds.
