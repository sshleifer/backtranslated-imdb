What is "Freedom of Presence" like? It is a great and unique experience of making South Africa and how blacks in the country were oppressed by white people. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), the chief editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he talks a lot about Steve Biko's views (Denzel Washington). Recently Woods meets Biko and changes his opinion on it and also begins to understand what the powers they are doing to black people in South Africa (from above, even from police officers). When Biko dies under police protection, Woods decides that he writes a book on it and that no matter what he publishes. But Woods must escape from his country to get the book printed and must also keep his family a second place, so the world can find the truth. Attenborough has managed to make a good film about people, with the main message being black and white is the same, because we are all people. The story leads us to South Africa and this (movie) is a good way for the whole world to learn what has happened in the country and I am disappointed that only 3200 people hit this movie. This is a movie in which we all can learn something. Although it was a long time, this story could not be presented in any short way because the director wanted to show us how hard it was for Woods to get this book published after Biko's death. <br/> <br /> Also the relationship between Woods and Biko was shown great, such as the two families and the problems they have. But sometimes the sacrifices have to be made (the death of Biko) so that the truth can be revealed (book Woods).
