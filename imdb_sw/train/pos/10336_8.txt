This is tough to check - as the original author says. It is amazing to consider the horrible films that came out after WWII - particularly "Dachau". Obviously, as in the middle of the battle, we knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The sequence of "transportation" is clear, almost like as the basis of real information (Nazi Minister liked to record their evil). Knox like Coconut is a brilliant. He changes the work of Nazi work. The photography is particularly true when you are similar to the effects of other Germans, when you hit Hitler, then they do not accept, and eventually do not help. The difference, however, allows us to believe "conversion" of a Nazi officer who opposed the Nazi deaths. It happened, as to witness several attempts against Hitler, especially the Staffenberg conspiracy that occurred as this film was coming out. Powerful film, effectively using your fingers, to accurately predict the ways of Nuremburg and others that will take place the war will end.
