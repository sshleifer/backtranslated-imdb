Whatever you are in your life, you must not forget that you have roots. This is a true story of truth made on a beautiful and moving film! I testify that this film has been hit down. This shows us the realities of life ... more evil around you, the good man you are. Send in to you and know that the beauty of life is to live happily ... without grudges, without living "under the rock". The concept of the film is more interesting ... connecting stories with real life experiences ... protect us from the understanding of everything .. from reality to the emotions! Bless these people and be happy everyone! See it, I recommend it to all young people.it not about racism is about how to live your life!
