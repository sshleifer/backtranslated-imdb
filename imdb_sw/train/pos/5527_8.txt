There is probably a special reason why Fox and Child gets special symbols in my heart. After just saying goodbye to my new fianc√©e - oh ... one day - an indefinitely, I had been distracted by different emotions and I had trouble falling to the bright face she needed to see. <Br /> <br /> I watched small movies and television shows, but my mind started from what I was looking for and what I didn't see. So, I have this thank you film. <br /> <br /> Become a natural partner and I've heard about the film before, I was sure I would love it. But I was not just like that, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Technical skills are wondering. How did they do it? Did they catch animals as they did? It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> The story of the story is good and when the end is oh so French and controversial, it's fun / sad one. Again, it took me a little bit-guard. As a person who feels his own feelings, his end was hard during a crowded crowd that I would be seeing for 15 hours or more! Maybe it's because the end makes me get back to what I scored. But for a few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and natural. And that's life. Indeed, there are those things you love and feel good around ... but out of the outside has many secrets. So sometimes I see something out of the ordinary when out; I'm going to explore, consider and accept. That's exactly what is happening in this film and that is what you should do with this get a good movie / doc backgrounds too. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P. /. It's two months from a flight. We don't know when we will see it again, but we'll do.
