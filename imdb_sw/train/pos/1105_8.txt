Residents of Manhattan apartment should consider all kinds of problems. Worse is the lack of space room! Some people who eat all the time use their columns and switches as storage sites because the buttons are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great team to write comedy from then, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, his hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand the apartment in which he and his wife, Muriel, and two daughters, should share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, Ave's Madison. executive, has had it! When he sees an ad for living live in Connecticut, he decides to look. Obviously, the first owner, Jim has been alienated from a real estate owner to buy a damaged home is being checked by an unreliable agent. This is the beginning of his problems. Everything can be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a program that does not work for a new home, after one of the original lost. If one problem leads to another, a lot of money is important, and anything that is a preliminary cost, stops at the recommended price that Jim cannot afford. The film is fun because of the three heads in it. Cary Grant was an actor who had a good understanding of the character he played and does more than Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a good actress who was always playing against Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old friend of Myrna, turned out to be a lawyer for Blandings, is a suave and debonair, how Melvin Douglas showed him. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, plays with Sharyn Moffett, who resembled Eva Marie Saint. Louise Beavers great plays Gussie, but they don't have much to do. The video has been photographed by James Wong Howe, who knew how to make this film more comfortable. HC direction. Potter is quick and succeeded in this film that will delight the fans of ordinary comedies.
