This is one of Edgar Wallace's films from the German series - they set up all the foundations for Wallace's fun film back from those 60ies: Though his glory, Mr. Kinski, was still no Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, stars again as a typical American 'womanizer' style, you have Eddi Arendt limited in its best position (and just like the usual) role ever - cold, modern master of the UK - and you have (not so young again) Lowitz like the bitterness of The basket still remembers very well (and so: very police investigation). In addition you will be given a bad and very bad boy 'behind the frog mask (so the head of the film!), You will get a wonderful sounding sound, the b-movie action events, the out-of-the-way scene more (please remember the time of his origin!), shouting, shouting and ... All the well-shaped tastes in the tasty German Edgar Wallace recommended tasting - is recommended !!
