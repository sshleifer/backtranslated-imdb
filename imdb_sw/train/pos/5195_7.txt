As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit the paydirt with this one. The plan is not too bad, but there are few cases where you should ask yourself "what's going on here" <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make it funniest bad movies ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore had discovered the oil and slowly when this movie was hit that special effects include acceleration of the two times fighting. There are also instances where there is instant slow replay, jumping on the wall ten-foot wall (to play fall off back), the naked people walk out the big letters, and the sex that actually brings down the roof (with a standing cable on the roof it gets fire). Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore film would have been perfect without a free comedy and random club club where Rudy dislikes all the customers, intervened with people making an unusual dance. There are many bad things about this film, but it's bad for entertainment, and if you take your eyes away from the film, you might be missing another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for true value, 10/10 for cheese, 10/10 for picking off errors and buttons, average to 7/10.
