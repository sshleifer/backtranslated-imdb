This movie catches the mind of the mind and try to analyze the story. I also can't understand why people will lose this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this film can not be suitable for you. <br /> <br /> This movie offers a high degree of originality. Actors and performance of executives are purely. It's not fake, it's just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound.effects, special effects. <br /> <br /> The camera function is excellent, music is very good. I can't wait to get the sound of the voice. <br /> <br /> It leaves your body disease, like Constant Garderner.
