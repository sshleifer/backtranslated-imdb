"Shooter" was a different kind of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is usually associated with anti-military action, this film, because it was west, has enabled him to show that he is a more powerful actor than some lines of the allowed story. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that the film does not allow any solid development. Giving inside is actually left for the viewer. We can only think of the sadness that has made the Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, a murderer that he is a murderer, in mind, that a small town, afraid of an internal shock, agrees as a hero who can be released from his trouble.
