After looking at the "Witches" in the search of a distributor at AFM the other night, I need to say that I was very impressed. The audience was laughing all the way. Unfortunately, each area was already sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy a film, but I really believe that it will hit a great domestic and over sea. I agree with the comments that "Victims" should not be beaten as male "Gender and City," because because of the difference between "Sex and the City," "Obstacle" is a satire on the relationship that has not taken much too seriously. "They were beaten" you would like to have fun in relationships in the way many non-sexually active people did. Also, the film I watched in AFM had a plot with more stories than "Turning," "Authors," and "Sex and City" together. "What he was hit" did not decrease by hitting and giving the audience and the endless players. Amanda Peet's exhibition and all others made were a strong fortress, which only made the film more amazing by focusing on the budget.
