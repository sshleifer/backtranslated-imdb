This movie was amazing, it's a kind of movie where you look and instead of watching other movies and actress watching other movies and director / author. Sandler did a good job working out of its comfort zone and beautiful Cheadle always did a good job as well. This film is good for mature mature viewers. Acting was amazing and could only be approved by Writing and leading film. This film focuses on the real Americans, the old generation, no discrimination or discrimination only people who have gathered and realize the real meaning of life. This film is about losing and tackling. Instead of exploring Psychiatry, it explains, not as a person who heals you magically, but through the importance of expressing your feelings to an unfair person who can believe you will not judge you, but instead he will guide you though your thoughts. This movie is awesome round!
