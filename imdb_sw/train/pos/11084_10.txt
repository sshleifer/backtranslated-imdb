I saw Glacier Fox at the theater when I was nine years old - I asked my parents to come back to me three times. I started looking for them on a video about five years ago, finally finding a copy on the online website, but I would like to see it taken by a new division and reinstated (I understand the original video run was small), or with the rights to purchase by Family Channel, Disney, etc. and are displayed regularly. It is a fascinating film that stimulates you in the story of the life of a fox family in northern Japan, described by a wise tree. Soundtrack best praises the film well. It would be a good supplier today, much better than many cheap offerings for children's movies today.
