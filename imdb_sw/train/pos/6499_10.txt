After all these years I have considered this series a very good example of the film of World War II. Interviews with many participants from all countries have set this apart from any other project. It would be nice to see a modern writer (Ken Burns?) Take this head and try to collect information from fighters before they go. With modern technology to improve old photographs of photographs and information has been revealed since 1974 when the World War was released, the new version of this series will be accepted. The History Center has made a good exhibition to deal with many WWII elements but a comprehensive series such as World War has not been tested successfully since. If you are interested in this time do not miss this series. Required to watch.
