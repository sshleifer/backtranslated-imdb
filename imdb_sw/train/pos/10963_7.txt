I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, will encourage Maysles' to do "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" news film. In fact they can be considered as "bones" in the family room. Additional features on the DVD include many modern modern designers writing some of their ideas for these wonderful women. I would like to say that anyone who is attracted to the style will find a dialogue with these impressive creators. (ie "Is it nuts? Or do I miss anything?"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not. Far they do, though.
