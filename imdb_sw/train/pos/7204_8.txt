It's a play of action, adapted to the screen. The 95% movie takes place in the beautiful house of Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of play for Broadway success, but his last 4 attempts have increased - worse. A favorite player, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a dance writing ceremony presented by Sydney, has sent him a copy of his play. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon) play is fabulous - hit-fire-hit. But it is good enough to die? Time will say. A clear and successful discussion and turns into a plot to keep this leisure film from start to finish. The whole cast seems to have a good time. It's reminiscent of the other secret of Michael Caine: Sleuth. It is worth checking. <br /> <br />
