This is a very dark and thriller kind of thriller derived from the idea of ​​religious murder. The storyline centers of the man deranged who lives in Texas, the United States who suddenly goes to spree murder and his two newborn children after being warned to redeem the bad people. Bill Paxton who is leading this film has Father deranged who is known as the Hand of God Killer when Matthew McConaughey has his best displays so far as the oldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer make the burden of his childhood murder alone, and uses flashbacks for hauntingly to explain the news to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Boothe Authority) <br /> <br. / I can't think of many movies that put the viewer in their position from the beginning to the end and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop looking, you will be able to reason for the full strength of this film. <br /> <br /> The directors and filmmakers this film very well, and they help keep the plot through beautiful themes. The acting in this film is great but if there is any drawback is that some areas are very powerful and can disrupt some people. <br /> <br /> When the concept of this film is very black, young children help it shows the idea through a brilliant acting. This is true of the spine film and is guaranteed to have the edge of your seat around. I would like to strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys horrible, awesome and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
