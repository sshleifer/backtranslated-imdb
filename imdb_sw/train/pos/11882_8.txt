This movie was for some time in my collection, but it wasn't before my friend reminded me about it? until I decided I had to look at it. I didn't know a lot about Welcome to Leo? just that it was supposed to be better come out of the old movie and deals with a very big topic? Aids. Does someone who has help? is Leo? The situation surrounds the way Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) hits family diseases. First time everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel ?? is believed to be very limited to understanding his brother's illness? The fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributing to the lack of parents to discuss the issue with young Marcel. I know from experience that many older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is less than this does not mean that he cannot accept the truth and act in a sufficient way then even themselves. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, have left my feelings to me? how they helped their son ?? even after discovering the truth about his sex and disease. The fact that they allowed Marcel youth to travel with Today to go to Paris to meet her former boyfriend was a sign from them? most families I know will fail to do so. There is a lot of heat in events that the brothers spend time together? you can see them as true friends, worried about each other. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Today is a very good game, which I recommend very much
