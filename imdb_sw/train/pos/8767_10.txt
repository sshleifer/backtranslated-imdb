I saw this movie fortunately, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new interest to Bill Pullman and I wanted to see his latest movies and thank God for what I did! This movie has been with me from time to time and remains one of my favorites! This story refers to two girls who start a wonderful journey in a foreign country where they will learn the meaning of freedom. Alice and Darlene were trying to spend holidays together before going to college but their journey ended the most difficult story. The fights they take during the arrest in Thailand and that the prisoners are moving very fast and intense. Acting is amazing, amazing pictures, sound sounds wonderful and so suitable for the film and the most powerful message. I can't even find the right words to describe how this film makes me feel every time I look at it. I know other people do not accept as much as I have a movie rating but I swear, this, you have to see !!! I promise that it will catch you!
