I would like to give him a high Kolchak but the show left quickly from awesome / insisting to be silly. ABC's fault. They moved to the show until Friday night at 8:00 am, then known as "family clock". It should never be Friday first place. I was sophomore in high school and I liked early sessions! It was the first against the Police woman in NBC. ABC had serious problems with Friday night. The worst season to Barney Miller, Baretta, and SWAT began in January '75. Kolchak should have been hit. Darren McGavin asked to leave his contract to finish the show. Too bad to write was not until Richard Matheson in the original TV movie. However, McGavin did Kolchak himself, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason like Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS is installed by the printing press and phone calls are seen as the present and the old, but that was part of the appeal. They were very fortunate to have Simon Oakland again "Vincenzo" from TV movies.
