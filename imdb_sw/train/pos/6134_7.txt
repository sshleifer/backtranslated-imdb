Some DVDs own until I have to go out and buy. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing it as a child and I loved it. I never knew there were cases and music numbers that were cut, so I was surprised to see what they might be. I will agree that the sequence of "Portabellow Road" is now a tad (if it is a football game) but in addition, I did not get any reputation for the remaining items that have been returned to a place of honor. Perhaps Disney should have a native version (which is a returned reference) on the one hand and a version of the flip side, then people can choose what they want to see. All in all, it's still a movie of entertainment that can still restore some of my childhood memories.
