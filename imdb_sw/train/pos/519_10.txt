I saw this film first 20 years ago and I have never forgotten it. It is made for beauty and story takes straight for all time. It's hard to believe this was done in 1946, as the story is still fresh today, and it makes a person think. I don't know very much about the films yet the special effects in this film are to consider when this was done. In addition, acting is very good, and the use of English and American actors is very strange. I recently bought a DVD so now I have the ability to check at any time I would like. I highly recommend anyone interested in the film after the British war to watch this.
