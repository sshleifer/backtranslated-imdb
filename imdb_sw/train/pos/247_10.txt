I love this movie, because it showed that they didn't kill for fun but to save those who loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a good job showing Ned and Joe. It has a few inappropriate screens, but it's more than that. The language is very gentle and sometimes does not even know it. This movie shows that because they are chaotic does not mean that they are bad killers! I hope that people will watch this film and learn about important times in history like this. There is one very interesting thing about this movie that they have been inspired by their weapons from the Ned book! It is also what people remember, from their weapons. I hope that people will watch this film and get the same mind as I have.
