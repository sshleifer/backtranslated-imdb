George Cukor leads the classic brooding and cynical. Ronald Coleman is very different in the Noir piece about the actor who loses his job. Anthony John (Colman) appointed his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) away from his delightful anger and irresponsible behavior. But the two can continue to work together to enjoy their audience. Things begin to change as John begins to get tired of his work; he agrees to accept Othello. He enters into character as a jealous person and murderers. He starts walking in a narrow line between fraud and truth and ends up combining his role with his life and ultimately killing his Shelley Winters, but has no record of dastardly action. Colman appears to be innocent in this role. Winters are very amazing as a young woman decided to leave her life on a cabinet. Also in cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
