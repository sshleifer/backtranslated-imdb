A great flick of 90! Parker Posey is amazing in this story about night life in Manhattan which requires a lot of money. Posey offers amazing performance as a reader and nightclub. This is a good movie, lighter on Saturday night before going out. Sound sounds standing, clothing comes from the world, the script is funny and executives are doing a good job. The value of redemption: you can make it in the world if you're trying, just get your niche. I believe Parker Posey is an actress of PERFECT for this kind of behavior: young, fabulous and broke. (You should check on the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at the Party Girl you will have a good time. Enjoy!
