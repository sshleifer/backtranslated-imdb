La Maman and La Putain should be considered as a time-related film (after 68) and forever in many things. True, actors do not "act" ... True, they talk a lot ... But what they are talking about is what makes life worth living ... or die. A very long monologue used by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text written on feminine, humanity and love. It's not easy to translate correctly, though. This movie is information about the difficulty of being a man and woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of many French actors.
