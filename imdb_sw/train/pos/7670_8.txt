I enjoyed the "Doctor Mordrid". This is a low-budget film, which can be off-set for some, but I'm not a problem with it. I am even more excited about it, considering it more WAY than entertainment than the shade Hollywood takes every year. This is not bad for the release of exhibitions; I don't know about anyone else, but I would like to go to the movie. 'Doctor Mordrid' is an enjoyable film of science fiction which almost anyone can enjoy, especially if it's sci-fi like me. I don't see why this is a R-rated film; Only one word f is said, and there are no incidents of sudden death, nor any blood. A long battle between astrologers Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted to use his power to save the community, while Kabal wanted to make them slaves), gave a cautious story, while the story of the story added charm to the story itself. Basically, this film which is just fun to see. There is one surprising thing in this film, though: see Jeffrey Combs keep the face straight when wearing a blue cape and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I digress ... However, acting is great; The main characters (Anton, and his girlfriend, Samantha), love very much; Anton is compassionate, kind, and Samantha is a friend. Further, the settings were wonderful. The island in the other direction was very cold; we are only given a double view, though; it would be nice to see more events taking place here. The main arrangement was also quite good; Anton's apartment is a very large room, and has a good equipment, especially a monitoring system he uses to keep track of world events. He even has a pet strap that keeps in his house named Edgar. In general, this is a good film; it was a pleasure to enjoy, and the chief executives put many feelings into their responsibilities. If you can find anywhere 'Nurse Mordrid', you should hire (or, for my part, give me. It is obviously spent money!) My rating: 8 stars out of ten. <br /> <br />
