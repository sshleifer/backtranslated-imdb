The stars of Vertigo Stewart (in its last end as romantic leadership) and Novak lift this, another movie of "Christmas," a Stewart's movie on the middle-level entertainment. The two-star chemistry makes the experience of migrating the right and more revelation can be found from the film if magic is seen as a symbol of personal pain that hinders many relationships. All in all, beautiful and stars of the story, 7/10.
