"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian movies. The film is based on the book of Italian author Luciano Ligabue, who is also leading the movie and writes a music mark - indeed. <br /> <br /> The film is a picture of northern Italy, in Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, when the first free radio - one of the film boys build "Radioraptus". Young people want, friendship, love, sex, personal dramas and unemployment is among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs -Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery boring and values, the story flows very well; The shortage of practitioners is powerful and the way to lead as well. For clear Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is not Fellini nor a film specialist, first of all is a musician. But he succeeds in doing good products. Unfortunately he can not repeat the success with his second movie "Da zero dieci" - not quite good. <br /> In "Radiofreccia" artists are not very popular, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most famous Italian actors. Look at the small role of the Italian-Francesco Guccini composer, he is a good communist barman and soccer trainer!
