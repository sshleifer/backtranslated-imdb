For a film that had a little broadcast, and a few people felt, this was very good. It is one of these modern crime films in the UK that are quirky ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast," etc.). It's not wild as "Snatch" but it's interesting and has some bad characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a corny and predictable end but early in the show - it's not too late - it has some neat twist to make it very interesting for the first viewer. Basically, it is about a low-British male who sends off with a "grandmother-master email" who sends, with the help of two Russian friends, giving them a good surprise. Chapin and Nicole Kidman star-star, and it's very good as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as a Kirman Kidman group. This is a different kind of film and well done. Kidman once shows that he is more than a good face.
