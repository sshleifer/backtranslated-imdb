On MTV stimulates all the ball and the callers shot the Scarface movie of the classic out of their DVD collection. This can give you the idea that Scarface is a "movie gangster". Indeed, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not sure of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a cuban reserve to find a new way of life. He falls with a group of gangs and becomes a famous drug addict. Montana was all to do what you want to do with your life. Common words: "Say hello to my little friend!" is located in Scarface. This quotation is always coming to mind when I think about the movie Brian DePalmas, Scarface. This falls under my favorite top 10 movies. I would like to measure that *** 1/2 (out of ****). Certainly the movie should see. PHENOMENAL.
