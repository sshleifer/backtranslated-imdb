Rod Serling was, in fact, a professional and his fantastic ideas, of play, of creativity left something that he lived with television models in that state of development. No present presentations, but instead of "Mother's mother" series ala Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or a sad shock in humor and a magic banner that eliminates our high screens. Jack Elam is locked in a place with the correctness of the same act and its normal adultery that I can't help but think that Rod Serling was describing that last week's show near Elam, even though he was an assistant flow of stories. This period is about to decline, as usual, but shock and humor is mixed with the destruction of "Serlingesque" especially. Rex Lewis Field
