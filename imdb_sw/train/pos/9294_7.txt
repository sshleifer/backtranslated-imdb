Before you start, I must tell that I know the editor of this film. We have never met, but we are the same fanzine (the previous pre-message boards), and we have spoken on the phone, so I have a preference here. Even so ... It is a wonder that when the culture of "Rat Pack" at the end of 50 years and early to 60 years began to return to mid-90s, this movie, from for one of the original Mouse Pack, and which was made in the same style, was flop. Not only, it was very important; I believe that Peter the Rolling Stone Walker was the only one who did not try this (gave a mixed review, if I remember). And when I don't think this is the world's largest film, and not a fan of Rat packing, or "culture," culture, I think this is well worth seeing. <br /> <br /> For one thing, this looks stylish, and goes along. For another, the basic displays are good. Richard Dreyfus is amazingly barred here as a group of head coming from sanitarium, and has an obstacle. Jeff Goldblum returns to the silent silence displays which he put in his pre-blockbuster days, like BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only required to erase this film, she does it with fun. True, it's not a great film; The discussion is included with the puns, and most of them do not work (like all of "Zen's Ben's speech"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are bad here. Still, I was happy, and if you love gangster movies, you might be too.
