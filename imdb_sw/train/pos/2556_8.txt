And made for television film also, this film was good. The acting in it and the plot was very good. this one of the only movies I saw was feeling my feelings because I saw that I was afraid of a reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen. There were a few small things wrong with this movie, but more easily appears. Antonio Sabbato Jr made the best role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie has very doubtful and has made me need more because I have never thought a small TV movie budget could be very powerful. After watching this I read this novel movie was based (four times) and also kicking was great. If you have ever seen this film on TV, I would like to look at it. The effects of this film were well done, honestly does not know what a person who looks at the appearance would look like but through the FX team that made this film I was attracted to and all shows that all these bad things have been done for television movies out there and a small budget should not be misused . Look at. It's very good, not really, it's!
