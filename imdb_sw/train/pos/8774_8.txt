In the late 1800's, San Francisco, poorly dressed Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) works on the bank, and enjoys attending the local "fight" with a colleague and his friend Jack Carson (like Walter Lowrie). One day, pretty Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) walks into "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is taken by the elegant beauty of Mrs Smith, gives her bag of withdrawal. Smith is taken secretly by Flynn, but has been removed by his courage. The good work of Flynn (in fact, the attempt to take-up) finds a pleasant membership on the snooty "Olympic Club," which easily includes gymnasium (and boxing equipment). However, Flynn's striving, and the practical ignorance (persuading people in the same bars) convince members of the "Club". When the English field visits the club, members are trying to get Flynn to fight the man. They are hoping Flynn will resign, shy for his failure - but, Flynn wins! First time producer Robert Buckner puts together a good pack for Warner Brothers, and Raoul Walsh's director. Mr. Buckner was, indeed, with the success of his contribution (screenplay) to a brilliant studio "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is very good. There was "Gentleman Jim" - this story allegedly portrayed the real story of James J. Corbett's "Roar of the Crowd" - but, this film should be very fictionalized. Flynn is a very interesting person who leads; he runs the script lightly, and should be recognized, in the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's behavior were (are?) They were ignored as a great exhibition, and this is one of them. Smith does well as his female interests, using his feelings for the viewer. The Walsh Director is careful to look soft and desolate. Support is a treasure fort, from the Alan Hale (as Pat Patbet) of a walk-on Lon McCallister ("Mr. Paste Mr. Corbett"). ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
