There is no revolution here; a brilliant talent, cinema barrier. GARDE VUE is just near the drab police station, and especially for one interview room, but director Claude Miller (who made this amazing SWEET SICKNESS film, among others) interlinks The outdoor table as a scenography of minimalist area. Miller's prevention, especially early, is to breathe, and its amazing handling of the most important interior mise-en-scene makes it possible to watch. Lino Ventura is as good as usual, can justify the behavior that, on the paper, is cliche: detective, tough-nosed, the killing of the world. Ventura lives a role, making it completely reliable, although the script enables us to get a bit of its domestic work; The film will end this time it seems to be forced to face its defeat for the first time. Michel Serrault is the same as the killer of the accused children who tries to have one-flic oversight. The combination between the two is more-often-than-not pregnant with the tension and aura of a series of metamorphosing series for wits battles. The character of Serrault turns pride and pride, and sadness; then later .... The GARDE VUE message, if one can find one, is the punishment of police methods and the type of pressure that makes the police more aggressive, if necessary, close to the cost of justice. For much of its length though the film shines like anything more than an example of how to go back to a scenario that might be possible to put soporific at a celebration of a great cinema celebration. <br /> <br />
