Finally - I've got a round and can see the "clean" copy of Pakeezah! So far I have had a jerky mangled version that left the Dubai TV sometimes in the 90s, with quirky English headlines, a large color coverage and water-colored water. After thinking the world of bad copy (and short) I get one of the respect was worth waiting and perfect 140 minutes even more than pleasure than I thought it was possible. This was a good Meena Kumari film from beginning to end, and I believe it was planned by him since 1958, and finally realized in 1971. It was a shame that long-term alcoholism finally killed him later, and in fact he was very ill to make some pictures of Pakeezah, require a double body. In other cases, definitely appears in his face. The Story of Cleanness Against Difficulty I can only treat as a falsehood of anything apart from it, but I have been guided to understand that faithfully shows the world now that has gone which must be common at one time in India. It is a lively and colorful film with an unpleasant epic message, a romantic sexual episode that somehow feels. But for me it is a non-collateral gold and Ghulam Mohammed who plays with Lata Mangeshkar impossible - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part in opening a story that makes this film better. I've been hearing so many times, beautiful, poetry, amazing and singing songs on any film. Singin 'In Rain can be my favorite music music but Pakeezah has my favorite music - but Lata said that these songs did not mean anything special. I just think that Mohammed's sole alone also had one song here, though the old desk and Lata. Because of all this but not his mistakes, Pakeezah is my proposed Indian movie, which was hit when the Westernisation of India accumulated momentum and was watching now when Western values ​​seem to be government-sponsored by rigueur. In Pakeezah's low look for the taste of Indian music "pop" you had to give the world before the stripes of drums, sound sounds and bhangra.
