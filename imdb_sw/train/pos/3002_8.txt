"The Kennel Criminal Case" begins to run and does not even end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is as strong as Philo Vance, a gentleman's detective. Mary Astor is delighted as the only grandchild who just wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie comes with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which also enjoys. If you have to rent a disc (or check from your local library), do so. It's a fresh entertainment!
