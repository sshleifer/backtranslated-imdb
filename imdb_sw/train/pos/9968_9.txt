My mother sent me to see this film as a child and I would like to see it every year if I do all other Christmas things. What I missed most is the ignorant devil and Santa looking through his telescope. I waited and watched through the T.V Guide. every year after that you see when it will be displayed. Often I would play on Saturday afternoon. I just got a movie in English that has taken something special from the film and I have found a copy of it in Spanish. I keep this favorite film with my heart and has never suffered from a dream as others might suggest. Yes, it's a different film about Santa Claus and that's what makes it special and special. I can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as I explain to them pieces and my favorite likes!
