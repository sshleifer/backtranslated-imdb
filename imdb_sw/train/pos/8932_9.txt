The film does not seem surprising in a natural sense. Does not show a series of beautiful pictures. Rather it is an interesting film. Emphasizes the viewer to continue the process or maybe consider the situation of various shots. This kind of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed. The film refuses to use a crutch type to help the viewer to fully share what is going on. Instead the film touches and flows through a number of different types. Device to love the film is to be happy to play. I condemn 99% of North American viewers will not only get it. If you would like to delete this video description, or a philosophical message, or a sign of the sign, etc. you will lose your time. None of these. Movies only show these types and others sometimes. The only power to connect to the film is the understanding of Claire Denis of what is appropriate together. There are a few lengthy feature films that are closer to describing the Kant's art, it is a powerful pleasure of judgment itself rather than gaining experience under the concept. The movie usually takes the easy way and opens with the simple pleasure of understanding what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most movies does not come close to art. When the film makes, as this does, and still enjoys the audience, it's a miracle thing. My negative opinion is that sometimes I find the film also easily buy within the various threads of the story run. The Tahiti's father's story, though not very common, ends up doing little things to be clear and simple. It rules too much.
