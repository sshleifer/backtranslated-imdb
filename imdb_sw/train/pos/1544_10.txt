This is ideal but it is difficult to get a trippy world of spy thriller in Italian style of 60 inappropriate. From the images of psychedelic features of the preliminary features and the great scores of Ennio Morricone in the lesbian area and Capucine and the events of the landscape of an organized and apocalyptic man-made war with the poisoning of German horsemen in full gear storm , this is a movie that should not be lost. It is a film that gets scared and the violence of war and the violence of players on and off the battlefield. In addition to the events of the war, some of the production and special effects are first, because because the majority of this film's budget has been stored for the events of the war, but for 60 movie lovers it is not appropriate to be a matter. I first saw this film on television many years ago and I had a view to wipe it on VHS. I still have a tape and enjoy watching it again and again.
