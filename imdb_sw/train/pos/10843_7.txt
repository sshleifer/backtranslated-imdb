What happens to wash the rock stars in the late 1990s? They launch a return / return journey. At least, they are members of the Strange Rock (70 fictional) group. Tony (Rea) has a contract on condoms to remove condoms while driving a child of a popular music festival. It was at the festival in the 70th century that wonderful Fruit broke. The 70 is "retro" and when it is similar to the wave. He puts off in search of other band members. Part of what broke the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the leading singer and the author of a brilliant song. The band was known for its extravagant life and now they all come back to the class of work they came to. Beano, drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was a brilliant in Secret and False) is a layout, a bass player is a roof, and their leading singer is still rock. When he owns a big house he is forced to sell it, if his fortune has not continued. Brian, the guitarist, is dead, so the guitar player is employed to replace him. <br /> <br /> Some bands agree to give an attempt to meet. Leaving their day-to-day jobs, they begin to postpone, and their manager reaches their labels about restoring their albums. But he wants to start starting the first visit. And so they hit the circle of the club around Europe. The club area does not matter to this shortage, laid, rocky. It is a tour that the film begins to develop. All the old conflicts began again, with Keith and Brian's data around. They all depend on because they are all looking for a second position of greatness that prevented them early. And it gets some of the personal chemistry that made it fun and very enjoyable. Crazy still begins as the Spinal II Pipeline but gradually becomes a more concentrated film, following the relationship of the band members. While it is still a very exciting movie, it is the perpetrators, struggling to cope with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own demons, which works on film.
