In spite of reading the "original comments" from someone who was unhappy to love the film - (WHY DO YOU GET THAT RIGHT TO GET LIST?) It was very good to remember that almost everyone liked it! Obviously the church wanted to emphasize certain points and to show the Prophet Joseph Smith in a way that was a good idea. And in fact, those points were very good. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but in spite of that, and all the evil trials that came from the enemy, showed how he could accomplish a wonderful work, given by God. I would recommend anyone!
