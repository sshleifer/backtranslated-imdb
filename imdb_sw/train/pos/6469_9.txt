This is very short from Hal Roach. This is the reason for two main reasons: infants in a short time are among the fragments that have been on the film and the plot has many interesting and well-written articles. A few, Rascals Rascals Few, I honestly can't think of a baby player than Spanky at the age of four. Despite being a very young and unhappy child in later years, he had only value here. And, put the little boy in charge of the babies even the young children are not only pleasing, but again on a good thing. When older children have banned to do this very bad job of children, all kinds of funny mayhem breaks will disappear. Gags are very good and well done at the time - with a crash accident accident involving the murder and the last area that Spanky STEP get the control of the scale to be memorable memory. I have not seen these cups for decades and I am glad I have given them this opportunity.
