He wore a vicious kill made a bit of ruckus when he first released in 1980: he had a "Police Girl" in a role that was mega-erotic, as Angie Dicknson played a housewife who was sexually abused by looking at a good time in all the worst museums (and inside of the packages of the apartment), with Nancy Allen as a girl-call, Michael Caine as a New York cousin of modern Norman Bates, and enough photographs of lurid permanently filming two films. Today is a little bit of interaction with the standards and, although the non-included version has some of the "hot" content of any De Palma film, at least in its 70th and early 80th century, where it appeared to repeat the theme The times, thought taken off the film-reels of classic Hitchcock and given tawdry planting. It is a simple story that has already been seen in Sisters, and again at a standard in Double Body, and also in Blow Out. Cutie Allen calls-girl Liz Blake, who explains her name of the murder of Kate (Dickinson, in full mode of MILF '), after a beard, a suicide weapon from Dr Elliott's office (Michael Caine, performance stone-frost over the way) <br /> <br /> From the beginning, which De Palma seems to do as a way to establish a dangerous sex zone as a way of topping the opening area of ​​Carrie (which, perhaps, he just does in The editing frame), we find a series of technical skills that will go through the perspective of the fashion itself: the track shots in the museum, which means to stimulate more of the fascination and the process itself, to follow and want to be followed, than any kind of tension; tracking on the lowest road (the path of Carlito's pathway is done at the level of accuracy, at the same time, with a little of exploitation cast by the black group; The behavior of the son of Peter, Kate Gordon, who does what is a little boy of real life De Palma as a child (science geek, monitored by Hitchcock and voyeurism). And it's all entertaining and entertaining as hell as something close to the real thing that makes De Palma's wonders unique while independent of the uncertainty of the film's fears. On the other hand, this consciousness of the soul finished returning to tell the director in the buttocks a few times in recent years, and somehow in the wearing of that kill begins to get worse and disappointing as the story should connect. If the Psycho theme comes along even more (someone who wants to change sex, even does not think he kills as * he is doing it), there is a scene of exhibition at the police station doing the above Movie film is seen as an amazing psychological revelation. With the last events in the house of Peter, and also calling for the pain of remembering the largest sequence in Carrie, it is meant to be deceived that even to De Palma is to apply to him; The ultimate shot in particular, although the master's class how to make himself. However there is a very shocking and, in itself, a perfect place in a mental hospital in the midst of this confused problem, where the doctor performs a particular job for the nurse, which all the other patients do as animals in the zoo, and the shepherd shot up and up on The area is one of the best shots to distort sex / total that has been taken on the film. So the disgrace is that the film ends up in a strange and non-verbal way, where then it is an amazing piece of massages, where the class is all-round on technical elements (soft lighting, cameras that seem to be very simple) with something that should be found in a mix of paper for 25 cents. It is not boring, but I would like to take over the recent influences of the director.
