Although there are no new incidents, and have not been shown a few times. I loved Sabrina magic and a young witch. I've never seen the last moments, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did aunt have to go out of the show? I'm sure the end went to be perfect. But there are many questions without answers. And I want to see the last part of S.T.T.W! Because I have heard deciding between Erin and Harvey on the wedding day! I hope that it takes Harvey! And I would say Nate Richart is HOTT !! Your very bad too old for me though. Melissa Joan Hart has a cut-out point that adds to the show, but there are a few "stupid" things to show as well as the popular band comes from anywhere and playing songs and cast is listening, its kind of stupid. With the cat begins to be disabled, as the show continued, the joke started just as stupid, and the things that the controlled voice "listeners" would laugh, I would think it was lame. Do not do it wrong, in a certain place it was funny, but I think show only a kind of lost "magic" to say if the show continues. I give to all those who were cast though to try, though the girl of Soleil Moon Frye had no taste, and was a good actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the cast does now for that, now that the show is over.
