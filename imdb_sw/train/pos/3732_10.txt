Producer Joel Schumacher who also led "Phone Booth", '02, and other great films showed very deeply how no one can be taught to kill and outdoors their own reputation and the fear of the truth that a person is dealing with when coming into COMBAT. ! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Inquiry", '03', gave one of his best performances and actually made this picture all back to him. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", '02', gave a great role to help with Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All Girls Real", '03', showed his true skills in the role he played. There were two short events where the soldiers were able to get a hot romance on a short departure in the inner city and they had to pay for their love and sexual desires. A Veteran Veteran teacher from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to tackle the enemy really by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on the human body. Enjoy and enjoy watching movies.
