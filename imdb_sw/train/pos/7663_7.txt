As a rule, the full color of the production of the Moon is a warning sign to avoid the film. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I shot. It is not bad. It's not good, but that's something else. This film involves the struggle with the evil "brother" (who is evil) who wants to dominate the whole world, and the character of the title. Dr Mordrid also needs to deal with people, and authorities in the world world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Destroyers can follow. Dr. Mordrid can travel between "tests," and makes it a friend to protect the castle; however, the guards are blinded. His eyes have been damaged by holes. So the witch puts his hands on the eyes of another, and he, presto! His eyes are restored! This kind of healing works only for the eyes. Later, Mordred and his "brothers" live several bones of animals in a fighting museum. I think which one wins <br /> <br /> However, the side from there, the picture is not so bad, though it's like a comic book. More adventures of "David" of Dr Mordred are similar, and Combs has a reliable role. <br /> <br /> I've seen more votes.
