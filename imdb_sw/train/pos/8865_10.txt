Two unemployed brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) are tired of compete for who is greater than *** and up with whom Daddy (Albert Finney) likes more, so they refuse the hair scheme to rob the mother and Daddy violence they can open their debts and start fresh. It looks like a great deal except that this is a density of the 1970s melodrama of a link about a goose, and a boy, doing things really going wrong here with our bad duo and everyone involved. Used by the image writer Kelly Masterson and the usual killings by director Sidney Lumet, "Before the Devil Knows You Died" uses a heist like his McGuffin to describe deep within the family game. <br /> <br /> Unlike popular belief, Sidney Lumet did not die. At the age of 83, he apparently made an agreement with the Devil to give one last film. Lumet was in its zenith in the 1970s and films as "Day of the Dog Day," "Serpico," and one of my favorite films of all time, "Web". In some way he has been able to make a film that carries all the notable titles during the intervention of some modern intercourse (gender sex, abuse, and playing with time frames and POV) into a strong, powerful, dynamic, and motivating melodrama. . One can only hope that some modern greats (like Scorsese or Spielberg) emerged during the same decade Lumet was on his game will have this very chutzpah left when reaching the age. Lumet is a master in leading people to walk through space to create tension and develop characters. If they hit us waltzes through Manhattan's well-chosen offices and its moving rooms gradually create a feeling of anxiety if we do not know who might be next to the next corner or what this person can do in the next room. Also amazing is how Lumet uses multiple POV and modifying time. The most commonly used submissions use the same films of wunderkinds Christopher Nolan and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seem to be at an hour. Of course, what Lumet has is the best in leading a wonderful mix and oppressing them into their lives. Philip Seymour Hoffman has never, and most likely never will be, better than he here. The comments of Albert Finney's silence of the father who was betrayed and at the end of his string are the focal point of view. Ethan Hawke, usually a good nondescript boy, is perfect as a little hurt emotional brother who has played so long on his attractions and shapes. However, a series of events between Hoffman and Marisa Tomei, for sure if his wife run away. Lumet operates through sensory feelings that reach the area that is the best of its kind since William Holden misled Beatrice Right in the Best Oscar Executive Assistant in the "Web." The devil of any good film is in the description, from the Albert Finney pipeline of his car which can not be closed due to the bender's fender, by looking at Amy Ryan (clean off turning him into a "Baby Gone Gone") gives her husband's former Ethan Hawke in his promise to the ers of the little girl all three know she can't put it, by destroying the family system on the skids, in the discussion of praying to Pastors quotation (my favorite line to be a threat to trick "Do you think I call Chico?" ) for the best score of Carter Burwell. "Before the devil knows you are dead" is a year film. If something happens well, then we know many other contracts should be broken by Old Scratch.
