I saw this film, and played, and I must add that this is the most touching story I have ever seen. Until I saw this film I did not know how bad life was and perhaps for South African children and adults who were living at that time. It brought tears to my eyes and sadness to my heart that any man should have such a problem in order to survive, and bring the children out of the area and teach them to act and achieve and transform them to tell their own story is just amazing. This reduces only five stars, and weighs ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for this amazing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that makes it hard in my heart. If there are VHS, or DVD out there to play, Please let me know ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with children wishing to bring to their attention and their situation with the attention of other countries in the hope that one person would have a heart and help.
