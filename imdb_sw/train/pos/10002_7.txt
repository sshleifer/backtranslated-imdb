This is quite simple film stored in Brooks's inn. Indeed, it is wrong. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of the singers, or Titanic gave the true view of Italy). Most of the joke falls flat. But yet, this film is very popular in many ways of the comedi not, and so pull it in stories about some of the most traditional members of the resurrection really is amazing. Not the King of Fisher, but not strict, either. My complaint alone is that Brooks should beat someone else (I love Mel as Director and Author, not a guide).
