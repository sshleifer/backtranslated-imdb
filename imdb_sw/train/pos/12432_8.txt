I expected this to be the same type of sand as the original Modesty Blaise movie, that's why I left it unnoticed for a long time, but I was very surprised. Besides being a series of gun-free gun and boat / boat, it was a close analysis of how a beautiful girl gets harder like nails, without something overlapping or on rationalized. It is possible that the budget constraints were supported by these: short-term efforts and efforts to find a way to learn for ignorant men to pretend to die, and more committed to making movies appear. Hell, the greatest gun battle takes place on the screen - and the area in which it is heard is best for that natural noise, which adds to the doubts - who is winning? Who died? Alexandra Staden can not be a good player like Monica Vitti, but a few are, and indeed she has all kinds of class and fire that is needed to make the character look like her face, hair its, and its beautiful, thin body could be lifted directly from the comic-strip images. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was a perfect choice for the bad man of Blaise, in that he made a habit to be interesting and enjoyable - even recommended (and I doubt I would like to consider taking many brutal killers, psychopathic as friends) to drink). I can't think of one of the "old ministers" of Hollywood who could pull that position well. Fortunately, bad baddies of Blaise die, the end (no demolition there!) That is a very good thing, because all the girls who would spend their time standing on this fascinating and fascinating hunk can now give us a basic Joes.
