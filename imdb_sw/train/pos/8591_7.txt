This was a very good movie. This movie is just good to sit down and look and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood film. This movie will never win Oscar or anything and certainly not one right, but I thought it was good. It's kind of show 24 but installed in the film format. If you like all we should stop the terrorist without killing the type of film then you will enjoy this flick. I personally think that the storyline has been made very WAY, but the Sentinel does not add a little twist and mole in the Secret Service. For all, this film will not leave your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who says every movie should be like that good?
