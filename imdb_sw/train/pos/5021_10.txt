I lost this film and watched it 20 times before returning to the shop. Bill Paxton recruited the first first talent to make a good sweet and other interesting changes. Stories are original and well written. Power Booth and Paxton both offer good performances. The story is told in an amazing way with two back matches behind 20 years, and then the current, dynamic and return ads. This story style makes a good thriller that can not get lighter. Bill Paxton, please make many awesome movies, you have a talent for it!
