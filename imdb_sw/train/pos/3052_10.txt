Surprisingly and emotionally confused about a middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) is run by his quiet father on demand (Donald Sutherland) when he sees a decline ( John Ritter) and play with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about the biggest problem, but "Fear" is the highest excitement that looks like "American Beauty" meets "Expert". Macy and Sutherland are scales here. A wonderful start for the author of the first time / director Henry Bromell. I wonder that this film does not get a chance to stay in movies for more than a couple of weeks.
