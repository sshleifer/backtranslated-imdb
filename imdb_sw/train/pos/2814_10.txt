This is the best film used to deal with the issue of AIDS. It is a document about two people living and dying of this disease. Movies are beautiful, stimulating, amazing, and moving. Most of all, it's a wonderful story story. Make sure you have a few hankies before you watch this film â€” you will need them. Wonderful.
