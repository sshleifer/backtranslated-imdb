The endless barriers to our humanity for our kindness are never able to beat me. This amazing story of the people who are used to horrible and largely untouched is compelling, well documented and encouraging. Like the United States, I have often been helped by my country's behavior and this is just another in our long list of international debasement. We exploit. That is probably the first letter of John Pilger that I saw, but once it made me see what else he did. My only complaint, and because I have given this film out of 8 out of 10, is that the Trainer shows us this effectiveness and the awesome cooperation of the US and UK governments, claims that we viewers / citizens are right for not to do ... comments about how to help. I don't know about Britain, but America has made it difficult for citizens to participate in their government activities. Sign in the right direction can help the people of this island.
