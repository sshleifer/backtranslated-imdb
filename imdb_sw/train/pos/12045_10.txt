I watched this film for the first time when I was a child and it was the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes with great fear in a particular area. I recalled again by the deletion of my special friends and immediately buying it on the video with a very hesitant I can add (just to my surprise I found it on the internet in the country when it was done in the UK!) I looked again at my answers and my surprise was similar, of great fear and The fear and never my heart beat so much. This is in my opinon film that has ever been done, Hollywood films are tame in comparison with a little pony and trap (crap), pardon pun. What is surprising though it is the power of this film and in uni when watching this and almost my twenty partners have never heard so much noise, blokes too! Even seeing a video brings the fear of God into me one place, and makes me feel not going to walk alone again in the dark!
