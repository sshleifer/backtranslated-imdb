I liked watching "Sabrina, a young witch" Friday night on the TGIF of ABC. I think this was one of the best displays on TGIF. My brothers and I were meeting every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed part. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He had a delightful and sooo funny. I loved Sabrina's partner, too. She was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good youth magician, too. My popular events are "Sabrina Through the Watch" mirror and "Hilda and Zelda: Youth Years". These events were good. <br /> <br /> Overall I've missed this show. I hope one day ABC returns back to new events. I give this star 10/10 stars.
