The newborn baby, with Japanese hyde and Gackt, was the most beautiful movie I was expecting. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. Setting up Mallepa, the story tracks a group of orphans in the street, brothers Sho Sho, Sho, and Toshi who rob and kill make life. On one of the robberies, Sho meets the Kei vampire of Hyde in the sun. Through the great nature of Kei's true nature is shown, however no one stops him. When it passes and means that an eternal, unchanging Kei has brought Sho, and the two have a close bond. Sho and Kei then meet the Son in the fight against the strong gun, and they become quick friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with the sister of the Son, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time is running again and shows the entire Sho, this time of disappearance of Kei. It also explains that Sho and Son have been enemies. Through the tragedy after the tragedy this film comes into reality of life and all the trouble, based on friendship and love. It's a really touching movie that is sad yet good at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Gackt did a very good job. Hyde did an amazing job for the first timer. The strings were good, but the film had rare and short shots. All, I must say this movie is amazing, moving, and I recommend it very much.
