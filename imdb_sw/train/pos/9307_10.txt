Not a movie for everyone, but this film is on me 10. I am a lover of black comedy. With the cast including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) in heads, lines cannot help but be dry. Support support is near the death center. Counting a few errors in the movie: The decision of Ellen Barkin gave her face you have to look out; there were several ghosts of Gimme and Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who did not serve any purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screen time was too short. Best of all, the cast was just wonderful without egos beautiful script. If you have seen a film by Larry Bishop (author, director), Underworld (dark violation of the darkness), you will enjoy this. His departure (author, director, actor) is Hell Ride and Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
