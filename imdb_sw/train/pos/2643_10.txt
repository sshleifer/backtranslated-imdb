In fact I can't say much more about the movie program that you have never said. I haven't seen the film in 25 years and its memory has never left me. I've been looking everywhere. I have done a search of the net in the past but came empty. Last night I had thought about the film again and I tried to remember who was in it but I was only 10 or 12 years old when I had finished seeing it and I was not sure whether I had a movie name and so I decided to find another search and finally found this. I was right. If someone knows where I can get a copy of this beautiful movie sharing with my family please please let me now on tawnyteel@yahoo.com I would like to know the truth. And for anyone who has not seen this film and has its place is worth it.
