MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his non-Bondi roles as a middle-class pastor with a middle-life crisis while in Mexico where he is a square-age squad (Kinnear affected) and sees more life than death. Newbie new movie player Richard Shepard makes the first red photo with a bad black player with a sharp eye for the visual and non-effective conversation and the development of a character that makes him a talent for looking into this breathing air 'comedy buddy'. The formula skewers what expects its direction and allow Brosnan to get her-to-out and devil devil. Gem of sleep indie hit.
