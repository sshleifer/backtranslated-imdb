If you do not feel more than an hour longer than this film can give you a difference. What I like is an ongoing surprise. Not only once you want one or more films in 'New York I Love You' to continue. Well, some short film makes them curious, some of them are very short, some of them are long, some of them last, some of them don't. <br /> <br /> Many news provides the sad side of the capital. It shows many national background. Many of them make it feel the same way I went to the capital in another country in a year where many people came from different countries. This film explores many kinds of things that you might know, but for all characters it is new things. Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just feel something new, meet new people; feel a dream, sadness, but a kind of sadness you are looking for because it is just that you had been in your home. You may want to do it again, to watch this.
