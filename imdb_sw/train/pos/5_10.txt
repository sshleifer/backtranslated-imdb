I came in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any character or even its head until I looked at it here, where I see that it has received a mixed reception with your profile. I am a good side of this film but one thing took my attention when I looked at: The beautiful and sensitive symbols written in Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was good when I realized that the mark was written by no one except John Williams himself. He has indeed written sensitive and painous marks such as the Schindler List but often incorporates his name with bombasticities like Star Wars. But in my opinion what Williams has written for this film exceeds what I have ever heard about its tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, perfectly in focusing on the tender and good plan of the movie. With another recent score, for Catch Me as You Can, it shows yet more and more wit. Like Stanley and Iris, I like educational movies such as Green was what Valley and Konrack, one with John Voigt and his South African charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc.. They say the important stories of the mind and wake up spiritually, a story that cannot be told often enough. This is the best supplement to that kind.
