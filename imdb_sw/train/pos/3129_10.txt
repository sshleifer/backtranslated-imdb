This is one of the best reconciliation ever, and Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun when doing so. It is amazing how much effort has come in, particularly to enhance the sense of the 1960s, put Batcave, Wayne Manor, dress, and elected actors to play young, Western, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is your precious time, and it's fun for all the classic fans of the 1960 "Batman" series of television. I realize that part of the "Batman" had been done from the film, and not in itself, as a result of legal restrictions. Let's expect the third season of the upcoming show on DVD.
