My opinion would be added to the section of RELEASE DATE, but I couldn't find its place. I was shocked to see that this movie was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it at the Washington, DC's first stadium in March, 1958. Surprised if it was given again, or some problem? In my opinion, this movie is very entertaining, but it has some classic characters. John McIntyre does the work of bang-up as a thief / entrepreneur thief / thief. Walter Brennan does the same role he did in the early Red River. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives success as he did. I have seen this film ten times more or more, and we never found its parts again. Photography and landscape is good, and offers an amazing amount of entertainment for an hour and thirty-six minutes.
