... heads, hands, and feet - bands from the past, as well as wonderful Fruit. Whammy three times there. Those who said that they do not like this film are of no heart or less than 40, and have not experienced any real experience. For their sadness. This is a very small picture that is the best way to pass an hour or two, and it may even not be very good for a second display. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a fat player (in many ways a very good example of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as a neurotic spokesman and a man in front of them all turn to good performances, and Juliet Aubrey has good The eyes go to a bright acting as Karen, who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly destroy. <br /> <br /> Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes is great and clear, Mott of Hoople back up before one for all their ignorance, and the script has never been mawkish for more than a minute. Do not compare this to the Wind Wind or Rutles or Full Monty - it's the same for all. A close comparison is responsibility, and that's not a bad thing. And any film that can erase the memory of Blodwyn Pig - the band does not remember if it sees, but the name lives - well, shows anyone in the team knew what was about it. <br /> <br /> Happy little, and thanks to memory. Oh, and I have something else - Tiny Fingers; and what about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Inchi ten NAILS anyone? (You see a movie or on the road)
