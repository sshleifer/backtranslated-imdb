This animation had been hit down and still it. It is impossible to movie the dorky children as described, I still return for 10 years after I first saw. One of the best movies provided. The perfect animation is good, the camera technique gives you a 3D and the story is still good today even after growing up and seeing the criminals like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It has nothing near deep but try to see it from a good perspective. It's a fascinating story, not questioning. It is still one of my favorites that I have also come to when I feel like a mix of more life of heart. Not to mention her new movies, there is a sad moment in this and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
