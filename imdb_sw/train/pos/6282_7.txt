Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired retired thief who is forced out of retirement when he is forced to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he retires, by finishing his brother's jobs stealing 50 cars a night. He has to collect his old staff who can rely on him to help him get out and get his bro from the dutch. But the cops are on it, so can you remove it? This was one of the most famous filmmakers to make a review if the text was away from the classic. And if you go into it you expect a lot, and turn your brain's mind into so that you can ignore the pit of a mere conspiracy to take a movie for what it is. You will end up enjoying the trip. Looking for a double bill and "Fast and Furious" for the night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out to spin right later.
