Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is the real art of animation. The efficiency and skill that shows this work of duos does not exist in a more powerful witness than this cartoon. It is a shame that many people can only see the mistake of why, and they were always required to be, a piece of entertaining heart that did not intend to call black people. If anything is rent for infectious and humorous music. I have not seen this connectivity for many years as the 'commissars race' in the UK have seen that too angry to be displayed in various UK colors. If anyone knows popi I can get a copy I would like to look at this work again. I think those who constantly search for messages and motives that have never been considered in these cartoons, which, after all, sixty years old, should try to strengthen and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that doesn't mean that anyone has the right to explore what appears from the past.
