I don't know why some people from the United States, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about something that they don't really understand. For those who did not watch this film - see. Do not expect too much or do not set certain systems because this is Kosturica. Look at the movie without hate, try to understand the deepest humor inside - the people of Serbia DID really get married when Bil Clinton hit their valley villages, scholars in all Balance are always trying to f * ck you on any way they can, LOVE is always unexpected, clean and The colors, and the Balkans are very creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie I see only that the US's sh * t (like meet Dave, Get Smart etc.) is worse than the pure Balkan, the true love of the cinema's love story as I promise. The opinion should be of interest and the second place should represent the personal view of the author. I think the movie is good and people are looking at it should give their respect to the director and the story told inside. It's simple, but it's true. It is brutal, but it is gentle and it tends to the dead.
