I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and I have never forgotten it. The movie shows the fear of war through which Hollywood usually glosses over. The relationship between the two warring soldiers is shown by the difference in the culture and ultimate knowledge that ultimately we are not all completely different inside. If you can find any type of copy of this - purchase or lease. You can't be disappointed, just frustrated.
