This is a good movie when viewed in the right context - It meant to have a definition of the youth-horror-and-movies movies (and '80s felt much)! I saw this film when it first happened, and immediately liked it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was good to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a hateful preacher cannot be so bad! Also, Fastway was already my favorite, so it was good to hear them on sound. VHS of nature (this was before the DVD) Trick or Treat lid showed the example of Sammi knees, playing his guitar in a hot ring and "demon" looking at. It was a special procedure, and the price of VHS copies when (in 1987) was $ 90! I wanted the movie, but not for the price of ignorance. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover was only created for a $ 5 release. From the company it seems that Gene and OZZY were the only people known in the film, so they were better put 'em on the lid! One thing with the "small shop of threats" earlier - Jack Nicholson was in it for every five minutes, but now they have him on the lid as he was the main star. I have a "Trick or Treat" network, and it's amazing how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway has helped develop the story by giving their album to 'Sammi Curr'. All-all, it was just a good time, movie-rock-rock. Certainly not considered too much, but just enjoyed!
