this is an honest attempt to make a love story of love. A clear inspiration after a series of television series "Bewitched," this beautiful sweet rom-com is a temporary treasure. The comparison is obvious. jimmy stewart feels but not "right". kim novac has a magician of a strong blond who takes him using the use of love. but when the spell is broken by a powerful witch, he is involved in the running of his own shop and finds comfort in the fact that his beloved pyewacket (his familiar clan) is cared for by his beloved aunt. you will recognize Aunt from "Killed by Death." This movie is fun and highly touching, taking a wonderful wit with a good sense of jealousy. value check.
