Thomas Capano was not the boss of Anne Marie Tom Carper, the Governor was. That's why Feds involved, called Clinton and asked him to get Feds involved in the case. I lived outside Philadelphia at the time the case was the front page every day. I read the Ann Rule book and saw the part of the "City of Secrecy" on A & E. Tom Capano was megalomanic (sp.), The uber ruler and monster. He demanded to love Ann Marie but all she wanted was a man who could control. When it did not allow him to do it again he killed, the last type of control. I think it is losing money that is still alive.
