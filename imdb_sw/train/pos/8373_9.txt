Note to an inspector who passed by: this movie is "the effectiveness of the false science of Iliad" according to the scribe. Therefore, if the records are painful or not, there is no forgiveness, it is based on the film. They agree they stole ... although it was taken by P.C. time. The biggest but very short. Probably not as a writer, director, or label he wanted, but it is not very good. The fact that the label itself entered when doing it helps only increase its legacy. Extra budgeting will not be exciting, and perhaps won't make the screen more fair. But it's fun to dream about the possibilities there. The DVD version and additional surveys appear but I don't think it would play on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and so I'm still trying to think of this out. At present, I live with the body of VHS.
