I have been enjoying the work of Edward Burtynsky for many years, and was very happy to see someone working, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's document. The brilliant bridge of the shipping bridge in Bangladesh, the city of Vermont, the largest plant in China, the former Shanghai villages that are waiting to be reduced: these landscapes are taken well by the photographer and film manufacturer. Sometimes I thought of old TV documentation on coal mines left by plastic-mold industries; the kind of things I've been looking at. Burtynsky's work has great value to show how industrial activity has just changed Asia, it has not stopped. The most amazing part of me was a computer yard somewhere in China - the waste was terrible air on it, when the workers were very supporters.
