Well done. Much of the angst. Friendship cannot tolerate all, but ultimately it's all important, or so a group of friends learn. I've watched it regularly. Music is also amazing. When Kei has lost one friend until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not accepted by his true nature. In the unofficial streets of Mallepa they are struggling to find their own place between the circles of Asian societies, and learn that sometimes it can be higher than you are willing to pay. Finish the surprise that comes as all the film does. I couldn't get enough. Gackt and Hyde are doing a good job of doing, confirming that they are more beautiful boys who are singing.
