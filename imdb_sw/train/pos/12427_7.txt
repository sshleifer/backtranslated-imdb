This film has a lot of markup power. The script is bright, the conversation is (usually) better (although it may stand losing cheezy voice-overs), leadership and movies are quite awesome, though some experiments just don't work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a young girl, always a young girl; and sad thing, easy is that it can't play anything but Fox Mulder. He stands, trying to be quick, trying, trying to be awake. Finally he tries only hard. He exceeds his character, he is increasingly crossing his line, and he only appears in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, each in his class on the issue of practical skills. Timothy Hutton was (as always) very well. There were two or two moments where he stood on his role, but you can tell him he was enjoying. He looked at that part, and became a physical and atmospheric character. Angelina Jolie was also very good. He had no great responsibility; In fact, though he could use one of the most powerful ... his behavior was not close enough, though he did very well for what he had. And the chemistry between him and Hutton was obvious (gee, maybe that's why if he had left himâ€¦;) For all, it was hard around, but a strong effort for good work and great help. If David Duchovny had not broken his place into pieces it would have been * the better. 7/10.
