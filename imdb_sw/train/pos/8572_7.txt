The first movie was beautiful, but not as good as an amazing animated classic which I found more poignant and love. This end is very poor, but not very bad. Of course slapstick is a lot, the script has its weak areas and the plot is uninspired. But the dog is very good here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as macaw. Movies are good looking and stylish movies and appearance eye (especially Cruella), and music is pleasant. Acting is very good, Ioan Gruffudd is very attractive to Gerard Depardieu when he has made a good show of excitement as Cruella assistant. But good property, as it was with the first film, is wonderful Glenn Close in high performance on high as Cruella, even worse than ever before. In general, it is good. 7/10 Bethany Cox
