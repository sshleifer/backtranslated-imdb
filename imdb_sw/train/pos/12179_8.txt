I happened to watch this film luckily a few days ago when hitting the way. My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.In 'A Guy Thing', Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle-based counterpart who is about to marry Karen (Selma Blair) and sit down an unconditional life of an inheritance. in the middle. First we meet Paul in his minority party, where he says there is no desire to participate in the common nature of his bounty (amazing friends) who have insisted, if they are a little naughty and he gets into trouble and will soon be in trouble with collision. In fact, the next thing Paul knows, is the morning after last night, he's a bed and eating a dancer of honey, and his mother-in-law's phone tell him that Karen is on it. Oh, and a hull player is Karen Becky's cousin (Julia Stiles). From this small problem of trouble it can grow a big shadow of misfortune, as Paul appears to be ignorant, hiding what he did while going on to be a good man, directed by a family, who is a great excitement of his children coming. His efforts to make sure Karen was still not wise about anything wrong with his way to surprise Paul next to Becky who enjoys fun, forcing him to question whether he really needs a life that seems to be decorated. The movie has a proper mix of comedy and romance. Surely the value of watch.
