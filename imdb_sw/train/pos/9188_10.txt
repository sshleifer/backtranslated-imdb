His worst people didn't understand this and the next section. <br /> <br /> But don't worry! The disease describe also you :) <br /> <br /> This period is divided into two pieces. <br /> <br /> The first part is the "dream" of Tony in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. Now people who did not understand is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. in this section on the preparation of His death. He loses his own identity and eventually even forgives himself, so it separates all his connections with this world. You will see what I say in the doctor's area, where tony says he has lost his basket which has "his life". The creators do their best to translate them to their own ideas of what happens at death. If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next section is something special, and a great spiritual meaning. <br /> <br /> Like every episode sopranos acting and copying is very good. The only thing I didn't understand was the role of the speakers. Gonna watch until I get this. <br /> <br /> anyways this section has really touched me, and I don't think anyone else can make a better view of what is happening in the experience near death. <br /> <br /> 10/10 of course.
