A GOD is one of the best films of the last ten years. Small app is natural and the main plot is better. Special effects are brilliant and perhaps the best I've ever seen in the awesome movie. Kevin Bacon reaffirms that he can handle any emerging responsibility. Claude's rain struck the world with MANULEZ in 1933, now, Kevin Bacon has accused us of the Son of God. One of the most exciting films ever. The action is intense and the crop is real. You can find yourself flying if you look at the dark night of the storm. The support includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg, and Mary Randle. All who do special work. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret of making someone invisible. After testing the animal, they continue to test for humans. But one should be a lesson. Volenteering, Caine has become invisible. But when his team cannot return to appear, Caine is dominated by his condition because he wants to take revenge ... * The end of attackers <br /> <br /> Film has created an unspeakable seizure system and has been designed to be the best in the next century. Be the base of the spoof joke in SCARI MOVIE 2, this film meets you with a throat and can't allow you to go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow, develop characters and show how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and more appealing to fans of action and fear. Think about the sun of DEEP BLUE. Then change the shark into an invisible invisible person. And then change the water in the fire and explosions. Rehashing the movie of the shark killer. Interesting ... GOD'S WAY gets 5/5.
