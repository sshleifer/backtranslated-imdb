The incredible killings in the European village are seen as a result of the VAMPIRE BAT VIDEO that worries the fearful community. <br /> <br /> This amazing amazing amazing was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Poverty Row Hollywood studio. Fewer production and bad editing increases at least the atmosphere and gives them the best quality. In general, it leaves the viewer with a sense of inclusion in a bad dream, which is suitable for this type. Even though the last crime statement is very strange and is not given the correct development of the plot, the film can boast for good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill gives another of his usual performances, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in the old castle. Good Fay Wray has his assistant in the role that you need to do a little more than looking good and scared. Dour Melvyn Douglas looks like an amazing police inspector who also happens to be, easily, Miss Wray's partner. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who can be very funny due to the correct situation, steals his many matches as Miss Wray's aunt hypochondriac. Elder Lionel Belmore is playing burgermeister who fears the village. And Dwight Frye a little, who will always be remembered for his wonderful roles in FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula's films, here is more effective as a day of love.
