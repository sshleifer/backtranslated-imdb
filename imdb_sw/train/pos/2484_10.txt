Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli, and Almerayeda have had all the Hamlet directed but Branagh is the only one who got the right. This is the only film "Hamlet" which has four full hours of William Shakespeare's Head and provides a special feeling for the whole story. Most principals could not smuggle this without lending to the audience but the use of Branagh's bravora skills and the throwing of stunt allows people to see the importance of events that are often cut. Examples of this include Dardard Gerarde as Ranyaldo who is all the purpose in the film is just saying "my master" as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as a grave carpenter, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as an actress. Branagh's 4th 4th soliloquy Act (which is often cut out) is not an incredible briefing of the film as the camera slows down as growth increases. It is a place that makes me want to jump out of my seat and start shouting. Branagh is the only movie partner who understood the importance of each scene in this film and knew how to show the same importance to ordinary listeners. This should look for everyone who enjoys the good news of telling, good words, and wonderful patterns. All of this part of William Shakespeares to win great.
