Just think of people, not so badly natural, at this time the original series of Battlestar was a hub, however with all stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was as good as Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict liked to be a star like Starbuck, but I dare speak, not like Katee as Starbuck. I loved a piece with Pegasus and Greetings from the world was good John Calicos was as good as Baltar, the War of God, the best was the Experiments in Terra, I thought it was a tax on Heaven. of the Battlestar, do not compare them to Tricia who is as good as the Sixth Number, but the beauty of Jane Seymour could not be compared to. Let's just Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was amazing. He had the beauty that the rainbow would be ashamed and. I loved nature as well as new. Do you think if John Calicos had the number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
