Young people, sex, and French countries - one of the unique films you will see. If you can see that, there is no point to consider how hard it is to get its copy (a combination of shortages and controls). Sometimes it is interesting, sometimes offensive, and often pleasing. Stimulating hard also in the middle, but all in all you can not call yourself an extraordinary film until you see this one at once.
