I had another person who tried to commit suicide, and our house was in a building where you could get a fifty-five-dollar noisy noise after a nightclub - so, without saying, I can easily communicate with the Polish planner . But I also enjoy the film for another reason. I do not know that it works, in general - the familiarity of the Polanski behavior in proportion to the madness, which lasts half the last or so, it seems to be a fight with a wonderful. Ebert, for one, was not quite sure, and he hit the same movie for the observation of one bad star. But I think a personal event and when it works well, so even though I don't know the whole film - what does Egypt relate to, for example? - I'm still feeling good in general. I love a worried friend shown by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times have I set for such ignorant friends instead of friends at all! I love the cinema movie cinema - funniest "make out" while in the history of the film, I would say. And the boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani - he is faithful in this film, it's almost impossible. And she provides good performance, as always. Politics is a good actor, too; I disagree with the occasional loss of comments made about its performance here. His behavior should be important and thoughtful, so his low performance is appropriate. I, for one, have found him completely sympathetic - though he lost me a little when he started to wear on the drag because it was unclear. Yes, the movie is unknown. And slowly. But it takes the characteristics of the alienation of an apartment - something that I have done very much - so I dig. It's funny how you need everything is a common memory, and suddenly a movie of weirdo like this becomes very important! Surely the value of collecting for pocket change on DVD.
