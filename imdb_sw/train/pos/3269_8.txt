The movie is a little on the side of the prediction ... The story goes to all the places you expect, but it is played a lot of effort (especially Pastor and Downey) that you can't help but have fun. The pastor has never been seen on the screen for the most benefit and he and Downey are supported by a team of talented participants in supporting roles. A beautiful and interesting dream that will attract and attract you.
