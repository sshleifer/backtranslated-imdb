That is the best film and revolutionary message (both in the form and content) that should not be lost by any fan of French New Wave or underground film. There is open to open or unlock credit - just simply dropped into the world of art of consumer, revolution, and youth. This film has little to do with the document and it is very interesting to play with our advertising ideas and its relationship to reality. True and non-genuine balls cross the paths that are known to the document that discusses the document, but this time we do it for consuming and selling, not by describing real.
