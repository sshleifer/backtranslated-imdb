Everything was better in the past. Even children's television. And the Fraggle Rock shows my point easily. When writing these comments I am fourteen years old but even in my teen years I can't resist the charm of Rock Fraggle. For those who have actually been living under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is about a horde of playful creatures and attractions called Fraggles who live surprisingly-in rock. But not just beings. Rock has many other kinds like strict Doozers and organic plants. Outside the rock one side live the scientist-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who is later friends of Gobo Fraggle), on the other side the family of the rulers of the Gorgs-thought of the World. The majority of Fraggles Gobo (the fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peace), Wembley (uncertain and Gobo's friend), Boober (the inner goddess of greed) and Red (likes anything to do with casual games). in some mysterious circumstances every part at the same time singing and playing their dances off. <br /> <br /> Rock Fraggle is definitely a family show - squares can have wonderful details that babies can follow well, but the song -and-dance-routines will focus on their ideas. The characters are powerful and they love, their conflicts are believed and their adventures are attractive. Gorgs is awesome, Doc and Sprocket shine, Uncle Walk Matt hilarious (postcard groups are very 80s!) And the last part, Change of Address, actually touch. Let's go down to the Fraggle Rock again!
