I have seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classic (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Wings) but among them, my favorite is this film (can be better - but favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at him on the IMD, I immediately saw it laughing because the movie was very interesting and well done. Marion Davies demonstrated with this film had excellent talent and was not JUST's grandmother William Randolph Hearst. The story involves a hick from Georgia coming to Hollywood and every expectation that he would be an instant star! His experience with the interesting cameos of the era of the stars make this a real treat for the blows of movies and must-see!
