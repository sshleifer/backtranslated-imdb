This film deserves 10 for its transparency as an experience in the player's mind. When I realized that the world was misleading, the film made a great deal of storytelling, and that takes us through experience that we never can enter. Tim Meadows shows that Leon Phelps, and the story, did so by convincing it, dragged me into a reckless world of Leon, that I had forgotten that I was watching the world of playboy and I felt it must be against him. Here the film fills because its great efficiency and courage in writing a story comes at its own price. Understanding that a large number of filmmakers will only answer the story of the film on the face, and reject the story, I will feel misunderstood by them and admit that I liked it. I did not just like his fascinating insight into the player's imagination, not only for his exciting idiocy image of a human sex drive, but also for his courage to look out for what is in the shadows of heroism. Besides, it's just funny.
