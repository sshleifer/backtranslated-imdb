Well, we have had a strong violence in Verhoeven (Although it is not as strong as any other Verhoeven), we've had many sexual and dirty sex, but there is something missing ... Oh, yes, it doesn't know the mind that Paul Verhoeven is known for his sci-fi fi. I enjoy the way Verhoeven brings the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike many of the Verhoeven films, the movie itself does not have enough refreshment to enter the comedy music. The general acting was on average compared to many slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes a Hollow person a good movie is not a story, not a cast or characters, but a special effects that can make a film like this is impossible. Employees have actually made an invisible person, without the use of objects like a mounted hat on the piano wire and other side effects (the effects set on the set). The most amazing incidents were not found when Kevin Bacon is invisible, while Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this story of the invisible person should be more than thinking. Here, it is done in laboratories in many places. I would enjoy watching Kevin Bacon invisible to steal the bank and eliminate it, or let the tubie steal something from men's handbags, or something like that. But what is shown is enough to make a person of Hollow movie of entertainment. Grade: B
