Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very good and very cool game for N64. Bowser is on its normal shenanigans (that's a dumb word but just one I can think of) and Mario must bring him back again. This game is very fun to play, and it has a lot of nostalgia to me. The only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are bad for today's standards, but everything is good (especially mini-small games can open) It is the second second N64 game (first first is the Bad Converter Fur Day) that I recommend to any fan Mario, or any fan of platform games. It plays super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
