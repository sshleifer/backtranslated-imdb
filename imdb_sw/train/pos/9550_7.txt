Despite the success in the comedy or drama, Turkish directors are defeated in horrible-awesome. "Okul-D @Bbe" is a good example of Turkish movie trailers. But if you look at "Gen" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is awesome and dark. Also special features are colored and not cheap. Sound ringtones are suitable for the film, but the script is not quite complete and the movie's theme is normal. As a result "Gen" does not add any difference to awesome movies, but it does not add fun fans. In this way it is achieved by Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
