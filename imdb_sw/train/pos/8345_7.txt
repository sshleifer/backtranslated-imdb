I recently noticed I.Q. and although it is not the type of romantic partner of gal, I think it was a good and sweet movie to watch. Many movies in my opinion do not believe trust. Do you know that feeling when you watch the film and you feel stealing because it takes something from the story and it was just like the director put it together if it was garbage? The story among scientists is one sweet and wonderful. How they included and tried to help the behavior of Tim Robbins become smart. I loved the story of love between Tim and Meg because it was easy and brought to a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is seen". I would like to suggest this for Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
