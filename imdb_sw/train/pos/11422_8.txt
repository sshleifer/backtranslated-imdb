Chocolat of Claire Denis is a good but highly offensive film. The film shows a very interesting look for the family of European colonial families living in Cameroon, and giving a perspective view of the knowledge of the lives of many characters and their cooperation. However, the development of these characters is often not enough. For example, the main theme in the story is France's lack of ability to form good relationships with others. Although this picture is done in full, especially in the way that Denis makes stories and events from France back to her childhood home, the lack of girlfriends and other film characters makes it difficult for the viewer to invest a lot of interest in its development (or lack thereof). ) as a protagonist. The overall scope of the development of the film makes it difficult to be involved in the planned plot. The film raises serious discomfort among the characters, especially among the Aimee and men in her life, but they do not fully support this social conflict, leaving the observer uncomfortable. The last few events are powerful but troubling. Denis' work is really appealing to a mental and historical perspective, but if you are looking for a film and adventure or drama, Chocolat is not the best choice.
