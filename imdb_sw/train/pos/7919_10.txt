Of course they wanted to be a camp shock, "Full Moon High" shows a young boy Tony Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanied by his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Indeed, Tony gets sick, and grows feathers and pigs every time there is a full moon. The most interesting feature in this film is that it cannot be as long as he has a curse of animals, and that he will fulfill destiny - even if it takes twenty years. But otherwise, the movie is just easy once it goes. Ed McMahon's character is yahoo on patriotic yahoo (he thinks everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars / head coach is dweeb time, and then there is more. One of the many members of the eye opening is Demond Wilson - the best remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a great surprise. But perhaps the funniest area is a change of presidents; then gag and Gerald Ford sent him! However, it is actually treated. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays with a zany psychologist - won Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder if he remembers the partnership with two of them in this movie (away from Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). It's very funny. Also star Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is perhaps best known for the child "Kill".
