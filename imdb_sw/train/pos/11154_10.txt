In my opinion, this is one of the largest films made in the United States and deserved every single prize won and is on the AFI Top 100 list (although it is very embarrassing to the IMDB Top 250 list, for just 183 just like this text) . If you would like to follow the most advanced statement (Watching with Hoffman is the best match), the best performance features and innovative leadership, editing and movies, you would like this as I did. Schlesinger shows clearly, always a reliable image of the last 60 years of the New York City area and is the most victims of struggling to overcome private demons and live during demolition, poverty and lack of ambition at 42, New York City. The filming techniques employed here carefully feel the feeling of a film under New York (and the city) and not less surprising. I have seen a lot of ideas (including quick editing of fire, voice handling, on drug trafficking / travel and the face of the cartoon came into the scene of the killings to show angst and fear) stolen by other authors The film. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is run in a way that is viewed as an extraordinary friendship or having homosexual relationships. I think that the director did this work through a trick enough to deal with the control of the times, but instead of focusing on his power on the importance of a strong human relationship in life, whether it is sex or not. <br /> <C / COWBOY of MIDNIGHT is a brave, moving film of size, influence and importance that has completely lost its effect over the years, so if you have not seen it, the lack of real American realistic truth. I recommend this film to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
