There is the rubbish on the cable films that I find gem with this. From start to finish I was locked up and deserved for the top score. The father of two children heard a message from "God" to kill people who are told to be 'demons'. When the opening credit showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of bad films; it is usually the opposite here if the festival is not stopping from beginning to end. And there is no one in the film when someone is not fully recommended if there is no minimum or unimportant sub-plots, and the script is the first class. All executives offer a very convincing exhibition especially a leading actress. <br /> <br /> This film is at least as good as the 'Silence of the Lambs'.
