This film is one of the best, certainly in the form of fear. The claustrophobic atmosphere is excellent, the music is similar to the film and the killer is as angry as possible! Employees are wonderful, RIP Donald Pleasance was amazing as Dr Loomis, made the film better. Without him the film would have been missing an important part. Jamie Lee Curtis is also as good as our beloved girlfriend! His justice makes him unaware of the real evil that follows after getting his friends killed in the house, which is actually one of the best movies. He gives great performance. I loved this film since it feared me as hell when I saw in the early 80s and still looking up to this day as a wonderful film that enters you into this world you could be closed like a fish on every side! The fact that it is the simplest form of a mad man in a mask who is saved from intellectual reserve and is ready to kill everyone in front without having any idea that yukopo, it's just awesome horrible to get you even more movie like events though false stories can happen to easily. We all realize that unfortunately evil exists in this world and a man with shade and knife is certainly not unusual, very fearful of all of this. Death to any side. Halloween undoubtedly shows this in the most frightening way. Fear should be trusted, and that's what makes the film relaxing. It's just a simple story that is done in a beautiful and terrible way. Like the psychological psychological story, all that I worship, I believe there is a form of good fear offered. For me Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I have seen and I will look at all my life and never never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
