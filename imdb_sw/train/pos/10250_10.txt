Gine pig: The Devil's attempt is undoubtedly the star of the star ***** at first glance, it is the view of the bright and amazing view of the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right, what can you think? The action is to satisfy the fan of extreme abuse and gore. This film has some years, more or less just making women violent. There is actually only a 3 event that can be considered a year. I will tell you one thing though the Guinea pig: The Devil's experiment makes enemies appear as Street Sesame. If you think the enmity was caused by tribal suffering then it does not appear in its half until you see Gogo's Gogo: The Devil's Trials. > Rating
