Live Christmas is an awesome awesome movie especially based on bad advertising when it was first released. Ben Affleck is as funny as an impressionist who pays a family that takes his childhood home to his family for Christmas. They then chase family members out of a great Christmas fun. I've never been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I did it like Daredevil and Paycheck) but here he is thrown into this position. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family who can not stand the behavior of Affleck first. Surely you can see where this film is going but you don't care. Listen to what critics say and rent this movie because it's funnier than many Christmas movies.
