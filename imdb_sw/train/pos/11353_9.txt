This movie was excellent. It describes the struggle between the investigations that emerged against the democratic government's demolished government during the 80th century. (thanks to the "Management" community). This is a movie movie. It gives an incredible picture of violence and is a terrible residue. There is no "candy-chopped" item with a reduced blood or a year to separate us from the sharp reality on the screen. This movie depends on the killer of the Russian Serial Andrei Chikatilo. I have identified myself with the true story of being very grateful for how they actually put the film. It's not comedy, but for those who enjoy dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.
