Pegg has had a few hits in the past few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, the movie on "Hot Fuzz 2007", earlier in 2008 came out with "Run Boy Boy Run" and now comes this, "How to Lose Friends and Encourage People "which is in many ways one of my favorite comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> The movie is about Sidney Yound, a person who writes a failing newspaper who laughs more than a celebrity because she is not one of them. However, one of the most effective magazine owners (Played with Jeff Bridges) invites (out of the mirror) to work on his newspaper. Sidney is really exciting and goes to America, there meets a girl now writing a book, and hilarity insues. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful and I hope more come out as soon. Pegg has again given people everywhere another good film and I do not know the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "Paul". I watch this film 81%.
