USING OUTSIDE By the impossibility of John Wayne, there is no other actor in the bed in Westerns than James Stewart, and this movie proves. This very beautiful story of retaliation has focused on the Winchester rifle, it has only one spot spot that I can think of: the cast of Will Geer as a very odd Wyatt. The release of criminals was good: Stephen McNally, such as Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (a good mix when playing the good guys and bad guys) as a gunman. The clash between Stewart and McNally on the falls is beautiful! I would like to put this Western on all Western products made today. Can not stand position!
