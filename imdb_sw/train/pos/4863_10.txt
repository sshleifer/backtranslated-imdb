Back when music was not shown to journalists, we had such amazing movies. <br /> <br /> Become a great fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was glad to finally see this film. It's not a perfect mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but very close. Some American humor's vaudeville, slapstick is not a port of magic, versus the intelligence of the British Wodehouse of humor. But in general, the American fashion banner makes American characters seem to be true rather than caricatures of cards. <br /> <br /> Some of the staging of innovation for dance numbers, including an amazing fantastic field and mirrors around and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for lack of Busby Berkley on top dance. They seem to be more realistic, if you could imagine people starting singing and playing as real. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do not hurt the movie, instead allows different behaviors of behavior to emerge. It is also good to be careful of the wisdom, the love of the head attraction. Instead we have a good love of the head, and more to the young women of the Wodehouses.
