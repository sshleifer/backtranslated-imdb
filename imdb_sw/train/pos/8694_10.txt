It was 1988, when I saw "Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austria television). At that time, I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since it won a high-quality brass film of Montreux in 1986). Of course I wrote each show on the tape and looked at it regularly - especially "Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the incident when Ronnie stood in front of Abraham Lincoln's painting (thinking it was glass) and said himself "I need to shave". Or more exciting of all, while playing the ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It is a shame, that Visiting Image seems to fall in trouble; it was one of the most amazing and most intelligent television shows. Compared to other satirical advertising was definitely the best. Well, about 20 years have passed since then, and I would like to see the show again. What? Is it possible to buy from someone ... somewhere?
