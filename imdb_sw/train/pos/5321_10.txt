This modern experience really surprised me. I was worried about the first but the movie was better and better for every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the point of searching the audience but for those who like a clear picture of a wonderful offender, man, partner and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or this sex content is not true for you. <br /> <br /> Story story is very difficult to follow sometimes, but at the end I think it has done everything better. Finally there was no expectation since you were lost to think it would be another end. <br /> <br /> As for acting I think it was good. There will be no Oscar award for a long time but at least they did not catch my eye. Gil Bellows a picture of a prisoner is not always full but it's very entertaining. Shaun Parkes photo of the prisoner of Bellows Clinique is great and very powerful. On the one hand I think I will put you a picture of Isai Morales's Markie. Take my advice and watch this film, or you would like it or not!
