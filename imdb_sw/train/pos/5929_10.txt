Stephen King was raised on flicks like this. -SOME film. <br /> <br /> Films like this and 'Jeepers' suppliers are “losing” for good fricks of driving day. They are meant to be fun, cheap and optimistic: a few good chaos. Anyone looking for a theory on humanity must find this element of creation because that's all ... everything you ever have. <br /> <br /> Leave a stop that has already been viewed as trash. Good, fun, trash! If you enjoyed this I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' 'Jeepers Creepers 2' '30 Night Days '' Scarecrows '(' 88) '' Live 'Terrorists' Halloween III: Witch's Season '
