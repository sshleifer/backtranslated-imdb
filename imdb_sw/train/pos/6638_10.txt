An older films like this are that you get to see a real picture of life over 100 years ago. Here are many people coming from the factory, all of them have died now and none of them even at a distance knows the size of the invention that they walk before. I was shocked to read one of the filmmakers like this video as a home video today, and at least one of them saw it as false as the first made film (it was the first film released at the rate of 16 rows per second, rather than then-usually 46 frames per second) . Of course, everything you see is many people who opt out of the building and are going ahead of the movie on their home home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it was The first film made by Lumi√©re's brothers, who probably had a great impact on the development of movies than any other person or group of individuals in history.
