One of my favorite movies I saw in Seattle. Tom Hulce was strange, and outward words could express his feelings / thoughts. In fact I have sent Mike Ferrell's contribution to help spread the film. It's good. The system says I need more lines but do not want to give the plot of the plot. I was in the audience in Seattle and Hulce and the director, the author who I think with Mike Ferrell. They spoke for an hour after the words. Not a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be ignorant. (I really know, it's our fault, see what we're looking for) Well you get what you're paying for boys. Get this and see it with someone special. It's gem.
