Ear 'Dog' Earle is back, with its sad-sack Marie's hair, and Velma's clubfoot's fickle. So it's Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even pt mutting Pard. The only thing lost is a good reason to restore Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without reflecting again to a line or shape, and doing so with a talent shown to be urine or two under the level from the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on through credit.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in Warnercolor ; sadly, there are those who could count this improved. When I die The Thousande Time might be necessary? and inferior? but at least not destruction; The story still works with its interesting words. Earle (Palance), clean out of pen next to Chicago, leads the west to lead the great work supervised by the sick king Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? hit on the rest of the mountain's post. On the journey, he almost fought with the Oakies family, when he was hit by their grandson; the hardest hit even when he finds he is a cripple. When he comes to the cemetery where any group is full of holes, he finds the hotheads of the guys in the clan of another and Winters, who gives himself to him (like pooch). When applying until they get a phone call from their local hotel, the Palance (for the winter season) offers a payment for the operation to treat a girl's disability, a sign that returns. Then, the surgical strike against rest breaks into blood. On the lighting, Palance goes up to the winter of the Sierras .... It is a well-versed, efficient story, which has no Walsh variation and cast it in 1941, Bogie's year, and role this and that of Sam Spade in Malta Malta, became a star. And the last one, the false description: The mountains are a beautiful color. <br /> <br />
