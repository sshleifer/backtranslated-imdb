This film is interesting to implement a scarecrow type of killer - for amazingly it can increase to be greater than its total parts. An average of montage events, 30 young teens, and some of the best face combinations and become one of the "new wave" of modern scholars. As an observer, I came out of the film in the same sense of "shock and fear" as I saw God first in 1969. An amazing example of Tiffany Gardner of Judy morally bankrupt was worthy of his Grammy, well-presented stolen by Ricky Martin and sanctions rest. Unfortunately, no sequels can live up to the original expectations (unlike the Godfather series which has been ideal for each phase, and should end in 2012 with the 4 godfather: eat my salary.
