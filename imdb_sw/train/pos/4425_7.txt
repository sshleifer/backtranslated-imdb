Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to fix the type of clothing. Successfully, and not, by different degrees. The monk of the Buddhist has a vision that will kill a legendary spirit (and very much) in the Gojoe grade to get the effect. While not before, Buddhist ideas are in the heart of this movie, such as the "Ran" of Kurosawa. Perhaps what made this film more interesting to me though it is now close to the "Ran" league. A fascinating attraction and beautiful photography sets the most attractive film in two hours and eighteen minutes long. The leading actors are the best uniforms. Music is very good. Two constraints are stories and events to fight. The movie draws in the middle that can be fixed with some reasonable editing. And combat scenarios are being fought in the close bonds. This works for many films but finale feels like cheating. Another recent film like this is the “Seventh” of Tsui Hark, a good film but the promises of fighting are scary. Asano really does not act like a sword that makes a demon, its work is good but it would be extra in the traditional war zone. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, maybe you will find interesting just don't expect a traditional sword war.
