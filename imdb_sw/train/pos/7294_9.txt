After reading several comments, I felt I had to add my two cents as well. "Sadness" is one of the shortest memories I think I have seen. I had the opportunity to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this film was very good and emotional. The story was very good - especially for a very short time. This story takes into account the little girl who was affected by her bad father. He was recently given the "choice" and demon played by "Publisher Eric Etebari." After watching the show, I was fascinated by how she played a unique and different character. I did not know that he could do so well! His character was very difficult and had a great influence. Acting was more beautiful with him. The girl was the same as the father was good. There is also a death in this who monitors a girl around until he can escape from his future. The effects and movies were quite intelligent. I wonder if they had at least one thousand budget for this. You rarely see the highest quality. The opening was completely breathing with any feature film. This is not to say that it is not his fault - I thought it took a little to go and the intro was long. But this is stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few shorts with this quality quality.
