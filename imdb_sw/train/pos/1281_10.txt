This film is as good as it is difficult to find. The hero of the film (and the author and director) is Simon Geist- man "with the agenda." He builds a fake magazine only to have an interview with Los Angeles pigs - actors, models, musicians who believe that their feelings do not feel smell. For cunning negotiations, Zucovic succeeds in doing so. Indeed, this film's budget probably paid for a car that he used, but this film is solid and well documented that works very well. Anyone who can reconstruct Edward Munk's 'Scream' by contemplating treshbin money in the domestic coffee house should be selected for a particular kind of award. Make this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have made the same car since 1986 ... it's called 'car.' Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
