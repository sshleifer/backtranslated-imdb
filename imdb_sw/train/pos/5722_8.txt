This was good. When I saw the Japanese version first, maybe it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and cuts, it was the sky, the sky and the terrible. When the mother spirit took the bed in the Japanese version, I was close to heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be lowered, and that Buffy would get rid of the dark levels of the original version. I don't need to worry. The creators of the film wisely put Japanese people who were involved with the original film, and gave the film to the person. They also put it in Japan in one place, in the house. In fact, the Japanese director took the pain of retrieving the same film as was the original, the only exception was the creation of American actors. That actually turned out to be a profit if it added a feature of "Aliens in a Wonderful Land" for general fears. Not only were they moved by a terrifying and sufficient spirit, but they were also caught in a foreign country, having difficulty communicating in society. It just added to the general concern built into the film and I thought it was the best touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a very good job. He looks at the danger and can make him feel better. There are no smart aleck words that are typical for American movies of fear, or one block that prevents the darkness from fear of characters. In fact, it was as easy as a Ring that I was really enjoying. I hope for the future of the US fears next to the new Japanese view of fear began with the amazing success of Ringu. Finally we get movies that can be a community like "Fear" !! 8/10
