This show contains great stories! It is widely believed! Mans' wife dies and she cannot serve her children alone and calls her brother the best law and many others come later in the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, a beloved and powerful dog, Comet, Nikki and Alex who can make your own (I don't want to destroy you) and persuade Kimmy Gibler! (Sidekick's DJ) but kids are also amazing. This is Mary Kate and Ashley first pulled out! And also you can know the Cameron Free Candace from shows as St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that's a string! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph who loves a middle-aged child who feels left out. This really is a very good show!
