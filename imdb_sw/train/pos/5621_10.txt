Humble, tiny, very close. Polanski gets invisible to its characters and makes something big out of it. In front and behind the camera he builds one of the most stressful exercises that I enjoyed seeing and seeing and seeing again. Never let down. People, even people who know me well, thought / think there is / is something wrong with me, according to my attraction, or I must say, volunteer to "Le Locataire". Polanski and I have never mentioned humor. Secrets around the apartment with an old tenant, a mystery that takes over it and, usually, we, I. The building remained with former winners of the Academy Award: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is a mandatory look. One, two, three, many, many comments.
