As Al Gore encouraged us with his film of trustworthy and trustworthy "unrealistic reality", directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "The planet of the world" is also a call to wake up that global warming has a negative impact on all living beings worldwide. Al Gore showed us the horrible future of the planet Earth by presenting the hard-preserved truths preserved by written monologues on the fascinating monologues. The creators of this document select a different but powerful way to complete this. They do not listen to the future representation of what can happen on our planet if we cannot change things around, but instead show us the real beauty of this world in all its wonderful glory. We see places we knew to be there but never thought it would be very good. In this film, we see many array of wonderful places such as the desert desert, large forests with plants and plants and green plants until the eye can see. And in all these different circumstances, we see very beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that should be made, along with one from Al Gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is very valuable intervention. The top voice and Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and so very well though at first it looked like I was watching the movie X-men instead! The movie seems to be a very strange thing in this document. Sometimes: what you see is meaningless that you forget that a person with a camera actually had a whole film of that interesting photo. In short: This is definitely you must see everyone because it involves everyone in this beautiful planet of this planet! The fact is: I never thought our world was so beautiful!
