My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP] My name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playing} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director take a flack too much in his style before. It is now obvious that most people do not like the choppy technology of Tony Scott, flashy, dizzying. If I must choose to love and hate it, I would like to say I like it. It was a very futile thing, but the final result was very good and it is good to see the director and the creative creativity in its style and nature (even if it is very boring from MTV videos). This stylistic scenario appears as Keira Knightley has the role of cocky hunter, Domino Harvey and even her conversation seems very strange. Otherwise he plays with him because I was very disgusted with his behavior and I had little pity for him, no matter how much he suffered. We follow Domino through his life as he joins his comrade hunter Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. Staff stand on the FBI and suddenly has a contract to show the truth under the production of Christopher Walken TV (what is Christopher Walken doing every film, through?). I think that it is a clever filmmaking technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use many images to translate MTV / Reality Show editing as he likes. It becomes the past of the MTV culture for this point. It works then that the story is told at a fast pace, with lots of strong power and gun violence. There is a wonderful joke; it's all very sophisticated and surreal simultaneously. It's a mess, but it's a fun mess. Finally it is wrong in many ways (executives are struggling to make their characters "cool", for one) but it works. I put the 7/10 weak on which it would seem to be generous compared to the general web concessions of the film? but I feel good and do it well. About 7 out of 10
