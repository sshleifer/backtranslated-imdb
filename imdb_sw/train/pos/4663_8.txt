I saw the filming on TCM and just let it run because I love both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was very surprised to see that I loved the movie and I have found it very unique. Of course, it is a great dated, but as a piece of the period it is better to just look at the trick of the trick in understanding in life and life nearly forty years ago. Now I only have to try to find it on the DVD so I can watch it often. I was also completely absorbed by Smith's performances and Ustinov as a leader, and Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the exhibition that happened with Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
