I didn't have too many expectations from this film. I was given a high-quality ticket. I had just worked. It was hot and I was exhausted. I had to wait on the film line for 40 minutes and there seemed to be no cool air flowing through the venue of the theater. After staying in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the participants at the beginning, but the film flow was perfect. Right from the beginning I was used by the movie, getting more and more excited for every minute passed. I think this movie should be a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were wonderful, the speed was perfect, and the end was magical.
