We hit this time when it was disclosed on TV after 1995 and we have tried all these years for its release, since it was one of our family's favorite. The children are now young and must have seen the times-zillion, but still look at religion with friends. Time-time requests reach all age groups - similar to "Grease." Vanessa Williams is amazing. Jason Alexander is very happy with his feet. I have seen other speakers on this site are very bad about it, but our family gives him a high level. (We loved her 'Giant Step'). Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) gives us comedic support and amazing music numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just blows flat. Probably our favorite character in the entire movie. One desire was the performance of Chynna Philip's Kim. Part of it relates to writing. Kim's role is very straightforward. To give this, Philip's offer is flat, unthinkable, unreliable and very clear. The director should have seen and developed it. Or never throw a start. Overall, the picture is good and I strongly recommend it for families of all ages.
