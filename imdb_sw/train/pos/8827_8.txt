For a small budget, during the eight-minute flight with a large amount of thought, Nacho Vigalondo has reached one of the shortest moments I have seen. The design of this screen is very amazing, as it does not end until the end time. Do not let anyone tell you what the brief is about, as you will be able to enjoy a lot more. The Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for its one-man show: leading, writing and acting in this shortest is the most amazing effort I have seen in years. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, its reaction shots are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Total rating: 8/10
