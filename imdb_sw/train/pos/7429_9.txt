She is a wonderful singer, who cares about anything else! The last event is one of the best times of each biz - no bar! I am glad he put the camera on himself for ten minutes - is eligible for the iconic status - that's a powerful voice. I saw this film first when I was five years old and had a great impact on me. I see today, and yes, I can see some mistakes (if Esther wants to leave Grammy's right as her award is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other user comments are just plain - I mean, where is the improper shortness - maybe we saw a different film? Streisand's ability to sing is great, and if he is very good! Get it.
