I don't understand. I'm not a critic, I don't know the quality of acting, which I consider to be true, good. My mixture lies with content. No one else is aware of the fact that these two unfaithful women emphasized their loyalty to men who were fighting the bleeding to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their countries. Will there be no speech to let us know if men made it at home and if so, their "cheating" results were trustworthy? When these women were closing their paramours due to emotional loneliness, they thought that their husbands were happy to be shot during a death or a moratorium every day? They did not think of their husbands at all! They alone. Forgive me, unless they love their dead husbands.
