After watching first, I realized this story being at least a little exciting than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more, I think it's one of the best. Some of these songs are very bad, especially a love song, but two things have emerged that makes the movie, even singing, be worth it. One is the art of art. Like Cannon Movie Tales other, this is a delightful piece piece; each piece of fabric and jewel (both of which have a large part of this film) look fresh and new, and to remove the plain clothes of farmers. Even during the song of love I see myself learning the dress and hair of the king, surprisingly made. Another thing is the time of comic. Many of the movies are fun, but the vanity of the king (and fun at the end), the guards of doubt, the chasing guards and the head of stupid, all were very funny and seem to be totally ignorant for the purpose. And the sequence of the song Weave-O makes for songs that were not very good.
