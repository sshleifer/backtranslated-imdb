We usually see short comments like these written by the IMD film. Maybe this is why it is so beautiful of the comedy and it enjoys without deep, or lacks something? I would like to look at it again if I had an incentive. What is happening? In French it is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Finally? Maybe it's an event that is the end of a series of random events. We've had all of this (called life) but when it is translated this way, when you start feeling that "random" can be more like "fated." A 'occurrence' in this film can be a small event like knocking a few leaves of the lettup back to the truck or as large as the basis of a life decision on the accuracy of the alien throwing of leaves. All these events cause other events that ... well to get the picture? Dominoes. Multiply those by 30 characters and each other and you should stretch your ideas to accept the village position that this situation might occur. And I think that there are observations for those who believe that life is like this. But this is the world of magic movies. We agree that it is fun to look at how the author / director gathers these events related to the story that strengthens the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours and you are looking for the escape of the stars, here is the place to do it. Or if you are recovering from surgery and goes anywhere, this will involve you when your stitches are healing. "Achievements" cannot fall as a winner but it should develop the following worship. The patient's things have been done. Soren Kierkegaard is associated with the following: "Life can understand back, but it must continue." If you look at more information in your experience of good living (to achieve your first love, to get a perfect gift, the last accident of your car) you can find a series of random events leading up to it. That is the answer! I forgot to bring with someone who was old to tell me "Success" to me.
