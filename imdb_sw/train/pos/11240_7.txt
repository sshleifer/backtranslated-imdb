Bud Bas Pop pop melodrama takes into account the girl who wants to become a star, becomes one and then gets all very little. Released well with the feeling of time and place can not hide the fact that we've been here before. Several events are a bit of hysterical and the voice of O'Connor looks very like Mouse Mini! Lost from the front after making this film - so life can imitate art! You must see if you want to see the punk version of Star Is Born though.
