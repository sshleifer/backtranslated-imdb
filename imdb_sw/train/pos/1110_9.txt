I think you would come from America to get a lot of joke. But if you liked Princess Bride and Gump Forest, you would like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the image to those who actually, but having a camera trip was definitely done for a purpose. Tomato killer is a hundred times greater than Dynamite of Nepole. Only my opinion. I am sure people from France will not enjoy French pictures. So this film is not for the audience of the world. And when I'm not a teacher of the film training, I know what I like. I couldn't stop laughing through the entire movie. My sides and jaws were hurt at the end of the film.
