That is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It takes me on a sense of rotation. I laugh and cry and get fun and happy and in love! All this for a little more than two hours! <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant! I mention the leading actor of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a wonderful job! I am also fascinated by an actor who plays Tore, who plays this mentally young man in such a way of convincing! He reminded me of Leonardo di Caprios roll in Grape Gilbert! And then there is a very good song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
