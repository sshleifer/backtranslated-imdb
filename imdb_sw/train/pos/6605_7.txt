And in the confusion of surveillance surveillance, a medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving his sister in a nightclub. The tough police commander investigates. It has been shown in white and white colors, along with a tough, narrow shade and one lighting of the natural lighting of the narrow color of the boiling film, compared with Sin City is inevitable. But the story should be more for Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than Frank Miller, as a high-top surveillance, non-non-non-non-aggressive suits are a large part of the environment like guns and cars.
