The show is about two sisters living together. Holly's younger has other young problems on the other side her sister Val has a job, a boyfriend, a marital problem as many of the world's women. They try to help each other make mistakes sometimes but they do not stop. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this show. It's funny and executives are very good. I am very sad that the show has ended. I still look at regular :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be new to play but plays very well. She is one of the movie actors I love to watch. I like the relationship of Vince and Holly they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows. And Tina Holly has found a true friend and I love you. Lauren's behavior is amazing and he is a natural talent. I'd like to see him more. It shows this truth entails and laughs. I would show it has never been.
