This stunning and emotional film provides every time. It is one of the best and lowest Frankenheimer films and it is easy to adapt to Elmore Leonard's review today (and if you hit your head to think "but I've loved GET SHORTY" you need to be beaten with face). In my opinion, no one feels "feel" for Leonard's best characters then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of stories from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) focuses on the reasons for the high sleaze for an amazing height. Be a person, have a few beers and watch this film. For reference purposes, books containing Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Head, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite movies of Frankenheim include SECONDS and MANCHURIAN TREE. I also have a special chance in my cool heart, the film for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
