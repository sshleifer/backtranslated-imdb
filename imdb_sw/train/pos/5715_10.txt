Karen comes home to Japan as a good nurse to Emma, ​​a wonderful woman who sleeps at night and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing the voice as she meets the fearful spirit. He will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> Scary! These events are shocking and frightening! Anime are beautiful. Settings are interesting. I love the whole plot! The end was awesome! I lived in a place where a little boy cried out to the man looking for his sister over the room and I was shocked. This is the worst movie I watched. I didn't see the Japanese version. I recommend this to frighten fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
