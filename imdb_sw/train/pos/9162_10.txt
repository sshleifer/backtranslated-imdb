Although I had not started reading "Classics" in books until I was 47, it has never been delayed. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, because because there is no part of the book I liked a little, the only part I enjoyed most. The 1983 mini-TV series and Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton were everything I expected to be. I saw it as a full movie in 2006. Mr. Dalton 'Rochester' was very good but I liked Zelah 'Jane Eyre' completely. Looking at the other 'Classics' movie I saw recently, I was disappointed in production, direction and discussion. It was only loyal to the adarice and the pride of Hollywood. A written label of great work in the text is not short of preference. Using the name after the license is fraud. Remove it to Brits to get this right (among others). You will no longer read the book without considering the movie and the proper environment and spirit. It has done well on the BBC.
