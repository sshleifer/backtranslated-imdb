It is difficult to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that must appear to appear. It follows a story that is more than water and more interesting than anything I have seen recently in Hollywood release. As its respondents respond to the sequence of events in different ways, and as events refer to different ways of responding, the audience is just an observer. The close Proustian's thought of thinking, the only wind in the script will come to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how it all works at the end. And apart from the basics ... there is a certain sequence in the film that comes out of melancholy, with bright and beautiful, and then sadly, all within a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is a clean magic. Recall one why the independent film is perhaps a bright star film industry now has. Probably with the best quality video bug, people will begin to explore.
