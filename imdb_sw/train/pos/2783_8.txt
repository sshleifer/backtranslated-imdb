It's not one of your hard hit stories, and that's the real power of this film. There are at least two intellectual relationships that would be able to add to the possible sexual tension as well. They not only rescue this audience, but give us some surprise at the same time. There is a short period of Disney-ish, especially near the end, but they can manage. In general, it was worth the lease and it was good, locked the fun. If you get a DVD, look at the place where the director teaches you how to make a gob of aloo. We followed his instructions and it was BRILLIANT! The next time we will make the day before we prepare to eat, because this is one dish that definitely gets better for the perfect night in the refrigerator to allow perfume!
