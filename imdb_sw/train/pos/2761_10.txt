I saw this film first came from Paris to Newark in Air France in August 1996. The film itself I believe is a masterpiece. It's a kind of film that people should do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French film, he plays a father and a divorced businessman who has lost his life until he has someone with Down Syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Down Syndrome. Actors including an actor who actually has Down Syndrome to create friendship friendship and relationship between these two possible men. Daniel's life and our lives change forever with the person of Down Syndrome. He knows that life is not just working and not playing but for life and love and that's the life that should be on him. The end is silly though I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring tears to your eye.
