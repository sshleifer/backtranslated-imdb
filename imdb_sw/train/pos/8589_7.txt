I will be faithful, eventually looking at this movie not because of the stars - although they were able to appear and compel, especially three leading - or even compelling stories of breach in the President's secret service (something, you have been notified through additional DVDs). of this show, it has not yet happened. Considering that it's true, that's wonderful!). I got it because it was caused and it has a choice to come up with no other except Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Okay, Clark Johnson, one of my deaths from "Killed: Life on the Street" by the former TV director (in particular). I would like to say that he does well as he can and the project is visible but is average, with the possibility. The old elder and Ace Hidden Secret Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) needs to know all who are accusing him and who killed his friend, targeted and hitting on Air Force One squad and is a gun for Prez (David Rasche.) Anyone who recognizes "Sledgehammer"?). His story with the first woman (Kim Basinger, open one of the first HOT women we have had, false or true) certainly did not help her stand. He should eliminate the real mole in the service and avoid the dog's hound as hunting for his old friend and fellow agent and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely in "24" mode). Throw into other key service agents (Martin Donovan and foxy, difficult to buy as gig Eva Longorria) and foreign shade characters and have a common political interest that does not have the highest target as it gets and achieves the desired, as a result, results. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show is shown without giving callers. The additional DVD to me was looked more and more interesting than the movie, although the film itself was a lot of entertainment to keep more (I included) intention.
