Peter Ustinov has a player who has gone out of prison when the film begins. Once walking out of the gates, he immediately begins to work on the re-plan of stealing, although this time he has its own set-up. This is one of the weakest points on the film, because he does not know anything about computers (few returned in 1968) but he can be a computer expert at night! It's true. However, he comes up with a plan to imitate a computer expert and get a job with a large US corporation to complete a ton of money. Considering his computer skills is rudimentary, it's amazing how he sets in a brilliant program and can incorporate the computer system and its protection. But, it's a movie after all, so I could stop unbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can run with a million pounds. Even the latter, however, finds a very mixed mix, and Smith announces he managed to actually collect more than two million by investing wisely in companies that Ustinov began (although he did not realize they were all dummy companies). This means that ultimately these reserves are useless. What they seem to have meant (and I may have been thinking wrong here) is that Ustinov and its new partners lost in the park before this became known and the reserve would then be meaningful. In any way, the film seems to write on the magical end of which no one hurts and everyone is happy - and this doesn't make much sense. It is embarrassing, in fact, if acting and many texts were good. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just amazing. <br /> <br /> If I seem to translate the last, I would like to know, if the film seemed unknown to details at the end.
