This film has moved me to more insight, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, because because it has almost every sensation is locked within 157 minutes. from the film, I put it on my DVD player, so I was surprised if anyone anywhere knew who is singing songs on the film and where they can be found, if I look anywhere I can think of more than 5 years ago. My popular quote from the film is when the court advocate says "But your own words ask for a direct struggle, not a direct call to abuse?" Biko responds: "You and I are fighting now, but I don't see crime!" "<br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
