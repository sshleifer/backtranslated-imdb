Running in 1959-1973. It is more than his life that says a lot of this series. It is also that it survived a change in style and taste from 50 years, psychedelic 60 and continued to be popular in the 70s. It was a combination of all its successes from stories, cast and production that made it unique. Lorne Green had her defining character from this series. To appeal to them for generations. All family members can enjoy this. It is the ethics of equality and violence, humor and weight. The cartoon series was made as a turn from this as a result of its effects. Shame is that this series does not come back and many do not know its importance.
