Edmund Burke said that "all evil needs are good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage because poor family members see the best film. This movie was a story of promoting losing and restoring faith. It had no violence, no dirt, and was not worthy of PG rating. The western wind was done well, and some vistas were just breathing. Employees were limited to their parts, but otherwise they are believed by talented. The music mark was too big, and in some places it opened up a whole conversation. I rarely was surprised and ended the movie again, but I was surprised by this. Sometimes good people win, and they win with loyalty efforts. We loved films and messages, and we recommend to the whole family.
