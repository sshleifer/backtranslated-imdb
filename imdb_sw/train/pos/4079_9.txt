I saw this film first when I was 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I really liked it, and I had a heart of heart when it was repeated one time later and I missed it. I was interested in stories and characters, but most of all with haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English version that I had seen - sometimes known as "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually by Ghibli itself and just distributed by Streamline) which is not available unless part of the laser resource ridiculously set the box. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel that the release of part for damage to Disney. The sound of the voice is the same but the discussion does not have the same energy as the "return" or the original Japanese was, and I think James Van Der Beek seems to be too old to lead. They have made other unimportant changes, like changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added discussion. But most of all I feel they have destroyed many events and intrusive music - the opening part of the aircraft of the airline was quietly but damaged by the appreciation of the moronic needs of Disney that there is music playing everyone without talking, which I find is offensive in many films Disney. <br /> <br /> This film still films the latest animations, and I can't recommend you very much. The program is simple but attractive and the film shows flair which is caused by sadness from the modern mass market, animation of homogenized.
