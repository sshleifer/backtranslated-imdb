I haven't read a novel, or anything else with Kurt Vonnegut, but now I'm willing to start. This strikes you from the very first frame, and does not allow you to go until the last documents start. Take the place where you do not expect, the plot is interesting around. Visible planning, nothing lasts for too long, and this makes the task of balancing between unexpected losses and allowing the viewer to solve what we have seen. It has been well spoken and thoughtfully. I have never watched a movie that I feel I can compare to this. It is intense and exciting, as well as exciting and sad. Acting is best, Nolte shines quite, Goodman confirms that he doesn't need to go to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding. I could go, in fact ... no role to be used for less stellar performance. The layout and the cinema are amazing, and all the pictures are beautiful, and a couple of amazing surprises and surprises. I will go to other movies led by Keith Gordon, along with two others linked to this, through a book writer. There is one sex condition, and a lot of trouble and separation of content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can understand; not good. 8/10
