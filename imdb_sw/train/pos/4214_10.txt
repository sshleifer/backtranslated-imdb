Better than seven Sam Fuller movies that I have seen (including Row Park, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, Kissing Naked, Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street looks like one of the best film film. It represents Fuller in more control. I love him when he is out of control, of course, but almost everything in pickup is perfect. The film is quite good. Richard Widmark stars as a cotton tool that steals microfilm which meant going to the Communist spies. Jean Peters plays a woman who was carrying a film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to get to Widmark and return. Anampata through the dung pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are facing, which swaps the faithful of Peters (that, and the fact that he is learning he works for the Communists, the Cold War things are very interesting). The story of love has been made very quickly and not entirely reliable, but it is not so bad that it harms the film (unlike the original Fuller film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is good. This should be one of its best responsibilities, but I do not know very much about his work that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter offers more memorable performance. His role provides a film for an unexpected emotional resonance, and its final location in this film is as touching as you will find in the movie. I never forget it. 10/10.
