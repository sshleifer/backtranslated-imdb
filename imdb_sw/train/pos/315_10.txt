I totally love this soap. It's been one of my favorite. What? Recommend it :) ... I love Brazil soap, they are experiencing real life events. I am so sad that soap has stopped but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those who have not seen, please see. I loved the characters, conspiracy and how things ended with criminals. The only thing I could change was the end of Xica and her long love. I can't wait to see again and recommend too much. Xica has been away, the best soap I have seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you also love too.
