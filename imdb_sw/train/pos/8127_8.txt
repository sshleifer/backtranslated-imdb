While a little preaching on the topic of development as the saving of humanity, this is still an amazing film that faces the effects of preventing fiction-fiction science that will take 40 years to reach the financial screens. It predicts a global WWII disorder, but it adds up to the premise that it has a 30-year crisis, and then describes the story of humanitarian competition from the bottom of the tiny and in space. Acting seems to be very tall and very strange, but maybe this is the result of its differences and images that must have been breathing during the release of the film, which is still interesting today. This is a film that no one should be attracted to SF type.
