This is a good movie. I love more every time I look. Many players can get very well because you know all the harvest, but the secret people are very honest in writing and features that look once again - like Ben Stiller crying in the ornament, or Hank Azaria says well for Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush stimulates his choreography, or Tom Waits while watching the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss from Paul Reubens - it's fun. This includes a full column of action. The story goes straight and consistently, the order of action is innovative and not too large, all payments set by the end. Hardly, if you have seen it and it has taken time, look again, and if you haven't started. You can't watch it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the test area. Many good things!)
