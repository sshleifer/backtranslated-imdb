The film is an old man I have never seen how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, while playing in a great film, "Lost Weekend". Ray has the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very rich bank. There are three girls in this picture who are very unhappy with their father and mother to separate and know their father will go to marry a little blonde who is just a gold-looking daddy. Employers should be like a very rich calculation, whose name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is drunk all the time and has no money and gives comic laughter in pictures. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) was surprised when everyone was at the police station and told the police chief that he was an opera star and then Penny started singing and the most amazing soprano sound I had heard, the whole police department and prisoners started shouting, which was an enjoyable and enjoyable area from this film. This is the earliest start of Deanna Durbin's film and he became an instant success at night and continued to become a popular film star and Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
