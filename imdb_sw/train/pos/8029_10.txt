I know what Beckett's gun was doing in the film, and also the caliber of the shot which he thought was firing. If this is freely according to the beat of Carlos Hathcock, I think it's 7mm. round. I am also curious of the gun itself. He also made a comment in the last movie Sniper about a gun that a Vietnamese man had used to use his father's. Beckett explained that he thought it was the best gun of the sniper ever made. I would like to know what a gun is also. I know that some guns were made near WWII or before. I was not able to look enough to watch the film to identify. To Mr. Hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 kilometers, and he was assured 93 and 14 was not confirmed to kill. After his injuries were healed by a fire in Vietnam, he used all his work to teach snipers in USMC skills that they would need in the field. His work is still known to our brothers and sisters who teach in the USMC. I recognized his name from my old friend Marine. Any information will be good.
