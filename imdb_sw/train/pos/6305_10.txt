Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. Wonderful format sent, good editing and amazing patterns. Movie's caper which is not available on normal tricks. Nothing is going to say about this film without destroying it. The label line says all - boys 5. 1 Secure. No brain. William H Macy and Sam Rockwell cause amazing surprises. George Clooney should be praised for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
