True film artists will love this true film. <br /> <br /> I disagree with three who are rating this movie one star and call it useless. Although I have no history or from the context of the characters, I have spent many years working in low-income and working areas and feeling acting was real and represents how young people are doing. I don't know what the basis of the opinion of others that the film is "non-fiction". The discussion is good. <br /> <br /> The low value of budget production does not bother me. I felt that natural lights strengthened the character of the film. The view was entirely on the line of the story and the development of character and not the simplicity of Hollywood film or melodrama. I was bought fully in the influence of behavior and effect. Acting was reliable and amazing for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip. If you enjoy good drama related to behavior, then look. About the negative speakers being "trolls": click their names and you will see many have no other views or just negative comments.
