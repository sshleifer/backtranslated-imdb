The carrey jim can do nothing. I thought this would be a movie of the baby's pride, and not quite. it was wonderful for everyone, adults and children. I immediately saw that it was almost out of the cinema, and now it's FINALLY coming out this DVD to me and I am excited, as you can see. you should see it if you have never been, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
