Aileen Gonsalves, my partner, is in this film playing the secretary in the central bank of character. She has a lovely place with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. There is more information on its website> Having said my personal interest on the film, I must say that I think it's a good movie - moving, interesting and beautiful.
