I just saw the film two days ago, and I was filled with expectation, since Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent 18 months of romance in '80 years. I was disgraced by many of this vignettes, the original and artistic, caught "light" and the beauty of the city very well. For enough to romance! We did not see anything of boulevards on the trees ... It was very dark, not just in fact but for instance. Some of the plots that caused the viewer appeared, and allowed "down" (a series of presidents, a chain of coiffure sales, giving two examples). Lifting, beautiful: The Mime series, monuments, Montmartre (though very much to the viewer understand), the vignette of "Cowboy", and Sacre Coeur-- seemed to be few and middle, and I would like to have seen a good actor like Orlando Bloom being in something which will show its most authenticity.
