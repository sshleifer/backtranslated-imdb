I did not read anything but good things about this movie and finally I had the opportunity to look at it at the end of last night and it was everything I expected to have and more. true. The impressive sound mark was perfect for keeping the dark conditions. I liked the incredible opening area and enjoyed how the delayed movie played. It was very easy to follow and understand the different movies and movies that are very difficult. I would like to see more movies like this. This is one of my favorite. for this film. So that all things were so frightening movie that it requires.I highly recommend this film for anyone who can appreciate the awesome movie that is not good for punches. The DVD has some interesting features.
