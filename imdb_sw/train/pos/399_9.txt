This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese film fantasy, you should love this. This film is the Lord of Asia's Rings: A story about fantasy, derived from the real Chinese stories. (I recognize many critics have called this film film, I think maybe they have a zero knowledge of Chinese stories.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven and Earth, this should be the same on your journey. This film is still very difficult to find U.S., although it was purchased for U.S. with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Well worth search! This DVD also deserves to own.
