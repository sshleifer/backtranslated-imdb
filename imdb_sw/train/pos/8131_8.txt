If you like rap or hip-hop, check out this film, though it's amazing if you don't get memory, like a direct comedy. You don't see the amount of CB4 much, but what I saw didn't have a heart that this small stormer has. It does not hear from people involved since then, which is a surprise. The film is the same as Tap Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think a lot of discussion, while the infinite value in Tap is funnier here, maybe because I am more rap than the day of rock text, so my own sentence does not cloud showing. <br /> <br /> rap songs are as funny as hell, and basically they see the memory of many films, not all located in your face, which means physical comedy and the most prioritized pieces of withdrawal. <br /> <br /> Great big, one looking twice if there is a movie.
