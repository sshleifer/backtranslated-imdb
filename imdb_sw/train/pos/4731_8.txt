That is definitely one of the best efforts of Jet. Few players can play stoic as Jet Li can. The action is fast-hot, with special effects have increased for power purposes. As a result, it can take Americans to be a little guard. The slight suspension of unbelief may go a long time in Jet Li film. I feel it is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and expecting more artistic works (especially Fist's Legend) and making it an American market. A good mix of gunplay and physical conflict will fulfill many flick of the action.
