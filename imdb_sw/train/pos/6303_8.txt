After hearing the best reviews and seeing the trailer car I was watching this film. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell should be good. And provided. In general, the movie is not funny, but there is one place that comes out and is in my view. SPOILER At the end, where they go through the wall to find safety and we see Rockwell and Washington looking at Jeter's is just amazing. This is just as good as the Big Lebowski area where The Dude uses a seat for its barricade door, but it forgives the door you can jump out! Last Update only go see this movie, you will not be discouraged.
