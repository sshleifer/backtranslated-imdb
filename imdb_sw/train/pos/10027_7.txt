Indeed, the Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but in fact you should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will clarify. The first time you see a film you see a love story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think of this) is just anger and you just stay there watching movies to think, When this ship d ** n go to sink ??? And even this is not surprising when you see it several times. Acting in this film is not bad, but it should not be bad. I was so happy DiCaprio did not win oscar for this film, which means who he thinks he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes a half-half film and does not make a film for less than 20 million dollars. And then everyone is judged to have no film with him in it. But on, with my eyes, the worst of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was extraordinary. I also think the director is very talented to put the same size film together. There is one lesson to learn about this film: there are many stories of love like it, the film designers should not try to add the romance of the crummy for every single movie! Of the 100% possible I give this film only 71%.
