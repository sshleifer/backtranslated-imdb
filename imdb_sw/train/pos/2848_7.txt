New York, I love you is a joint work of eleven short films, and every section runs around 10 minutes long. Shorts do not specify but all have something similar, love. Every short is about finding love, whether it's about two couples or just two visitors. Children's films are beaten, among them Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson, and Anton Yelchin . With a stellar cast such as an impressive column, I expected a great film; The problem is New York I Love You don't add up. It remains the total of its parts. Some of these groups are amazing, original and interesting but others are important (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) groups that are awesome. The film is obvious and has a lot of experimental sound. Wise way, it seems like something of a few film students can put together. After saying this, the film has a good time, one of the best parts of an old couple, played with Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, going to Brooklyn for the 67th anniversary of marriage. And it's like this, that you have made me a viewer, want the film to be more stable, because, there is great power here. But, if it is not appropriate if the general story is about to be, for me, movies and sounds keep everything. The editing was perfect, how the film was so amazing and sound, it could not be more suitable. At the end, New York I Love You feels like a pilot film, and as in many experiences there is high and lows. It is how a person looks at the entire film to determine whether he enjoys or not. It may be useful to some and waste time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
