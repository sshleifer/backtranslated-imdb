I was very happy to see this film. I thought eventually Australia had made a good film .. but I was wrong. This was the most exciting attempt on the slasher film ever. I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald having come all the way to Australia to make a bad film. Acting was bad (especially the Australian German who was trying to talk to the American statement), and the plot was too bad. When I received information about this film, I thought the head was sad (because it looks like a cheesy film "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was ready to allow it to roll it as a good movie. <br /> <br /> Color! TIME WORKERS! Maybe the worst thing about the film was the end. I expected a great surprise on who was a killer. But the killer was not even a man .. who turned this true film of slasher on a bad terrible movie. Do not see this film. .. probably you will be disappointed!
