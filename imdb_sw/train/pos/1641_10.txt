I saw 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to watch. In fact. Looking at this small family fight during the winter there was a heart. No time to ban: the fate has thrown together and we put our shoulders to grindstone and work. This was the basis of the woman's magazine, which I have read many years later. He said in his diary that his parents died when he was younger and all their concerns and sisters had to make the farm feed themselves. He learned to beat, which was not like a woman. He was afraid that nobody would be so great that he would want a woman with a sunny color, but the man was so happy that his new wife knew how to walk, and was happy to do so. They were all widows and together they worked to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the child died. Of course, if you were today, I'm sure it would be good. That only makes the sad sad. I cried a lot. But then they went and successfully took the new calf. Spring is on its way, and life continues. In her diary, she had two other boys and lived.
