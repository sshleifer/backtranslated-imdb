I was looking at the old VHS tapes that I saw and I saw John Denver's TV & Muppets A Together Together for Christmas. I was disappointed that I could no longer get on the DVD. The exhibition was shown in 1979 and was a good display. I have a record with CD but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture of the picture is good but it grows, the sound is not recommended as a CD. There are also a few other songs that should not be on CD. As a lover of John Denver and Muppets, the DVD's show would really be a good supplier. If you do not have a CD it is a collection of Chritmas songs taken from the show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play on.
