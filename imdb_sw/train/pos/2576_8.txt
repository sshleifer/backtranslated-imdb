I am of "Generation Christopher Reeve" is right to say that he was an excellent actor playing Superman yet, but that does not prevent me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a good effort to knock Chris from the top, though he drops too much. That doesn't stop him from enjoying this film, it has a lot to go for it. It has everything that is needed by film, plot and beginning, middle, and end, with all those parts written in mind. The film is a mixture of work and story, something of a black-film but with fingers. The story is exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that is not also preaching. I am still wondering this was shot more than 12 days, oh the days of Hollywood's glory, when we didn't have to wait just 5 years to see if the film would fall into the promotional spirit ... The film has been hit by expertise, led by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, known for leading speed and efficiency. It will not allow technology restrictions to slow down, in fact there are some creative aspects that have been made to create airplane effects, including keeping the camera on the boom on the car and the high shot and traveling fast to make it look like we see it from the point of view. Superman, also a few close to George in the work of the process, and the long shot of Superman's animation. It is now available on DVD as an additional feature in the first series of George Reeves Television series. The DVD worth owning, the inclusion of the film as its original origin, is an icing on the cake. Give me blood today God bless!
