For films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under their belt, good people from the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, now bring us to some of their lost humor in the form of "Creative Comfort" .... .................................................. <br /> <br /> Made for a short time in their work, "Creative Creatures" is a piece of livelihoods where the dialogue talks are removed from their surroundings and the release of animals of some species. br>> The Aardman animation in the world interviewed people with innocent questions such as, "Are you a liar?" and then accelerate little things about their sex life. <br /> <br /> Answers, when it seems to be boring and mundane, is quite true, when you understand the conversation comes first and animals are added later. How many of these animals are seen as someone making notes? One of the characters discussing what he is looking for for a woman, "I love you like a thin type." are insects, Walking stickers. There are two dogs talking to the smell and smell, whistling behind the handkerchief, while talking about the odor of the woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the castle. As the "wife" describes the litany which is her health, her heavy husband stands standing with her, saying no. <br /> <br /> While it may take time to "Comfort of Creation" to get "feet", it should find a place on television for those who are tired of normal. Although there is more truth than the Carter has the liver, "comfort" is one of the kind and certainly appropriate to watch. Some of the humor may seem a little racy, it is the soil that gets the attention of the children (like the old batman series of 60 years, the joke is enough for children to get) and it's a joke that adults.
