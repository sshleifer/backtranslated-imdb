Shot in the Heart is wonderful. It clearly shows the problem of Gary Gimore, the murder of the accused who asked for death. Shot in Heart shows the difficulty that the Gilmore family, broken by the hatred, passed. This movie is an amazing psychological study, and it makes a sense of it to enhance it. 10/10
