It was difficult for me to believe all the negative views about this flick of all stars. I laughed through the whole picture, as did all my family. The movie describes itself as an old gangster comedy - players were hysterical - I bet that they were good at the time of doing it. In fact Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and how about those Everly sisters, each of Falco two, and God's music around. Rob Reiner made the biggest driver of the lime laugh, and Gabriel Byrne had a terrible neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Joe's sleep and the entire hub with major references. Paul Anka was the most fun, and most interesting to run the fear after Byrne decided to make the duet of "my way" home welcome to Vick's performance. <br /> <br /> I have a suggestion that this movie was a wonderful victory for Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, even thinking of following the actions that occurred in this film - is a joke - not a "gangsta" film. Cars and clothes were amazing, as they were decoration, "Vic place." In fact, I think of "Dog Maker" as a music comedy, not a risk than many cartoons, TV crimes, and talk shows. I would recommend a video for the evening of family entertainment.
