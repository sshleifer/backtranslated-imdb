Hilarious completely. John Waters's tariffs for his favorite people (Baltimoreans) are a little messy mess and a lot of look and laugh. It's like turning on the museum kitsch! I did not laugh at the reminder since Mother's Serial. I liked to see old friends from the days of Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back to the Waters camera. Cast is just amazing (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best of the worst evils of the water (especially Assisted Polyester) and a lot of new surprises. I made it sick, in a strange way. Thank you, John!
