This is not a "free", but a typical, reliable 1958 session of "Monicelli" of "I Soliti Ignoti" and Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that's good, copy of all the wonderful characters and plot, even for more information (like the location where the photographer steals the camera from the domestic market). <br /> <br /> I looked at an old version of the past many times and I knew to heart all the categories and last but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its beauty and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how life and ways of thieves in the 1950s are taken to the United States of America. 8/10.
