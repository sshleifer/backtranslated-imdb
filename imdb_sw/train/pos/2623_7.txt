I really are like the original, and this film has ups and down it. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Many original sounds were thrown. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like Maa Timon's voice. I know he made a voice in The Simpsons, but that's just displayed stupid. Ups: We get to see Lion as "boy." <br /> <br /> Downs: They lost to the slug-slurping competition between Timon and Simba. Ups: He was a friend who told Timon about "No Matata." <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumbaa get to know about it? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (some of the previous songs were there, but they were just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (a.k.The soul of Timon.) I would recommend to the original fans. But if you don't like nature, space won't like this. <br /> <br /> My logo: 7/10
