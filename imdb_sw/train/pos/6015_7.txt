At the beginning of the 1970s, many of us who accepted the culture of hippy / acid / substitutes wholeheartedly, realized that the traditional community did not change the way we thought. For me this film describes the tension of "now what?" that most of the people I knew felt at that time. Do we go to the district and create our vision of cigarettes or do we reduce and push for change? <br /> <br /> Due to improper signs for the police, great rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music, for love - do with pictures of bursting in the desert - very much there. It takes time key time.
