In October 1945, Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) was born in Germany, came to Frankfurt after the war with his Uncle Kessler's uncle (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) finds him working on the Zentropa train train as a sleeping trainer. While trains learning his profession, he sees the damage done in Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of a powerful entrepreneur of transport business and the owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold stays neutral between collaborative forces with the Germans, and he knows that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing killers and doing acts of protest against allies. He likes to Katharina, and earlier clarifies that he was "Werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold was also stressed by "Werewolves" and the need to take place and decision. "Europa" is an amazing and sad story of Kafkanian's general director of Danish Lars von Trier. Using a style of speech that you remember Fritz Lang and changing a big picture of black and white color and other color details, this film describes a difficult time of Germany and some of the problems that this great nation had to deal with after the defeat in war. Very interesting action of the working forces to destroy the resources that can allow the rapid renewal of the damaged land, and corruption and the Jew who should recognize Max. Jean-Marc Barr has a good role in the role of man who wants to stay neutral but is used everywhere by everyone. The story of Max Von Sydow is another touch to the class in this film released. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europa"
