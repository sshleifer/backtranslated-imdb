I lost this film from the blockbuster on the blow. I love alan arkin and the lid was catching ... I read back and I knew once it was going to be the best or worse movie I ever seen ... I think I'm lucky. alan arkin brings good character to this movie. I've bought a copy of the rental for my own collection and watching it all the time. I have suggested this movie to be loads of people and all enjoyed it as I did ... I see complaints about menus and dvd work .. but it is not suitable with the film. The blockbuster exculsivley which is why they did not allow you to jump before preview.
