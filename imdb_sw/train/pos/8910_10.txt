Many teenagers of the old Atomic cinema noticed on television as a child-and some of them, BLOB included, fear outdoor days. Films like MARS MARK made it quite clear to us "a small fry" that children were not to be trusted during things like home-like things; BLOB referred to the same truth. I remember, sadly, the late evening spent stretching on the floor to look like the body of the Body and Invaders of Martian and Blobs entered into an unconscious society. There was a summer, at the beginning of the 1980s, when a local science museum (Richmond, Virginia) conducted a classic Atomic Age every weekend. These were 16mm films, and many were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" of BLOB's magazines had lost pink-but, man, it was fun. I drove my mother together, and she was so happy as I did. It was there, at the science museum, that I loved so much with BLOB. The aim of the film manufacturer was, of course, making money - but it was the loyalty of all involved, from film artists to the "talent" (players), which made me more interested in this film. Corny? You are a bet. Cheesy? They don't have any cheese. But, man, what movie!
