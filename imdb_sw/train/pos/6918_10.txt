The most enjoyable film that depicts the actors who are doing bad things and who allow feelings like anger and a desire to take revenge. The stripes are very beautiful, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl to take revenge (for moving) at the end. I have seen this film several times, and always check if it is on AMC or cable. Very recommended ...
