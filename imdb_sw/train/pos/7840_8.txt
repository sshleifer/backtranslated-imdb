The birth of the BOOGIE is actually 'getting' - although the rock rocker for nearly thirty years, I first saw the film a few days ago, and put it in the middle of high rock films all the time; The bright music (the cream of T. Rex) and the most frequent and unusual performances, leaving this viewer interested in other Ringo Starr leadership, who did a good job here. If you like music, you will be at T. Rextasy around, as Marc Bolan really is a star piece, front and center. Even the fact that some of the songs are repeated does not matter a bit: different places, expensive, music settings, and fantastic visual ideas are all used to lose different textures and a lot of upbeat humor to what can end up as 'just' a film in other hands. As rich and perfect as full of BOOGIE is, the film is only one hour, but what is really enough. There is only my lie - a video bag says something like 71 minutes, and at least one Internet source says the film is 67 minutes, but it looks more than 61 minutes of fun.
