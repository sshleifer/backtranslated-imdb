Riding Giants is an amazing document showing the history and stories of the three most powerful players, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job to replace the director and should be praised for doing such a brilliant work. The film system has been carefully modified and works perfectly with the presentation, interview, animation and playback pictures. The sound of the music adds only to the overall content of the film, and to make the Vision of the Battlefield. Personal features include any views of Greg Noll, what to his point of view for sure, Laird Hamilton Footage at Teahupoo, and out-takes at the end of the movie. But in fact all this film is one of the biggest, proposed that comes up if you have the opportunity to see. It is the most shameful, but it is a worthy gem. 10/10
