I was very impressed with this film. Writing was wonderful, and all the characters were rich, and easy. It is very easy to find an attraction for all. The creators of this film just nail the head only when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer healed in their world. Additionally, music is bright. They used some independence to make a mark, and some sound sounds, and they do a wonderful job to add a film. If you have the opportunity to catch this movie in a small playground or on a concert (as I did), I strongly recommend going. Also, for personal note, Paget Brewster is good in this film. That's the reason enough to go to explore.
