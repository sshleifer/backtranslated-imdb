This is actually a very small flick, made up of a sufficient budget and beaten on a decline video. It takes a little time to turn to it. Acting is so bad that it soon finds the charm of zen-like. After a few events, you choose to focus on the odd lines or sounds of some delivery. All characters develop the charm of quirky, especially "Richard". Forgetting Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is someone who would like to employ a psychopath play of raving. He just looks very happy! Confusion and incidence of mad and zombie demolition are some of the real shots of the characteristic character of the head, "Midnight Skater" that travels through the camp in black hoodie, searching for the whole world as a cross between Reefer Grim and, say, Finance. These shots make other interesting things when the characters say about Skater seem almost evil. Sound sound has some of the Garage-Punk tunes that are very fun with the raspy wind, the simplicity of the mix is ​​very similar to the state of the film. Thumbs upish, I say.
