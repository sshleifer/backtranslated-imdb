This is a beautiful flicker in Michigan, about a boy who was beaten by an old man, with his father (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown up very well. In fact, he is quite bonkers, but he tries to be very clear. He has a winner, his little spirit and angels who follow him closely. Daupo didn't say a word but in fact, they don't, and he is Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that a very angel blows his wheels in this, as Eric does the work that makes him feel better, like “opening” people that decides the need, most beautiful women. This is a beautiful spiritual picture, and you are the only kind of time to know some of what is happening, but in general, I watched this from the beginning to the very end of the film because it really was my intention. It's a little lack of in other places but there is nothing I can put my finger on. Good effort and worth seeing if you like a serial killer.
