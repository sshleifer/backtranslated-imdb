The cluster of this movie is simple and also a script: A Muslim-born Muslim finds his young son to his old car station from France to haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his duty to the Muslims before he it dies. The father is clearly religious, but the child has no influence; he accepts the responsibility of his father instead of religion, he would prefer to have his girlfriend (non-Muslims). The father is a stubborn person in many things that the child does not know and the wind between them is a sporting game, although they are often angry. However, if any good movie movie there are wonderful characters who have met on the way; for example a woman along the back road in Croatia who when asked for directions to Belgrade gets only in the back seat and says with her hand giving one word that they think is a place but they can't find on the map. In Bulgaria someone else asks for confirmation instructions can speak French but then gives a detailed explanation in Bulgarian. There is also a constant humor - in one country children eat tires sandwiches and they want meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps by chance to the viewer) goes away before the father can do the worship of Islamic killers. Finally they make Makkah - like the Muslims of the Vatican but at a very large scale. To the west it is all wonderful but interesting. The movie is not modern but it is charming in its own way, a variety of National Geographic and spirit.
