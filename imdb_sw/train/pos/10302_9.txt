This film is the best film Jim Carrey has ever done. Carrey had no ordinary face to do things in this film. He was happy and sad. Carrey played a journalist named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that is wrong in his life. Then, God comes from heaven and gives Bruce his strength. As I said earlier, Carrey did a very good job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were a lot of help to actors / actress. The plan was good because it had many passages in the main stage. This movie can be funny (dog Bruce) with depression ("break-up"). Script did well, too. I am glad they did sequel for this film. I am testing this 9/10 film.
