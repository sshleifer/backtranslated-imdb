As a fan of Pokémon I enjoyed this film very much. It creates a new story of Pokémon (like every film does) and adds deep to the relationship between its characters. However I did not expect those who are not fans of Pokémon to enjoy (This includes adults MOST). Some of the lines were corny, but that could be somewhat impossible to avoid when dubbing the movie on English. The animation was good, although there were some parts that were not well seen. And although the villain is a kind of corny, I think that movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of criminals, and I make sure that not all like this. Those who did not like it, I tell each other, but the Pokémon fans will love it.
