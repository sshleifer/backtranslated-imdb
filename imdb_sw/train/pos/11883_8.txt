I saw this film about a week ago and still thinking about it. I was very impressed with this film. I have seen the characters are believed and are interested in the fault. As in real life though sometimes people are desperate, as was the case with Leo, who even though I liked her behavior I couldn't be more desperate when she was ready to have unsafe sex even though she knows her HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo by rejecting the medication that was available to him, and the worst way he had done to Marcel when he decided to take him to his house on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why the number of HIV is on gay men. This is not by any means means of gay masters (I am gay) and a very good movie can be made about a single direct person who makes a bad choice and apparently doesn't know its own results with others. The only part of the film that I could not understand why the family (friendly friend) was not willing to include Marcel in Leo's disease and even let him go to the funeral. I think the main message from this film is that whether it is gay or direct you don't want to do SEX!
