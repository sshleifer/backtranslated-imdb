My personal feeling is that you can't divorce this movie from its political / historical text as many experts (Americans) do. This is not about growing on Main Street, USA. It is about Yugoslavia growing when it broke between East and West. Just like the boys are broken between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is broken between "Tovarish Joe" and the boys. There is a shame in certain situations that have been lost to listeners who have never lived under Titus. I feel the movie is tested and it is very bad we have lost the director. This film makes freedom more important. It's not just "other Eastern European film films" ... it is a sensitive image of young people walking in a good line that can eventually lead to real freedom.
