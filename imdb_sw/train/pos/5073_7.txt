This drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, a man who gave us "Gandhi": good photography, a beautiful healing, well written through testing, learned that Hollywood dropped 30 years, and correctly. It looks like a kind of art film, the best in its American American (or, more suitable for its Canadian landscape, "First Nations") and stand for "Black Robe" as a beautiful piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, in 1934). This inappropriate picture gets a drama from the matter: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, Scot raised in Hastings (England) and young girls who came out with a "black stories" of his childhood that he went to Canada, lost in the woods, and became a walker and the son of the Ojibway band. He was an innocent man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian girls, who no one seems to be younger for him, because he was also an extraordinary character and a picaresque. One of his wives (more intelligent than he, and many accounts) made him famous as an author and advocate for the early protection of the northern country, and this focuses on the goal of Attenborough's story. Chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (like Pony Gray wife of Pony) is involved and, if not hot, is still quite touching. Good film when you need time from the crowd.
