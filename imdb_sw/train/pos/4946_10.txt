Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor, who examines the character chosen to play, before volunteering. Freeman is a 'good good' for this film (as it was "Driving Miss Daisy"), and not just reliable, but it gets the opportunity to change its image of a characteristic respect and heritage. Although there is no guarantee in life, for anyone, this gives the actress a good opportunity to play different or unique characters that emerges, to avoid getting the victory. And it must have been said that playback has been reduced, or completely destroyed, a large number of works. <br /> <br /> This is a small budget of a budget which, surprisingly, was released for only two weeks. It is a well-directed film and written by Brad Silberling. The area manager chose Carson, CA for film settings, and the location helps keep the tone and duration of the film. Editing is just for good, but a little angry. <br /> <br /> Silberling was a 'contractor', by getting Freeman to make this film, while the actor was in the middle of film projects. It is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actor, and this opens the effective dialogue between each of the members sent, who are different from different cultures. The film also promotes understanding among people, who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but comes from two different ethnic groups, colors, gender, principles, feelings, beliefs, folkways, principles, and values. The film is striving to be honest, and comes true, to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays a drama who has no work that has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman is very much needed as an actor that always works. <br /> <br /> Movies provides an adventure of connecting, caring, sharing, changing, and sharing. And, the film gives the viewer a preview of some of the items that the recipients must go to prepare for the role. If necessary, tell your master that you are taking a 'mental health day', and go see this film. If you are able, use with your other important ones or your family. I am filing 10 out of 10. It is fun, interesting, informative, painful, and valuable.
