But the joy is in the journey. I have seen this movie very interesting, not only leads very easily in the eyes, humor from support and joke really makes me laugh several times. Yes, it is predictable, and yes, it's a romantic romantic comedy. But the thing is that it is a sweet story, a message about finding your true love is also true in many ways. The conversation is dead and acting is done well for all parts, and on comic effects. The Bulgarian area is worth the weight of gold, the actress there deserves the honor! For those who have banned for predictable - If you want a overlay film and turn that lets you specify ... then you want to exciting. This is a romantic comedy ... touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> The great movie day, the great movie for the fun cry ...
