"Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of the most Hollywood producers of concern. Welles' county was previously adapted by manufacturers and cut to ribbons. This has led to the mysteries of the injustice of even the most difficult to track. They have said much of his talks because of the density of Irish statements, and dubbing is very obvious and does not work properly. Most of the worst of all, Welles and her on the screen with the real life of leading woman Rita Hayworth were falling into their relationship, and their awesome chemistry comes through screens. Fortunately, this all fails just how the Orisa Welles orientation is amazing. He makes this film very strange and atmosphere - every scene seems to continue to breathe from the screen. Also, characters and events are very strange until they like like a dream and surreal. This feeling of weakness raises the events that are often found in these films, such as the central court system. I often find the dramas of the court, but Welles' direction and quirky touch makes them just interesting as everything else. At the end of the festival reminds one of David Lynch around. <br /> <br /> Acting here is also very good. In spite of their failures, Welles and Hayworth both offer good performances - their interaction however is only a bit. Everyone else is very good and enjoys watching though, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "Lady from Shanghai" has clear its problems, but it's worth looking at just seeing one of the masters of the movie for the better. (8/10)
