If you are looking for details of the life of the striker James Corbett, then this is probably not your film. The famous striker receives 1940s "Hollywood-ization" of his life - and making this story more entertaining and engaging than real life. However, because the exhibition was good (especially with Errol Flynn) and the script is very enjoyable, the films can be forgiven. Errol Flynn plays nine-year-old James "Gentleman Jim" Corbett - a man who came into the world in 1892. The film comes from its humble beginning and follows through his work through winning the title against John L. Sullivan. However, although it would have been largely focused on the match, most of them are short in the film (except for the final title of the title) and the emphasis is on Corbett's stability and its relationship with Alexis Smith. In the film, there is a good job that works for the best players (such as a permanent actor in the Flynn film, Alan Hale) and the writing has helped bring these people alive. it's very good about the film is to see the act of Flynn as a striker. When a few shots are double, all pigs are Flynn's and made a job of lobby as a pugilist. This was a good departure for Flynn, who usually played the role of a "good boy" or a girl of coin and this just shows how tough it was. To find out more about this, try reading his description - he was an adult and bright before coming to Hollywood. Now for REAL James Corbett, read up if you're not afraid to know how movies are incorrect. First, Corbett was not a poor person from a poor family, but was an academic and bright college. Second, when he found Alexis Smith at the end of the film, they also left a few years later. Third, the final touch of the film between Sullivan and Corbett was perhaps the best part of the film, Sullivan was a jerk and this could not happen - in fact, Sullivan was more than egomaniac and Corbett was not a fat-led guy was shown in the film - though they did A good film.
