In the 90s you use a 50-year-old book, put a blood item in 50 years and not '90'. See, the 40-year-olds and values ​​tend to not play too, or the ring as true, that off the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood continues to violate. And that's the trouble with this film. It should be installed in the era that is written. You can assume that it will be no-brainer, but nooo. I would like to clarify, but bmacv's comments are very well described. I will limit my comments to Rachel Ward. He looks like he ate his ass completely without this responsibility. As a result, he looks like a crack 'on chemotherapy, and it's about as sexy as a bed of gay skin in the drag. I found him "I was dead at any time" I found it very difficult, and it has caused much of his "fire" and "gender tension" a planned design. Other than that, the film was quite good; 7+ out of 10.
