I saw this movie when it was under the release of the younger, especially for the beauty of seeing Pierce Brosnan and mustache, but it became that one of the funniest movies I saw all year round. It starts as close as exciting, but it progresses steadily in hilarious work full of one liners with great comedic power between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, when I say this film is a comedy, it doesn't forget it has a heart time and it can be very touching when it needs to be. When I entered the playground I did not know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I found was one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. Leaving the theater I felt a great deal from the film and I would like to see it again with the release. I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a well written script and a great mustache.
