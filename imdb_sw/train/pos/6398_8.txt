The "interesting" stories about "the victory of the soul of man" are very great for me. The most amazing thing about PEOPLE of how much I loved, even though I myself. The movie is like predictable and cliched if it gets, but it works. A large loan goes to enjoyable performances and all causes. It's a full responsibility for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is blocked here. We have come to expect a lot from De Niro, and can't despair. She builds a dark picture of funny. Director George Tillman, Jr. has made the flick of the past and come with the winner.
