I thought it was a very interesting movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies so together they were twice beautiful. K-9, k-911, and k-9 PI are popular movies. Jim Belushi is a hysterical and Jerry Lee is a hilarious and adorable master they make a big team. The only obstacle is that I didn't know how Dooley's wife died. He died before this movie but how? If they said it must be wrong. Other than that I provide thumbs / two tails on! Dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have a lot of training. They were very funny and all sounds Jerry Lee would do when Dooley was talking to him was very interesting. I loved so much when Jerry Lee sang and when he forbade private people to get the most funny news lol
