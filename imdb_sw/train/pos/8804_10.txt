Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I've just found the broken King of Egypt). Obviously, all but the Mexican director chose to describe the problems of individuals or groups related to 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf, Palestinians, Srebrenica widows, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, beaten by Pinochets and subsequent blood, suicide in Israel, the assassination of the paranoia and Islamic oppressors oppressed by the government, in the United States, the elderly living alone, and after WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This can say something sad about the limits of understanding, in both ways: directors can feel that Americans ignore the pain of the whole world and care only about their own disasters, while they do the same with their short films. Surprise yourself, I saw a piece of Sean Penn optimal optimal in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think its image of Ernest Borgnine as an half-mad man who climbed the New York apartment facing a happy time The life of the widow when the Sun shines through its window after the WTC "fall through the light", I think this may also be one of the most offending as the total US viewers will see.
