This movie was more than a passage in humanity for one gay person, and how he should deal with everyone. Her mother sad, her little sister is in pain, her older sister agrees. The relationship looks good with his partner / exhooker and leaves his family to try life with this first person. Unfortunately, a new boy is around him and he says he really didn't have any meaning. Our male boy goes to finish the looney bin and finally leaves you, throws his new partner and starting. We are left with him starting to look, do not share, in fun. So maybe things will go well for the future. The latter was a kind of decline but the whole movie was realistic and so I will allow this last rest to go to a higher level.
