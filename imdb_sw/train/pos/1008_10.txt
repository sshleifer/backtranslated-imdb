I came into this very best program for the 4th season and since then I have seen all the episodes of the DVDs and continues to get better and better for the 9 and 10 seasons. Currently it can be Richard Dean Anderson now but add to Ben Browder with Claudie Black has given more power to show and even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately now the sci-fi center has removed this awesome show without a relay of hope for the 11th season makes it straightforward to DVD movie and more hopefully. Atlantis still continues to be strong in its 4 seasons. And there is a third part of the work in the work of the star franchise is not close to dying. This TV version is a must for all sci-fi fans and people of this kind because it has many things to appeal to all ages and all kinds of people looking IT !!!!! 10/10
