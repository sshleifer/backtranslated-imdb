After reading only two comments here, as a Bronte fan of life, start with Heathcliff of Olivier and continue with many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it's more than open eyes to see that it is a sister of Unung Bronte who gave a lie for the period male-chauvinist trio living. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the British liberation of the 19th century is that the "girls" were all "spinsters" and their real dams just and "men" were their father fathers and their wastrel? brother. That said, finally, it is ANNE Bronte who, in one of his observations, showed the "woman" point, the way forward of modern forms, and including an array of "lots of franchise". However, history comes more than a few earlier, including Greek heterai and Sappho and likes of Kuei-fei, ancient king. And how about "Eve" with her apple?
