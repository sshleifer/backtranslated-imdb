I saw the movie soon and I liked it very much. I wondered myself and cried. This film is in the same type of niche as "Get out of it" - or even "Buckwe List" but it covers all the themes of aging and amazing originality. In fact it is very difficult to have the main character if it is not seen as Hagar. The director is doing a good job and challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. His world is hard and he is not a very attractive woman. <br /> <br /> The first part gets this without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken home for nursing with her son and daughter-in-law. He describes them out of the way and comes out. Its boundaries are very difficult. He is meaningless. He is proud and selfish. He is a stone. I didn't like him - at least. <br /> <br /> During the movie, we get insight. We see why he does not like petunias, why he loves one child over another, how his loss has created his character ... I began to see the angel ... and I began to love him. I really loved him when he asked his secrets to the boy in the shade. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a talented actress. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a place! <br /> <br /> This is not a movie "feel good", but it's certainly a movie that brings the viewer to mercy. I understand more clearly that the most difficult lips in a person's life are there to protect, they are because ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she even my mother- law or neighbor ... but its parts exist in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I have watched Angel Angel.
