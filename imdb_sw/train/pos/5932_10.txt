Best Stephen King film included IT, though this is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This has got all: <br /> <br /> -freebed by Alice Krige and Brian Krause with the joy of King himself; <br /> <br /> - well dosed stories in amusing story; <br /> <br /> - The great use of music, Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk" especially; <br /> <br /> - with spelling in the normal circumstances of the King: in the middle of no place in the village; <br /> <br /> -the name of humor. You can't find a fragrance here because it's so fun and high; <br /> <br /> -dogo but good effects of makeup as they no longer have! <br /> <br /> 4,5 Rating: I am not available. At the end of the horrible film was what fun like this?
