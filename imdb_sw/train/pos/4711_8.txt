Oh, what a joy here! Amy Heckerling has a chance to lead comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, See Who's Talking) but here it seems like he told actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton reduces Johnny's position, easily his work of better screens. Joe Piscopo is as good as Danny Vermin is named, where the shameful directors caught on this. And I also mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie with a unique vocabulary of character. I don't think it's an accident that a lot of character name is called MORON. A good line is rolled out in all films, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner was given good lines. Even executives with small responsibilities like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale find good lines. <br /> <br /> suggests to a friend.
