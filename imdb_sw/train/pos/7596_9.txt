The first part once gave a good sense of expectation from the series! Hidden wait resolved and a lot of good game! I love the fact that gradually reveals stories about characters! Just describe enough to stay excited! Of course this show has some errors! In the first series there are characters who for some reason do not show in the third season! Many characters are removed with respect but some are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where is hell? What happened to them? Maybe they will come back in later periods! But it's a little opposite! That said "Lost" can surprise every part (especially the first season)! That's a very difficult thing to do! I see that in the third season the goal is more about the development of character than the secret issues of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some of the boring events! One of the things that can be considered that the power of this show is amazing characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But finally I want to see some secrets to be resolved and closed! The risk of "Lost" to get rid of the decline in the ratings is near! And that would be bad!
