The first commentary of Peter Weir, the last WAVE is the most effective killer and an amazing story behind the story of the Aboriginal story. Richard Chamberlain gives good performance as a defense lawyer whose life is growing unmoored from the truth as he learns more about the murder trial involving ethnic ethnic race. David Gulpilil who is one of the suspects, who can lead Chamberlin in the 'Dreamtime' area, a substantial fact / main schedule between Australian and ethnic history. Faced with the atmosphere, with sufficient purpose in planning, the film creates unintended finale which has been reduced to negative effects, perhaps due to budget deficits. However an exciting film that has a general sense of mystery and fear that emerges under the face of what we see as 'truth' will remain with you.
