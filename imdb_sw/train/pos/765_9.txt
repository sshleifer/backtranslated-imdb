I think when the "Beat Street" made the national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one play area to play and others were jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons for "Beat Street" was the best. The only film that can fight "Beat Street" seems to be "Publisher", because both movies focused on how drums have been used by people to express their feelings. <br /> <br /> Drum-breaking events in "Beat Street" just come before the middle and end of the flick. And I loved them all. Almost every breaking tricks were featured in the break of the jam burst: jackhammer, flares, head spins, sitting sit, legs of things, die, front flip, four figures - almost everything. <Br /> <br /> As "Warriors", "Beat Street" has violence related to the life of the group in the world of hip hop ... but through less cruelty than the former. The only big event of fighting in the "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (in the movie was shortened as "Ramo") was expelled by a member of the militant group on New York City road ...... The third and all who die by electrocution on the rail. Well, although tracking the area was mature, it was better to have died in such a way than to have a blood shot from a military detection. Most of the gang items on the flick were graffiti related to hip-hop culture, and rap music. Much of the rap music was seen in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as an analysis of the bad life of the gang. Even the theme of the film's film, which closed the curtain for flick, was not just a hip-hop culture culture - it was also a cult to Ramon's death. The way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I think the female player in the hole orchestra carried out by actor Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. who appears to appear.
