Seeing whether the ballot was very low, and the fact that the clerk at the video store thought it was "the same", I didn't have much expectation during this film. But as opposed to above, I was very happy. This is a charming movie. It didn't need me to grow, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks offers good performance as a leadership character, I think quite differently from its usual size in its movies. It is not a lot of cricket joke or something like that, but there are some hilarious pictures, and this is generally very fun and very easy to watch. It was highly recommended.
