This movie was recommended to me and a friend. I did not see an advert or trailer, so I didn't know Clooney was in it and was not worried about the fact that his role was too small. I thought to give them all was good, and I saw a film that enjoyed, all for all. The opening area, along with the small bandits of the robbers standing on the side of the road, gazing at the haggard, kept my attention right away. It had a way to tell you, "don't leave, this will not be interesting", and it was not true. It turned out to be an exciting, heart-stirring comedy and enough to turn it into your seat until the end, but when the end came, I felt a little misleading .... just a bit. The events continued to build so that you could expect to continue building, but when I could not define it, it was kind of out-of-the-way, and so to finish a little despair. I think I was expecting a big bang, but it was a type of low key. If you watch the film and that in mind and you can live without a large measure of George Clooney, you should get this very flick of entertainment and worth watching. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal in Madonna Street), but maybe it gets rare in the United States.
