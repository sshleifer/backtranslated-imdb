I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did a very good job showing Helen Graham, a beautiful woman who hid, with her young son, from a secret secret. As an anglophile who loves romances ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend to anyone who tries to escape for a few hours in the UK's 1800s. enough to watch this amazing production.
