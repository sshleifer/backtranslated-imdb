I liked the movie, but if everyone said, there were bits that were not enough. I thought personally that the girls were very dirty before they got to prison; indeed, they were supposed to be innocent girls of the United States but still ... I felt they didn't have the same sentence that best friends should have. For example, in the montage where they see-see, the way they interacted with the image was looked very much. Then, there are parts that were very unclear. I think it's very good to understand that the character of the Danes did not do that, but I can see how that can be mixed. Also, why does the camera stay in Manat with very good words after putting bags in the taxi trunk? I thought it was showing something, but it wasn't there. <br /> <br /> Besides, the film was good. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; he is a GREAT actor. Also, I wanted to see the Thai girl took her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure ...
