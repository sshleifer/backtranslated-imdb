At the end of the first hour my jaw was well shut between my feet. The movie never, and I mean never, lets you in action. It can be a strict step but it is a step. Sometimes each member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosion was real, the eviction events were possible, and the fighting was strange. Matt Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. I should say that every Bourne movie gets better and this is not different. Steps, columns, plot. How to do it I never know. I praise someone who has written the screen showing each of these movies. Because if he hadn't done a very good job with the first movie, we can't have this talking. Do not go to the exhibition, go to the movie stations while still out where you live, but if not December 11 Bourne comes to you!
