Thanks as a student I have been able to watch "diagnosis" for several years now. It is basically about a doctor who takes the killings with the help of her LAPD, a little doctor and a doctor. DM provided the 8th season of exclusive entertainment. What made it different from many other cop and exhibitions on it was sent by the quality of writing. The main Casting gave the best performances and the roots of the entertainment of Dick Van Dyke through the magic, dance and humor. The best DM issues were fast, the magic texts and of course the toe. Unfortunately it has been successfully opposed to "Murder, He wrote". DM is far more boasting than solving and more types. Now it's gone the TV is the worst part. Gone are the days of feelgood, shows a friendly family of police. Now there are only "gritty" problems.
