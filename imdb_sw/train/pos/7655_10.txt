While you have not seen this film in 20 years I am still attracted to the impact of the hard touch and stellar statement. Of course, Mr. Mickey Rooney is true, it includes his position as "killer" who led the ring. (Considering some reviews here - no other than Orson Welles promoted the name of Mickey Rooney as the most popular film actor, too.) I also remember a jazzy-brassy color and a black and white color. I love the last line of Mick before going out to his dose of poison poison. (I think the delegates raised it in line in one of their tracks - Get Up.) This is a good film and a non-fiction film buried. Let's get out! The latest newspaper magazine The Film Film has written on "Babyface Nelson" of Don Segal, made a few years before "Last Mile" and also with Mickey Rooney. Another extreme action of the Mick. Perhaps it is the beginning of the basics of appreciation for the best movies.
