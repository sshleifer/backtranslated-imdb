This movie is a brilliant lesson on the Japanese history set at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before Shogunate lost a great war against loyalist, who wanted the king to return to the throne to rule Japan. True, I had to read many history to find all history. Shintaro Katsu (also known as Zatoichi's original) gives good performance like It Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Human Assassin) of Bakumatsu. He is a simple Samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he is put back by Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke out of the Sword of Doom). Hanpei is a national political politician who allows his Hitokiri band to kill many of the highest politicians in order to achieve its political goals. It Okada follows its leader without questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to go and drink and spend on his adultery. The Okada murder is more and more violent during the film and is proud to have a basic reputation for fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful picture on the life of a simple samurai who finds on political elements and is actually having ignorance to realize what's happening. First after being betrayed and tortured and always having a conversation with Sakamoto (who is a Samurai who rejects violence) he changes his mind and views on life. But it's too late ... <br /> <br /> See the movie to see the end of It Okada ... Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff provides good performance. Each actor reaches their place. Sword of the sword is unique and very fast ... probably faster than several movies today ... <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance !!!
