One of the most horrific and horrible periods in the history of America began. Members of the Culture of Love Culture, at the end of the seventy years and the beginning of the 80's, finally put an old instrument with love beads and all night and turned back into normal life, whatever it meant. For those who were not able to grow out of their youthful youth and sometimes useless, they are a Wonderland culture. The love of drugs and the sense of legalization as well as the destruction of authority, ethics and "establishment" are the world in which the film takes. sixty years was the time of the revolution and the change of violence that separated the "house" of America off. Once the war ended, we all had to face the consequences of the murder. The characters in Wonderland's home are the icons of misfits of seventy years; The parts of the bike, part of the hippie, part of the pig, all of the exclusion. There are no definitions of expression, just a state of dissatisfaction with everything and obedience to anything. Ron, Billy and David are making themselves like Robin Hood and dope. They say about love and live violently; it takes from the rich to sell to those who are caused; they steal from everyone. Holmes and the company are the end result of an incredible clash of anti-sex issues, and drugs and rock & roll, while laboratory laboratories get bored and continue. The film is directed to the art and is faced with the capture of the world of drug freedom in their aspect. The fact that Holmes is a star of porn is almost meaningless. The story was told in the "Boogie Light". This is the story of the transition and forgetfulness.
