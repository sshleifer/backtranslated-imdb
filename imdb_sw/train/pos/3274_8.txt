This is one of the 80 films that I can think of which were ignored at the time and unfortunately, still ignored. One of them was Clownhouse headed by Victor Salva, the movie destroying because of legal / sex problems of Salva. Another will be Cameron Cameras that beat me as it was down - not bigger, but not as bad as the comments I saw. The Paper House is worth your time and I think it is one of those stylish films that will take on your brain for a longer time than you can imagine. I mean, 10 years after seeing it and I have put it on the pause, when something that I could see 6 months ago went on ether.
