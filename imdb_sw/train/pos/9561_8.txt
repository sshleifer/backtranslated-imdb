'' Ranma Â½ 'is my most popular anime and Rumiko Takahashi. For a woman knows how to give us good news, not just comedy, but also a anime action. For the main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a young man who is also an expert on art military. Ranma is involved in Akane because of the order of all the fathers, who are good friends and have been taught together for many years. Akane is the youngest and most powerful sister of action: Kasumi is an old and very sweet and Nabiki is in the middle and loves to win money regardless. Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially because they are all very angry, and when they find out that Ranma becomes a girl being beaten by cold water and her father becomes panda, many characters and new situations begin to happen. discover the reason for change: when they fight, Ranma and his father fell into the curved river but not only had this kind of fate ... <br /> <br /> Looking at '' Ranma 1/2 '' and loving, I would like to recommend you '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku ', two other creations from Rumiko's hands.
