This movie I love since I was younger! It is better. Although, it may be very little for ordinary observers of the film if someone cannot interpret a certain trick in the film (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander was hit with a heel and rocket, such as Achilles in mythology was shot a heel. That's just a little truth that is kind of interesting! However, a good movie, good story, would be good to see it again with the special effects of today! Normally, Gary Graham had an average success, with a star at T.V. show the Nation of Alien. This movie is an enjoyable watch and should be accepted more!
