Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves come back as two dopes from San Dimas who are sent on another trip to life when someone will feel very well opposed to the way presented in the first movie. The only difference is that their journey is “somewhere” between Heaven and Hell and ends up being two. When they meet the Grim Giver, they have the opportunity to chase a chance to come back and stop two bad robots in order to destroy what they should have in the future. In addition to playing the roles they ... have ... they are finished, they also play (and revive extra sales in the process) some of the most common games (I even have my original copy of the war in the closet). <br /> <br /> Because I loved this movie better than the original because it deals with "what could be like" instead of "what was". Without damaging the film, I can't give you more information about this (I think you will need to look at both of them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
