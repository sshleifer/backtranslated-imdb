Although I saw this film changed years ago, its effect has never been left to me. Stephen Rea's sign of the advocate is deep and moving. His pain for the ability to stop death is valid. Everyone who has been beaten is incredible by Sutherland who tries to take care of him and provide police channels to coordinate their efforts, for civilians x. Every day when we are hit by the stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the stimulating work that people are trying to find killers.
