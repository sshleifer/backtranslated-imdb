Good story. Good Script. Give it well. Good acting. Directly directed. Good orientation of art. Nice picture. Sounds good. Good editing. Good everything. Put it all together and end up with good entertainment. Its shame is that there are not enough films of this caliber being done these days. We count ourselves fortunate that the writers / directors like John Hughes are able to make their creative sounds heard. Every time I see that I watch the film for a third or fourth time and still find it quite satisfying I see that something about the film is right.
