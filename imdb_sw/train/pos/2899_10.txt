A very good sense of humor I do not believe how people can think it is worthy of 1/10! I hope this film will be displayed everywhere so everyone can be happy. If you have the opportunity, see ... Do not miss There is a place where chief executives run and sing "Happy Birthday" and "pay plinplin" (the song of Argentina to children (I think ... can also be South America, I don't know). These two songs that have the same music ... but people don't know that ... it's just a net! I tried to write this in Spanish and English, because it's a Argentina movie ... but the page will not allow me :( I hope you enjoy!
