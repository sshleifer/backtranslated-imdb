The choice is the movie of Chinese people, or triads in this case. Every two years the election takes place to decide on a new leader, and for the first time it seems to be higher among Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know, "Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was Judge for Full Contact!). Although Lok once succeeds, Big D refuses to accept the choice and may at any time be able to be recognized as a new leader. Unlike any Asian film I expect in collaboration with gang groups, this is not an action film. It has its time of bloodshed, when necessary, as in Goodfellas, but essentially it is just a very effective drama. There are many characters, which are very difficult to track, but I think that comprises quite. The 100-year-old Baton, a symbol of the power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things sit. And although it may seem that the film ends 65 or 70 minutes, there is still a great surprise waiting. Simon Yam was my most famous character here and type an anchor image. <br /> <br /> The election was the winner of the final year of Hong Kong film, winning the best performances (Tony Leung), the best pictures, the best director (Johnny To, who made the hero of Trio !!), and screens The best. It also had a selection of movies, editions, films (which I liked), and three more displays (including Yam).
