Because of the bad review - or the collapse of the car - I feel able to get a gear and make a transmission to give praise because, and to perform services. I don't know people have a license to say it was bad, almost directly. <br /> <br /> Few for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This film has taken quite a long time for me, despite any mistakes that may be. How many films can say so? There is no even bigger. Because of the simple Cluster you do not know if people will come out of a life threat, which takes the whole movie. Yeh, the suspension was firm, and on some territories trouble their work. Not just a TV movie, but all the movie's action; there is no point where it leaves, or loses, or speaks. It's hard to make a film like this, always the road. Just Duel, or Speed, is this that I remember. The best thing in them was also a constant tension. It is not bad: Justice is better than ever, and others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is out as sometimes it can be - or seems to be - a little awry. Something that doesn't seem right is not necessary. Your first sentences are not correct, but I think the leading actor was right in being in this film. <br /> <br /> STUNTS is more awesome, especially on TV. Their only failure can be seen, and again, it seems, slow speed. But we all know how the Grand Prix Car cars can mislead. I wanted to be BEGINNING said, "led by a true story." So goes how much is it true? You know only the base is. Usually "according to true stories" makes me think it must be true. But maybe that's my fault. How to get this: The best view of the recipient will provide a tow truck to lift back wheels. Just a few inches do. The cheat driver can do this at 100 mph. It is amazing that they did not mention a car - or electrician or electricity - to see if there is a way. I hope this comment has made it clear that this film is a tragedy. Or at least neutral. And help it to be effective run. <br /> <br /> The image quality is slightly soft on DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would be winning out after a child, but the wonder that the idea of ​​saving life was dealt with carefully in other interesting conversations to wipe it out. I think we know why. End of the film. The suspension of unbelief explodes the top window with the child.
