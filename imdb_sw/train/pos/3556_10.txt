Oh, this is a glorious music. There is little trouble - Frank Sinatra is said to be very much like the Jewish Detroit Nathan, though it seems only on "Sue Me", which is a Jewish song. Unfortunately, film designers decided to cut one of the best songs from the show, "Marry Man Today", and change it with the image below Sinatra. For these two errors, the mind is otherwise positive. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing hard beans, but it takes away. Stubby Kaye happens to his work of Broadway (written for him). The language of Damon Runyon and pleasant and humor comes in a very good way. This is an over-all-position-I-find list.
