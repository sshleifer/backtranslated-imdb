It ran the 8th season, but it was the first, early 1959, and it was the last, in the 1965 season, were shorter than 2-7 seasons. CBS chief William Paley dissolved Rawhide's production after 1 show season 8, in September, 1965, because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil grace, who was on the run after the season. The year 1966 CBS advertising, on January 4, 1966, was rerun. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide didn't change the color of the film's filming last season? Most of the great western 1960s had gone on the colors and 1965. CBS was broadcasting in autumn colors, for most of their sitcoms, but western as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last time the head of the web series switch colors) September 17, 1966, for the Snap decision period.
