The House of the Spirit is a fascinating story of the complexity of the family, South American politics and the highest natural authority. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel for life and all his doubts. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of 1990s. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a good couple suffer from family acceptance in tribal culture. Glenn Close, like Esteban's sister, gives good performance. Portugal is a suitable alternative to non-tropical countries of South America. Clara's house and ranch of Esteban are effective and when the US cars are increasingly better for the war after the war.
