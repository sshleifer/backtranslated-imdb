Titanic is a story of a beautiful but successful love of love that takes place during a rough trip on an incredible ship. Author / Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this film about a love story of two people very different and combining it with a real Titanic event that came up after a glitter on April 15, 1912 and demanding thousands of people lost in the icy water of the Northern Atlantic. The two lead in the film is great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good couple of screens. DiCpario and Winslet also had a real chemistry together which made the romance that ultimately flowering among them that more reliable. Both showed real talent when this came out and both have continued to show only in their films recently. Some of the support grants including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are very similar to their characters that help them bring them to this film. Story of love, action, suspension, and special effects are very great done at that time. Fear of the situation in which the characters appeared were real because it happened really to make the majority of them live this life and the death state. Stimulating speed was slow and was a long time but all the films planned for its errors are small. Titanic makes a great movie of the date that ensures that other girls cry around every time they look at it. The fact that this actually happened to the movie will make you feel sorry for all life lost when the Titanic entered the Atlantic after blowing ice. Overall Titanic is a story of hurt heart on two people who fall in love during a bad-fated ship that brings life and unique exhibitions from the cast exactly DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely makes this movie worth while watching.
