Robot jox is a very small film ok some sets are bad and acting is not great but special effects are very good for the film of this size and age. You should remember that this film is more than 10 years now and it was made very cheap in 1 place so you could get to the worst part. So just sit back and watch the cool film with big big robots in it.
