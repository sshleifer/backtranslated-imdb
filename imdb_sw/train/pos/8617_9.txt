"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and other people evicted from Japan's civil war for some reason, and many killings continue. It is on the top of the sword against the machine gun that eventually brings interesting results. The basic score is applied to the railways you can expect from the head; The original-out-of-the-antics antics ("what this flying flying box"? etc. etc.), "not we better here" talk and finally a great battle. The latter is evidence that the film does not support itself completely, killing more than half the second as a weapon of the battle of the battle of the Chiba; The face of the person is fully expecting from the head but still will be able to exceed its skill and destruction. That is one of the most unique of the warfare of its time and does not shine despite its extended height. <br /> <br /> Chiba offers a bad performance like Iba, a good leader but a person who eventually finds himself arguing with himself moral values ​​as a slower effect has an impact on it. Surely this is one of its best cars from its rough CV. For the last thing the two worlds have had similar effects each should ask whether it was a bit of nihilism for authors, because they seem to ask "is not better at that time?" But this is perhaps a little reading inside can generally be described as a great entertainment entertainment two hours (almost) non stop.
