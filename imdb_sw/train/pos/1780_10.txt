My mother and I were going home from the East to North East (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little inquiry to attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I don't know a lot about the film so I thought this might be a little education. The first movie we saw was this, ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I don't know about you but I thought this was beautiful! I am from Texas and where I come from we don't see many photos of motion so this was a good surprise. My mother insisted it was very violent, but said that I did not know a lot about what she said but this was a beautiful picture. I was shocked by the fighting system. Also, I am a great fan when good people win so I was surprised when the women of Rome killed all the bad people. This was true beauty. I don't know when it is released on the video but if you get a chance you should do it. I think you will be very surprised. The word to the wise though, is violence and there are many who say the words so that you don't want your children to be awake. It's more for adults.
