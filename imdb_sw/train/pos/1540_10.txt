This is a wonderful film. I can't remember the last time I saw the movie of this Swedish sweep. It is surprising, it is sad, it is compulsory, and most of all is a piece of life of the little Swedish city. It breaks the clichés, and sits more. It lets you feel connected, not just for the main characters, but for all characters. <br /> <br /> Big girl city reflect back her roots, her small town, celebrate the birthday of her father 70, crossing the way with people who have never met in several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new way. In the middle of the story is the relationship between three sisters (for different stages in life), who are not very close. Or at least do not know how close they are. <br /> <br /> One important factor that makes it easy to connect with people in this film is cast clean. First, I am more happy about the fact that there is absolutely no so-called 'A-list' Swedish actors in this film. Usually there are a few of the participants who are able to find their way around every major producer in Sweden. At this time the production company has managed to put it real to the executives who actually seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you need words to express feelings. <br /> <br /> The text is also very interesting. The discussion is more reliable, and compared to other Swedish films from the previous year or two, it is ahead for miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you do not know, you will never think that this is the first time to write and guide the film's length feature. I can't wait for her next. <br /> <br /> When you start looking at this, you really want to see it.
