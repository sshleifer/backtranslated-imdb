For the beauty of seeing this picture is the best! I did not know that Technicolor came out very early. Although I didn't like the last, the whole movie is amazing and it makes me like I was in North Africa. Healed is the best and Marlene Dietrich is with great and of course she is delightful and I just love her in this flick. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I can't get over the settings and sets ... hotels, palm, desert, it's all there ... villagers also bring "Beau Geste" to hear the film. Surely they won't make movies like this again. Do not fail to look at this classic!
