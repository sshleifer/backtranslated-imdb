The words of the daughter are poetry: "I can't go another year. I get to the hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in the sea of ​​leaves." "The marble faune continues ... it just gave us a washing machine." "I am blinded by this recent thing." "The milk and cats reduce a little too long." "The little nest of the mouse, the mouse hole I would like to be better." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... it is my pleasure." "This book will put me straight, like the color." "One must always do everything correctly." "Where did you come from hell?" "... bring my little radio I need to have some professional music." "I am your mother. Do you remember me?" Mother / daughter relationship is given in this very beautiful film. This is the Mother's Day film.
