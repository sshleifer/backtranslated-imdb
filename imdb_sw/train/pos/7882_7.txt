"Shipping Ahoy" was probably made to show MGM talent. The film is an enjoyable journey to the maritime road on the way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, when the country was involved in WWII. This was typical of the studio label, which gave the movie go to the entertainment of ordinary public weight as a barrier during those difficult times the country was alive. Eleanor Powell beautiful looks at his ability in a certain number of music where he clearly shows that he was dancer counted. The red skelton also looks for a direct part and not very clowning, for it follows good Mrs. Powell on a ship that brings to Puerto Rico. Bert Lahr is incompetent with a good opportunity to show that he was a good man. Gray Virginia is also seen as a happy, unhappy girl. There are good numbers of music with Tommy Dorsey and her orchestra, which one sees, among others, wonderful Buddy Rich, who has a few solos and Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. Frank Sinatra is also seen as the first band singer, supported by Pieders' Pipers. This is a prestigious journey that should be saved by fans of this type, which MGM has completely controlled.
