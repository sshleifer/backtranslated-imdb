If you have children or girls who love action, adventure, preference, and imagination - without the need to enter a song every twelve minutes - then this is a Disney movie to you! My children liked every minute of this film, and it must admit that I laughed in many sounds in the movie. There are no sappy songs to get through the information described strangely, and all the characters are recommended and known for their own right. This should drop as one of the Disney "classic" because of its beautiful landscape drawings and its non-stop excitement!
