This is a movie called 'feel good', however it made me sad somehow. Why? Because I had talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at a sports college, and the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer. <br /> <br /> And soccer is a red line in this film. With the struggle of young people have the expectations of parents. The English-Hindi girl and her parents, and their family relationships and strong family relationships, and on the other side the English family and daugther who dresses as a young man, and plays soccer ... the uncomfortable mix of her mother! This movie also shows the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in the UK. It is about believing in your dreams, and living your own life (where we have heard before). Paraminder Nagra (beautiful women!) plays Yasminda, a girl who does not like boys, new clothes, make-up and things of a 17-year-old girl. Unlike her sister Pinky, completing the opposite of Yasminda. It is really necessary, to see how a beautiful girl is fighting the traditions of their parents, and finds her fortune finally. With the best music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, with Indian beat songs. <br /> <br /> Good to enjoy, but if you, like myself, have ever played football, above, then this film will make you a melachonic.
