See, this is the possibility of one of the best American films offered by others in the world. Dislike this film is hating independence itself. I remember that in the early 80's it was a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatens us all, and nuclear destruction was almost uncertain. Among these chaos came the hero, Ace of Stroker. Ned Beatty's performance in this movie showed that he was no longer a kind of beat as a desert desert striker. His victory is an inspiration to all. Existing screenshots between Burt and Lon shows a clear comparison to Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this film tonight!
