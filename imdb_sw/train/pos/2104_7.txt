Who does not know Largo Winch in the French-Belgian-Luxembourg trio (three countries that French "BD" or "Dessin√©es port" are published largely? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which itself is a change of novel series, was supposed to be changed on the screen. After the first and failed test and TV show, the real thing begins. First of all, and that's what most of the fans have not received, the purpose of this movie is not effective to deal with the comic book series. Some important parts, characters and previous actions are not available. Movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a class 1-fan of comic book, I must admit that I was really surprised. Actors are good, that's the situation, though it may seem very fast. Therefore, I recommend this film to all interested in financial / political advice, but it is obviously not a substitute for James Bond or Jason Bourne's series as I can read on the web.
