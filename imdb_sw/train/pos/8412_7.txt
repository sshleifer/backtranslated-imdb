Those involved with the film camera at the beginning of the century must be able to think some of its potential very early on. This is a good story of a playboy who needs money and angryly tells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the spirit is his two times and must fight him regularly, breaking his life away. There are some incredible events and people are going out and, in fact, the events when the two are at one point at a time. The central part is a bit, but the Faustian Story is always in the view of the viewer. The one thing I need to mention is the general inability to people in the movie. Also, many of them walked away from many steps that would have at least been given life for that. I began to recognize this film about 25 years ago and finally I was able to see it. I had no desire.
