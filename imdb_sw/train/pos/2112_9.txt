In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; there, says his colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). Two do not live with work because everyone has fallen in love with an invisible pen. Watch Ernst Lubitsch directing these stars through inevitable is predictably satisfying. The best is a small plot involving the shop owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek), who accuses his wife of having something. To hire a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms his 22-year-old wife and has sex with one of her small employees. Morgan, to realize hard, "He didn't want to just grow up with me," and the helpers are helping what this film is alive. Ernst Lubitsch (James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut)
