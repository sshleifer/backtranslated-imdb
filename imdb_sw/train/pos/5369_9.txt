Spoilers Good In the near future, the Arnold stars like Ben Richards, the guilty man was forced to play 'The Running Man', a TV show game where people keep moving to try to escape brutal death at the hands of 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to die eventually and up to Arnold to prove the wrong system. I've never read the book of Stephen King, but this is a good film regardless, one of the best of Arnold. He does what he does well in the role of man, giving them death and incompatible remedies. Classics is probably 'He had a real pain in the neck' after spraying a boy with wire wire, and 'He had to be split!', Referring to where the sequence had hit someone in vertical. Dawson is as irritating as a TV presenter, and all 'Stalkers' are a suitable camp. The action is violent, but its film action. That's sure. The film is very fast, and for 90 minutes it should not be welcomed. With the Starsky and the Hutch of Paul Michael Glaser for the assistant, and made after the achievement of The Terminator, this movie has been seen to be just an extraordinary car with no meaning for Arnold, and for a very long time . But today, anyone who watches many TVs can see how the film is approaching reality. I can't be surprised if I hit the TV on the "next future" and see the show is not far from this. <br /> <br /> In this memory of suppression, I must however suggest 'Running Man' to anyone who likes 80 years, Arnold, stupid or violent acts or just a good film to work. 9. 5/10
