This story is told by water. No distraction. Flash pieces are made within now for seamlessly. Composing was very good. Young Yaara appeared very much as Ya'ara would be looking at that time. His blindness was done in the lobby. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a good job in getting various actors working together in this story. Style is very good. You feel like you have Yaaara and Talia going to the sea to the coast. English publications follow the Hebrew script very close. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" two names are very suitable for stories.
