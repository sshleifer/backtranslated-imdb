I lost this film from a friend I do not know anything about it, and it became a top document on a trip on an old ship in the vast sea. Thor Heyerdahl had the idea that the ancient Incas in Peru could travel thousands of miles along the sea of ​​Polynesia, based on certain issues found in two areas, some of the ancient sea vessels that we know were there, analysis of sea currents and The wind, and the skill that Incas did, in fact, travel to some extent signed in the sea. To measure its hypothesis, Heyerdahl and its crew build up as close as possible to what the old Incas was available, using only balsa trees and other available materials, and from Lima capital. , Peru, trying to reach the islands of Polynesia, a distance of 5,000 kilometers away. <br /> <br>> His theory, as well as about the history of the past, is impossible to prove to a 100% point, but the coverage of their journey provides powerful support that he is correct. The film is a little more than a picture of the photographs taken during a 100-day trip, but it's a detailed description of the content and trials that they faced. I often want to have the Academy Award winners easy to find, and this from over the last 50 years has continued to be interesting and informative if I'm sure it was the time it was first released.
