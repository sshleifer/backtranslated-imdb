I know that earlier, this film was not a boxed box, but due to recent mobile releases (many that have been written verdically, low-down, useless, "but blonde-chick-and-matter- what" drivel ), The Saints All Saints, certainly in this context of sorry you deserve a second opinion. Film - as a book - loses its connection to some historical history, but it shows the unique problem of the United States set apart from the exclusive American institution of human slavery, and its negative consequences (and surprising, and touching). And he deserves to play is Robert Ri'chard of a young man, beaten as a leading leader, Marcel, whose real interest is the most common if he puts at the beginning of his 'coming age,' just having trouble very much for what turns out to be his true knowledge in the ways of the southern country of Louisiana, at the peak of the antebellum period. When I saw the review with Richchard (frightened) red, I expected buffoon, fop, caricature - I was so happy. Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, late Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy provides a clear picture and wonderful skills as actors in the back winds of buttons, jewelery, "Creole" aristocracy, and Haiti's revolt from this story of human suffering, hatred, love, family, and the concern of color in the society that seems to have gone and somehow still exists for us.
