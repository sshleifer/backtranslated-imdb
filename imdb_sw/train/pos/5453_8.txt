With ten or less words describing this film, Barbara Stanwyck is very interesting and beautiful! The film is amazing, except for the end of the end, but I would like to rest of it however. Barbara Stanwyck, however, as platinum-blonde gold-digger is amazing. He knows what he wants and follows! This movie is beautiful and excellent!
