When a child's problem with the problem of self-boxing and self-respect is not a new thing, the story is being lost here while the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. Diana has trouble at school. He can not just stay away from fighting. His father always throws us. His brother teaches boxing in the gym and one day he decides he also wants to teach. It will be easy to call this film "Rocky with girls" I think. But that's not all that pertains to. Stories really benefit from the main character being a girl instead of a boy. That way you can cope with more problems immediately. First the problem of disbelief because she is not a girl, and then when she comes to boxing exercise because she is a girl. It is also a story about how a purpose can change some lives. Good things can help you grow. I don't want this to be heard carefully, because the movie doesn't really feel, but what I'm saying is true. Michelle Rodriguez is also very good in leading. It is a real shame that she has been stuck in a "tough girl" that is happening now, because it is not actually part of it in "Girlfight" refers to. She is certainly a female striker, but instead it is a very good time that makes you shine. So this is probably your most common subject of the head and deviation, but it has raised the way over the crowd and Rodriguez 'performance. I rate 7/10.
