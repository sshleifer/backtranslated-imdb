I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. The difficulty of believing this is the start of Mrs Blom's conversation, it is very good to do. The enormous scope of characters can be out of the novel of Anne Tyler, ie they are decorated with the backdrop and the possibility of the future, no false explanation, bursting surprises with humor between self-concern and truth especially if not destroying the world. If you have seen the "Best Youth," you will find out how well-presented attractions are short-lived, even if the story goes faster. I believe that this gets distribution in the United States. I live in a modern film market, but we rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
