Cor blimey. This film was very surprised as it is the center of comedy. Billy Zane is stunning as a central character, and everyone can play directly for comedy being natural and easy. <br /> <br /> Sound sound is very good, and the set pieces are fun to see. I recommend that you watch this film with a group of colleagues, a few bottles of your choice tool, and be prepared to be surprised and very welcome. <br /> <br /> This extends to the full range from the film as Program 9 From the outer space which is located in the traditional "B" film. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of people who participated in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself engaging in an area where Zane reduces under action because there is no clear in the close ballet style. All small, and all the best for it.
