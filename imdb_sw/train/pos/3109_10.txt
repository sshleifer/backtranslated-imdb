The third and final film of this trilogy is finally a clear glass. It's a more political film than open entertainment. Jason Bourne finally knows who he was and he would discover and remember the torture that was presented to kill his former identity: he actually killed a man who ate his body. But the film finally reveals that all of these have been organized and planned by the CIA within the Blackfriars program which has also been exposed to this film as a goal to eliminate all American citizens who have tried to prevent the entire community's control by the establishment of a small group of people. Who was the most important CIA officer until 1980, when he came to the vice-president? That goes along with what is said on the Internet. Then it will certainly thank Jason Bourne himself but the great man who can bring the truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision about CIA is the woman and the woman gets the Senate to participate in the general inquiry. Woman and Senate; read my lips. In American politics it is a battle in the media and two media is important for any presidential campaign: it's music and movies. Currently Hollywood and more intellectuals, scholars and professionals use the film in general, with this particular film, to create an idea for the public that salvation will come from the woman and from the Senate. So go see the film. It is a good entertainment and has the final scent of the period and a big change that awaits and others are waiting, but no one can pretend that it did not come: the only step is to know how deep and big it will be.
