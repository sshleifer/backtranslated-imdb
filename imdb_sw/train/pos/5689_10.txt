First, this is a review of two sets of discs that gathered together with the DVD's "Wonderland". These two movies were included with the lease, "Wonderland" and Johnny Wadd's document, completely forbidden Stories created by "Boogie Light". That is the story that the participants involved in the adult business of the film were more than young children who could do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything other than a hateful hate. This is surprisingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" made for "The Godfather" story and many more gangster romanticism lots. <br /> <br /> Now, what is my anger when you look at these movies, and maybe irk anyone who saw and loved "Boogie Nights", is how fools and gullible who need education and modernization can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" of course John Holmes, who is different from "Dirk Diggler", did not have the quality of redemption. Holmes was a criminal man who treated anyone around him, was used to his self-esteem, and was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal massacre in Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The movie shows a great deal that the "Boogie Light" was , and reinforces Linda Lovelace's business of brutal and horrible business which is known as the adult entertainment industry. This is needed to watch, both on the "Wonderland" DVD, for anyone who had a good comment on the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
