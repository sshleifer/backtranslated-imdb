Paulie is a fantasy of a girl littler or maybe her memory of what her youth was like growing. Tony Shaloub performs a useless performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can't find a good job in America. He becomes a friend of the parrot alone doing the laboratory inspection laboratories in a science laboratory laboratory. The great doctor is a bitter person, like Paulie, who can speak and fully understand the language and learn, dismiss the Doctor, who then expels him to the lower levels of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. Paulie repeats her life with Marie and how they lost each other. The effort begins to connect Paulie and Marie, just over 20 years has passed. <br /> <br /> Movie is approaching, others will say predictably, and Mikail reunited Paulie and Marie. The story is closed with three entries of Marie, where you can make your own choice. <br /> <br /> Great family film!
