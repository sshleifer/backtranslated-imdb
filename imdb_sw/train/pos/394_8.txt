This is a wonderful return from the director of the movie mastermind, Tsui Hark. It is one of the few movies that should come face to face with the face of Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the time the movie started, there were back stars in every edge that <br /> <br /> came from a good style. If you are a false science or a Chinese military "geek", you will have a great love of many 3D effects and real weapons produced by computers. There, comes good performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung who plays "Sky King". He is collaborating with Louis Koo (Red) who was very interested in his "wing" wing who tried to attack the attack. The fighting of these actors had skills in every way. It's not just a wonderful event but it has a hard story. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of stories / themes or just "beaten into pieces of destruction" and even described as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer cannot rely on looking at Dragon Ballz and other similar cartoons to understand this film. Others who are famarialy and "Wu Xia" movies will have the best appoach. With respect. there may be one weakness that can be seen. The blow that was sent to the enemy in the final battlefield could be more and more serious. In spite of all this, it must see it.
