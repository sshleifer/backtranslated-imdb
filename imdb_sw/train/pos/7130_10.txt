Well, before I saw this film I was not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how I was wrong! I thought this was one of the best movies I watched for a long time, a real classic family. The story of the young evacuee and his new father, this shadow takes all the boxes. I have never read a book (perhaps that is a good thing and I was so excited about the film) but on the side of the story, I can't think of any bad points, so I scored 10 out of 10 (and it's not hard to ever think anything permits high marks! ). When William announced 'I WANT MY FATHER, GET!' I was stirring my heart (anyone who sees it will understand, I'm sure). True heart, and certainly was recommended.
