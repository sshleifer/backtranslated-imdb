I saw this film first when it was dropped at the current Trio Center a few years ago, and recently looked again - without advertising - on Sundance. I was first surprised, and I saw even more involved in a second look. Yes, some of these distant groups - the definition of hysterical of Amos Gitai is seen as tuberculosis - but taken together, 11 09 01 is a total success. Excellent display: The final part of the Shohei Imamura, which modern critics like Mick LaSalle with a tiny-scale mansion is described as a 'terrorist' attack, but now stands as a celebrity of war; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening opening that can combine a greater understanding of the 9/11 victims and concerns about Afghan children; and Idrissa Ouedraogo of amusing children of amusing to Osama Bin Laden - hunting almost as a great job and success as one of Osama REAL. The part of Youssef Chahine is as good as a failed attempt at least has guts to remind listeners that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are the foundation of the creation of foreign US and CIA policy, and though the study of Sean Penn's behavior seems to be unhealthy, yet a piece good film making. All in all, looking at the key, and more comfortable than Oliver Stone of the World Trade Center.
