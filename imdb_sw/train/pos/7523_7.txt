I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival of 2006 and is a movie and not a movie since it seems to have been shot by HBO to be displayed on the cable network sometimes this year. This movie offers Page as a slave and discipline fetish pinup and B&D stag film actor who had enough talent to be a real actress. The page was slightly higher than that and the film takes some of its other functions for example but it is not enough to sync the function of the pinup icon of 50. This film is allegedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It's a shot in black and white to feel the 1950s. I have a book called "Bettie Page's Legendup Life" which has many beautiful pictures describing the work of Page and I must say that this film produces film, and Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these popular images correctly. Mol himself and the time of Bettie's black and contact lenses of black color is Bettie Page. It's not just that she has a Bettie Page look but she has a smile and a character of her personality that came through a less perfect camera. And his body is close to the copy of the Page possible. From the terrible. Myths are thin and tabloidesque and certainly would have been very good. But this is a good movie TV. I would like to measure the level of 7.0 level 10 and recommend it to watch when it comes to TV.
