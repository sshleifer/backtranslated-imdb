The thief in the night should be better from all the end times. I have no clue that people complain about what people say about when they say that these movies are afraid to accept God. They just needed to find excuses and blame the thief in the night. Listen! These movies do not describe just one of the most likely stresses, but they also enjoy watching their humility. In fact it's a low budget and that's very obvious, but it's not all very obvious at first look. I did not have a clue because I thought that many of these films were made in 70 years included a small budget at all times. The thief at night tells the story of the little Patty Myers and the proud who lives for what comes his way, until her husband, and all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone told her. At first, the movie is not all around it until you grab it. What leads up to show that everyone else around him is to be Christian and believe in Christ, which usually happens to many people. Everyone around them once knew and loved would go forever, and the one left behind is the one who accuses all people but themselves. No one can blame themselves because they are always the same. <br /> <br /> Like these whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be adults. I'm thirteen, and don't see me moving, especially since I was like Patty before accepting Christ back into my heart. For those who have not seen, if you want a little bit of everything on a Christian movie instead of a stereo-ordinary everyone is a negative movie, than you will enjoy a thief in the night. Don't remind us before trying. Something new is good every time. Trust your own nature.
