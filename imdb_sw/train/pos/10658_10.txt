The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years if I couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It is absolutely true to beat me. I was a holiday with aunt in Ft. Value, Texas and I will never forget. Now, 48 years later, my daughter tries to get a copy of this for me to see as an adult. It has taken a lot of research to find out what the film was but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally managed to get a name and expert on it. I was so happy, but it gave me a lot of fear! Jaqui
