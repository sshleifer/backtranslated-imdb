Japan 1918. Ryu's 16-year-old story begins with her father's death. If it is later revealed, all her parents have died of tuberculosis. In this very serious condition Aunt Ryus has arranged a wedding with a Japanese man in Hawai, who know only from her photo. With Hawai's arrival it finds that her new husband is as big as in the picture, and that she lives in a very humble environment near the sugarcane she used. Ryu was never used for hard work on the plant and desperate for her situation in her new home thinks of running. He soon finds that he has no place to go. The friendship of Kana, the female female worker, gives hope and new strength. This picture depends on the actual events between 1907 and 1920, when thousands of Asian women married men in America, who just said from their pictures. This image is very unknown written and implemented. The area is very interesting. This film also includes Mifune Toshiro in its last appearance as Benshi (the silent movie star). This film offers some awareness of Japanese culture here and at sea. You must see!
