One of the best music, which is not available and it is necessary to see from time to time. Delicious! Acting, especially with Ron Moody as Fagin, is very good. Dress is beautiful .... even those with shabby. Two kids who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderful talent. Oliver Reed does a good job showing Bill Sykes where you can't help but he hopes that he is coming to a terrible end .... he did. Created is carefully selected and stands. Oliver can hold himself and be interested in My Lady Fair, Music Sounds, Oklahoma, etc. Film for the whole family.
