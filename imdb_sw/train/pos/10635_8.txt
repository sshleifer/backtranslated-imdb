I enjoyed photography, textures, colors and often, different from one view, lighting. What was missing from me is the story of consideration. I saw often closed, damaged badly and sometimes hard to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one to 125m. It may be reduced and the heads don't help you. I am grateful for any films that are running from the Hollywood mold but this has helped me to be depressed. Miss Gillain was the brightness and performances were fine, I wanted more talks. If anyone would like to see another film associated with this, try 'Hideous Kinky'with Kate Winslet.
