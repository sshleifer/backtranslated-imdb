Not many films were made about the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA), but this is one of them and it is very good. Just a fun movie. Most of the films take place in the Navy of the Navy in NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin play role). Wallace Beery has a popular player but Munchausen as the Head of Ned Trumpet, the experimental test, which many of his stories have often found no one believes. Half of the fun is around the end of the film when events start to prove that most of his foreign stories are really true. Put it at WWII, the main centers of the plot around the horn of the pipe to put the widow of the village only to end up having a father-son's relationship with a child of a disabled widow, Jess. He said he cannot walk without weeds for doctors, the Great Pipeline closes several conditions and the Navy flight surgery helps restore the foot of disability. Jess continues to join the Navy to become a runner, flying blimps back in Lakehurst and dealing with a new set of challenges. Well done, even though not the Corny Hollywood talks were passed through the technical consultants, and the possibility of Beery Walking. Otherwise this film gets a good score for technical accuracy, and it rarely looks at Lavy's Navy operations. Cash Register Register Scene, the exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future interest Cathy, is a hoot completely.
