Few of summer summer summer were actually sent to the place with a robot. And oxygen in the ship was short-lived. They had to send someone to the space station to get gas tanks, etc., etc. First of all, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But it gives you a feeling of anything possible if you put your heart on it. It's amazing to see those small actors who are still looking at the same time after many years. (I saw this film for the first time in 2000, it was held in 1986) There are very few people in the film that still work on Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was great from outside space. It doesn't look untrue. It's about 2 hours long, it comes so fast that you won't see. You know it's not true, but it's only available to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
