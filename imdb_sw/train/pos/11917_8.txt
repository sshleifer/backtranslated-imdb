Yes, the archetype of a simple but powerful movie. The end of the end when all the people in the field climb up and people raise their hands give me whenever I see it. That's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as a single and sad child who has been disappointed with anyone and anything in his life. How he works with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is funny and exciting. Very good movie of the family and - I concede - the last corny fun end. But hey, no matter what, the movie continues its basic quality to acting good with inspiring themes.
