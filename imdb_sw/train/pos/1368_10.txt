Okay. This has been popular since I was 14 years old. In fact, I don't see again many times a year again, but ... This is not an old-age film that requires more meaning or good news. This film is FUN. It's dated pretty, almost passed, but Parker Posey is very brilliant that is amazing. If you want to be charmed for 90 breakfast in Tiffany's, attended 90 raves, or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't worry.
