While the best music is available, what was about me on this movie was an unexpected chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as a composer who had built, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. If you paint a high color, a confused artistic type (loud cry due to its most common roles as lost criminals or Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's attitude seems like he could not find his way out of bed without help. And the help is Starbuck, played by its normal droll player and Oscar Levant. After leasing the character of the Crosby as its author of the song of the spirit, Rathbone tells Starbuck by saying, "He makes all my ideas for me." This course goes back (or more) Rathbone, who is too busy to reflect on where to hit his second song will be from. As another consultant said, who knew Rathbone could be very funny! Worse did not have more opportunities to show his comedic talent.
