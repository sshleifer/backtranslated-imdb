I was hit on this film about four years ago and a French actress who was my performer. For the first half I was sitting in my chaotic seat at New Beverly hall in Hollywood, I love this film, hate it and even hate French actress. And then ... I don't know what happened but I was pulled from the film in a way that I had never been. And this included the fact that one of the managers broke and they had to make every change in hand. I was in the playground for about four hours, but it was worth it. I believe that big movies connect you into the world, making you a part and then letting you talk to your friends about coffee or drink. This film did it. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
