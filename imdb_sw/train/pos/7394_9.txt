This Chinese movie has made me feel similar to the members of the culture I am not and is far away. In a close Buddhist technique, the film helps one relate to each other's character, and the joy of doing simple things. All characters are brilliant, and Xu Hzu offers kindness and wisdom, but also dangerous and meaningful. Er Min, a lost brother, shows us that the mind and wisdom are not the same, and that wisdom comes from the most diverse people in this world. China different, this is far from Chinese originality, however, has a number of humanity and originality of different species. Get it. Not eligible.
