Two years passed and especially everyone looks different, some good and more. I really enjoyed it as I did before. <br /> <br /> Some of the errors they had though though changing the Joker now do not have red lips and it looks like the black hair more and the black color students, hes still spoken by Mark Hamill which includes me guess. They made a hat hat to be more white than that she was becoming more like a plant with Catwomen looks very different and not like "interesting" as she was in the original. <br /> <br /> Though dress like Batman, Batgirl, Croc Croc and Scarecrow looks bad, especially Scarecrow. It is not as dark as nature because Batman doesn't work as alone as he used it. They often work with Batgirl and Robin's new, Tim Drake. When NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the constant rescue. Batman gave a yellow mark with a black wing on his suit and looked like he got a little more but still hitting a ton of ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as originally because of some of the characters made but the story is as exciting as ever and the conversation is still an elite. "Over Maximum" can be one of the major events of Batman however make sure you watch. <br /> <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
