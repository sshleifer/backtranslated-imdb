John Boorman's "Rescue" involves four villagers of Atlanta cities riding under the quickest Cahulawassee? The river is about to be lost for the construction of the dam and flooding of the end of the land? Four friends emphasize different characters: a popular passion for sports that has never been insurance in his life since there is no special risk in it (Burt Reynolds); a passionate family member and a guitar player (Ronny Cox); an insurer's insurer (Ned Beatty); with a quiet person, considered by a child who loves to easily experiment with his pipe (Jon Voight). Does it follow the search of a male night against the violence of natural hostilities? It is also a good code of ethics on the civilized men engaged in the dark laws of the desert? <br /> <br /> By shooting, this amazing adult adventure certainly has some really lifting scenes?
