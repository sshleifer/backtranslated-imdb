I watched this in July and even with Christmas themes, I've got to touch and sensitive. It is not for a person with real intelligence as it is full of fantasy and good moments which sometimes worthless. William Russ did a great job like Hank. I just found in the remake of Summer Long, Hot Summer where you played a weak character. But in this, the words in all his eyes, as Hank focused on his experiences, was wonderful and compassionate. Valerie Bertinelli was beautiful and beautiful as usual and is widely believed in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always bring a smile when he appeared in a number of important events. There were many special events, including which Hank knows who Max was actually in his life. Not for everyoneâ€¦ especially those who don't have 'good feel' movies and this is definitely one! If you would like everything to be perfect and meaningful, avoid this. But I think it's good to review it again, why I put it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs :)
