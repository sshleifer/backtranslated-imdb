I can't understand what fans of the kind did not like about this film. It was very fun. Special effects were extraordinary. I generally agree with the comments and voters of IMDB, but not this time. I waited until it was in the home video I heard was another reason I would not enjoy the film. I believe the special films are needed to appear on the big screen, but again this was not. For me the film asks to compare two films that were given at the same time. Blair Witch and Mummy. Both movies I thought were bad. Blair was probably the most horror movie of all time. Mummy made money groups and it was a clean dreck. People liked to be special effects. Movies like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like a funhouse ride. Well the same Mummy model was a B ticket on the E-Haunting ticket.
