Gritty, a gutsy display of the history of the world war 2, which many of us in U.S. they were / did not know the idea that happened. I'd like to have this on the video. Only shown on t. once until I knew it, back in the 90th 90th. The great actors around, I would like to see it again. Series of top series.
