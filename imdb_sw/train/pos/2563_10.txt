I have seen several comments here about Brando using the South accent, some of which they saw was a mistake. When this movie was made, discrimination and discrimination was very strong South. Crow Jim's rules had begun. Civil rights were within it. What? This could be a personal definition of a community, a Southern love person and a woman of another race? The same way MASH was the subtle enemy of the Viet Nam war? Any comments? <br /> <br /> Other comments were made about Myoshi Umeki "cool". Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not want to show an impression on visitors. There were strict social laws, especially for men who met women without women. The Americans in Japan were very alien to this culture, and an amazing attempt to meet women was shocking to women. One Japanese article was a smile at the time of shame or anxiety, which many American servants took as a sign that their development was used. Also remember that at the time represented in the film, Japan had just failed, and the forces involved were treated with a rejection. I think Myoshi Umeki gave the faithful performance of his situation would. Looking at its partnership with American actors returned several records of my own experience in the country. I was able to meet a pair of good young people who, after persuading them not to be an ordinary American man, taught me their language and culture during my country.
