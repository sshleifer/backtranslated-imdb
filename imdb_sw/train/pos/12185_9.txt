IN SHANGHAI is a confirmation that the great expert Orson Welles can lead the movie "normal" if he wanted it. In contrast to his other works, more artistic, this film has a small amount of crafts, and almost no esoteric elements. Besides, of course, the last location in the mirror hall, was widely accepted as one of the major events in the history of the film. It alone is the cost of leasing. The wonderful surprise did good work for Rita Hayworth. His work at the beginning and middle of the film is very good, made other actors like caricatures instead of characters. Even Mr. Welles great.
