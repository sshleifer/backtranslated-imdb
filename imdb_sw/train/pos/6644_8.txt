After many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' noted 1979 book "House Next Door" has finally been done. The result causes little from the novel which, especially in the first trilogy story is understandable if it is not as good as a TV film, all of which includes and really very good, not like the book, one of Stephen's recommendations for the King and my mine too. Over time more and less restrictions like the release of exhibitions, all the wealth involved in the original part of the three-part house of destruction can be observed and encouraged, especially a sharp revelation near the end. However, the whole cast is well in this story of mindless intelligence. There are a few unnecessary unnecessary but a growing state of fear has been developed well. In fact, one of the most disturbing events involves the painting of a house and a neighbor's amateur artist who tries to look at his bribe on the canvas. Make sure you read a great novel.
