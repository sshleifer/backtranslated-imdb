Gandhi my father is like watching the book, the shape and shape you read (with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and for that matter Kasturba Gandhi. So it is very little known about both and this movie spells exclusively. The head has lost though, his movie as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as well as about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya performs perfect justice for their duties. <br /> <br /> The movies are like flying years. They come after a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father, is also on the internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle of independence. <br /> <br /> Watch, if you like the best movies.
