This is the best series of its kind I have seen throughout the year. I can't help thinking it's just my fortune - series I would get 6 events (and more than a year) and a regular stream of cookie-cutter soldiers shows you never get rid of incidents! The reasons for New Tricks succeed are many. The labels are beautiful, with a mix of superb characters, acting on the airplane, with a mixture of comics and works performed treatments. Stories are not all that they did not remember, but that is not the reason I look like this. <br /> <br /> The theme theme is favorite, and we had the desire to find it not available in any published edition. The great things, the BBC- intellectual triumphs on sex appeal (apart from the youth no constable there as eyes lolly, and even if it is, can still act!).
