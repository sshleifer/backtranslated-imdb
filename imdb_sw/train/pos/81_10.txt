I watched the McCoys meeting and was delighted to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now it was strange, because I always watched the show growing up until the TV said that there would be reconciliation I was so excited! The only thing I couldn't think was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Luke little) were not there. I know that Walter Brennan is dead. So I logged in to my computer and tried to find out about them and found this website if there was anyone out there who can tell me what happened Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Luke bit I would like to be grateful !! The only thing that I could know about Michael Winkelman was that he had been born in 1946. This show was worth and values ​​every show gave a lesson to learn.The shows today do not have From the whole there was nothing better than getting their knowledge they would meet So it is not possible if anyone can help please please. Thank you Glenda
