Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American movie is very big. His legacy is a group of movies that will live forever, just like "Shop Around Corner". This film is made on other non-popular movies and playing music, without charm or beauty of Mr. Lubitsch himself, with a definite version. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. Their characters in this movie are an example of how to be in movies without almost being seen to act at all. Both stars are as beautiful as pals pals that do not know of someone else, but who eventually worked together in a single shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> Because these classic movie works well is an amazing help to hit the studio set together on the picture after the picture. Here, we have Frank Morgan, who plays the shop owner. Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing amazing work in making us believe that yes, they are Budapest. That is why these films will live forever!
