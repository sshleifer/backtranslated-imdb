It should be against the law not the experience of this amazing show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like that. <br /> <br /> Murphy goes for 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults most popular people including his own "family". Among the people who get for murphy are: Elvis, Mr. T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've never been so laughing at anything for my whole life. I mean, when someone doesn't know who Mr. T is, but still laughs too much for Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. When I saw the show I did not remember who Mr T. had but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that makes it more fun. That is why Eddie does - he can make such a good idea that it doesn't matter who is trying to hell, it is still hilarious. And above all, we learn that Murphy really is a very good singer. Please check out.
