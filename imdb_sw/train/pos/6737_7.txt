LAURA director and two (1944) were appointed by the strong police: Dana Andrews is a criminal child who is a partner to cut all ties with the past but cannot put his hostile ways to be interrogated by suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is a guest wife of his defendant, a decorated hero who is involved with the city's racketeer and 1 Nemesis of Andrews, Gary Merrill (who himself was an advocate of Andrews Snr)! As always with Preminger, this is a well-designed movie with a series of opening opening features and is made up of beautiful and well-equipped Karl Malden (as the head of Andrews'), Tom Tully (like taxi-taxi-father taxi father) and Neville Brand (as the General Director of Merrill), and also known help comes from Craig Stevens (as a lover of a loving wife), Bert Freed (as an affiliate of Andrews) and Robert F. Nolan (as an outdated Andrews). He has already warned and the last to do his own way or perhaps, Andrews's concern and imitates Stevens for several hours after the murder of the police (in this case) Merrill's bad songs; However, after Tully being the principal defendant (for the time Andrews and Tierney are involved in a romantic relationship), the soldier goes with himself in the position of Merrill completely wanting to get a gun and 'shape' player to kill himself for his own murder! Obviously, the protagonist is a hard character and Andrews increases with the challenge and characteristic of the first level that is usually run by the domestic house of Fox.
