OK. I am interested. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this amazing film was done. Still looks similar to now. I remember that the cinema here is quite clear, and the fake snow on the streets for the last days. Often, when I go through Shrewsbury I see a road or house and it will remind me of this film. The Scrooge of George C. Scott is a more realistic character than other screenshots. His physical appearance is not normal. Scott is great and strengthening. A person who finds those younger than himself to be inadequate. <br /> <br /> We all know stories and quotes. The book is one of the most interesting works in English. And I don't believe there are many people who don't worry who could say that people can't change and redeem. This version of the film shows all of this very well. George C. Scott can be a American but he plays an active part of English with amazing skills. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version I would like to encourage you to do more. It is usually found in a very small amount of money ... or do you mean?
