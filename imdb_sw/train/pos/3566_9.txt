In 1954 Marlon Brando was a hot actor after his exhibition on Streetcar Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra was no longer hiding on the cash screens. But the picture of Sinatra as Nathan Detroit at the same time, has helped establish the Sinatra and its fans. <br /> <br /> It is a great version of the screen to play great and the choice of heads and support players are strict. Think of a movie where Brando sings? This was his only role to sing just as he showed Sky Masterson. In addition, the woman leads, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repeating the role of her step as a long-term partner of Nathan Adelade), putting up her efforts. The special expert goes to the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely), and with all respect to Eric Clapton, there is no version of the Rockin 'The Boat even approaching Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who would continue to qualify as a television producer such as Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does the wonders of "Harry The Horse," BSPulley is as good as a shock and talk "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers its quality as "Brother Arvide". It's one of the music to enjoy seeing, good comedy, and find Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Fortune Being The Lady's Night" with the brothers ... "is your dice"
