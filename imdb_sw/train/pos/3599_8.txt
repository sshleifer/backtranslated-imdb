This movie is a real gem. The plot of the plot is described in the first 3 minutes, the characters have compassion and openness, their intentions are completely reliable. Talk is clean, and oh so it's true. The situation is unique to the characters and not always placed or hackneyed. Until the peak, that's it. Then it's like the film left on one little railway and it was a little hokey and impossible. But I don't want to discourage people to watch this film. The first 3/4 of them is very strange. I gave 8. There are wonderful displays here. Check out this movie.
