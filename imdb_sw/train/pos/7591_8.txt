Music chaos but it is mainly according to Stephen Chow's ceremony for his inspiration. There is a kung-fu of magic, college romance, sports, gangster action and right melodrama for stopping. Production is excellent and speed is so fast it is easy to get back to many mistakes in this film. The child has been denied near the basketball court. A homeless person brings him to the Shaolin monastery in the center of the city with a special kung fu guide where a homeless person has some kind of illiteracy. An old elder teaches a young man but ends when he tries a special approach in the guide. School is taken by the master of phony kung fu who is assisted by four wacky experts. The new master is getting bad at the moment the 20-year-old boy is not pretending to hurt the master's slow and throw him out at night. A boy is found throwing a garbage into a basket from an amazing distance with someone who brings him to the gangster club playing arrows. This leads to great clashes, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery's house and the decision of the man to turn the boy into a basketball mood. This happens in the first 20 minutes and much of it happens in the first 10 minutes. In addition to a very brief description of the story the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until you go to the film. The person who uses the boy is described more quickly when the third third is over. The plan does not follow the new world except for the stage of the film's fraudulent action. I am sure you can easily imagine how dirty wacky will show up to the end. Side effects, photography and stunt work are all over-notch and make for a fixed plot. Stephen Chow has the best command to write and plot and text and this film will live in its shadow but that is not a good reason to ignore it. It is quite entertaining even to terminate-end. Recommended.
