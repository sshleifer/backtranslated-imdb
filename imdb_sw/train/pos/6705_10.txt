And not because since his days on "Clarissa Tells All" that I've had a bit of crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who when this show was popular was already in its 20 years, but still able to get young roles. "Sabrina, a young witch" was Hart second after flying after his "Clarissa" days. According to the comic diagram, Sabrina Spellman is - the imekisia! - a young witch who tries to balance his magic antics with the needs of everyday youth life. She is assisted in her efforts by her two aunt and a black cats as she goes from high school, university, and finally to her work in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is a heart show & soul. "Sabrina, the youth sorcerer" is very moving and very exciting, and it is a shame that it has taken a long time to realize how great it was. I just want there were new events that we can all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
