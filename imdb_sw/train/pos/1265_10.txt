Hi .. I see one reason for my favorite movies of Sean Connery, it's a long-term psychological thriller and a beautiful show from Cast, especially Connery. One .. Also has one of the best scenes in movies at any time, when Sean interviews Ed Harris prison is just wonderful .. enjoyed this very much and I can't recommend this enough, really miss this! Listen to the negative comment that says the last 30 minutes of drinking, it was like an edge like all the film, I just see the reason for a very interesting movie.
