I've seen this film once, on TV, and it has never been repeated. This is wonderful when you think of the garbage that is repeated again and again. Usually the movie for me is a source of amusement, but this is very frightening to me. Do not read the experiments of the practice in your observation of the FILA FARMING! He asks who in hell you are any people. Automatically provides their true identity. The girl who pretended to be deaf to destroy and deceive her says "I am Lilith, a sorcerer who loved Adam before Eve".
