I think this is still the best way. There are others, like the Rock "brings pain", and "All Men" of Allen who are hilarious; "Damon Waynes stand last" is also funny through tears - but this size does not make mistakes. All jokes are funny, and during 70 minutes is perfect. Long enough to last 20 years. I just love how he empowers the audience to be totally and unblocked. I am a fan of an elite and a young man who watched a lot of Jim Carrey growing, looking more comic laid back is pretty cool. Not put into a group with Ellen and Newhart, but something that you can watch if you are locked. Thank you Eddie, God bless you.
