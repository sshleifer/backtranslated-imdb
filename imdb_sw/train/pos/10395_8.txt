The strange thing of Arabia. The former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played with the Black Narcissus Sabu) to seek the love of Ahmad, who was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is a very difficult time here. Always builds new adventures for heroes. Personally, I have found Ahmad and his king to be a little boring (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed four in credit). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actress, makes a good villain, and Sabu is very happy as the head of thieves, who once finds a genie in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson as Sultan of Basra, the father of the king. He collects awesome stations from all over the world. Jaffar strikes at the hand of his daughter and the horse-jumping horse. This may be like one of the great children's films at all times, but special effects are very bad today. Children will certainly laugh at the pictures when Abu and the genie are on the screen together. And the incident with the big spider is very visible. Although most of the younger generation probably think that King Kong seems to be bad at this time, the animation of Willis O'Brien's motion is a thousand times better than a bed in a string that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
