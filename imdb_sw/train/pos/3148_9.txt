I love this show. Period. I haven't looked at them too long, maybe just six months or more, in fact, but now it's my popular show and maybe it will be for a long time. I love all the characters, unless I don't care very much for Donna. I don't know exactly why. I just ... I didn't get funny, and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actor. Other than it, I find all well planned. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the parents of Erics, were very funny. Topher Grace is also a good actor. Unlike many fans, I did not really hate the eighth season. I still look, and it makes me laugh. But, compared to the preliminary season, its ... it's not good. Randy is awesome. The end was decent, nothing wonderful, but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. I have a fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of its hilarious events, in my opinion, were 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey', and 'Streaking', but I love every part I have seen now, which is many of them, I think. =] Star 9/10, I would like to recommend. =]
