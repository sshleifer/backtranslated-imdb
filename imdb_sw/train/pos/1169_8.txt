A powerful, powerful, innovative force of vengeance for revenge. Also cheesy, of course, and frequent cheesy too. It reminds me of a lot of great heat because it has a plan to take revenge on just one event, and a girl comes close to the good side of a man because of such a bad habit and a bad person. It's sad no Gloria Grahame but it's so wonderful that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Is there anyone who is as good as Alain going around with a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? Yet he is quite tough and cold cold. No one today can touch him - though someone like Jude Law can try to guess. Hard for any girl to look good with him. Music was funky and perfect and there were very good driving cars (and this is not my cup of tea) - especially one of nilly one willy in the forest. People also encountered their effects in the creative and blood style, for example in the cruncher of the junkyard. But more than cheese, the general environment was affected and skilled. More creation, excitement and beauty in the "forgotten" movie than most of what I have seen recently.
