The first was beautiful and original. I was not a bad movie / bad fear. So I heard the second one was done and I was looking at it. <br /> <br /> What exactly makes this film work is the attitude of Judd Nelson and the script sometimes clever. A good script for the person who wrote the Last End movies and leadership was the same. Sometimes there are instances where it looks like made by using a home video camera and watch-testing. <br /> <br /> Great TV-making movies. It was worth the lease and maybe bought it just to get a good sense of uerie and look at Stanley Judd Nelson to do what she does best. <br /> <br /> I advise the new look at the first before the good look, so you just have a idea what Stanley is like to get a little history of history.
