When I saw a dentist, I thought it was too cold. But this film is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory events as a dentist has many gory events. That's why it has a R18 rating. It is on the dentist of beverly Dr Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheat on him with the farmer. It's better to go to your dentist "before" you will look at this. But if you do not want to go to the dentist already, then it is better not to look at this if you are left to go to life. The dentist has revenge for the blood I have seen. Who has ever seen a movie with a dentist (Spoiler) removing all his shepherd's teeth and cutting his tongue without anesthetic? Flick total surprises, but not for everyone.
