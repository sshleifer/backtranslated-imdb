I have never heard this film until I came to an accident when looking at IMDB. I found that it has found a lot of negative reviews of how much of the color. Of course this means I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised if it was whipped really good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and laughed more than we had in most recent Hollywood comedies. This is an independent film and as it shows its (sex and dating) feature without the usual fakery of mobile. I see that people's opinion on this film will depend heavily on their experience of life. If you have never written or dropped many places you can't get this video because you can't meet people like these characters. If you have, you will understand many situations shown here in comedic style. The latter was also good, as it had not shown women as useless, helpless, romantic sex against many Hollywood movies.
