The patchwork about 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (one first, for example), sometimes he was saying to Americans "we have had more deaths than you, and you by hand killers" , sometimes really weird (but with a symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (a private couple of couples in New-York, showing that our day-to-day "problems" is not necessary), Shoei Imamura (amazing, with the power to fight the war in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, usually hope for Africa despite the horrible day of misery day, and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intelligence, pro-peace, having moral problems to accept US policies in Arab countries) I am really happy to see that many Americans liked the film this. It shows that we (or they? I'm still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) still interested in other cultures, able to interview past and present actions of our government, as we should in democracy.
