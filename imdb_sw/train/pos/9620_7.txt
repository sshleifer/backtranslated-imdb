There are many "Hollywood" movies that are currently being done not only to watch, but also to life in anyone, nothing. In fact, movies should not necessarily mean meaningful, but it's good to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about the stories of "human". I will not give away this brilliant film, however, the screenplay is certainly one of the most complicated and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32 year old buff film too! Worst of the top ten on my list of favorites, which include: In water, Sunset Boulevard, and Black Narcissus, just for name. This movie "moving" should be one of your favorites too - that is, if you have a heart!
