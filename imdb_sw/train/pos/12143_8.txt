A talented film, the best film of Doctor Teacher (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it from the original VHS and I haven't seen this film for 15 years but it's still as good as it was back. Acting was bad and dubbing was worse but it is a character that makes this film (and many old Chinese kung-fu movies). Choreography is amazing and storyline is basic. I have never seen the 36-room shaolin but I know the same film but Gordon liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr The return of the 36th judge is played with different characteristics. It has a great value of comedy and kung-fu brilliant.
