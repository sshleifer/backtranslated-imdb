Mr. YoungLincoln is a poem, a beautiful film that takes the story of one of the most respected figures in American history. Henry Fonda had a hard work to show historical pictures and at the same time making him a perfect human being to take care of them. It is probably the best performing actors. See how he left the lynching group.Alice Brady is a wonderful in the role of the simple woman of the farmer. For many of the characters from the judge to the audience are given many folksy folksy folks that differ from the major experiments available. But I have been used quite because the humor is a trademark of Ford. Help section with Ward Bond and Donald Meek is very good.
