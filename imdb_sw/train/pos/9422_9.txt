When I found Sir Alec Guinness's death, this is the first of his many films I thought of seeing again. It's a good droll of the film's views that even provides all these years. And Guinness helps pull the charm in every shape. His eyes and face are the same as a white suit wearing. All he and the film should be considered to be the stars of life.
