It is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as co-stars, and cooperation between the clever Oscar and OCD Felix is ​​common. The view where Oscar considers the two days, leaves the little room, and returns to get Felix and the two girls who cry out are pricelessly funny. <br /> <br /> For any fan of mind comedies, The Odd Couple is "going out of your way to see" film.
