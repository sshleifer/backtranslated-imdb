Yes, the plot is not very available and very thin. Yes, acting makes from the average to destroy. YES, it has been done many times before. However, what we are concerned about is a film that is not suitable for this fact and pretends to be no more than it is. In fact there are some instances of previous death and tension increases in the movie. In addition you are not more than a few minutes away from gory killings. I encourage everyone to watch this film with an impartial eye and see it with what has been set; Awesome, awesome amazing flick and tune of the second theme to no.
