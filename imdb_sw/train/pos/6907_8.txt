This movie is fun looking. If you liked "Dave" by Kevin Klein, you will get kick out of this. Imagine "Dave" has gone to South America as Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor in employment, chosen by the national head of the secret police of Parador, to replace the dictator, Alfonse Simms, after having a heart attack. and die. Noah is created together, assisted in his position by the old dictator, while trying to prevent Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters is also seen as the American Mimigr√© who turns out to be the CIA. It is also a star of Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. There is a wonderful short time such as the body of an old frozen dictator for frozen year, and the last area, which Sonia Braga, who has a bee that stimulates the blood of Dreyfus's blood appears sometimes in white white, and nary smudge on it . But all in all is a great romp.
