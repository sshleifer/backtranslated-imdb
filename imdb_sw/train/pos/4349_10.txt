Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son's unexpected position. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is very surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left his father. his three are trying to get Muriel when ben and his father go to see a farming house that is selling. Not at the end of their journey. Their roadway turns out to be a long-term treatment session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is a director of Thing About My Employees (2005) .Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and has done a wonderful job. Talks between Ben and Sam are wonderful.And he worked with the script for twenty years so it's not surprising this beautiful Who would be better to imitate the father than Peter Falk? No one, I can tell you that. And I love stories why Paul wanted Peter Falk for that part. Peter was an actor who made his father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. go fishing.And how the old guy hits the slightest game in the pool and then beat him with a stick.The movie is often very funny and I laughed several times. But it can also touch regularly. You can't tell any better story than told here.
