I thought this film was very interesting. I watched this film with my wife before I had my first child. So, I didn't look like just family entertainment and I was still very happy. It seems that many comments say that this film is not being grounded, there was an unexpected plot change and that the movie was predictable and awesome. If these people were watching this film expecting to have a religious experience to do so, then they were obviously disappointed. This is just an animated movie; no extra. If you want to see this film just to sit back and allow you to welcome it, you can't despair. In closing, this is not the best Disney movie has made, but it's entertaining and I don't understand the bad reputation that has received.
