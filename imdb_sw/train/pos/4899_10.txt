I am so happy I came to see this video in the shop. I was looking for fun movies and this was a real gem. I loved being a film, a story of love kind, did not have some of the most beautiful twenty signs; rather, it is a story of a beautiful sixty-one, who used to be twenty and somethings. It is a good, written, and wonderful story made by the wonderful WWII music band that is also cast. It also has a wonderful surprise in it for lovers of the Scottish castle. I left an exciting and ready to look again, which I did several times more before opening it. I strongly recommend it.
