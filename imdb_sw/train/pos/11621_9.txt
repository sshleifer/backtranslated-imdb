I was bored one night and the Red Eye had and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies for a long time. I mean I just entered the movie was just brilliant. <br /> <br /> Stories are new and different. <br /> <br /> The movie also has two main titles in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. Acting is just a talented and you get a feel for people in the film. It is only good, it gives you a growth and can also make you feel relaxed. I just love how the movie was made well and not available. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is something unusual. No more and no less. <br /> <br /> It is a good thriller. Overall, I enjoy the Red Eye so much that I can watch it regularly. <br /> If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I Give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> Great movie
