This is one of the movies I have seen so often that I can mention more. Some line in this film do not fail. I am very happy to overthrow him and fall during the drink, go out to a fancy restaurant and a part with moose. I don't know how many times I've got this sequence but it's funny every time. From that time Arthur gets the role of Susan's father for a little and wild, you are very good to laugh at all times. I remember looking out-takes about a bit and a midwife. Declined as I thought it would be like. They were all laughing hard it was hard for them to be a film. The end of Sir John Gielgud had a wonderful addition to this. His character, his one liner and how he used Arthur were all similar to hilarious. It is always a time to whistle when he gives his head and hat or tells him he is a small child ____. I laugh every time I listen to "I will grow" with the following verses.
