From beginning to end, I cut the real hard on the entire movie. It is interesting that "Groove Tube" is the most popular movie, but it is still the raunestest, of all the comitic skit movies. For 73 minutes, humor, extraordinary humor never stops! Just think about how all this improper childhood can help you enjoy a simple life! By the way, IT is better than the Central Comedy or any show of the greatest time! Do you own the favor and garbage of all wine, lazy movies of comedy in takabasket! Better yet, say the box office manager you want to "Groove Tube" back to the big screen!
