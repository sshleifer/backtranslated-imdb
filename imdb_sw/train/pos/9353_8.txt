REIGN OVER ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Burrows Saffron, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. Sometimes it affects and sometimes an ideal cycle on a lost person who lost his family on 9/11 (Sandler in its best role since "Punch-Drunk Love") who is reseting with a former college student and friend (Cheadle to continue do an interesting job with every role so far), a good dentist who seems to have all? family, wealth, happiness? but he actually sees a participant in freedom and sacrifice of his troubled friend. It is written and led by Binder (who is a star-star as an old friend of Sandler and a working accountant) and the same part of humor and a true film film works best when two stars show a screen until the last action is coming in with The film-of-the-week effort and destroying the solution of existing things.
