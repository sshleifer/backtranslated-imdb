The man on the house is a realistic state of play for every word of the word. Comedy deals with a character called Robin Tripp (played by Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, living at home with two women named Jo and Chrissy. Interestingly, the party was held to charge for their old age. It definitely ends when he enters. <br /> The man on the house was an arrow before Cooke and Mortimer photographed George and Mildred who had 2 characters who were home owners for Jo, Chrissy and Robin. The two characters could have been a mixture of man on the house with Mildred (late and much of Yootha Joyce) that he found especially to find the best lines of the series. Regular behavior was Larry (Doug Fisher) a worthless person who had always had a scope and had come all the time when he wanted to borrow something (and never come back). The version called the third company but does not match the position compared to this original farnier origin. Thames emerged in producing comedy on the person involved flat with 2 women during conservative but they should be concerned if at the same time ratings suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to look at the good old bit of comedy and strongly influenced by the sharp script. What? Comedy of modern compassion can not reach this high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the web DVD
