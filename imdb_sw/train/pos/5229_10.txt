This movie has received bad ratings from almost everyone who voted here but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If you are in movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id should care for you with different angles. Yet I still love this film and everything about it even though it is a kind of "kiddy" this is one of the few movies I and my partners have been looking over over the years and mentioning any time possible. GREV MOVIE. This model should be the number 1 of AFI because its class is very high. The only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was made for a television film on the station that no longer exists. So I don't know how to get this movie, id like to buy for dvd but I don't get anywhere. I have yet to hit it from the time you were first, you can come up if you want and watch yet I can sleep. This movie comes out and that's all you need to know.
