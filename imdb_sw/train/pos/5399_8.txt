The last Gosha movie of the 1960s. "Tenchu" (judgment of heaven) is a word that the faithful to the king weeps when killing the enemies or "traitors" for that reason. Katsu includes his genuinely submissive attitude to the ignorant politician in the name of the country's pride. Anyone who asks a politician is called a "traitor" and is a target of murder. One of the best photographed films, many shots are amazing text form, color and light. The events of the fight are constant and bloodless and brutal. The blood becomes part of the color palette Gosha uses its pictures. Interesting and disturbing. While personal stories are easy to follow, history history is hard and when the basic history of history at this time in Japan will be very helpful you can fight through the film without it. Few restrictions on the film are music tracks, length and Katsu's time to chew the scenery. He has an alcoholic area that is leading to the film but in fact it is a proper manifestation of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Limitations but one of the great films.
