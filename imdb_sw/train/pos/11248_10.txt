Illudere (meditation) comes from the Latin verb 'ludere' (play), so you have warned about 'spy game' as a stemmin of cruel and still intellectual (!) and free, whatever it might be; and still fascinated by the system of apostasy and loyalty, raw materials of any relationship, from personal to community; After, many years ago, I was easy to finish the book was a revelation! At first I was bored if not in an amazing style of text (in fact I started LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not very good: he has made the choice to redeem his weaknesses by following the way of faith and friendship, or not?

There is no Smiley here to emphasize humanity's good qualities in 'service', or at least there is no point in identifying him in this case. The BBC has done very well with this series from LeCarre's novels: executives are excellent, such as sites and sets; Of course the script here is a brilliant adaptation. Understand though, even if one can find it delicious, after the taste is bitter.
