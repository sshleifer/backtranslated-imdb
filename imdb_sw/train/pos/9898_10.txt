My 10/10 rating is only for fun and you think you decided that you loved the "Main Slaughter" even before watching it. Yes, it is normal to take revenge-years-after-dirty-prank, but how can you like some of the things that are so hard here? I have not been able to predict that the bathroom area in millions of years. OK, so maybe we can be worried and say that this film does not give something new. Yes, it doesn't. It's a kind of flick which the characters in the "Dial" may look at, and it has contributed to their rules about how to live on a terrible movie. After all, who does not like to see people suffer to do these things? In fact, it has a lower audience audience, as people are punished for doing what '60 years were beaten. But still, you have gotta love these things! So, for forgiveness to Don McLean, this jester did not sing to the king and queen!
