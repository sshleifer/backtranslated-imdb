I did not write a review on the IMD for a long time, however, I felt compelled to write this! While looking at this film I have found one review that encouraged people NOT to see this film. Don't listen to that person who doesn't know! NOTHI is a wonderful film, full of laugh and above all ... ideas! Are you not sick and tired of the power to feed this old bubble-gum movie? Sometimes the film NOTHING comes and gives you something that you have never seen before. I don't care if you like (even hate) the film, but nobody has the right to despise the film. IMD has a great impact on the features and no inappropriate inspections should be viewed as such. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't look at it. We have our own ideas and we will make our thoughts thank you. If my judgment is good, I would say that most people will enjoy this film as opposed to those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Use your little sense of eye candy! See NOTHING!
