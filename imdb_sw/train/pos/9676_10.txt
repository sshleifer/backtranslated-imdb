The movie was very good and encouraged! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie to each other. The movie was provoking me. Workers did a good job, and the movie was well played and done. The movie was about a little girl who had a parrot who called Paulie. Paulie had separated herself from her parents because they thought it would be better for her. After Paulie had so many people found him in the castle itself in the apartment. Finally the Russian man who had found a job as a minister. She had found Paulie on the floor and Paulie began to talk and tell her the story of her life. Finally the man helped Paulie to reunite with Marie (a young girl who raised Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
