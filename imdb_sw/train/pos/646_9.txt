A and a girlfriend who is now attracted to the relationship with SOB who has a long-term partner. Of course SOB looks very good, charming, etc. and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the character of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is similar to watching what is going on in real life while boys like to destroy the lives of our girlfriends. It is sad, and you know she will go very hurt, but there is nothing you can do. Leaud is a brilliant. Absolutely empty. Anything in it, she cuts the face and tells the story she thinks she will get the answers she wants. Two hours when Leaud and Lebrun love love, and the next morning he puts a record and, very interesting and pleasant, sing together to please him a brilliant. "What hell do I do here with this word" expression that comes up and the face in her face will be my long-term memory. It is a long film, but look for one to go, preferably in movies. It takes time to intervene, but when you get lost.
