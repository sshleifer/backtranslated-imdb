When the "girl" came out, the views were interesting, but I never seen. I finally saw it released on the video, and understood new comments. The movie is opening in high school in the middle of ghetto. We quickly brought to the student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has a bad ass about his face, and any idea about Diana that we can get from these words once he gets subsidies when he fights. If Diana is having trouble with this, then we meet her father, a kind of aggression for her own right; we certainly cannot accuse Diana completely of her view. But then the movie grows, as new ideas grow in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to avoid the worst situation. His older brother has gone into boxing, but his father will not accept it. Diana alone can decide what to do. Only the first few minutes alone I noted that I was on a false, non-Hollywood film, but a brief short of John Sayles in the role of truth has proved it. Even before you reach any swine screens, you feel like you get beaten with a face to see the worst life that Diana lives. And finally they come to the main story of the film, no return. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie. I will admit that using the box as a way to show someone trying to do something of his own self has become a kind of movies in many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think that did not work great and here. In fact, this may have led to that kind. Really good. It's not bad that Michelle Rodriguez separated himself from Hollywood movies after this.
