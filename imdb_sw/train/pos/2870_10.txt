This movie is wonderful. It has always been going to be. I mean it's really better then the maid's house falling in love. Walt really was out himself here. And music! The dream is to want your heart to do it good! What else can you say instead of awesome! I can't wait until a special version will come out will be very amazing! I can't wait to hear all deleted songs! This film has been made so beautiful and wise! It's good. How about a good mouse too! I know I keep saying these things again and again but hey this is a good movie! Woods was strict in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
