I watched this film by chance, getting curious and trailer on TV. I like when I find movies like this, a small story, tender about ordinary people. Even if the end is sad, "the man in the moon" has a special time, especially in the first character of Dan, and his innocent and pure relationship with the Court. That is very good, which encourages the story of love and the top three points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who has carried out his promises in the world of movies, a beautiful "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and a wonderful symbol by James Newton Howard, which is the soul of the movie. Its landscapes (which deserve the Oscar selection) have been very close and suggest that they apparently had changed the screenplay in music.
