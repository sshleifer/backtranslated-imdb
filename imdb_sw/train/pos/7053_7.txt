Do not miss the "War of War" for a very satire or a comedy of the full brainy of the inner joke for news buffs. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old screwball comedy, and includes conspiracy plot conspiracy, shareholders (given detailed in the enjoyment of John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and one way for one of the political content. You see, the political points of the authors of the film are things close to all countries already know it is true. Yes, we understand that the war-torn organizations are corrupt, incoming pigs, political leaders involved in them are many inept passages, and the American empire has never been worse and worse than it is now - but nothing is a matter. Here, all this noise is an environment in which they are - sometimes by way of mind - like the backdrop for losing secret, like John Cusack's character (hit -man and heart) tries to change his life with the help of a good journalist who did not believe (Tomei) and the Middle East star who wants to dismiss his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with the best quality of passion. Ben Kingsley appeared to be lost in his small section as the master of CIA's cruelty. That's all, and it works. It is very simple, but if you are not able to see the realities and you think the war is going well and everyone is involved it is doing good and no bribe with the Middle East people want our Western culture to take them away, then you may not find it as funny. <br /> <br /> To all others, it was a light comedy and a political edge.
