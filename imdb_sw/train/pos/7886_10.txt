Okay, I am a fan of a series of dreams and everyone says here that this is the worst! But not !!! What? Have you not seen Freddy's revenge? WTF! That was quite bad! Now this film is very good and connects the story of Freddy and it's cool that he had a daughter etc.. And then I saw it was in 3-D !!! I was very excited, remembering when I saw it on the DVD box placed immediately on the 3-D series. Many comics were in 3-D though as Lisa Zanes hand, Dream Demons, Claw Freddy (more than once), Lezlie Dean with a knife, Lisa Zane and Baseball Bat, hand of Doc, Freddy's head broke. <br /> I loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I would like the whole movie was in 3-D not just 15 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> That way is 15 minutes NOT NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
