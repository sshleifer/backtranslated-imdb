Being otaku from the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite creatures at all times. Considering time was made, animation is of excellent quality. There are no loops and the order in which art decreases for quality. Although the last part is black and white, it does not stop you from watching the movie. Although it has been described as "sappy," it should be noted that women do not accept in the same way as men. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that it does not need to reject the "eyes-man" approach to gain the respect of their peers. Seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like a 3-dimensional cartoon can get; His personality takes on the essence of a strong girl who appears for the first time to be a complete offender but at the end she succeeds by the power of her will. The only complaint I have is that mecha looks like teddy bears. Even Gunbuster uses "Laser Homer" and "Buster Shield" which is not very suitable (which is not much more than a high-cost velvety machine with a real style of Dracula). I doubt that the area was meant to be funny, but it broke me. However for all, I would like the Gunbuster title in the top 20 of all the time.
