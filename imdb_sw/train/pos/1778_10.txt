I just want to say that I'm so happy someone finally ordered the beans on this movie. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a horse of ignorance of film making. Especially for the student film! I just want to give credit to Spazz by taking extraordinary amount of time in service to get the same picture, and then REQUIRED IN IT! Most people I know do not have that kind of time, especially a few will end up reading. Kudos to you master! However, the cinema follows a narrow story that is very strange and just plain. I understand the backward idea of ​​creating a satire of the Angel of Charlie but why not employ artists like no feelings! Also, what kind of director works, writing, producing and also editing pictures! Choose one job and put your love into it man! It is very embarrassing because I hear it made a good film about a dentist. Again, because of the spazz to pull back the curtain on this film, people like you are getting a few.
