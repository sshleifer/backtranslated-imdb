Richard Linklater's spotlight on the beauty of the romance of the youth and the travelogue of Paris is one of the best 90 best-person movies. Julie Delpy returns in one of the ten-year exhibitions as a Paris player who spends a day with an Ethan Hawke visitor. The discussion (and there are its oodles) is sometimes more interesting and more valuable, but this picture of two wannabe lovers who make romantic, intellectual and spiritual relationships is full of exciting, amazing and incredible insight.
