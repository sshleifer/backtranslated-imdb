This is the film that gets better every time I see it. There are too many displays in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is happy, bringing a sharp relief of comic. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the movies, and his oil amulets are used well here. Frank Morgan, is happy as the owner of the head shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his usual manner is well used here. I really liked the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. It is widely believed in each group of its role. Two guides are the same, with Margaret Sullivan doing the best job of showing a young, neurotic, but attractive and attractive woman. <br /> <br> Even this movie is Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from its perspective, and the move around it. Mr. Stewart is more on the task of carrying the movie, and the amazing performance that you use in various emotions. Just look at Stewart, when he dismissed her, because of misunderstandings. He can show shock, anger, fear and shame that the disturbing event causes, so perfectly. In my estimates, James Stewart is, without question, a great actor of films in central history. No one else has ever been captured in a film that can convey the feeling to the audience. When he made this film, he still had much more work in front of him, however he is the owner of his trick. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts's best movies, and it is also one of the most interesting romantic comedies that you will find. I strongly recommend this film, especially for those who enjoy the work of Stewart.
