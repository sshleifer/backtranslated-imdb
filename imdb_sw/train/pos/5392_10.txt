Those women who work for a large hospital lie, with all its joy and sadness, are the place where LIFE starts. This diagram near this has forgotten the good opera soap, full of comedy and catastrophe, all locked in the life of the parent workers and their patients. The fact that this issue is happening shows the pre-Code of the movie. Aline MacMahon, head of the head, is the stabilization center of the film, the rock where every flow of water. He can handle any crisis or emergency, he is the best mother, sometimes the last, a friend. The MacMahon Community is a costly burden: Loretta Young as a criminal accused released from long prison term; Eric Linden as her fearful husband; copper Glenda Farrell as a dame who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a mature mother for her sixth match; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as skeptics, sympathetic and Frank McHugh as father-to-be unhappy. Children's Movie will recognize Bobs Watson as wee tyke who wants to see Stork; Paul builds as a fearful man who promises to act as a 'little soldier; 'Gilbert Roland as an Italian man who had trouble with Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty doctor who loved to adopt Farrell's son - all were not accepted. There is a little fraud in the plot - some mothers are very obvious; Farrell becomes a drunkard in Ward but none of the workers are seen; A psychiatric patient can walk around with love - but this really only adds the value of film entertainment and makes things worse.
