This film may be uncomfortable because it has been made for TV, but it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Film and its actors won several awards. It comes, cheerful, and will find you completely. The story of dismissing a killer in a metal glass of Russia and people who are willing to risk their work trying to save the lives of future victims will be a compelling story if it is a lie - but it's a true story. I strongly recommend.
