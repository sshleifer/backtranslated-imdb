I saw this film and heard the author of the author, Juan Gerard, saying at the Santa Barbara Int'l film concert. I knew about it is that it was the age of 8-year-old boy when the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. Its / its part of the opening will bring you the "Cinema Paradiso" idea. In fact, the film is filled with popular films: Roulette Wheels (Casablanca), "Promotion" (Rebel Without Aause), Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. A homeless person (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to the Cuban folklore which often uses black man as a form of Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> What this film is the end of the dream. Gerard wants to respect his family and the center of the film that he loved all his life. This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real, such as the events shown. Gerard is an architect and engineer (with a popular movie partner) but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live that dream with Harvey Keitel became "angel" who believed Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel has a powerful screens like grandfather's secret and "secret". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans beaten. Iben Hjejle (Higher Honesty) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y only Mama Tambien's mother) provides great support in important roles. Of course, the first half of the film is faced with the provision of sharp lines, but continue. The last half is very good if the revolutionary events combine to the peak of delight, and trust. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is honest if he is enthusiastic and his heart comes through, in this first real effort. I would like to see it again, and hope that he keeps his work on the film. <br /> <br />
