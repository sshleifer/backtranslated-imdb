Real stories (held in Kansas in 1959) of murder (Perry and Dick, two former detainees who broke down a village on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks described the awesome and amazing book about the reasons that drove these children out of crime (What are natural killers?). Crime incidents are very cruel and haunting because of lack of intelligence and the reasons for what we have seen. The black and white cinema from Conrand Hall, the best country - a road sign of the road from Quincy Jones, an amazing exhibition in two major roles from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and the first time in a film of sad comment on The village at the end of their deaths. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and as a scorer of the planned screens) are chosen for the Academy Award. Blowing, guided and feared, one of the best films of this decade
