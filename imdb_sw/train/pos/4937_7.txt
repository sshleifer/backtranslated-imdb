This film is important even today from the threat of bio-terrorism, and the threat of superbugs, West Nile virus, and SARS. As an exciting thing, tension is very sharp. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more likely to be used in their roles. Internal features between Widmark and his wife provide good quality among the main plot. The actor in this film which many left its mark is Jack Palance. Its well-defined and external features seem to be very easy to lose a way to reveal a bright and brutal person under the face. The expulsion through the packing plant is amazing even today. Recommended, 7/10.
