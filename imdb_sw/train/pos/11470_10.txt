Everyone knows about this 'Zero Day' event. What I think this movie made that Elephant was not that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for almost a year. In the movie we get like them, laugh with them even if we completely know what they're gonna do. And that gives me sores. Because I felt guilty of being happy in their opinion, and I thought that Cal was a good person. Although what does it happen, you know? Even at the end of the film when they were about to kill themselves and decide whether they did so by a 3 or 4 calculation I thought this was amazing but I was still scared to see their heads hit. Of course I was. I had to be like. They were bad, maybe, but I felt like they were normal boys, that they didn't see the truth. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> That is, IMO, the main power of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone else, can plan extraordinary things, and that we can't even see them. This movie, as it was good, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't sleep now. There is still this little feeling inside my stomach. Butterflies.
