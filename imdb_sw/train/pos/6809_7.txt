This was a very good film. I don't know if this is considered a spoiler view, but I didn't want to take advantage. However, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads the Scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. I cannot remember the first passage he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. It is so bad that prosecutors did not emphasize the Bible today. What? Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court of the country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. The worse we have lost that view in America.
