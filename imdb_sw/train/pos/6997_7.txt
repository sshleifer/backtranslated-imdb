One thing is definitely ... you should watch this film if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad story and follows a character that lives with sin that should not deal with. The story is given to you instead of the usual details below so it makes you wonder what is going on. Finally the dots are connected to the performances. All characters were similar to Wil Smith made another good day at the office. There is no doubt that many ethical questions are asked but if you accept and buy in his pain then it is easier to accept what he chose to do. If you agree or disagree with no value. The journey takes you up is enough enough, if not to destroy. It is a good enough video that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would like to recommend this film if you like the kind that you should think and not just look at explosions and fights.
