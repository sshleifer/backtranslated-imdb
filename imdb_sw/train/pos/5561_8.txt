Indeed, it doesn't mean to say, this film goes just to appeal to a certain audience; ie stones and people with similar intelligence. It is said, if you are one of these supervised people, this film is LAUNA. In fact, I think it should be necessary for the head shop to sell its copy to anyone who buys their first bong. What the Holy Gray of Monty Python is of geeks and nerds, so this movie engages. I saw this film first 10 years ago or so, and I'm still missing every time I look at it. Jokes make perfect the life of the head of the pot, better than the last day of knockoffs as a half-baking attempt. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, to say; The film is more than a collection of different skits; as the film characters walk around Los Angeles in their story haze. Despite this, the film has a better sense of speed, and it is never worth it. Many people say about smoke as the best work of C&C, but we must say that the next Movie is better. So if you have a sense of the hour and half of the stomach it laughs, light, tune in, and let your mind be fired away.
