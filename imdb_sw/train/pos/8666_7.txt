Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking runner who goes to police or illegal gambling (for reasons unknown to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is the youngest who builds the beach hall and spends enough time hating Frankie. Being in a good place for a good time, Tony is arrested by Frankie and is sent to jail ... where it makes a bond that can be a very friendly, but it will do now. This film came under the head of "Frank and Tony", which is heavy because I see an alternate name is "Means Frank and Tony Tony", which would have helped to sell the film more effectively. I think that is an honor to "Maria Dirty, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film, "Violence Specialists", and I must say these two are well. <br /> <br/> Italy has always failed behind the Americans in their budget and production values, which is a real shame and this film. It is considered a "grindhouse" film, which despises the right for a b (or worse) movie. With a clean voice and picture, this can be hit Hollywood, I suspect. I have seen this very interesting story, characters (and actors) better than average and unlike "Quantity experts" the conspiracy is obvious - not many secondary characters. If you like Mafia movies or films you should give this test. The film about a group that actually came from Italy (what do you want more?) It's as much as you can ask. Indeed, it's not "Godfather", but it shouldn't be. This is not a drama, it is a light comedy, a heavy film action buddy ... like "Die Hard and Revenge" from the view of bad people. Okay, it's not true. If nothing else, this film has made me look at other films from the director and the code. Film instead of "New York Escape" (where VanCleef has "Hauk") and the traditional cult movies. It's more fun than discovering the classic lost?
