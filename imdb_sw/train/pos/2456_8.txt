When I went to watch this film my expectations were low, but I was very happy. I thought I would be going to look at the flick of the youthful spark, but in fact the plot is surprising and well done, it was very persuasive - especially from Melville who shows her talent in this film, and fighting events. it was - for a small budget movie - made well. I think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received. It is a film, which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not small children, because it has other bad pictures. Movies about love, and problems that may arise, when you disagree with your family tradition. Yes, the movies are like "Bend it as Beckham", but in fact I think this movie withers better.
