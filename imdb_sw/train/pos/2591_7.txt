Free and rather entertaining sleep on two very different brothers who are not all just called "forerunners of fire" (consider Stephen King's book interesting for the same book), but also forever for a woman who has more bad habits to be pyromaniac! Specific effects (especially towards the end), quirky performances from talented talented and well-sounded soundtracks are finally making "Wilder Napalm" treat only the film to watch ... if you can find it ! For personal note, I was fortunate enough (by saying) from a two-dollar bin to my video rental shop. (*** out of *****)
