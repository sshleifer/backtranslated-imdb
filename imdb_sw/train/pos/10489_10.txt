This beautiful comedy should be interested in the value of entertainment. Finds a good time for many voices, but if you spend any time on the 'side' of the songs you lose comedy when it comes out. Release of characters unites and is really reliable in their roles. How grace works to meet her dead male husbands had played well. She is a true woman. And, my favorite is a white suit of Grace hair that dresses. I highly recommend this flick for anyone who wants to laugh loudly, who is happy with a little girl or just wants to look something different.
