I made a reflection on it a day after seeing it. That to me is a symbol of a great movie. Wide Shut eyes had the same effect on me. I have been exhausted with these people who need this fun of Hollywood cookies. I plan to go to see tonight again to understand the best plot - but no matter what, the emotional message of the movie was quite real.
