A beautiful piece of children's cinema packed in the world of ancient Celticism. Putting stories near the famous Kels Book, believed to have been included by the monks from the island of Iona, from the west coast of Scotland. Explaining the story of a small student of abbots who leaves the forest to find Crom-Cruic, a bright horse with a mythology of paganism. In the hope of bringing back the lost today. <br /> <br /> The best movies are located in its' animation. The key in the bright and inspiring style of great complexity that makes it seem easy. From most of the artistic style of the Cartoon Network 'Samurai Jack' style of its creative and detailed design, Kels's Secret creates a world of Celtic creature living under the shadow of Viking invasion. The history can be very bad and the way of life has been shown a lack of authenticity but this truth is not so important as the film puts itself in the fantasy world and the innovation of Celtic-revivalist. The forest girl is adding to the wonder and in my opinion makes a picture, as it stimulates from the branch to the branch. It looks and disappears like a wonderful nymph with similar characteristics and stories of Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is completely treating. For all girls, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family movies. Do not expect to tremble but rather to please!
