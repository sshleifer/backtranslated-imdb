I agree with the comments mentioned above, I love the reality in this, and in many movies (not just movies on eating problems) producers seem to forget it. They take the daily problem and create a very large area and then come to the end of the film everything is perfect again, which I don't like because it is not true. It is not meant to say things can't be better, and not to say things are not in this film, but it does not use more than the film that creates all these problems, and comes to the end of everything of the film is perfect again. When people have problems eating people do not only accept and want to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how in this movie we grow with characters, we face problems with them, get better and worse, because they are part The most important movie. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders, and shows problems and pain, in a very real way, and I have loved it. I also love how it shows Privacy and people betrayal feel when suffering from eating problems, it's awesome to see how people react when they know, especially if they approve it. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and with one concern of my favorites.
