I have seen the trailer of this movie several times over, and it should say that Ned Kelly looks like it would be a good film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I couldn't take my eyes away from it (it was my thoughts really). Heath Ledger includes what he knows and what works for him, to pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who appears to the second division seems amazing. I think this movie will be hit, and will appear regularly my many people.
