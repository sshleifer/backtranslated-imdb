If the movies are to be trusted, Chinese ghosts are much better and worse than their Western counterparts. The three "Ghost Ghost" stories are very similar, but the focus is better and the details and colors are not a big problem. As always, humor is an important part of the film, accompanied, of course, for a great deal of importer. For those who have never seen a trilogy of 'Chinese GhostStory' yet, this film provides an interesting departure from the Western kind of horror / ghost; for those who have another pleasure to lose in the spirit of the Chinese spirit.
