This is about a mad scientist who builds a half shark - a man of half critter on an unknown island, then calls on all his old business and academic studies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but really wants his sharkman to kill them! Many aspects of GCI, goofy conspiracy elements, and newborns emerging in shirts to follow. All these monster monitors are looking for the same form, but this perfume causes humor (I assure people who did this had strong languages ​​planted on the cheek), not to mention newborn babies. But let's mention these young children - a few newborns of fire, in T-shirts, they are very dedicated. Someone in it undies at the beginning, another at the end. Thank you, thank you for making bad movies! The plan is full of goofy things, the boy runs on the jeep, smashing it on the tree, then gives everyone to the island from the helicopter. Yes, um, well, how we think about that for a while; we'll come back to you. Sharkman is a hilari - either a bad CGI or a similar boy with comedic in a ball suit. The scientist is doing a very good performance; he is evil, that's why, he is not worthy of forgiveness. Overall, if you want stupid, FUN B-movie, this one should work.
