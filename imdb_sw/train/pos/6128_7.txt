Yes this fear of B-grade. But at least the producers, directors, and cast are not self-made that this is manna from heaven. The plan is a corny, psychological psychologist on its method of execution is being hit by natural acid turning to a snowman. The snowman a.k.a Jack Frost then continues to beat the killings to get a small capital of the city who finally seized him. For a small budget that workers had to do with special effects limited, a lot of money appears to be used on the costume of a snowman. Shots of hard complicated are managed by cartoons or hitting the cakes away (shots where the camera goes off to hide details). It is not a child's movie and it is not appropriate to be confused with the Disney movie of the same head. If you allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not allow their children to watch this film. This movie has two claims of popularity. 1. Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) thanked her first role in the movie. The area where Jack Frost attacked Shannon Elizabeth is worth a few moments. 2. This film has the greatest shock of snow ever. The congregation is so bad that directors give evidence of jokes in the credit list.
