I have been saying that Batman's films were more beautiful than the live films. I have seen all the animation movies, but out of the bunch, this is the poorest, and instead of despair. "Mask of Phantasm" would rank as best, then "World Top", then "Sub Zero", then "Return to Joker", and finally this last column. <br /> <br /> In this new animation movie, there is a wonderful new batgirl in Gotham and Batman is interested in discovering whether he is a friend or an enemy when he sets on retaliation efforts. But if Bruce is involved with three young people, he begins to explore them and discover who is a new batgirl. <br /> <br /> Sound in this film is an unusual light based on many films that are bad and aggressive, which was rather desperate. Bruce works very often, criminals are used again from the last films, and while the action scenes are exciting, they are not really something new. It also does not have serious effects on other films, especially "Sub-Zero" that were heavy in drama and character development. Everything in the film hears that the recycled pretty and the help characters are charming but no one deserves to get the roots. <br /> <br /> All the time, I was very excited about this, I had an explosion, and the identity of the new batgirl is amazing, but this was not as exciting as I 'd hope / ****)
