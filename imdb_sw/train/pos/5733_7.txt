I will give you a number here and say I have enjoyed this. However, the cartoon is only true to appeal to those who have a very absurdist feeling. It is obvious that most people will not be able to find, such as a misleading nature. <br /> <br /> animation is awesome, but yes, that's why. The main character is foul mouthed, violence, and stupid. no redemption features. his wife screams and laments, apparently very clear to have a basic knowledge of communication. Many stories do not contain any kind of sure. <br /> <br /> but again, that's the action;) <br /> <br /> It is very short, so I would rent a replacement instead of buying.
