I remember previously seeing this film on Radio Hall Music Hall when it came out. I did not understand the humor at that time, but this movie can make me cry out loud. With all the respect for George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau was highly qualified for Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing - due to the fact that he was less than 20 years old than his character, Willie Clark. His ways are the first level. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And while speaking to a Spanish-speaking person on the front desk: "No! No! No enchilada!" Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who called him directly. I would just like this on DVD, because my VHS record gets young. <br /> <br /> I had no interest to see remake with Woody Allen, because in any way it could be a previous match.
