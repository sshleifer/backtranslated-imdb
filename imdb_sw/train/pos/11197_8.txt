Another romantic love of the film triangles from Hitchcock, is not a secret, but very English, very interesting and photographed. The boat-keeper Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) employs the box "One Cycle" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his partner's player, with a good set of good Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis). There are many actors of the fruit and the wedding of Jack and Mabel's verger, standing on the island of the church, registered and shocked before a very tall and very short men, a fat woman, twin widow who, of course, say on the side what aisle sit, and the wedding feast is amusing. All of the movies has Jack to lose Mabel and boxing his way back to his heart, or something like that. It was quite another time, with the audience in the evening dress, and the travelers dressed, too, during the ring. The camera spinning, speed, use of logo, reject all very stylish and skilled. The camera function and the editing of the last boxing match is very high. The best Brisson exhibitions are used well in this; His excitement is not what is around him as he is the Manxman of Hitchcock, and so it is not disturbed. But can the bells be reduced?
