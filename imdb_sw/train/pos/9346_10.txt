If you didn't enjoy this film, or you are dead, or you love Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. Well done, all who gave good performances. This movie has shown that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite the concerns they say. Adam Sandler is becoming a very good actor. It all started with its performance in Big Daddy, then made two bad movies, then broke it with a bad performance in the 50 Dates First, the Longest, then Click, and now Undine on me. Return to the film. Adam Sandler plays someone who has lost everything. The closest thing to the family has a son-in-law and his son-in-law. After his former college colleague (Cheadle) rushed into it, he looked back to his life. I won't say it again, because I don't want to destroy the film, but I recommend this movie. One of the best 2007 movies.
