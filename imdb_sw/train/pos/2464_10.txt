One of the best movies I have ever seen. We do a lot of action in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that shows all the good things that actors can do in their work. I strongly recommend this, especially for those who are willing to act, as "must see." There are several cases of note. For one thing, the cemetery arrives when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about the situation by going to primary school), and his cooperation with the skull was done very much. The logic used in this area was too great - I think Shakespeare's covenant more than anything else. Secondly, I was very excited about the area where Hamlet, Horatio and the character they played with Robin Williams discussed the roles.
