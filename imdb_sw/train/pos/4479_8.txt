Since I first saw Ancheors Aweigh in 1945, seeing it on videotape has a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to find in the first popular music of MGM Technicolor. Now I probably intended to think about the future work of leading players. Although Sinatra had made a few film a few times after her emergence after Dorsey's days, as a solo singer, this was her first great film to be seen. As another observer noted, this seems to be almost to be warm-on On Town. Sinatra may have had a hard work in it, but his dance with Kelly is reliable, and he would do well in their next harmonization. However, looking at his body, it is easy to see why he pretended to be a string bean. Who would have thought that in ten years he would win the academy awards, and continued many roles as a difficult detective or leader in the fight. Although the personality Gene Kelly and playing this film, its winsome performance did not indicate that he could be a great creative force, almost iconic figure, for MGM games, where developed the style of dance booster for that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was wonderful to see the clean-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that later playing "thrill" killer in Forced, based on Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. Additional information: One inspector praised the performance of Betty Garrett as a love of Sinatra . Later he played against him in On Town, but Pamela Britton appeared in this film.
