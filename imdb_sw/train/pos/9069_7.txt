If you like films about school attackers, brave children, infants and eating insects, then How to Eat Fried Insects will be interesting to you. The video is about a boy named Billy, who arrived on the first day at a new school, realizes that some of his colleagues have played a prank on it by placing it in his lunch. University, Joe and his "team" friends begin to laugh with Billy and call him "little boy." Billy decides to play together and say that "eats worms at all". Joe and his friends don't believe him but Billy assures him and takes care of Joe that he can eat ten worms one day or he will come to school with worms in his pants. The boys take Billy up on his bet, and leave the weak child with the responsibility of earning respect from his fellow students by eating fingers, fried, or alive. <br /> <br /> Movies can be loud but there are many messages in it. For one, it shows true friendship and how to accept people for them. It also shows why some uncomfortable people are subjected to child abuse. The film's main character, Billy is a strong and brave person we can all be involved. It is easy to thank him when we are happy to reach his goal, although we cannot agree with what he does or what he does. Children in films are shown exactly what children have in real life and the film is very eligible for credit. Children's actors are the stars of this show, showing a true sense and feeling than many other children's movies they show. Some adults can enjoy this film but children will, maybe even young people. <br /> <br> There is no good film on the rotation at this time, so if you do not feel to see snakes on the plane, try worms on a plate of how to eat worm worms. It will feel the fun of the film and not just the reason for fear of children.
