As explained by other consultants this is one of the best movies of Tarzan. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the film as it is seen as a proper manifestation of what business business should be. With the definition required to know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. Beyond the beginning of the film has one of the most exciting and awesome series tracks ever made. This happens when Harry journey group has to leave the tribe of cannibals. Production values ​​before control increases a lot of authenticity, in fact showing the tragic signs that await Europeans going to the jungle. This film also offers, although maybe antecedently, the correct account of how they were treated by African Africans had their white employers. In addition to sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, large sets and two chetas! Not to lose the classic adventure.
