After seeing Vertigo, then look at Bell, Book and Candle, conducted within each other's months. <br /> <br /> My second photo of Kim Novak, and Picnic, comes as a third. All three displays are huge, Vertigo, to be the best, of all. They came to my town in Kansas Prairie, near, in Salina, Kansas in 50 years, for film, Picnic. <br /> <br /> The symbol of music, Book and candle, I believe is one of Alex North. Suitable for this beautiful. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, performed this comedy, how interesting to note the great difference. <br /> <br /> Value your time, if you love Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
