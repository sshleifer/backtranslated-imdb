In my mind, this remains one of the best performances of the Superman on TV, and it is also one of the faithful during the time of some community. This series revived all of Superman's '70s /' of 80's series and a series of Superman "reboot" of 1986-continuing ("Man Steel," "Superman Vol 2," "Action Comics , "" Adventures of Superman, "etc.). The opening and titles were to stimulate, according to John Williams's film, which was updated on a Saturday morning series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors of reboot (author of "Adventures of Superman") was the perfect choice to participate in this animation series. In general, the series was more mature when it became a very friendly child. <br /> <br /> Superman was issued as a reliable, powerful, and symbolic. His regular nemesis was Lex Luthor in his body of megalomaniac / CEO. The characters of the Daily Planet Lois, Jimmy, and Perry were shown well. One of my favorite performances was Wonder Woman, and the story surrounded her home of Themyscira ("Island of Paradiso"). His whole creation and that of his mother Hippolyte were addressing the series of Wonder Woman comic of the era, and it seemed like a well-conducted series well done for her if it were done the same. <Br /> <br /> One thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been removed from DVD / Blu-ray! It should be.
