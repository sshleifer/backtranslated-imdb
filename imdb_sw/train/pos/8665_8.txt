I wrote this title for accident and Vol Grindhouse. 1 collection of fresh movies of Euro-garbage. But this film has a good stamp to be approved and should be transferred better than outside. Includes not ... satisfaction is! Watching this film I did not help to ask ... How did Sergio Martino not make this flick? This has signed it all over it and registered with the Fenech Edwedge (nor is it known if he should be but he got a good comeo in Hostel II). Two crosses and three crosses and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef adding cool under pressure from the second second. What? Should this person have to go to Italy to reach his potential or make the studio system leave this person to find? In addition to Lee's most well-known movies, filmmakers should try this by size and see if Sergio Leone would have slowed its epic speed down. has turned out to be like. So it is comforting, it should be taken during the day at home and make it to the mattress bed
