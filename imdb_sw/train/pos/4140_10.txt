What a wonderful and original show. The first release of Julie Brown (King of Women's Judgment) is perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays with lesbians who are always competing with her boyfriend and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN) I have done more during this show than any other I have seen (if With Newhart-one of all my regular showings If you like movies like Naked Gun and Birds - you will like this series! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams who plays himself. The image is of Cindy Williams doing an act that cannot be opened and pinling-upside down. It is amazing to see actress like Cindy Williams can play like this. opera as to surprise many twists during the short run.I can only hope that this one day will be released DVD with special special bonus special features.
