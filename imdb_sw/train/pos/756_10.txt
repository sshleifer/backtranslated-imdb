I must say although I despise these types of exhibitions, shock shock, I am a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I had seen Sanchez dirty before seeing Jackass and I think that way is increasingly jackass in terms of creating software. The story lines and interviews are inter interior and create the most interesting show. I saw a few minutes of the movie Jackass the other night and I didn't believe how to put together wrong, everything just put in a joke line after joke and no connection between anything. It must have been the most simple show of ever edit, amateur shock. When you drink a puke is not really my thing, such as a great show of entertainment goes, Dirty Sanchez is a way out of the Jackass League.
