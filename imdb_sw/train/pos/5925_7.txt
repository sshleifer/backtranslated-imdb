Because of all the negative reviews of this film I almost did not look at it. However, I was surprised to be a very sad and interesting movie. Acting was not great - away from the amazing Alice Krige - but some discussion ("Just think you lunch.") It was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> Best of all over Stephen King bid - 7/10.
