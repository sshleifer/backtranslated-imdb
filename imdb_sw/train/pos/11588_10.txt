This movie was nice and I'd like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a small eagle. The boy should feed and take care of the eagle until an old man is given to the crop. The boy saves the eagle from being killed and run away from the tribe. The eagle helps feed her by catching the duck from a little boy's pond. Later the boy is making an effort to get the child to be abusive because their arrows were so close. It is only until they see the thickness of the red line they decide who found the ass. But this was bad because he made other boys even crueler to him, and finally he was chased out of the rock but when you think he will fall his pure love with an eagle turns him into a golden eagle and just a necklace as a reminder of who was. anyone knows where I can buy this film let me know.I haven't seen them for more than 30 years, but still remember the parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
