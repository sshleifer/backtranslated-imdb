I loved this film. It was very cold. It has all: cars, shooting guns, fighting, and even a girl sign. Not suitable for any of these things, except cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and the LOT of the car, and the big chase around the end. Jump, you can say, impossible, but according to our good friends here IMDB is possible, so the movies are not suitable if people draw. It has some quality, and I wanted to look at it. In fact, I loved the film. And I didn't need to turn off my brain to look at it. I was not always thinking "Is this possible?" or trampling like that. 9 in 10.
