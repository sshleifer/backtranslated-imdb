I strongly recommend this film. Putting in the future of the Bladerunner-esquire of 2054 Paris, it is the most respectable film of the classic black script: a woman in danger, a sister trying to find him, faithful soldier to fight everyone. Luckily, it avoids the most unusual views, and combines good storyline with interesting, creative images. The film can remind you Sin City in the look, but it has even a strong, even more of a novel picture that I have found a powerful. Each chapter, each sequence looks like it could be drawn from a skilled master desk. With regard to the story and artwork, you can get a return to return to nineteen years (or even earlier with a classic view of the Eiffel tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca, as well as looking towards a bad future where our goals are ruled by organizations . Make any excuses you need to see this film.
