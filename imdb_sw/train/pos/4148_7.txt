Let's put one thing straight: this film will not try to fix that type, not Dr Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It is a flick fatal, with three beautiful female inspiration (can not remember any other comedy and similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and Queen of Indie Parker Posey, attracting it as it was. The story is basic: those three were "lost" at the university, and it is still after the county. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind person), Posey is a senator (who "never touched someone since Clinton was in the office" ... a few minutes later ... I'm slow, right!) , and Dracht has a fianc√©e of gay (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They should prevent the "evil" daughter of the senator (Amber Tamblyn who is very good from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to embarrass her during the spring break. So they should go to watch him, and some hilarity comes. All in all, comedy light, simple, quite short, and quite enjoyable
