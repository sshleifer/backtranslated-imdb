A wonderful, wonderful and wonderful example of family life! Author Andrew Marshall has written something that is exciting, causes and sometimes scary! Yes, do not show with fun characters and 2point4; The show has a dark side, and sometimes it can be quite cool. And that's good about the show, not just a simplistic sitcom where each character is 2D comic device (case with My Family). Instead, the characters are fully around people who express a deep sense of human emotions. During the dark sometimes as Bill counted by the curses and Ben rising up in a strange village are two examples of show show surreal, dark turn, help to add a little depth. Of course show is also very strange, and is sure to make you smile. It is a real embarrassment of Eureka Video to stand out on this comical gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope of holding events that cannot be closed in stores.
