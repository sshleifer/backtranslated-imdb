Story of emotions and track sound sounds. It is about a little girl (with a sound barrier) that keeps her dark green Paulie. Parrot thinks and speaks as a man and offers help and advice to his friend regularly. <br /> <br /> Paroti is a definite star of the film. Sometimes it is caused by a constant depression in the plane takes a mood in a strange and express way. The word is also well done and within a minute or two you can really believe that this intelligent bird is here. Earlier in the movie his father gives a flight to the pawnbroker and the following events says the story of the constant struggle of Paulie for many years to reunite with his grandmother. One of the most memorable events is when it falls into a bad company and is encouraged to spy people using one automatic machine. Paulie seems to have a wonderful memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who would like it otherwise. Children will like this film and anyone who keeps an airplane like an animal will be interested in the Pauline antics.
