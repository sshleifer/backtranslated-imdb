It has been 16 years since the original run, I would hope for now some of the "marketing wizard" would have translated the actor's life of this classic now, or at least wanted to reopen the previous 65 times. sci-fi or cartoons have not slowed down. The Galaxy Rangers really had a good idea out, and even the best scripts.The animation was on average rate at the time, and the best compared to the slide show show animation Japan today. It was before a heavy-toy tie in the market, this could be a seal is a penalty too. I would like to spend money on a DVD on GR if available.
