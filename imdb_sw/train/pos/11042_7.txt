In prison, four detainees take the cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and betray him with his wife; Drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his advocate, Pâquerette lost (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his sister six months; and Marcus's mind (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old newspaper hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They know that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from prison, when they see the truth about the fate of Danvers. "Maléfique" is the first exciting movie budget of the French budget, amazing and claustrophobic. This story is close to one location, it does not clichés and takes the attention of the viewer to the last location. I am a great fan of French movies, regular romances, dramas and police stories, but I noted that I have recently seen the most beautiful French movies, such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End ". My vote is seven. Headline (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of Evil")
