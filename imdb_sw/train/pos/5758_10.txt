This in my opinion is one of the best movies of the 1970s. Not only does it include cast but also caused by wild strokes and explosions that are still interesting today. The story is about vet Vietnam (Kris Kristofferson) employed by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean a criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris starts to replace his position and become bad as criminals were hired to quit. It's good to see Kris playing against a variety. Bernadette Peeters and the Chief of Victoria provide great support as women involved in two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real star of the movie in this film. I don't think Vigilante Power is on video but it often shows on TV. It's a good flick for boys who love movies.
