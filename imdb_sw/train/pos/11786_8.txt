This is almost the most common Lynch. However, What makes this film odd for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, close to amateur. But I believe Lynch is doing it for the purpose of giving more realism to reality, which serves to speed up the surreal time. However, a lot of Lynch's most common designs are, such as: a functional camera; haunting music; Long (caused) stops; to hang curtains; The lighting lights grow black at a faster (almost indiscernible) speed; close ups; the women's problem; produce high, unfriendly, all known characters involved with characters who are suffering, for a short time, in the dark and so on ... Typically, Lynch leaves leaves everything to translation. Many questions have been left unanswered and this reduces thought. <br /> <br /> Another good effort from Lynch. I only hope that it makes a brief, more than a line of its advertising playonys 2. They were moved.
