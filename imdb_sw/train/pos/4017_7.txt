This is a very unpredictable dance in the west. It has great stories, interesting characters, and very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. His role as the worst in this film is very realistic. He covers every area he exists, and shows a lot of his face and eyes, even when he does not talk. Its performance is very reliable. He deserves to be a player without being up (not that there is nothing wrong with being up). Mark Damon surprises well in this film too. <br /> <br /> Music music is the best, and the theme song is a type that will play on your head every day after seeing the film, if you want it or not. There are several sections that are very interesting. I especially like the place where Rosalba Neri puts in front of the parrot. There is also a lot of playing a gun player that has done very well. I would like to give this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was not for two things. The first to become a wheel of barly bar that occurs 25 minutes on the film. This is one of the most fighting fights I have ever seen in the movie. It's too bad to be found, and it looks more like the dance numbers from the music worse than any kind of real fight. One can destroy this if it's Terence Hill / Bud Spencer player, but this is more west, and brawl needed to be more realistic. Another thing that heard about this movie was Yuma's fear of Mexico. I think he had to be a comic aid or something, but the character was just stupid and not necessarily in a movie like this, and he's not all funny. What can I say where Tuco needs? All that has been said, I would like to assure everyone that reading that Johnny Yuma is a typical western story despite the mistakes I mentioned, and all fans of the type need to see this film.
