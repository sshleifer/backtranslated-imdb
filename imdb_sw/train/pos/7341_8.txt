I enjoy the film of Ralph Bakshi ("Witches", "Cool World" and "Mr. Pete" hit down) and is the collector Frank Frazetta and the fan. I am also a fan of sword and magic who loves the world of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. I missed the "Fire and Ice Reveal" back in 1983 and I have been eager to see a video or revival since then. Therefore, the release of 2005 was a real dream to me. However, I bought it boldly, because I was hoping it would not be worth looking at once and then putting it on the shelves as a collection of "collecting" until that day I died. Fortunately my fears are unfounded and I enjoyed this film. <br /> <br /> As with the art of Frazetta this is a false film that has physical and sexual films that are hard to find in many fantasy movies / sword and magic without being cheesy or dirty. Art is good and you see the success of Frazetta for his ability. Even my boys liked to fight me and ask to watch it regularly. However, my wife has an objection to the strongest king (Frazetta-esquire). I don't care that because it is reliable and there is no sex area. <br /> <br /> There is a dream-scoping used, but personally I enjoy a dream-scoping. It offers more water and true movement for characters who are difficult to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> With other persistent problems, I recommend this film to both Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, and sword and magic fans. Enjoy!
