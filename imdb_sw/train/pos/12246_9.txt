The minute I started looking at this I realized that I was looking at the quality of the product so I was not surprised to see that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was released by both Sue Birtwhistle brought us the best 1995 production Pride and Prejudice! So my special here is that Emma did not rush 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes as Pride and Prejudice. Acting was good and I think Prunella best scales like Miss Bates but I love Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. Language is fun to listen, can you think in this day and age to be right to go to someone without actually giving a word? Samantha Morton was as good as Miss Smith was actually thrown there was a lot of spot as it was for Kinyonge and Hate. I liked it so much that I looked at it twice for two days! So sometimes I accept the BBC for another piece of TV. I found the version of Paltrow and it's the same but I think the BBC version is much higher. The best production that I really enjoy having a DVD!
