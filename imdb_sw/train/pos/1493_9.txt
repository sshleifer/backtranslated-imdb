I thought Mukhsin was written wonderfully. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of cunning messages that I think Yasmin was trying to bring. And yes, it may be a concern for some of you (especially if you didn't see Sepet and / or Gubra for 76 times). I realized how they use characters from two movies before right? It's really amazing how characters relate. As a granddaughter neighbor is a prostitute from Gubra. And the ass on the pad of snooker turns into a religion with the wife of the wicked in the future. <br /> <br /> And I totally love voice-overs. His evil is still fun. If they shot a safe gun of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, then suddenly the voice of Mukhsin said 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim.' somehow gentle, engaging in an amazing way is displayed in character. For example, even children can be bright bright (full with a pleasant sad voice) and just bad mouth ppl every movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur yourself life is not sorted out. I could say it, this movie reached my expectations if it didn't exceed. <br /> <br /> It was glued onto the screen, I can't even take my eyes off it. It's not even doing in movies. Ha ha.
