One of the best Vance films is more successful in an interesting and attractive direction and no other than Michael Curtiz. This time around the hated funder is generally seen dead - shot in the head - in his closet and locked room on the top floor. Philo Vance, hearing the situation when going to Italy, decides to end her holiday and try to solve what she thinks is murder and what everyone thinks suicide. William Powell has been affected by Philo Vance as you will. He never seems to be journalists and is always very soft in what he says and does. Powell is supported by highly talented actors - characters of the first character and actors like Mary Astor as a nephew who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as a dead person secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a fan of rival dog, Arthur Hohl as Helen Vinson, a wonderful pastor , as the second door set by blonde, and two beautiful performances by James Lee as a Chinese cook and Eugene Palette as a police investigator with insight. Add to a wonderful mix of drama and Etienne Girardot as a public coroner always missing its food. This is the depth of the suspects and the story that has many plots and it turns out that Kennel's Death Park is a secret moving, fun.
