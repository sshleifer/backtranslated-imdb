Before all, I would like to explain that I have not read the book, so there was no chance that I had longed for it. The greatest benefit I have seen is historical information, and several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think not at that time. <br /> *** ***** <br /> <br /> The technical feature of the film is the same, there is nothing to brag about. But acting, I think, was severe. I have no experience in doing, I still can't believe how people can focus on this terrible! Perhaps they have seen only two films (ever), and another should be very good indeed! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and was well aware of his character, a man who climbed a social level with a very difficult task, then he fought against those who would take his job from him, just he gets so involved in this war, he does not know why there is no longer a side of him, and the end of the man being beaten, desires. Irons made it so reliable, I sympathized with the character as well as its brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also as strange as female romantic women, who is drawn in a revolutionary coup with her boyfriend (Banderas, had a low-level development, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had a moderate performance, not bad, not just for other actors. Beware of Miguel Guilherme, the best actress of Portuguese, among many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's movies, here only translations, the only people are the thing, but at the same time, not worried the film, also worrying to try to be mindful. The best evidence I liked, I write seven years later.
