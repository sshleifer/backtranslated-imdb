The great color of Kasparov or Fischer can be aggressive for the total rookie. This is a good movie. No special organization to participate in the plot. This is a clue! This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a PRIVATE business. This is a destructive plot and itself. As a conclusion, the situation described a full academic plot: self, self, self-destruction, without considering at the end. Anyone can be behind a plot: smart "director" and some money. All can only be done by message. "Director" must be a player only. If an ordinary viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in a clear film system, the real plot has a small chance to be discovered. All performances of executives are done well, with specific reference to Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
