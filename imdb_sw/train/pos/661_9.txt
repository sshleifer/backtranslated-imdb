Ho, ho, maniacidal maniac! This visit to visit with the powerful-de-powerful EC of the awesome tale comics is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series you have ever made. Director Robert ("Go back to the future") Zemeckis does more than the script of magic and Fred ("Night of Creeps," "Monster Squad") Dekker that faces a good-time homewoman (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who married Zemeckis when he was starring in this period) who kills jertk her husband's (nice cameo and Marshall Bell) on Christmas to put her head and fire-poker head. Problems are being done when a widow is dressed as Jolly Kris Kringle saves from a nearby reserve and decides to pay a tutor to visit easily. The Spooky of Alan Silvestri, an exciting sculpture and the Dean Cundey film that has been typically the most fun. And Larry Drake (gentle gentle benny on "L.A. Law"!), With its creepy hiccuping guffaw, demented twinkle in her eyes green eyes, and grinder leering, really bad, makes sanguary Saint Nick.
