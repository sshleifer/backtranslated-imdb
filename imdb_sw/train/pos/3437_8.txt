Other types of films are needed to wear. This was different. Taken by its own reputation, it is the lowest version of the film of fear. With special small effects, it can be a psychological study of the species, with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by then, and why? It's not a good film, but because there are so many things about it, the story works. Of course, and all about the cooperation of the characters. Actually, there is one problem in opening events, but it may be put there just to put the sound of what's coming. I value the amount of male and female energy, and will not recommend this story to anyone who is more attracted to the physical and psychological challenges. You will enjoy the film if you have understanding, focus on the importance of a little adventure in your life, and ask yourself "What should I do in this situation?"
