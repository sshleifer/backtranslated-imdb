Other comments about this film made it sound. Due to the pictures of talking were new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was small and clean. He had not yet found his own style that we were expecting. However it is advisable to see him this way - still learn the trick. Most clich√©s came from this film and it seems, this film sparked some way for the next 70 years. Voting for me is there and remember how young people this kind of film was. Continue and open your mind and perhaps trembled in the picture, for in 1934 and how we see the early part of the last century as being raised.
