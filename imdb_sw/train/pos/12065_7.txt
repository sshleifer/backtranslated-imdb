"Important" is far from the great film, from the play stage, headed by Nic Roeg. In the Roeg film program, this is about the highest level of its work "Do Not Look Now", which is known for the good use of Theresa Russell as a leading actress. In fact it is very good here, and far from trouble in other Roeg films like "Bad Times" and "Winter Heavens". As "actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, showing him as a completely siren, but visible. He plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is better to say a few. He looks at the place with interest, and when Theresa Russell is not seen as Monroe, he certainly attracts the influence. Other players are not enough if you do not like to catch as Emil and Russell. A beautiful, intelligent mind is directed well by Roeg, but certainly not gently, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other Roeg's other films, he is relying heavily on vague, trivial barriers, which add very little to the film. In many ways the film would have worked well as a short (say, 60 minutes), a lower piece. Still, an acceptable film, can be approved. Sometimes it is quite good, but largely not generally. Testing: - *** 1/2 / *****
