This is not a good movie but I still love it. Catvis Clovis is a gold in a bottle with a column of cats themselves - quite the opposite of the bad sleepwalkers. I think there's more of this film than people realize, basically it's very hard, but this brutality can sometimes be good. It has a corny line, a sudden end and a comedic feature provided by the complaining police. Is there anyone who has found a bit confused feature? Finally this film is typical and an acrimonious random, which is very appropriate, likening to Psycho - a relationship between mother and son, change of characters. I think the damage works too, this is not the film that you want it to pass, it only works as short. <br /> <br /> I still don't know if the director did not have depth, or if he did these things for a purpose, we know Stephen King has the ability, but I've never read his books, I just saw his movies. <br /> <br /> However, I loved it. If you like the great corny movies and just overtones just look at. but don't wait too much. It really is very bad.
