This may be the most supported movie of its kind. I do not remember to see any ads or ads for this which may be the reason to do so well in the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and original movie. I place it in 10 most popular privacy videos on my list. The movie begins with pictures of pictures and news articles tell us about a murderer who calls himself "the hand of God". Then someone goes to the police station and tells the officer that he knows the murderer is his brother. Two of them go together to go where the victims are buried that can help solve the case. During the trip, a man begins to tell his brother's story and we go back when events started. Fenton and Adam are two younger brothers living with their religious and religious father who, one day, say they have received God's message from God to ask them to kill demons who appear to be ordinary people. He receives from God a list of demonic names destroyed and ask his sons to help him do this divine work. This is a terrible and stressful film that will put you next to your seat. The tension runs up, the innocent people (or the demons?) They are killed by religious experience being asked. It does not only have but only a few mental twists in the end. If you would like this type, I highly recommend Frailty to you. I have a DVD and it is one of my most joyful moments.
