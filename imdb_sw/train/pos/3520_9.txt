This is a "B Series" of the Noir film, and my vote shows its membership in that kind. I saw this film last night on the bank of the left bank in Paris, where it opened a two-week film. The film has some flaws, yes, but many of the most interesting features to ignore. As the previous inspector said, the drama is amazing! (B-movies can go where the movies are blocked!) And the plot is interesting. About Francot Tone, however, I disagree: for me, he is very accurate; only the correct shade of creepy. One must remember that there is a form of German expression that takes place here (director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and so the air spread spread throughout this film. Of course it is for me. However, it is Ella Raines who is good, who, in just three of the performance characteristics, saw the viewer inserted into the film. "Girl Friday" kind of similarity to Gene Tierney, it's amazing that she was not a household name. But he is good here that I have ordered another film ('Impact') from the web, and I can't wait to see it too.
