The only reason I fear this film is between 8 out of 10 because there are small movies, in my opinion, which is perfect. This small picture B is a taut story, well told. I've been attracted to Alexander Knox, but I've seen a few movies. Here plays Wilhelm Grimm, a little sad person who returns to be a monster. He gives us everything and everyone without sadness. Performance is one of the most beautiful displays I've ever seen. Since World War 2, actors who played the Nazis or other bad forms in the film have been selected regularly for Oscars. I think that since this was done during the war, the Academy felt like respecting the performance as this would like to respect evil. But Knox puts in such a way - a very bitter man is used to convince himself that he does not think anything to cause others to suffer. I still can't find it. Marsha's hunt, which usually plays filbert gibbet films or social butterflies, is beaten against the kind in the best possible performance I have seen, too. Maybe not Oscar is worthy, but better than his job. Nothing against it; I have enjoyed him in these "little" roles that often played. But here confirms the work of heavy drama. If you would like human human stories, or stories about the events of those who suffered by the hands of the People, I strongly recommend this little film.
