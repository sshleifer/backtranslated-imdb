The 1983 edition of Alice Walker's exciting and interesting film (written as large as a letter from the center of Celie to God) was a great success of Oscar, and therefore it is okay. <br /> <br /> In the role of people who are used and raised Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave its best performance screens for miles. Not far from him was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, a hot woman got the fate. The others who had been beaten gave the characters characters Walker had clearly explained on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, the Celie husband who hurt; Margaret Avery as Shug, the power of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and Carl Anderson was very lost (otherwise known as Judah in the 1973 film Jesus Christ Superstar) as Samuel's preacher. It is written beautifully and carefully, 'The Color Purple' has the right to its source at the opening of the story to involve the audience of the game length of the feature.
