Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good film. How? Von Trier has a highly recommended way of telling stories, at least he had Europa. I all the film was like an experience even though I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete part, REAL and moving the movies then many films on the top 250 list. In fact there are other good too, but this is my favorite. The last event is one of the most powerful events ever.
