I have never seen a refund, or any version of it, of "Child's Face" and Barbara Stanwyck until I got it at TCM. What a good movie! In short Lily lives in the conversation, she has been beaten by her father since she was 14 years old! Then he still closes and killed Lily (Stanwyck) alone for his black girl Chico, played by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves the capital (New York) deciding to use her sex to get higher. He does it in good fashion! She persuades the clerk to enter the bottom floor and keeps going through the men like sweets! A man who dismisses his partner and kills his mother-in-law, and Lily's father, commits suicide! Lily barely talk! STANwyck is as strong as a girl who does not really love. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris, she falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but while in a serious financial situation, she bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, he knows he loved the Court! Lily nations looking for him, but did he go late? <br /> <br /> This is before the Hollywood code for the best. Stanwyck is great and look with music in the film is perfect. This reminded me of the original "Sinama" by Angelina Jolie, another who was misunderstood flick by a romantic woman, those who did not like romantic sex films, will not love Baby to do better, those with faith in sex, love and power, will love me. . It is highly recommended! Look!
