I have never seen this film until I bought the tape last year. I was happy and fun. It contains all the things I like to see in the Sci-Fi story, in the book or on the screen. There is a social definition, tolerance, and good news. It is a good thing, and it is worth it, to look at the 1936 view of a "distant future" of 60 and 70. .
