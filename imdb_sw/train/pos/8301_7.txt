Gary Busey is the character of the head, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, a standard-based maverick who has got his nickname because it doesn't matter how many shot (38 and count), he never stops going after bad people. > When the American tank of the name "Thunderblast" is run to Mexico, it is taken by the revolutionaries / fighters led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who has joined himself with Russian. Employees involved are retained as prisoners, chief among them Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who happens to be a former friend of McBain. McBain is then employed by the Army for the rescue message. Busey cannot have a physical presence to say, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would be another good leading film of this kind, but an explosion like a dude who has a quick to be in demand. Fluegel is a great female leadership; he not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for fine-kicking action babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (as the head of the Russian) is a sharp fraud in the traditional practice of ethnicity. Effective support is the perfect character of the character and integrity: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provides a script, according to the story of Lankford and former director B of Fred Olen Ray. It is a kind of script where you know the authors have their own language in their cheeks: they know their material is wonderful and fun, and enjoys giving us trust outside the window. The director of the former stages Steve Carver continues to move and provide a decent amount of weapons, explosion, and general violence. "Bulletproof" is a great pleasure for a fan of the action who doesn't care to change their brain regularly and enjoy a generous spirit and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
