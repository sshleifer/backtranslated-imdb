This is the first of the series of Pigogo Giga, and is one of the most interesting films from the collection. It took a long time to finally get someone to get my hands a copy of this very popular film. I bought the Pig Pig Guinea and decided to look at the collection for the release date. So I hit this and sat down. From what I have read on the Internet, and realizing the content of this film, I expected to measure my nerves with full strength. This ended that it was not a case. The film focuses on a group of men who arrest a woman and begin to attack her in hopes of discovering the action of breaking humanity, and how long one can endure pain. Looks like a flick one of the patient right? Not right. The film fails to surprise. This may be because I've been desensitized over the years to make my quick and fearful, but I think it's safe to say that any real gorehound can stay this way easily. On the other hand, a person who does not have a good understanding of this type of film will have a greater capacity to exaggerate and be disturbed by the photos they see on the screen. Although it has failed to shock this film has some of the most violent and graphic violence. Including the toes with the fingers, the intestines are beaten to a woman with no understanding, and the needle through the eye. Overall I think for many of the gorehounds on this board that you should find your hand copy of this film for its novel, but I suggest that for new lovers of these types of films you should do your work up to this.
