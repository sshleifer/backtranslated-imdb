Is there anyone who knows the real quote about "time and love" and George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in argument, Was it? Was he talking to Charlie and Annna in the church when they left? If I don't need a movie rental. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! A great love story for the soul! I met my true love (Soulmate) and though I had experience to meet him when I had little expectations, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. We are married, I didn't have enough maturity to give as I thought I would like. I loved it very much and I took his love for a small space and he resisted it for seven years. I had the most difficult lessons to learn and now we have been away from 3 years. I can now appreciate the different feelings in me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick is really to me. I know when he has healed enough to trust him again, we will marry again. <br /> <br>> You have never prayed and made it love for you! IT IS A DECISION OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> Also music in this movie is EDUCATION AND RISK! This movie is DEEP and tightens spiritually. True love deserves to wait, if it means that, it will be, no matter what, it does! Nothing is impossible, even when it's next time! Thank you!
