After seeing "Marry Mafia", I'd like to lose my trust in the Korean movie business. But this has led to my faith. A female student who is a university student was obliged to teach a destructive, rich but grateful young man. She is a female character. Through many violent violence, these two end up being good friends. I was so surprised that a stranger who loved him did his work with skill. He was such a revelation! Kim Kim nul was also as attractive as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried so hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in common comedies comedies. And it did not indicate any sexual, sexual intercourse. It was brilliant, beautiful, clean, made me see again. <br /> <br />
