Nick Nolte gives the best performance in the dark story of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle has Howard W. Campbell who was a double-acting agent in the propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives unnoticed until the contest groups want to dig past. As with Vonnegut's great work, this is to reflect on the ignorance of war and those who use propaganda for their own purpose. Nolte is amazing - assertive and confident as a small Campbell, and then broke and haunted as an old man who has to finance past sins. (7 out of 10)
