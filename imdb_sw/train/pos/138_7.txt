I do not understand why other opinions are based on McConaughey. She has never been a very popular film actor. The best part of this film is writing and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an odd duo of comic, definitely not stock types. Although one cannot say their characters are a modern development that does not make them less to play. The version I saw was on HDNET and it had Spanish headings, so it's certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish provides more validity. A highly supported movie, judging by IMDb members of the odd logo they have given. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth 7 at least. Most movies and high-quality movies and making big money at the box office are not very interesting.
