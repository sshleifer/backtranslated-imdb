I longed to see this film when it came out of the movie, however, I couldn't move around. So, finally, it became a shelf, and I took it. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I planted a dvd in the player, sitting in the evening of the murder, and playing for the emphasis. What followed was one of the most engaging flicks that I saw in the last few years. It is a story of the Wonderland massacre, which has led to the more and more direct parts of the first 70 years, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). I walked from the beginning, and the feeling of the movie made me all the way to the end of the blood. I was surprised to see that the movie focused a little on real killings and more on events before and after the investigation. In addition to the small walls of blood walls at the beginning, and the actual demonstration of murder towards the end, the cinema was more or less show of the active dialoge and good acting. Val Kilmer all sells me as a porn star of a junkie, and even a "good but that's" Bosworth was happy to enjoy (and just for his looks, remember) <br /> <br /> I felt myself better feature of the movie it was, as I said, its lack of clearly showing murder. It was displayed in a very dark condition, so you can't see the bludgeoning of the brutal released by the fourth sleep. Additionally, the impact of the sound of these murders was more than enough to lose my appetite. They were blowing with lead pipes, there is not much more to say. My sole problem was the short appeal of Carrie Fisher. His definition of religious religious figures was, I think, too little to appeal to him. Maybe that person was part of the story, maybe not, but I wasn't sold, and for some reason, Fisher appeared also "akward" in his show. <br /> <br /> Overall, the best movie worth watching, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
