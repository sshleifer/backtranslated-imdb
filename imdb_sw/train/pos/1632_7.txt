Misfits at the military school? Hmmmm, looks funny, maybe angry with some. You have characters there, an Arab thief, a boyfriend of a gender, a mouth of mind, a smoker of a pot, and don't forget, a man who burns things. Throwing a Sergent non-trustworthy, Sergent's gay and one teacher of bullet and makes one adventure film. I have seen this film and it's amazing, because comedy spinning the fact that if you're trying to work together, things have been done. The students' disadvantaged band at Weinberg Military School are set here because, as Sgt Liceman says "because you are aliens, embarrassed for your family and community, they despise you." Ralph Macchio before Karate Kid and Cousin My Vinny, and exhibitions from Barbara Bach also, this film attracts young and young. <br /> <br /> The loud sound of the sound continues to the film.
