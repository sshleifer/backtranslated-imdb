Just the most funniest and the most beautiful of the film at all ... is certainly on my top ten list. This also gets ten on a voting level. The successor of the owners, Arthur Bach (Moore), is the middle 'child' who refuses to take a mature way in life and avoid all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal player, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping in Bergdorf Goodman and run away from the little shepherd, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur's and Linda Chemistry adds electricity to all the film. There are good pieces to keep. In the same area, Arthur (drunk in many stories) finds on the bad door of the apartment and hears the threat of losing the ear from the "siren" of man ("My husband has a gun!"). he said indeed: Geraldine Fitzgerald has a loving yet loving Arthur's father, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the whole show and his acidic problems (He took home to Oscar for this), and Christopher Cross provides Theme Theme (Oscar winner "Best That You Can Do ") It is a disgrace for the late Dudley Moore who lost last month (March 2002).
