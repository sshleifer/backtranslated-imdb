Yes, I did, since I was sitting here, I remembered that I felt guilty if I looked at it a couple of weeks ago when my wife chose to look like something big (in contrast) as "Dear Mommie." How does one describe an appeal to "Batman and Robin" - I mean only those who have actually been counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, and horrible squares and bad acting - and, oh, it was very funny! And that applies to this "reunion" and movie "flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to the auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for love. But it finds stolen, and our pals (as they themselves) fly into their old characters person (if not their clothing) and go away to find out what happened. Along the way they remind you of the series, and we see how it was all collected in the match, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing with Adam's little and Burt's television series. In fact it was very interesting to find some back of the events that appeared on the past series, and Adam and Burt began to return to behavior (even if they were not in the character - well, you would like to look at it to see what I mean.) It was also good to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the previous series, you will hate this. If - heaven forbids - you have certainly thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney did "Batmans" acceptance and you would hate even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and you still want to admit that you have never explored the part - well, this is for you. Yes, it is true - 9/10
