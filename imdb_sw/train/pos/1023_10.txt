This show has been my escape from reality for the past decade. I will be sadly sad. Although Atlantis has filled a little hole. <br /> <br /> The last part of SG1 (on any TV) was well done. Robert wrote something that felt close to the truth. As if he was trying to explain what was on the set of show. (Everyone working together for a long time has declined and declined. But over the years they have become a family). I thought this was a good way to stop despite the opposition of another person. SG1 was something unique and often again making me uncomfortable and surprising threats. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From one place I walked. The combination of action, science, drama and comedy especially worked very well that made me continue to want more. <br /> <br /> No real words that express fully what this show means to me. I can only thank those who put the show so clean and entertaining for many years. It is written to do many things that I thought was impossible. I hope the movie last year and I hope there is a number of them. I don't want a show to die. Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
