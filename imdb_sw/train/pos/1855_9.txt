After seeing all the films released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best film of the year. I can say it is the best film I have seen all year round. Most American films with black people can concentrate on US issues and "race relations", or fall within the ghetto's local publications, and each sterotype can be mixed with a slang of ebonic form. Antony Fisher stands to boast only on this issue: the race is useless, but by fighting one that can, or not, is taken by a slur of color. Antione Fisher's story is one that should get a resonance with any compassionate person. She is down, and to think, is shown by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while having the power of the stars to have the film, holds the background to many places, and allows the film to be the story of Antione Fisher. When BET, and popular culture generally want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film talking to humanity in all of us. I only hope that the non-Black listeners will go to this film for humanity, rather than avoiding because they feel that there are no characters or characters in the film that they can recognize. That would be a sad definition of the race relations in North America and itself. <br /> <br />
