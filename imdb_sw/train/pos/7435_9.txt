I saw this video first 15 years ago. I thought it was better then and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English love poems, so Coleridge has a very high level with me. Anything that can prevent the beauty of the poem or the power of the story does not get my masterpiece. In this case, everything works well in conjunction with the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated by a generation on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds meaning to legitimacy and authority to it. Okay, so there was no big budget project. So it was not Star Wars and no CGI in it. But who can erase Gustave Dor√© illustrations as part of the presentation? The above comments, which in just four lines prohibit video as a piece of garbage, are very bad and unheard of. I am a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for these comments. Instead, I defend the art work that I think has value at all levels. It is a good idea to bring a Coleridge poem to the pupils in such a way that it raises their gratitude and awakens their compassion for the subject that the mariner of the past offers.
