Disney has done again. The best way to Timone and Pumbaa has been raised again to tell us how they met and help the Lion when she needs. I love this film and watch it regularly. It shows how Timone lived with his family and colleagues before he stopped getting his dream house and adventure. Then it meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they are looking for Timon's home wants and constantly fail, which is funny if Timone gets more and more things. Then the Lion returns and we see more of his childhood than we did in previous movies 2. Others, you already know.
