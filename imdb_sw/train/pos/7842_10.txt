so half way through the season, I've been drinking at school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show has been canceled half, which is crap. I think the supporters of this show should write a fox and ask them at least to finish the picture so that the season can be given to the DVD later. perhaps they will see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. I liked to show and look forward to every day after OC. Can you imagine my absence when I returned to try and watch the show just to discover that it was lost? Without saying, I am very unhappy with the fox right now. even more after discovering that NO TO GO IN FILMED. I mean, if you are going to work on the project, at least finish to see what happens. The half-show show is like a half-made car, not so much. fox, the final film of the damn and give some fans of some peace show.
