This kind of documentation often thinks too much. This movie seems to take all the views and let the viewer do what to do with the information presented. It sadly these poor people should work, this film has a good job to show the bad side of the sweat stores. Mardi Gras Film: Made in China was a great way to show the world how something like small as festive celebrations could affect the lives of many people in other countries. I had to watch this film in English class where we used our time to talk about sweat shops and how other people are trying to get rid of them and this film has helped to find the headline. It was a good, very good movie and I would recommend anyone to see it, opening your eyes.
