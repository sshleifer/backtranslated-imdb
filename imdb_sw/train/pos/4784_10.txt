It is good to see the film and real people with a sense of trust. Sissy Spacek is so quite persuasive as a simple daughter, but beautiful, Robert Farnsworth, <br /> <br /> who finally, in his last role, gets to show good performers. It's hard to believe that this is a film of David Lynch. It's slow and even, sweet and moving. One of the best unless you like the car is running, sex events, and violence.
