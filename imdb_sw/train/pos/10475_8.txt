My friend suggested this movie, citing my voice and deleting to Des Howl, the main character of the movie. I think how much I can see it and maybe a little more, I don't know very much if it's not interesting. <br /> <br /> This is a special job, the only movie in which this can be more than the same look will be Romance True, not for the content or style of the cinema or the fastest conversation (Whale Music is much more, well, relaxed) .) But instead they both represent modern love stories. Overall I am a great fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example I strongly recommend a hard hard score) with this particular film. It has innocent innocence, Des is not always a boy, but there is something about him that draws a kind of sympathy.
