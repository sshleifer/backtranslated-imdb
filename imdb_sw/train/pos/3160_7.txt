This view has all the common characters in the comedy: a good man, stupid, miserable, rich girl ... but installed in 70 years. That's the only difference that has other TV tips. I don't know how you can love this show. His humor is sad! I mean, joke is a direct ... The most common discussion is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you (viewers laugh) Jackie: Fez you are the offender (viewers laugh) Fez: Yes I am (the audience is happy and shouting "This is not funny. I think that if you didn't laugh (I don't know how you call it in English, sorry) you don't laugh at all. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is insulting to the public. I love more than the American race, but this is not quite good. I would give 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)
