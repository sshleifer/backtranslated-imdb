I agree with all the exhibitions, I used the tissue box to watch this film. It had the legitimacy of honesty and it became true in every way. The question that I came to raise represents the current understanding about animal treatment. I had a very difficult time to be slaughtered at the beginning of the sheep and goats, and the sheep died with his neck stiff and divided the blood when his life was torn off was hideous. This is the age of "no animals hurt in the production of this argument." Iphigenia was done at the end of 70 years before coming to the simulation of the computer. What? Is it possible to make these animals die? Or were these animals killed by art?
