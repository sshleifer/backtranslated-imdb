I looked at the Child as part of the BCI Protective Store in Cultural Classics (including released by Crown International Photo) on DVD. I think it's a very good film. <br /> <br /> This movie takes many stories for a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, homosexuals, anxiety, and murder, all in one spot! <br /> <br /> Lead operators do a reliable job. And, I've got a conspicuous plot to be reliable and interesting. However, cast, especially for bicycles, provides good performance, especially when killing lines for more than a few words. Perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors. Several characters, in particular, were very honest. <br /> <br /> The music score is a spot-on, at times, tempo, and by moving the story forward. I have found a real music cure. I saw in the opening of the opening that the movie showed the music "Food," I called; but, he could not get anything ... \ t , a little help - of course, he wrote, produced by the star in the "Weekend and Babysitter."
