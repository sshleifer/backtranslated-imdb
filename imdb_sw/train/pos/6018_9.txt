I saw this in the first 70 years (when I was 16 years old), and in spite of short-term, meetings, demonstrations, etc., once the desert part began all wrecked in the environment and I love. (However, it has a very good age.) Back there I was in seemed a few few. All obstacles seemed to focus on lack of action and details. With joy I am no longer in a few. It shows (in some form of prophecy) a political loss, chaos, struggle, cruel oppression, business and ongoing fraud. Appreciation for this court film has grown, and I'm happy about it.
