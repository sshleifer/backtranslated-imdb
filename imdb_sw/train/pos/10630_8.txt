I think it is unfortunate that the leading comment on this film includes the words "Clueless and unpleasant." I think it's a very good movie and excellent entertainment. One can stop the unbelief of a man as a male and a female woman can fall in love, have a child and live together happily at all times. But it's always amazing to see it playing in the movie and have the heart of a hot person. Is it impossible? There are more serious events that are not addressed in other movies. Acting is good, the script is funny. The only suggestion is that the story can end when the family goes away from its original home rather than expanding on exploring whether someone has homosexuals.
