When I saw him for the first time I was very impressed. The director made a very strange environment, especially the end. Through all viewers of stories they can expect that Richard will kill Tomas really or will do it first. Older and mature man prayed for a small lifetime. It's amazing. Every time I look I enjoy! Of course it is as good as every movie of work but I think it's acceptable. Thank you very much Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movies! I advise everyone to see it. I'm sure people are witnessing and they will have a good time.
