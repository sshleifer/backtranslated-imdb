I see the DVD version appears to have events or lines not included in the FRF registration and launch. They are proving that they can win the right to stay in FRF unless the green team. <br /> <br /> Another example is like the failure of simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin screaming. <br /> <br /> I think the VHS version except one of ABC's can have all the missing stuff. Otherwise I would like to know it is the release of the DVD there are none. The DVD that I watched feels edited for television.
