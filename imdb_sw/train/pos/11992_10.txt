Since I remember, I loved the birds and flying. I am now a university and a personal experimental license and check that business. I can never remember why I was so overlooked by that until I got the old Tail Spin tapes on my home and hit me, this is it. My parents bought every tape they had and this was the only show that I would look like a child. I had the head I grew up and I can still call it today. It's very amazing and I plan to buy a DVD soon! In fact it is good for children and adults and is not quite available. I can't get enough to show this.
