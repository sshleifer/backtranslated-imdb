This film struck me as a project that had many right links, but somewhere on the way they didn't come together. I don't know who did it, but it has a little sense of Disney-esque. While its parts are not possible (like when a young man pre-work in a public office) and they tend to avoid the story being taken seriously, there is a normal health measure (whatever it is) to focus on things and perspective. Acting is the same. Interestingly, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is lobbying, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... off. It is interesting to see how she works hard to keep the balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two desires: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player himself, it was very difficult to watch Frankie trying to be self-reliant on the boys' team, but it does a good job to show the fight he is facing. I read somewhere that he is not really ballerina, but the editing of this film did a great job of making her play not only ordinary but beautiful. In general, it was a good film on honesty and ambition, but his Mischa Barton star did not achieve the realization level we saw during his exhibition in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", with its small but frightening performance against Haley Joel Osment in "Sense of 6."
