A British newspaper survey appears to be involved in the fact that critics are aware of Toby Young, a journalist whose real life experience of this film. The main word here is "base". How to Lose Friends is a romcom of fraud. Sidney Young has joined the prestigious laughter in New York, where he keeps gaffe after gaffe before finally getting justice and doing it. This involves him to export, and the movie has several important points about the credibility of the news. However, it does not go beyond: The main substance remains comedy which faces Sidney's misadventures. The script has its own cake and it grows because Sidney is a buffoon of stupid, meaningless at the same time as a skilled, highly skilled writer. This competition is not a matter, because Simon Pegg (like Sidney) is working very well. <br /> Jeff Bridges attracts Sidney's editor very efficiently, and Kirsten Dunst is not known as finally the collision of Sidney's poetry, with the Megan Fox side (who plays the stars of the air force), I can only say this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my stuff, and buy myself a ticket to take my place on your side as your partner. Of course, since I am a 56-year-old English accountant, you may not get my permission to persuade them, but it is there on the table however. From how his short-term career has been so far now, one can think of it a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on the role that causes the kind of actress who can think of: however, he does well, with skill, and very sex. This girl will go away. There is a good support from various characters - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from England, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. There are several times of laughing, and I am more excited. As it was, the word F makes the appearance when you don't need it, though at least a couple of these are very interesting.
