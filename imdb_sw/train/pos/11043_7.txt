Malefique pretty much has a viewer from beginning to end with its destructive status. Nearly the whole movie is put in the prison cell that surrounded 4 characters of Marcus and his lost boy is a wonderful way. Recently the detainees find a former slave magazine behind the bricks that are associated with its deficit of black and black theme leading to escape from the cell. From here everything is related to revealing the secret of the book and its details of the flight from prison. That causes some accidents on the way out of the cell into an unknown light. In fact I think the story is bad and the last end is good but to me the latter is pretty loosely tied together. However I was glad until the last time because the atmosphere of the movie is unique and a small set and cast. It kills it raw and beautifully ... it does not take a year to promote your back and the magic theme is also done very well and reminds me of the hell theme in Hellraiser. Malefique feels to feel dirty and cool with green color. Sometimes you wonder if the truth or the world of magic is shown here is the guest ... when the lost boy leaves his fingers and sleeps on the breast of Marcus seems to be normal, so how strange can enter doors freely? With its movie budget creates a unique atmosphere and attracts the viewer in a very different way than most of the shockers of the kind do. I just want the story to cause more finale. Several elements like a guest with a camera, other obsession prisoners and books with doll vaguely doll describing the end is not recommended tight in the story. However, I will keep my eyes open for other movies from Valette's director, although his extinguish seeing is making the Hollywood remake of "One Missing" which was wearing off and useless already in Miike version.
