This is the most beautiful dub I have heard with Disney, as well as coping with the best situation from the most horrible sounds in the sounds, themes, characters, discussion in Kiki delivery service. Urrrhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially deviation from the usual heroine. This has a hero and heroine (though I do not really use the hero & heroine here, since Miyazaki falls out of the theme with a common theme). As always, after being brought by Spirited off, they were surprised by Mononoke, concerned with Grave of Fireflies, and touched deeply with Majo no Takkyuubin, this beginning and a little doubt in my part. He wonders if this will be the first dud of Ghibi. Well, just at the end of just yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving a level of 10. I would like to give a 9.8 rate, but an extra 0.2 is there to share a good feeling by encouraging people to see the film. THE WARRANTY Somehow I see this as a sad film, people die in this, a robot alone, a place of neglect, and it ends with destruction. It is as if humans cannot live with much power. Part of the fall has given me a patched of Metropolis ending. It's just sad in some way. The program is obvious in most reviews and sound sounds too (as always). Joe Hisaishi is actually a Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. Those who can bring a film, a game, a life event, even a short time for a wonderful composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good feel movie that was part of the American movie in the past (it's a wonderful life etc. etc.). Yes, change things ....
