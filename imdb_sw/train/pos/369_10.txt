Certainly one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can't go through it without crying. I despise anyone to look at the Celie and Nettie, or Shug with the father and don't feel your eyes getting misty. Whoopie Goldberg should have one award for an awesome display. And for someone who says you can't love the film if you like the book, it's not right! I am a covenant of that.
