this is best to show what I think Jesus was real. Many movies show Jesus like to destroy, mislead, or torture. Jesus laughs, played, and was powerful when it was necessary. this is the type of people of Jesus that can be interesting, not the ordinary version of hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie took some independence, and tried to "fill the array." but fillers didn't seem impossible, or even impossible. one thing I can say, was that he had never explained what the romans were against Jesus (the movie has been shown that the romans were the main driver of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authority was against the idea). It was seen that the movie was being done well. One example was a young boy's opinion who was called "scores." It is believed that the mark (or symbol of John) was a young man known in the garden of Gethsemane whose clothes were cut and naked (14:51). I feel that they tried to make the film appropriate (even in spirit) was possible.
