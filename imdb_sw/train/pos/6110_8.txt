As "My Sassy Girl", this film is based on a true story released from the Internet, but that's where the end is the same. The story is usually about this young man called Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents employ a teacher called Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes out of a bad situation, but happens to be old similar to him. Adding to that other obstacles, martial arts (bandits are always after Ji-Hoon revenge), a little girl who loves love who is after her, her ability to teach lessons, and usually you can feel the whole story. Did I say it is a romantic comedy? This film has good combat scenarios, great sense of humor and a lot of spunk, due to the beautiful chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. Sexual matters work for that reason. And, I must say, I'd like a girl more like Kim Ha Nuel than the girl from "My Sassy Girl" (personality-wise, at least). He has a spunk, but it's more on a good, sweet, beautiful heart. The characters have already been highly recommended (so someone may say that he was under the hill climbing "My Sassy Girl" - a barrier that worked for the movie on his loan), and the movie is very clever and very interesting. Type of story, though, about 2/3 of the way (where it walks on a normal, normal rate, where there is nothing interesting to happen), but close to the end, it takes again. In general, the enjoyable movie, good. 8/10
