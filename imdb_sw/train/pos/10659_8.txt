"I love the best perfume, it does not live longer ..." - The behavior of Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells this behavior of Helen Stanwyck of Helen, after receiving a bribe that she chose her husband in Tijuana ...! This verse hated me, and it was also seen as an example of this film - that's cheaper than it is expensive, because the person who likes the perfume has a 2 x 4 way is the best person to be around! I agree with some of the comments sent about Helen's visit to Lawson. Although his story says that he wants Lawson to be removed, he seemed to be attracted to his fire, and that the passion he had stirred in him could not be washed with the wave!
