I just know of another one movie that can compete with Night Opening and that Bergman '; s Persona. All movies are just amazing, they have a wealth of hard ideas to understand for the first time. We have a deep reflection on the relationship of art and life as one actor, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds himself in touch with the character he plays in the steps he may want. The death of one of his fans, a young girl who announces her love to Myrtle and she is beaten by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actress. He begins to ask himself a question related to his aging which begins to affect him until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much by Myrtle is one step away from complete spirituality. The place where he kills the spirit of thinking (or not) of the dead girl is one of the most exciting events I have seen in Cassavets. The last movie with a mental show on behalf of the director as he filmed the venue of the venue where he himself and Gena Rowlands fills the area, since Myrtle comes a very drunken night of opening to make his part correctly. This area was carried out by the wind, with a live audience, laughter is a real, chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands quite amazing. If you would like Persona or you are attracted to a film that offers good ideas together with this great entertainment movie will do you well.
