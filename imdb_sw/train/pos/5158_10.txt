There is something that is both positive and positive about this section. From the beginning, the tension situation is made up of the knowledge that a certain planet will arise within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have overcame the destruction of the locals, all of whom seem to have already stopped for unknown parts, except for the old library. The library's counselor is a prideful advice on where all citizens have been interrupted by a crisis that the three employees of Enterprise employees find themselves unexpectedly thrown into different world differences. Kirk finds himself in the same time as the 17th century of England, when Spock and McCoy are beaten in a damaged, stored waste. Connecting between the two stories, and the different risk factors that men find themselves to be used properly, and returning to the current unknown space, while the minutes are counting under the explosion of the planet. A thoughtful and practical text reflects this feature, and the activity affected by Mariette Hartley as a woman transferred to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the registrar of urbane. Some reminders of the village part of the City in the Eternal Thing, this travel story is a powerful and compelling finale for the series, which concluded one part later. This should be one of the best of the whole series, especially the extraordinary giving the lowest quality of the third season in total.
