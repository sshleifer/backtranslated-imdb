This work is surprising in its proper direction of youth life during its implementation. Although this is a comprehensive generalization, parents of that time were also involved to be real parents, and those who were at home liked to be too far from the real issues, where their children are concerned. This film teaches us how to let go, even if it is painful, and it does it in a good, hateful way, but it describes Foster talking about philosophy of life. I liked the area. It was my favorite ear in the film, in fact. <br /> <br /> Transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life is going on, and so should we. Skateboarding of Baio through the packet of goons and beat them meant to show us that times of anxiety will pass, and we are meant to find their way, at the best time. The entire example of "moving," and life-march, exists in all the film, and serves to give us hope, at the end. I love this movie, although I don't look at it often, as it seems to make me melancholy. It should not be viewed by young children, and perhaps only those raised in the 1970-80 years would like. <br /> <br /> It is 7.4 / 10 level from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
