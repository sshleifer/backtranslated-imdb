In my opinion, THING OF GUY is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and quite good chick flick that guys also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles shouted like a wife-in-law and his wife-in-law. If you ask me, they look like screens like magic. You can also feel their chemistry among them. Before we close this, I would like to say that the exhibition was a high class, the trend was meaningless, the production structure was good, making was perfect, and the clothing was perfectly done. In conclusion, for anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You are lots of lots and exciting, therefore, go to a video shop, rent or white, kick up with a friend, and watch.
