Last year we were awarded by two movies about Truman Capote to write a book that this film was held - Capote and Infamous. I can't imagine a film like this being done in 1967. This, a strong and violent drama; he raised the status of the classic film and the beautiful trends of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on the Hot Tin House, Expert, Jungle's Blackboard). It's amazing that Robert Blake, who made a star in this film, has had many late problems that might be related to his killer's film in this film. This is a film that sits with you after watching.
