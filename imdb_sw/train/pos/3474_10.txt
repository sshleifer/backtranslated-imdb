This film should only see for the best Jared Harris display of John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris is not the same as Lennon; His character, words, position, inspiration and view are fresh Lennon. Best scene: Lennon in the local cafe with the opposite words to the stuttering fan as Paul McCartney & Wings' "Silly Love Songs" deserves the status # 1 in America.
