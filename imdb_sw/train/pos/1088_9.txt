Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are well beaten as a middle-class couple who want to build their dream house. It all starts with planning and prudent prospects, all of which are hit by bits and many problems with the previous budget blast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of laughter (even if the story is a little thin) sure to invite fans of stars or late 1940s of the comedy style of Hollywood. The right view comes when the contractor goes through all the cost of costs, which must be seen by the majority of 1948 viewers. certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
