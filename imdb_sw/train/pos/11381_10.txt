The best part of An American In Paris is a long chain of ballet at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the lives of several journalists. Kelly has been established as a painting of Paris, so the sequence is a logical ending of music that starts with life and energy, Gershwin tunes, and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was able to do it here - it's a little different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of all the film as one hit by ballet offers quite sure thing. It is not surprising that the finished series 'That is Entertainment' after all MGM music stations went!
