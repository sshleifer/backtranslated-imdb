This film has some of the most comediki talks and unexpected quotes that have gathered in one film! The program is not cracked, but interesting quips are enough to make a difference. This is a timeless movie for all the years that is sure to please. If the art form of cinema is very entertaining; and for a great star like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... how can you go wrong? Comedic discussion and time like this has not been appreciated, and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 film: The Pit Pit, by Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film refreshed and received poor feedback and viewers' views. To reach the realistic comedic conversation is art.
