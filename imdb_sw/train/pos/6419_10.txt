This film is the best military movie. It can't be a modern Hollywood Movie, but that doesn't matter. Hollywood has the merit of the sacrifice of good for good entertainment, but it is not for this movie. Other viewers have found that this film is very slow for their taste, but? as a retired soldier? I appreciate the speed at which filmmakers took deliberately to tell their story as much as possible from two hours and nine minutes given. The story itself has been told to return several times over, but it remains for professional soldiers ?? and African Africa therefore? to report on the story as presented by the film staff, and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work being the Navy River, and his life as the Navy River beyond its conquest, is not the only story given. There I am also a story of how the Chief Sunday Sunday Officer refused the illegal command of his Official Officer of the Commandment that the Chief Executive Officer of the Grade 2 Brashear is not available in his experimental dive no matter how well he did, and paying the one-off price Stripe and change function. He also told a true story of how Brashear got three Hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the Spanish coast of the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another soldier who was in the line of the unlocked line that would be locked him in two if Brashear had not expelled him and took his own shot. This was a complicated story that was worth telling, and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes is not enough to describe the full story, and I can tell you from the deleted pictures on the DVD that the staff have tried to tell the story as perfect as possible. As a professional soldier, I was delighted to see the good news as described in detail, and to see the customs and respect of the navy preserved in a natural and complete way.
