I recently bought a full of Gothic American series on DVD and lived up to my memories. I was very grateful to be able to check for the first time events that have never been approved. I liked the "Fire Ring" especially in stories that I have never seen before. Gary Cole is amazing as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a good player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Justin Coombs was also very good. In fact, the cast of all there were good talents and there is a great chemistry for each other. It is a disgrace that has been overthrown by the network (by a large group of censors) because it was created for adults to watch. The combination of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic music and a variety of fears, provided the brilliant attributes supported by the act of mind. I was very desperate for the devil at once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the angel who loved the "luster" more.
