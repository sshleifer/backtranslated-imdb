I loved this film, I saw this evening on a great movie cinema! The audience laughed at the most interesting things, and the speed was fun. <br /> <br /> I, as a singer and music director, question one part of Roby Keeler's voice in "Waterfall." with a high voice like the voice of Twitter which he used in all his sounds. <br /> <br /> What! Anyone knows if this was more closed by another singer? It seems to me. I would like to know. Thank you very much.
