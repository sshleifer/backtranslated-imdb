At least half an hour per week. I was not interested in anything on 3 major networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All power is interesting, although Larry can pull the time. In fact I have loved the figures of intermediate steps that bring the Hunter. Most of the other characters are also interesting. Siegfried and Roy's side is sometimes fun. Animation is a high score, and the best CG best that has been made on the weekly TV show. Usually when they hire big names for stars in the show, they try to hide the poor script or characters. It's not quite true in this show though, There are two characters who were weak and improved with the sound of doing, but the total of the characters stand alone. <br /> <br /> This is obvious to 16 and more. There is nothing here that many children have never heard before, and many jokes would just fly over their heads. It is obviously not bad and dirty as the South Park, but it brings some "Bash everyone" similar to feel. One example is that you are disturbed by both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in one place. The Father of Beauty and other Dreamworks products like Shrek also feel like the spiritual supporters of Animaniacs, Pinky and Brain, and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor. It may not be as common as Spielberg's TV series, but it's still good. I hope it completes this season well, and is renewed for next season. Otherwise I can't find the reason for looking again 3 great.
