Interestingly, a well-designed killer is a worthless story of death and evil. The city's physician is trying to find out who, or what, is doing a series of powerful sexual killings. <br /> <br> Incubus is a secret secret, with a horrible killing system, which builds up to lose and decrease the weather. Scenes killings are intense and gory, so this is not a film for squeamish! John Hough's direction, along with the wonderful features of music, mixing and creating a dark atmosphere of fear that uses film. It also carries a variety of Gothic vibe as well. The best places to hide the image and the work of a stylish camera also show. <br /> <br /> Sent is not bad either. John the Great of Cassavetes works hard as a new doctor in the city. It is also a good presentation of Kerrie Keane as a local journalist, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a stressful young man. -defined and re-tested. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
