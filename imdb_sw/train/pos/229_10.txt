In the modern world of digital manufacture, there is no computer that can replace the actress and author. Alas, this kind of "character-based behavior" of the film is very rare these days. Duvall's performance and James Earl Jones are faithful to their expectations of the audience. I wonder if this film was made for TV? It has a personal "personal quality" for details. It's less to say that all the exhibitions are unique. The only thing that takes it from being a cinematic movie is the lack of a great movie star, but a beautiful picture is not everything. How can the gifts required by Jones and Duvall produce a very good job at age where administrators make for digitizing?
