This movie is probably my most popular movie. Miriam Flynn is best like Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a professional comic. Some of the cast are amazing, and the film is really true. The obvious satire of awesome films, as well as moving zany. If you are interested in fun, comedy filled in the evening, then go with this classic lease. You'll all the way through!
