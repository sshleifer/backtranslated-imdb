And here is another evidence of claiming that we should worship Italian worship and approve it to be the smallest of small forms in fear. Emilio Miraglia of the "Red Queen Kills Seven" is the perfect nature of nature, production, stylish, musical talent, and excellent killings. It is a wonderful giallo (released in the year 1972 gold) which is about five of every fan of Italian movies. The story of the story is not only to produce your black-and-white killer, but it combines good motives for retaliation and the story of the "Red King" murderers. At an early age, their grandfather tells their brothers to fight regularly with Kitty and Evelyn about a stupid woman who once every 6th of April, kills seven people whose sister is the last victim of the inevitable. Fourteen years later, Kitty has been a successful choreographer of the testing unit (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing begins. Sister Evelyn was a real sinner, but she moved to America recently ... Or has she? Complex is still compelling and involving red dirt thrown to you every two minutes and the character of the Red Queen is definitely the most attractive killer in the history of the giallo. His face can never be seen, but it dresses red blood and provides a ghastly laugh whenever it made a new victim. He is not very gentle or, as his victims are beaten with a dagger, found behind the cars and even treated in the courtyard! The latter is one of the most violent acts (= more violence) I have ever seen! What more can you ask for a request? Some of the classy weaknesses and taste, perhaps? Beautiful female traders got more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and Sybil Danning limited. Emilio Miraglia is not a very good director, if he did this and it was recommended the same "Night Evelyn Come From Hell", but its influence and importance are NOT forgotten.
