Once I was at university and we had international rights, the Russian part was the Soviet-era poster, "Ne boltay!", Which means "Do not!". I have "interpreted" for "generation" of TV observers like "Don't Be Gladys Kravitz!" (based on the neighbor's ee on "Bewitched"). However, when you see the results of speculation in Pvt. Snafu short "rumors", you see that it's not quite surprising. In this case, the ignorant soldier always hears something about bombs and immediately thinks that Axis Power has attacked the United States. So, he tells someone, who tells someone else, who tells another person, and it goes on. As in the "Russians Comes, Russians Comes", the story is hit more and more consistently each time, so that when it comes to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it is more than a propaganda of WWII - complete with a word of contempt for Japanese - but it should say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course, since they had the writing of Dr Seuss and Mel Blanc sounding, it is not surprising that these descended very low. Value to see.
