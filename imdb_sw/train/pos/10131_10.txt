In the first part of Friends, which opened on September 22, 1994 "One Where Monica Gets a sleeping partner" there is a song that plays like Rachel sitting on the window towards the end of the show, the playing line is: "If you ever need to hold" Does anyone know the music of the artist or the title of the song? It looks like it's a great song .... I'd like to get a copy of it. Thank you for help. I am looking for an album / cd is up so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have an exhibition that is available for shopping and enjoy this show regularly. It seemed only to be reliable ... thanks to the hours of entertainment you gave over the years.
