This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, carefully written and appealed to those who do not have a 'pickist movie' indeed. Do not make a mistake - there are some good movies that have a great appeal, but when you go to a movie that comes from "everyone looks at it" - you know you're in the middle or not having a comment. This had a very good humor - despite many people perhaps just looking out. Employees were shown their characters and aplomb and I thought there was more than a "personal" personality in this film. It has an appeal for children, as well as adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and drugs! Good, non-fiction movies based on public use. This is necessary to buy.
