Far more in texture and character than even classics from 30 to 50 years. George C. Scott was born to Scrooge, as he was born to Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the many 20th century executives. Scrooge's behavior as played by Mr. Scott appears to fly off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought Scrooge the most powerful, most powerful, but still moving more than any screening of its predecessors in the role of the most important man in the 18th century London. Mr. Scott appeared to bring Scrooge to a more private, understandable but very contradictory; His role was carried out by the chief executive Scott always brings to the screen: however his usual voice of bellicose can sometimes be brought to a whisper, almost like soliloquy, if he could blow up a Christmas holiday one breath, but reveals his human weaknesses in his line upcoming. He would add Scrooge sour and round, and Scrooge incomprehensible, of all mercy in the same area. It is really amazing and great performance of his generation.
