Kali's eyes are a preliminary film that is still emerging in the activities of a cult group in India that include German psychologists who have learned how to control their will and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be "cured" through powerful techniques (which can stimulate the pain of the night and physical pain and suffering to release the pent demons into them. The film has been shown as a series of vignettes about Taylor-Eriksson's group - a group of worship mentioned above. The first part is slower than others but serves well to lay the foundation for all the film. All of it resembles an intellectual film @ ck and some of the most important intervals that are sown in a mixture (full-dust, some year) to make you happy. <br /> <br /> I am looking at this. It may be amazing, but the concept is good neato and offers in the right advertising. 8/10.
