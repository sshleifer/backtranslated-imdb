The first word that comes into my mind after watching this film is "beauty". Beauty is round, in play for actors (Andie is better than every day), in well-designed shots, and in the idea of ​​the authors of red - Love. I think Kenny's character is only white spot in these three women 'otherwise wrong with predictable life. His interaction makes the character of Andie live as much as entertainment as possible. When he was gone, it became clear that we could not fully understand and hold our inner desires and holy desires. The fact that Andie succeeds because of this loss is not bad, rather it shows that life occurs in any kind, even in a small British village, which is fully displayed. <br /> <br /> Another reason I like this movie is that it's all the UK - all that house and "fags" and accents :))). And Andie again does a very good job! It is embarrassing that this film received low score. 10 out of ten!
