Holly discusses the issue of sex with a child that spreads around the world (2 million children are infected every year) and is doing it consistently and without a trick - a long process that the Priority Film team does with great success. American American Ron Livington star films with a guest Thuy Nguyen, an Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring what is common to people in the famous K11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it is faced with a difficult topic, the film continues during laughter and hope when we get to know the characters around, and put a two-hour film to one that is very difficult to watch. I am glad the film if this is to bring the world to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's great and everyone's film must see.
