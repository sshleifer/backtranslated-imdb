I saw two movies at the weekend, One was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both movies are made for "sound" but only the world. The basic difference is the story with the Director. Vipul Shaw made his unforgettable mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Indian Indian movies. His drawing for Charecteres is perfect. Seemingly taken from Gujerati Play is amazing, treatment is amazing and some variations. With the voice when the movie is put together the first thing the Director of Sound can do is a sign of the music director and this person (Malik player in this period) deserves to beat six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good Director like Vipul Shah should use it to please Finacier and Grandmother who cannot find these numbers. No director of Music can beat good songs without being seen as open in this film. There are no songs with any songs and they describe the story of the story except the back music and the western version of Bharat-Natyam. The great role of playing with Father and Son is good to do with Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. Its interesting scenes are quite clear. A good director locks himself up with good actors and he is ready to wait until good news comes along with in this super movie. Then we have an inexpensive publisher as a publisher of Sharukh Khan who will stand under the crack of the attack and promote garbage as "Kaal" to identify themselves at the cost of Art, and around the talent of the border, and they rebuild the investment before the word. get close. These are a locust voice that looks at the uncomfortable audience to create an "Film Farce" that was given by Bollywood Chamcha and many of them are in the Media.
