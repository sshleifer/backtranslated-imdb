This is very frightening, and in many places, a thoughtful game. I was so impressed with the film, not just for good and good work, but that special movie was released. Many movies involving spy or war are filled with the Brit or speaking power, but not. This is not about this kind of war, it is about a war between a man and his position in life, a US spy in Germany, as an evil helper no one can forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will return home as a hero, but his heroic position must continue to be the secret of the government. Return to the US, Campell meets Nazi supporters with Nazi opponents, providing interesting, internal and external conflicts. Nolte more than eliminates the role, and resembles a good plot for what it asks.
