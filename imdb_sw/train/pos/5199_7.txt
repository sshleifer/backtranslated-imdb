Not only this is a good African and American comedy, but one of many groups of the American religious group. I've recently purchased a collection of Rudy Ray Moore. If you like old karate movies and black comedies, this is for you! They don't have movies like this again. My whole family is a blow to the film, so this website is an extreme support in solving many debates. I am used in Iraq right now. This helps me stay connected with the world that I know in states. Thank you IMDb.I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolemite rules! Don't just take my word for it, see for yourself. Ten lines are plenty to comment on one movie I think, but if it gets a point, I'm all!
