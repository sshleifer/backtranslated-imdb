Sea is Watching has been given in the original study of Akira Kurosawa, and is actually a hot and warm film. Watch it will be fun! Kei Kumai as the director is certainly not the same as the former but eternal master (especially the events of the film at the beginning of the film has a very serious act), but the general nature and environment are very fun. Something else missing here: Corruption has always been able to allow the characters to be even more what they show and do. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was her magic on placing a shot; and perhaps this script was not fully available so far. Maybe we lose the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is one good and beautiful film, but it's no Kurosawa. Expect that it can be very much ...
