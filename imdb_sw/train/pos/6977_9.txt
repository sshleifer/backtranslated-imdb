Im too late for Caprica, because it is a good series of prequel for Battlestar Galactica. In fact it has a fast start, but of course take a quick time after the new sessions continue. I have heard some good news about future sessions and visitors of the first season. <br /> <br>> This Fi Fi league is certainly a pleasure to fans who love the combination of both music. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does an amazing job, with Polly Walker as Willow Clarice! <br /> <br /> Pre-value look! Take Caprica on Friday at 9:00 pm in mid-SYFY
