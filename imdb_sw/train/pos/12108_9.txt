Desire! Ja-pan (called Baked Fresh! Japanese Baked) is a story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make a perfect Japanese or Japanese, and Japanese, which will be recognized worldwide. <br /> <br /> Of course, that's out. In fact, strive! Ja-pan is not true about bread, but the answers that come after eating bread, and pun that comes with answers. The series is loved because of these punches. From the popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan, and Dragon Ball for preventive movies like Matrix and Lord of Pete. That's all there. What makes this title different from other names like Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? In fact, unlike others who use cooking for world domination, strive! Ja-pan is just a comedy. Indeed, there are times when stories turn into a game, or even kill, but the comedic situation makes you laugh. You will be laughing at their own heavenly view. Just watch. Just remember that this is also false, although some of the bread done here is the basis of the real bread, eating the Japanese house # 2 will not allow Super Saiyan or turning your body to the ball.
