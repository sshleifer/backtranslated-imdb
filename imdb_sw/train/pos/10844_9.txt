This reminded me of Tap Tap, to a greater extent. It is the story of the band to make the journey of reconciliation, but things are not the same. I was particularly impressed with Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You have felt compassion for him, however he had some anger over him. It's a good movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band to get wrinkly, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, very recommended.
