I loved Top Guns. It had my interests. Score forecasts, development of the best character and line of the story. It is similar to Noon's top for that city people seem weak and afraid to stand for the villain. This film has other quality actors who have no chance to share all of its talents. Also some executives did not receive credit for their duties. Denver Pyle was a very good man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor is the best in their responsibilities. Sterling Hayden did the best that he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a desperate character. He seemed happy that two men might have fought him. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without loads? Especially women.
