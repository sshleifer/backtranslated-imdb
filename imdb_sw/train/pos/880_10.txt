Perhaps the best movie of the year for me. This small French film puts on the office of Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who uses his days to work on other men, without funding, and to be a source of their complaints and lunch discussions that are very clear to him, for being part of the deaf, reads the lips. Changes are made when he includes a new meeting that discussed Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. The ongoing relationship between them is a film center. The dependency of each other, for many reasons, binds them. Carla is attracted to Paul and the fact that he makes him feel, what is seen, at first. Paul has nothing to take away his feelings because he needs his help. He owes money to the local gangster and plans to steal from him that will involve Carlas' ability to read the lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film on the emphasis / normal game is a wonderful chemistry between two stars. In the entire film, regardless of other characters on the screen, you can feel this wonderful bond between Carla and Paul. I can't remember when I have seen that psychology among the two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives good performance (won French Cesar for the best actor). You can't feel like you are looking at a piece of acting, this is really Carla. Chameleon as Vincent Cassel is also amazing. He makes a distasteful, attractive character. I loved this film because of the two people, and twice as I watched it I wanted to go back to the movies and share it again.
