Freddy's film is the last nightmare is awesome and horrible as every dream of Elm Street, it has the Comedy essence about it, it also has all the other films, but one can say that you can't find Freddy Krueger scary, if you would come with this person in Your dreams you can't see him even more horrible with the essence of the comic on him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care about killing that he finds it very funny, and Freddy also has the comic games of comic with them, which in his own way is very aggressive, using its comic ways I think that makes the movie horror Nightmare street elm what it is today, Authors are very clever to make Krueger Comic and scary contrary to Jason Vorhees, who can't say anything and had no witches to fear his victims, Movie This is almost as much as Freddy's wizard gets and I would recommend to anyone who has a sense of humor and the way "Falling Sleep!".
