This movie started me on a Nick Cage kick. It's a perfect story of losing and turns - movie of mind and goes. Of, of course, Dennis Hopper was ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are a perfect pair to catch an irresponsible person who has fallen on their web. Everything about this movie is good - movies, speed stories and end end all. Cage exceeds what he does well - not being a hero to act but everyone who is found in the traps of life.
