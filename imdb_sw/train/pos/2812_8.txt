"Silverlake Life" is a document and was open and direct. True, it was more like a home movie, and if you want to fill it faster, see something else. And not the meaning of tears. But I mean that in a good way. It shows two men who love each other and how suffering from AIDS affects their quality of life every day. It is very difficult to say if this was a good film or not, because it was so disturbed that I had to find other ways to respond. It is a fascinating film, in fact the most interesting, trustworthy documents I have seen. These two men are very faithful if their lives have been reduced to basic parts. It makes the production of river wood for AIDS appear to be urine and heartless. These people made this film themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The place that Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and tell him the payment is a real thing.
