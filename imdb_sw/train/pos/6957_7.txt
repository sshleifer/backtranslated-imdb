Super Ex-Girlfriend is a recreational movie no less. <br /> <br /> The story is a simple calm. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the lowway and joins her. At the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be the same, but Matt finds that it is G-Girl. The first time that seems to be very cool for Matt but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and troubleful. So he decides to break him and talk to his friend Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very mad and begins to take revenge on her former boyfriend. I love so much in the film is the events where G-Girl is cooking on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role then her character from the horrible Movie Saga. <br /> <br /> I offer this 7 movie out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes good comedy.
