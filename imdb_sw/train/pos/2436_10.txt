In general I love something less and enjoyable, so this film should not apply to me. But it took me from the beginning. The story of family choices and challenges are obvious, but it raises the question from time to time: "What if my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did because I felt really what the people were feeling felt. It was in difficult places to look, but more difficult to turn. Stories are true, and sometimes life is hard to watch! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence, or special effects: good news is all good news itself. The most beautiful and unexpected stories are all true. As a real life, you don't know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
