Dadell Steel's Daddy, a fun story. This movie magnified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that? In these times "Heather has two Mommies" (or what ever, you fill the blanks) is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With the responsibilities of the father that I was popular I hoped this would be Daniell Steel Saga another. It's a disappointment that you have to end. Each character was important and did a good job involved. I would like to see every character developing over the years. I liked this movie, it's one that I will watch every time it is. Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but no odd sex or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Warning, get Kleenex ready. What is sad is that this side of family life is rarely displayed today in our entertainment, whether it is television or. Movie. Daniell if listening to you, You Go Girl, give us more.
