Robert A. Heinlein's first Starship Starship Troopers has been sent to recent years, everything to Paul Verhoeven's film in 1997 on a TV series, for several games. But none of these, to say, has taken the spirit of his novel. Often these games are not related, the television series was more than a stop, and the younger said on the film Verhoeven, better. Few do not know more, however, that in Japan, the animation solution was already prepared, released in the year of Heinlein's death. And, hope or not, in spite of its differences, this series of 6 parts is, conspiracy-wise, dealing with the most trustworthy of the Heinlein class. The most obvious of this series is the presence of powerful weapons, something that we had been reduced to in the Verhoeven film. As a book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on the action and transport of space, although we see the right amount of each other. When events occur differently in the book, the idea of ​​a book plot is. Rico and Carmen have a romantic barrier, but only a little more touched than in the book. While others may believe the conversation and cooperation of the character will be less than a book (finds a bit of anime treatment, but what do you expect?), But it's far more than a film. Heinlein's political views are only exciting, contrary to the film, where they are changed. The great success of the series, however, is the climatic war in Klendendo between the troopers and the bugs, which shows the kind of action from the suit suits we would like to see in the film version. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision next to that of Heinlein. And I think they did very well with this. If you can find this series, check.
