This film is about Japanese culture as it did the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical communication is more complicated for more than 7 people (especially for the public) so all who lie rather than embrace even when you are close friends / relatives. Playing for Ballroom includes keeping your hands around someone else and also with the public too! Never under the ballroom play is (the highest) very popular. The people who make Ballroom play in Japan seem like western witches ... many more would like to do but are blocked by culture. A favorite family film, which any amateur dancer would be happy with the dance style alone. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I think Japanese is the same as the rest of us - they also love to be included.
