I am not an ordinary expert on this site but when I see how this movie was hit down, I try myself to write comments and words on it. I was surprised to watch this film, maybe because Cat is everything I would like to be, I am not going to write tenants or open squares but there are some things I've found amazing, how they make people just mad. this is a very low-down movie, I'm not talking here, usually I enjoy it and say a little bit about it, when you like it on the movie is fun, and I was very happy 1h53 I stayed in the dark room. must be seen from time to time until the fun disappears away. let's try to be so bad about it. thank you for reading.
