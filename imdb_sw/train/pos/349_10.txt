Niita I stupid, but I loved the terrible movie of 2001, Valentine. It was well done, well written, well done, well directed, etc.! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were common (the death of Lily), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), quite awesome and amazing (Paige's death), and heartbreaking death (first place). I think the whole trap worked fine, especially three leads: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met, and got autographs from, while photographing this film - very good people!), And Marley Shelton. <br>> <br /> I am very sick of people calling this film "another string scream". This movie is, in any case, the Scream hippo. In fact, this film runs the ring around Scream. It really makes SENSE! Crying is also not the only movie to put the killer in his hand. Forgive me, but it looks like Scream is also a clone too (ahem ..., Friday 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think that the beauty of the killer cup is brilliant. It's amazing to see the face of sweet, squad to do all these awesome things. Another community (noseping out of the nose) makes an endless way! Finally you give me energy every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you didn't like it for the first time, check out Valentine again and give it another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Keep an eye on my new site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon ...
