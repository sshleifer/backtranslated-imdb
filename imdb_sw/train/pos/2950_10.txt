If you have been sad because you can't find a film on DVD, maybe 'Delirious' you want. How often do you laugh when you suspend a playback? I was too young to see Richard Pryor his great time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not as funny) I did not know when Eddie got a big part of his leadership. Now that I am an old man, and I have seen Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everyone STEALS from Eddie, while Eddie LOVINGLY rises from Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was a natural, amazing, motivating, thoughtful? and more. It was something that has never been seen. He was all we needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring with age? but once in time he was King, and 'Delirious' was a great fortress built. One of the most funniest routines of all time.
