I was in a bad mood when I saw this film first. For some reason it identified all my levels, tension in the family, solitude and want someone to share your life with. It was not hurt that someone would share your life with a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought a sound voice on this movie (very hard to find). He loved it and hoped that one day would come from DV
