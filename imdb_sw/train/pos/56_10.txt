This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. If this film is led by Larry Clark, then this story about school shooting would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and anything that caused that person to be unclean in the first place. <br>> <br /> Instead, the plot focuses specifically on the results of school bullets, and how it made survivors who survived. I had seen Philip's Busy in another film before, but Performance in this film is far, far better. The only other film that I saw by Erika Christensen is "Piga Fan" which made me almost want to watch this film, but she turned into a very good performance herself. This is one of the small movies that I found that it really could make me cry. Believe me when I tell you, that doesn't come out many times. <br /> <br /> The home room is a good film, and that's all too ...
