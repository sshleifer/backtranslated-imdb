When I have a great respect for the Disney legacy films, as of the late they are not really what I called "must-see". Atlantis appeared exciting from the first film poster and trailer, and thanked him for my expectations. Atlantis is a "mature" film of Disney for it has no songs (odd behavior for Disney Movies really), and focuses more on action and discovery than any recent Disney offering. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the foundation of the world, is remarkable, released as a muddy pond and ruins, and then slowly develop in a real environment, which, when usually containing a brutal reminder, become more and more interesting until paradise The tropical itself is reached. The presentation of the environment and the environment of the Atlantis only, without the song of the cheery you can use, gave the kingdom a more beautiful and awesome appearance. The inclusion of the Atlantean language, as well as the attempts to integrate into the legends of ancient civilizations, add to this, and work well. Also, except some of the events involving Mole's actions, it was not found to be a big part of the "children's" feature that I share with Disney movies. Instead, the major issues were the struggle to reach Atlantis, and the constant discovery of Atlantis, as the visitor Milo was able to learn all that he needed to know about the area by helping Atlanteans to discover their own historical parts they did not know about. Part of this involves the “weapon” of Atlantea, which is used at the height of the action that is due to lack of a good word, quite exciting. In fact, not all the story makes perfect sense, and the film does not have any new amazing feature produced by the computer, but, apart from the Toy Story movies, this is the Disney's favorite movies that I have seen in years.
