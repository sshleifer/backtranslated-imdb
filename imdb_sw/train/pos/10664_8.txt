Does anyone cry for tears when they watch this film? I LOVE it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It just makes you feel good. I look at the fast installing number and all the members thrown regularly and more !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a movie child, IMHO! I've never seen a game but I get angry when I read the comments that says the play was better than the film. The two are like apples and oranges. The filing process will never provide complete products that are faithful to the original work. I believe it is because of the fear of public isolation that most of the known works have been done with screens more than they are. This is a very good film, it is very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
