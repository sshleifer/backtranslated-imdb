I saw this movie with my father. I had to be a good boy, almost 15. It was on one movie the afternoon afternoon. In fact it gained momentum after the first half. <br /> <br /> All actors are best, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's included, they just play together well. I can watch this film at any time. Jokes are not corny but they are cunning and extreme at the same time that makes them hilarious. <br /> <br /> Comedy full for idle day.
