Never seen this film, based on the entertainment novel and Nicholas Katzenbach, and based on the first level gathered for production, we decided to look. "The only reason", while not a horrible film, takes great freedom and the original material that Jeb Stuart was not quite successful in his treatment. Arne Glimcher was directed. The first thing we think is when a young black man enters the interrogated village is police brutality. After all, sheriff Tanny Brown, and police officer Wilcox, have no compassion for beating Bobby Earl, who is convicted of killing a little girl. We are afraid of what the officials are doing to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then, the area changes. Evangeline, Mrs Bobby Earl has been sent north to ask Harvard's famous professor, a retired lawyer, the boy wants Paul Armstrong to defend. An older woman is sure enough for Armstrong to look at the case. She has also been proved innocent of the boy. Things are not what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man who serves at the center like Bobby Earl, comes to describe how he was linked to the murder of a little girl, and changed the case change. How it plays in the film, it is used to combine the viewer and distract the Armstrong from reaching the truth. This exciting game is fun with Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, a bright actor, makes a good impression like a sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of misusing her prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best executives. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Scarlett Johansson youth appear in support of the roles. The film, even with its errors, will not be satisfied.
