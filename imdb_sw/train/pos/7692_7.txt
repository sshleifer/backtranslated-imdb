First, I will give my rating for a general series; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I have taken three for this slide slide series after John Amos left. Do not do badly there were cases of hard blowing later but after Esther Rolle left for the season and returned. In February 1974, a very large-scale (with great overtones) started on CBS. It was the first TV, a show about the African and American families living in Chicago Projects in the 1970s. Designed by Norman Lear as to eliminate "Maude", he returned to the right scope and audience. <br /> <br /> Still since this show I have seen the comedy situation talking directly about family problems within the city. (Yes, there was a "South Fox" in Fox but 'it wasn't renewed.') John Amos as James Evans Sr. he was a great man of this family and acted like any family family with his unsafe children in life. Esther Rolle was a good student who was on the same page as her husband when their children were born. Ralph Carter as a young but very bright boy for his age but stuck in a school system that does not make his academic needs. The character of his character is similar to the founder of show Mike Evans who was Lionel Jefferson on "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died Dec. 2006) <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl aged 16 or 17 and she needs to deal with the risks of being a young woman in the ghetto streets. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is an example of a conscientious young man, who has a boyfriend who doesn't take life enough. <br /> <br /> Just set, all my favorite events include John Amos, except Penny Stories of Gordon's stories / Janet Jackson <br /> <br /> After losing to the character of James Evans, the show lost is quiet and the audience left. Esther Rolle left for the whole year, without wanting to play the second fiddle for JJ's smart-aleck "Dyno-mite"! He returned to the next season, having secured the guarantee that the author could even be imported. The neighborhood of Florida Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who finished passing the little girl Penny Gordon (10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's mother was abused by Totie Fields, Mother of Kim's Farm. In August of 1979 the festival died, and all of them dropped out of life projects. JJ artist was selling the idea to the comic-book company, Michael went off to college college. Wilona & Penny, Thelma's player and soccer player Keith + Florida all moved to a building in Chicago. It is not the end of the truth but at that time it was useless.
