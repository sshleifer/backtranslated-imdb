This is a movie of someone who thinks. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy the humor of the UK that can only turn into a classic ritual for you as it has for my wife and I - from the casting "voice" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as martians for overly simplistic people of this big bean which you can either sleep or watch carefully and enjoy any way. It is not for everyone, but if you would like to enjoy the simple humor that you take to quickly see the joke as it comes and you will enjoy this film.
