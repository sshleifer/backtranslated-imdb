I was very excited to go and see the "Milanese" film in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood well and fortunately published in the film of Milanese philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film describes a standard-working story of a couple of Milanese, starting from "birth" to death. The birthday party is common from any program that begins and involves all wedding guests in the back story of how the couple came and felt love. Life is hard at Milan's "urbe" and after the old days of practice have been more severe and more powerful, eventually the product: the child, who rather than strengthen the relationship of the marriage is weak because "selfish self" The most common today "metropolis" personality. All advertising settings and "creativity" under trouble conditions help you get better in the plot. We lose the values ​​of life and this looks good and deeply in this beautiful and bright movie from the director of Senza Pelle. We are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca is good and has a good reputation, with a wonderful, Fabio Volo, a good, known for the "TV" currency: Le Iene. Rating: 7/10
