The married businessman who made the success of Harry Mitchell (a good performance with Roy Scheider) has a shepherd playing with Cini (good Kelly Preston) and a beautiful sweet'n'sexy girl. Harry has been destroyed by the trio of the low-life hoods - the movie shower of the movie Raimy (good-looking John Glover), the joint owner of antsy Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and the champion Bobby Shy (strong inspiration Clarence Williams). III) - who have published his video with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, hoods kill Cini and make it as Harry did. This also reduces the risk of wit and love between Harry and hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, using a hard script due to the shocking narrative of Elmore Leonard's crime, an expert keeps steady speed, provides a lot of tension, and effectively builds a suitable seed condition. All the guidelines have been very good, and the foot to help stand by Ann-Margret as Harry's wife was overpowered by Barbara's bitterness, futility as a feminine woman Doreen, and Lonny Chapman as a business partner of Harry Jim O'Boyle. Chapter tight'n'twisty puts viewers on their fingers around. Negative discussion, Jost Vacano's comprehensive movies, Gary Chang's exclamation, the rough sound of amoram and an exciting conclusion is similar to money as well. As a bonus bonus, Both Vanity and Preston remove their clothes. The smallest and satisfactory number that is worth looking at.
