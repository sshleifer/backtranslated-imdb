It took a long time for me to get a title in a special videothek in Berlin, and I was fortunate to get an English version for holland work. I think it's one of the best horrormovies. It seems strange to me that some people call this black movie comedy. I must admit, I was not able to laugh, when I saw the first time (and it was the second time!) On the one hand Trelkovski seems to be very good and even beautiful in his shy character, but on the other hand hits this young man in the field of games and no explanation for it. But the most exhausting thing is actually change it in Simone Choule and the fact, that he doesn't know, who is really. His venue is very awesome in this film. Of course it is all in his mind, but it is this flat that brings this side of the woman or was too before moving - I think that's an interesting question. Its shizophrenic character is hard to understand and it's awesome to see its two sides or identity to fight against each other. The result is that it eliminates his first hand and later jumps from his window. But this frightening cry - that means, that all will repeat again and again ... that his soul is in a stronghold or something? And these hieroglyphs of Egypt and other Egyptian elements? The fact, that he looked like a mummy in Hospital - not an event, but a clue in my opinion.
