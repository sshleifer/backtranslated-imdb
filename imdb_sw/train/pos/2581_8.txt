People become very hard on the film. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "explore" that. The whole thing comes when hackman decides to push the trigger but his goal is still going on. Then happiness begins like everyone about him too "drop". Think about JFK and all people who are involved in any way with its murder, whose lives have ended suddenly and in a hostile way and you will enjoy what is known in this film. I think it's a good interpretation of what could happen. Although the EXACT story line has not been monitored (see here after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire") but what it says is interesting. <br /> <br /> I'd like to get a copy for it again. Based on what is known today, the Domino principle is appropriate.
