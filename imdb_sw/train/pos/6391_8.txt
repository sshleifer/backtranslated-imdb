He got this film on the Arizona Arts Festival. I did not have many expectations (although the director of the festival told me it was one of the best films presented). I was five minutes in it. Shota in B&W in the budget decline, this film is hilarious. Acting is stable, writing is solid and looking for the film is solid. Acting is probably a great revelation, as many films are being played on low budgets tend to have an amateur or practical skills. Not this. It shows one of the most spectacular, beautiful and interesting performances of the Tourette's Syndrome character that I have ever seen. This program is deleted without any confusion and having fun without being free. If you get a chance, see this film. The authors of the film as Majkowski (the hope I received that right) deserve a chance to move their items to a broad audience.
