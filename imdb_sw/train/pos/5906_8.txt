Doghi is a good movie with Renuka Daftardar is the best. So it is Uttara Baokar who is often the best in its many responsibilities. With Kairee, his example of Marathi movies for the best. There are some parts in both films that have practice - it would be increasingly enhancing the movie to have fewer events where social messages are introduced. These parks may arise from the political concerns of the film but the film is realistic and moving forward in need. But apart from such small quibbles, his movie which deserves more appearance and one I recommend very much. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanity shines.
