Yes, I loved this film when I was a child. As I grew up I saw this film so often that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was tired. My family received a VHS copy of this film when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure that this was a suitable movie for a 10-year-old but just because we had bought a new VHS system she allows me to see it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is all boys dreaming dreams? The film has a difficult environment, the masses of muscled, high-quality women, bad strokes and jokes will only get when you grow up. So, a few days ago I entered a video and watched the video again after a long time. At first, I was bored, and then I started thinking about how much I loved this movie when I was a child, and kept watching. Yes, experience was not as good as I remembered? Acting is very bad, the story of the story is very bad, the joke was no longer funny, but the women were still beautiful. Yes, I've climbed. Although the film experience has changed to me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. In good times you know?
