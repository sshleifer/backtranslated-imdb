Hilarious, evocative, confusing, a brilliant film. Reminds me about L'Age D'Or of Bunuel or the Holy Mountain of Jodorowsky - lots of wonderful characters fasting and searching ... what is it? I laughed almost the whole way, all the while keeping the peripheral eyes on the adverse effects and constantly the terrible of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Enjoy through and through, from start to guts and poisonous ulcers to the end, if they are the end. I just wish I could remember every detail. It is sometimes offensive to me. Really, however, I have only a good memory of this film. If it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch, I think you'll have to wait a few years until Crispin Glover comes back to its Big Slide Slide (and then "What?") ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after the deal with a very serious car accident, so I had a very little time, which was perhaps a very good state of watching the arthropods of talking and prophesying a superhero dress with Glover as a god in its proper burly-Q environment, good mounting coverings out of the floor like a beautiful Dadaist's rainfall. Is it information about Life As We Know? Of course everyone looks at the art right. Instead I think that the truth is more obvious in the lack and in the negative position. What tells us what we should do, but it is more accurate than the lies that some people give us day and night. Instead of one "WHAT?" More than 5000 films like "Titanic" or "Sleep in Seattle" (shudder, gag, groan). Thank you, Mr. Glover (adding a happy person to watch the screen or on his Slide Slide - smart, funny, quirky, and angry fire). Make more films, write more books, continue to be happy.
