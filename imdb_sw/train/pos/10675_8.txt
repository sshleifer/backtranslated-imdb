For a long time I wanted to see this film, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that a little romantic plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this role of juvie. Thank you heaven for the Classic Turner which announced last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially in ways that were in the 1950s. I certainly don't want to meet them on a good road, a little bit of darkness. There was a good understanding of the feelings of fire such as, or as they call, shade.
