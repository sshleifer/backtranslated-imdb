This is the second short of the Burlesk baby's release, and probably the most popular, is the 1926 film's spoof film of Glory of Price. I looked at this and I don't understand the kiddie-porn that is allegedly. It's just a small film. I have seen that the family shows that I was looking at the '80s' and the 90's which had young girls wearing more attractive to act on 'mature way'. It was much larger because they were not wearing diapers. Nothing moved it on the bed unless you had one of those who use it. (just joke) Read that film notes and where it says only pedophile would be happy to watch this. That's sick. For me, if you look at this and you are suffering with it, then maybe you need to look at your own psyche and try to figure out why it is wrong. It is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film. All of the B.B movies. were parodies, no more. Today's present / modern features have a natural color and have a realistic picture of pornography and the worst language. Shouldn't it be more awesome? I can look at those who have no issue, but sometimes they take the stories of children and turn them into dirt on their centers. That's what you should get under your skin. Not that they baptized (not a word, I know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how the silent PORNOGRAPHY films were, huh? Not to mention those 'prehistoric films' before the Rules' were bad and dirty. Can't make dirt like today? (see pride)
