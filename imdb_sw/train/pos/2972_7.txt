I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and I was expecting a basketball to be funny but no place as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when David Zucker combines, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This film has great value to restore it and there is nothing bothering you with a serious separation. The stylish style of the stick with Stone and Parker works easily. The kind of humor on basketball was not popular during the release and it became out today it will be hit. Don't bother to try to be important, leave your brain on the door and wait for the end to come. It is recommended for anyone who has a good sense of humor.
