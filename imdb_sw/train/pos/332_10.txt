Although I have not seen this mini series in more than twenty years I can remember how balance between character, plot and story of wonderful adventures succeeded. Use of special effects were prevented from making more poetic rather than telling real stories. The two versions I saw were known (English and French) but the participants seem to speak their own language not only Italy and there is a problem of interaction. It does not spoil the story of telling. Among Cast Cast Irene Pappas as Penelope's best known for American Americans. It is recommended for all Odysseus' followers who come back.
