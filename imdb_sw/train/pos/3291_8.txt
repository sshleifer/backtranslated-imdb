This good film, and a shame that will take a little attention out of arthouse circles with students who stay up to two hours in the morning to look at the Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The program is simple but it works very efficiently, the frustration between a child's fantasy and hard to beat hard is very good. The budget looks low, but for those of those involved do not show it often. It has never been so much. I was lucky to run this on the phone as it was a few years ago, and it has won a half-dozen views. It is one of those films that will not all reject; though as usual, those who have a way to think more of the movies will get a lot from this. Charlotte Buerke puts a good performance like Anna, a damaged brat and embarrassing she seems to have gone to the acting area. The cross is also very good, carrying the character of its character very well in the image environment. <br /> <br /> There are some realistic (and we say that in a short time) when you combine in this film, both shockers the second half and more tension. Look at the lights out! <br /> <br /> Recommended most / <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
