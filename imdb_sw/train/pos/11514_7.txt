It is not the most successful television project John Cleese has ever done, "A wonderful investigation" you feel the first draft that ran in production before any adjustments could be made. There are some hidden ideas and even those few clever, but the story in general unfortunately does not add up a lot. Arthur Lowe is a hoot, though, like Dr Watson, bionic bits and all. "Good Lord."
