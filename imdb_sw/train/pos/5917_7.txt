Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very special film led by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's amazing the cinema, and it's very important to see. It is a live action mixed with animation, it appears to be affected by the South Song's Disney, almost as if it is the answer to that flick. Philip Michael Thomas, who later became Donickson of Don Johnson on Vice Miami, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, is a prison for escape. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are friends of Tomasi and planning to help him escape from jail. Faced with police road, and Crothers tells Thomas stories about black rabbits, beba, and fox who migrate from South to Harlem to get more peace. The story is animated, and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi movies, many will be disappointed and will not like animation. Lovers of real animation will forgive its discomfort and fall in love and its invention. The movie is very violent, very sex, and especially about conflict between society. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something very important, but over time, especially after completing it, it began to appear as a refugee for the mill, as well as the Superfly lines. It says very much and does not say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to it, Coonskin / Streetfight is still very valuable to look for an animation aficionados with fans of movie rites. 7/10.
