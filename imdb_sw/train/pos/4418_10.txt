You saw this at the Hawaii film festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took Q & A later. I found it hard to believe this is the first director at all times and Harvey Keitel for once again take risks and go out to the foot of the script he loved. Sure to remember the Cinema Paradiso, sells the story of a young director on the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a movie about the revolution, the political situation is very strange. Many references to directors love the love of film history (a great "Thief Thief") and some prestigious events that work out to be brave. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
