I waited for some time to review this document because when I first saw over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. I've got from the view of the document that this is a good text document. It did what was intended to do, show me something that I had no idea about and put me in the world that you have investigated. I didn't know anything of the world of drag and know about them and "Balls" was just awesome to me. These people were very talented and what they do and how they do, for competition. The people of the catty, complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the King's coat of drag was wearing was not a man's coat!), Envy, is all there like in every other race. THERE IS EVERY TRAINING. Which I heard was sure. You had an old gold talking about how the balls "used" compared to the nearest Queens that have changed balls and made more competition - and even those who looked up to know that the future of the Balls it would change even more when they were ready to walk the road. It was interesting to hear that some fighters were living outside the road two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories of "house" and "housewife" brought the best and most bright in competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now add after 10 years of watching this film, I lived through what is known as 'Madonna'. I saw a few faces of documents from this document who lived with Madonna during his "Vogue" phase and indeed. If it is not for those people, Madonna will have no "Vogue" phase, I know that now. Credit should be provided where credit is DUE. It makes me wonder, if someone from an ordinary American would look at this document, they will learn that it is not “normal” as they think.
