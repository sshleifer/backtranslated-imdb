It is not a prerequisite for looking at Hundstage as a 100% stability of your mind, because it will be tested very much by this film no matter how you are. I say Hundstage is an art film instead of entertainment, so many viewers will not have a "maturity level" to reach their favorite side. Types like Tarkovsky films, but in different ways. I, myself, I can't say I was so happy to see it. But it is an excellent and very interesting experience for those who suffer only by pictures that Hollywood offers. Hundstage puts your finger right into your brain and refuses your mind everywhere. You can't just sit back and watch it, you will be using play or looking for eyes opened in all films. A similar film in this style is Nachtgestalten, but it was more beautiful, and significantly violent. This is for example, not for children or those who have a little or angry mind. Most viewers could offer more than 10 or 1 for this film. I give 9 because I have seen the myth of the story-in one-film in another film and it was better. But this is the best piece alone. It deserves to watch, but be ready to see something that combines it.
