What? How can you test this movie with 10/10? I agree to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you stories but History! This is the first movie 'cinema' of the history of the cinema (`the Prince of Galles' was the first but it was not full of expertise ??) and has a great international value of course. These people who you see ending their working day in the movie have the opportunity to participate in historical time, that the first people have the ability to see themselves moving! And on all the bullets are a good shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first people you have to see that! What time! The history of the first science (because the Lumiere brothers first painted the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for future art. Worship!
