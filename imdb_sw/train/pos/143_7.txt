Riget II is good, but it's not exactly the same as the first. This series is not as bad as the first. There is more comedy in this, good, though. <br /> <br /> We are back in Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish Danish Hospital. Mrs. Drusse is just about leaving the hospital if her work has been done, but finally you want it otherwise. He recently expels ghosts and Helmer does everyone mad and will soon be so bad as black power is removed from the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story involves more comedy than previous. In many ways of fun, but it makes you take a little bit more. The story has saved many features from the last series and added some new ones. It is written well, but some new features are just a form of deception, but they keep it by making it as comedy. Good story, but not good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> Actors are the same as adding some of the regular cast. They are all very good. It's an unusual story and set. Other parts are a general show of freak and characters are changed during the show to keep it rough and put it real not an easy task. However, these actors hold the whole situation fully. Most of the good qualities from the first series are saved. The movie is one of those features. The hand-drawn camera that has made the world famous Trier offers a lot of custody and reality. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier uses this ability. Good, movement, great electricity and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable look. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see the best effect in this first line. Also be ready to see more. I didn't think anything green was very good. He thought it was normal and useless. Never a bit, the effect as ghosts are very good. Non-digital effects look good too. The younger brother looks just odd, but you agree. All I can say effects are from OK and good. <br /> <br /> Music is also very good. Moody and beautiful. Some of them are really touching. Very good. As the first there is a small part of music on work events and it works well. <br /> <br /> All together this makes a good sequel. If you would like to see Riget you can see this without fear. It has the same features as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two makes a series that you do not want to miss.
