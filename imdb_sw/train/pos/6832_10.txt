Beautiful film, style Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a good performance of a low-performance actor, dealing with success, aging, loneliness and alcoholism. He tries to escape his ghosts with head, posed by the specter of the little girl's death. Accepting yourself, of human nature, though all its problems, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the exhibition system and the film itself is amazing: it's as if the action was the way to go to Heroin. If all American movies can only be of high quality, dealing with human relationships on an adult level, without trying to try and reinforce the feeling ... One of the best games. 10/10.
