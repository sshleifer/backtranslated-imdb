Released two years before birth, this Oscar-winning movie has all - a set Technicolor sets and clothing, respiratory displays, superb wall-to-wall Gershwin music, excellent choreography, lighter screen than air, and great exhibitions with Kelly, Levant , Foch, Guetary, and Caron. Hollywood does not do 'em like this again. Of course, this is my favorite movie of all time, the level I judge all other films. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!
