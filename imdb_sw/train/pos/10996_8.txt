Who can watch the film, check out Lucy Liu and unhappy. The woman is a good and talented woman. That's a hard mix to get now. And Jeremy Northam. I heard his name many times, but I didn't see him. My advice to Hollywood is: "use him more". <br /> <br /> now about the movie: I looked at one of my changes to the grave. I do not recommend anyone. It's very difficult and it's amazing for it. still I can't believe I didn't see the end of coming. I can't say why that will bring down the hole of the hole. although saying this is a trophy. <br /> <br /> Now I think I vote on this movie. I love the historical story of history, the participants did a good job and I love the directors (natali) working in the past. No great audience of this kind of thing, that's also very dangerous. you know what, I just give you this job because everyone should see this. Then again, the discount of point 1 there is always a chance to improve.
