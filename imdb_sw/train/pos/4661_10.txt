I can only praise the features of other reviews here. It is an interesting film for the feelinggood that succeeds without crossing the line on the soppy feeling. Usually sweet - no sugar added. One small view: it seems to me that the strong restrictions given on the behavior of Ustinov Pendelton have the ability to walk and fail the security of the system ignores the fact that Pendelton is open professional / savant for this type of object. Yes, the film was very good to read the computer, but it showed a pendelton 'learning computer' on its flat, and I believe it meant that his gifts only allowed him to focus on the whole lesson, once a night. There was a rare time when it appeared in some cases that Gnatpole was trying to explore Pendelton's skills and call her bluff. I don't know if we should believe that Pendelton for the trick drove his way out of these conditions, or if he had enough knowledge to pass the tests - it was not quite clear. Sure she had enough knowledge to set up dummy accounts. Wallach and Ustinov may have had to rely on their own idea about how the computer worked in those days, and to understand in detail what they found, it is important to know their idea. They knew that there was something about "procedures" that were important; thought that the 'light of light' could actually control the safety, rather than just showing its status; they thought that the end of the terminal user (user) could be very persuasive about what can be done on the main form itself - although away from objects like the image of the image I do not see. Overall, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer activities as much as they could, and they did it well. To give them artistic permission, I do not think their efforts had any merit. CD / CD
