Shower continues in itself in many ways. Almost all the films take place in the old bathhouse, during the citizens who handle humor, pathos, and emotional feelings. Love and friendship between the owner and his lost child are deep and moving. The older brother's way found in this little world seems to be unacceptable and convincing. This program is a mixture, full of surprise and anxiety, and the general reaction and feeling of what I would like to call a neighbor in relation to the conflicts of artists. This is the film I offer when I want to believe in the world again.
