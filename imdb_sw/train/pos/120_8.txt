Not all film work can be very motivating to you. I will take the failure of enthusiasm on the hit-mass market hit any day. Although this cannot be described as failure, the total of its pieces remains. This unsuitable quality is looking for me in a constant look at it. This is a challenging, stimulating film that does not do well. The problem with the movie is in its format. His unfinished plan seems to be going on, as the second end is set. Although everything is so amazing, the film is too long for that unit. Today's long-term wake-up call comes for 20 minutes at the end. <br /> <br /> The great movie shows come at the cost of a good script, but here the creative technique camera provides a wealth of visual ideas. Artifice combining is stimulating and engaging; Character is behind the project but his own hand in front is not. The world is shown to be deliberate, cunning and ignorant. Keep your eyes stabbed with a memorable, horrible lecture that will help your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> Songs are amazing. Anyone who opted to unlock (without publishing) video video in a pot & skate format should never have seen it. What is a DVD? It is not possible how anyone can give this bad verification. You should see it at least once. You can find the meaning of Trier far more than he can chew, but this film lives to be so rich. I testify that he is studying with the Hitchcock External Correspondent where false Europe also makes the American brain and many Welles movies that take great pleasure in such a way as he does. All Trier movies look at the naif problem with non-forgiving communities. After Zentropa, von Trier departing with this kind of technical experiments towards sreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap as Breaking Waves and Dancer in Giza.
