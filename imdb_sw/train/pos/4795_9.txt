Whenever I get a movie filled out because it doesn't have sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, b.s. The detector goes off. Typically, such a movie is a hogwash of love that convinces people who do not want anything to surprise them, but to prove how they are better than us ignorant people. Therefore, when David Lynch received such information, I was worried, especially since I was not a fan of his "foster" story, MAN ELEPHANT. With all the wonderful pictures and acting in the film, it seemed to be more interested in our preaching than to give us. <br /> <br /> I don't need to worry. HISTORY RISK is a trusted movie rather than one of saccharin. In addition, it is due to the fact that Lynch and the author John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell the same as simple and easy. There are several homilies for the same I could do without, and the shots of grain that harvested are very small, but those are just quibbles. There is no heavy message, no pleasant conditions for calming our feelings, and no bother with us and its characters. Instead, they rely on the story to build its own strength, and it does, for the last place, we move to the truth. <br /> <br /> Of course, throwing Richard Farnsworth adds efficiency to that part. In fact it is a person who seems to have lived in many ways but still continues, and without these values, the desire to come back with his brother does not seem to have a lot of feelings, because you can see here is a man who has lived too long and seen very much. driven by anger for a long time. And he knows when it comes out, so he wants to make peace, not just for his brother, but for his life. Sissy Spacek also does a good job, without learning as a daughter. And although I am a village and a town boy, the state of Iowa and Wisconsin are well shot, making me visit a certain day.
