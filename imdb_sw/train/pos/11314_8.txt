Wow! The type of film can look at ten times and you are still interested in its nuances. Fully amazing! If this was the first Visconti film, I am happy to think what will happen if he gets better from film to film. The only thing I have seen (the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was quite amazing: more interesting than the Observance. One of the most beautiful films I ever saw, but her story did not share as Ossessione. If you click "miscellaneous" on the links to this page, there is still from the film on those sites. They certainly do the right to the film experience: the movement of grace cameras, very good composition, surprising surfaces, the strongest spelling, great storytelling, the first movie adapted from James M Cain "Postman Coins. I can't believe this was done in 43 years, eight years before Brando was supposed to set up a real job for the world and Streetcar Desire (1951). Actors in this might not be able to use techniques of the method, ie they could feel everything themselves (I don't know anything about it) - but they are some of the best, realistic and realistic displays so far in movies. Also, eight years before the Neighborhood Street View called Tamaa brought a new impression on the screen, Ossessione was a world of electronics. The most secular thing from the beginning of the movie! Yes, I am happy, but Ossessione was very strict. <br /> <br /> The reason for Ossessione did not cause road traffic was that it was made in Italy fascist and banned by Mussolini, and re- cut in America. US viewers did not see its full glory to 59, eight years after the road car. I will say no more about it - just to tell you one of the most beautiful, beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! As another consultant, I'm going to buy it as soon as I can!
