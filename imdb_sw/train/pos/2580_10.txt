I say the domino principle is a very popular film film that has taken time to explore our modern history of conspiracy, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact many others can draw only the conclusion that the author of the domino code actually knew what he was talking about about.roy tucker can be lee harvey oswald or James earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even John hinkley or timothy mcveigh.ta mention a few. The evil of our history of existence caused by equality.god helps us, but the domino principle is more truthful than this fantasy.if caused by a slight loss of sleep, perhaps it is necessary to do my word for it, search for yourself.
