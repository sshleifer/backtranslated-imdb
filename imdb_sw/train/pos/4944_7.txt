Not many things happen in this film but have many meanings. The woman thought she had all that she could do in life, but that was not true, and she found herself meeting this man who was doing research for her next job. There should indeed be many kinds of movies like this, i even not as old as they are "mature" (im 13 through) and I still have an idea and action of the film. The main quote is in my opinion: Don't think you can't have a good life, because you have this one. Even though I had to admit I was looking at another film but after reading all the comments and seeing the trailer I decided on this even though I didn't know that many actions appear in the film. I recommend anyone watching this film as it has very good points in the film, and it is a very good end.
