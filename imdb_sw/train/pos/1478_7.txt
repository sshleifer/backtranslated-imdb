I loved this film, Although half of that way, I was able to tell who accepted the secret. I am also wondering if it is the basis of the true story since it described about "real" people at the end of the movie. I think I will need to explore and know. Does anyone remember what this situation happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina if they were not mistaken. Of course the states can be changed to protect the innocent. You would think that this person could have thought it as easily as I did. What was a fool or what?
