I have not seen the original "Wonderful Trip" since I was a child, so I can't compare these two facts. This edition describes the story of three animals, two dogs and cats, whose owners leave them with friends in the camp when the family head should take on a new job in San Francisco. Pets, believing that they have been left out, run away from the long journey to go home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This story can be easily locked as a cartoon, but both translations are really live-in-action films used by real animals. One major difference is that in the future the animals speak in human terms, giving each individual a different, something that was not done in the original film. (An animal talking device has been used in other recent children's films like "Tournament Tournament"). Some critics have been acting on the use of this device, but my view is that providing different animals for their own benefit to enhance the film rather than weaken. Animals said for a great star, Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields. <br /> <br /> All dogs are male, and their relationship is similar to most people in the "buddy-buddy" movies. Shadow, retriever of gold, is a wise, knowledgeable dog; Little possibilities are bright, cocky and inspiring. For the Chance of Britain's eyes it looks like a striker, but in fact it's the American Bulldog, which seems to be a natural difference to its British cousin. Sassy cat is a human and human woman. He is very proud of his status as a cat, which in his eyes makes him better than dogs. ("Management of the cat, dog blows!"). In the view of the adult film has a number of errors; It may be sad, some of the events (such as those that animals can manage a lion dog in the river) are absolutely amazing, and all human characters forget it completely. This, however, is a film that specifically has a focus on children, and I suspect will be very happy. Indeed, any child who loves the animal will do so. (The opinion of other academic critics like James Berardinelli, who complained that animal sounds reduced the "size" of the film, helps to strengthen my perception that professional critics are not always the best guides for children's movies. of the greatness of its greatness. ”/> <br /> One thing that adults will enjoy is the image of California's Nevada Mountains. This is a very popular family film 7/10
