I saw this movie in the theater, and I was attracted to it. Then again, that's when Claire Danes was a good actor, not a fool, a pride, a born Hollywood act today. However, this film struck him as one of the most friendly, realistic, friendly friendships. Would you go away with your best friend? I was moved by tears at the end, and I have broken when I look at it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and told him how much I loved him. This is a good film to watch with your best girl. However, be prepared for future conversation where he returns to you and asks if you will do something like that for him ....
