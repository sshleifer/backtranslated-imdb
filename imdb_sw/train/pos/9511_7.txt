The typhoon of the epidemic in the Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious person, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, at this time the story returns in another way: Mike is fighting to save his life with his only son who remained, because some of his family were killed because of his filthy game. He is able to take revenge and save his future son, but he is killed at the end. These stories have no fun at last after all. The role of Mike Salliwan's role was played by Tom Hanks, and part of Mr. Rooney (boss of Mafia) was held by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression, and we hear the key words "robbing bankers". This film still has value to watch though you could expect something great from Sam Mendes after its American Beauty.
