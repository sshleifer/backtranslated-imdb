Here is a favorite cartoon Tom & Jerry perfect for Halloween. I know it is not appropriate to have a great humility, but it has a 'trick' like 'Trick or Treat,' as Jerry did with Tom and a blind window and a clean-and-shirt shirt to make it as a soul; but still like to put on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short, Tom was listening to "At Witching," a soul-story program on the radio, and feared the story of fear being told. Half of the story, the story (the hair stands last, the heart jumps to the throat, the cold spine on the spine) begins to happen to Tom. . . real. And Jerry has been looking at anything and laughing for himself, he thought he was afraid of Tom to shock him. <br /> <br /> I love the last, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons where Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; others have Mouse Lonesome, Mouse in House and Nit-Witty Kitty. Also this short is the first cartoons and twenty-five where Tom speaks. Others are Mouse Lonesome, Cat Zoot, Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Shida, Mouse Comes dinner, Secure, Trap Fun, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse, and Cat Top and Mouse Down led by Chuck Jones.
