There is nothing to be proud of "Non-Woman," and it is not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are making a comedic team. But there is something that has not been read about Neil Simon's state of play for his attack to make it look like a skit on a comedy show show than a full film. I haven't seen playing, but I think that the screen version is trustworthy, since Simon wrote, so the defect can not be judged on the step by step. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two men who have recently been dropped who fall once in a normal marriage roles as they leave them because they do not know any difference - that Simon cannot fully erase. However, there are many ways to kill several hours.
