Modern ok about the low syndrome. The mother has one twin is very sick and the other is good but she has less. The mother does not think she can bring her so she gives it to other people who have 15 children who have decreased! The mother does not like this and thinks she should have her family (I also agree) so they take it to court and the family breaks up and grandparents lose, they say like mother and daughter's decisions? I think this movie is good but the plot is normal, it's still good & has a few laughcheche unintentional!
