In the ocean crap that Hollywood (and others) continue to proceed, this is one of those diamonds in the worst. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you just didn't lose an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is very amazing in this film. I have never been a fan or I had seen him before but returned to see this original start-up experience assures me that he is very talented. Watching this film was working in my university course so I was worried I would even care. I thought, "Oh boy, a certain dumb man of a chic or a stupid-bashing indie ..." I was very surprised. Without analyzing the most important theme, I'll just tell you, if you haven't seen, make yourself a permit and look at it. Sometimes the low-to-earth movies, the piece-of-life is better, and this is good.
