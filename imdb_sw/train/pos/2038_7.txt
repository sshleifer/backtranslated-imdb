This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and I heard that it would be garbage, so I didn't expect much. However, I was very happy. At first I didn't have a beautiful girl and I didn't care if she lived or died. After a while she grew up on me and became a good character. It's not just a slasher film where people die because. There is a history of history that takes only a few seconds of film, but it explains a lot. I would like to recommend this film to everyone. If you are not sure you are looking at any time, it's only about half an hour of your life. You are going to live for 80 years however.
