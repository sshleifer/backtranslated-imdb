The music entertainment where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to raise a cross-breaking game and so tries Sky Masterson to try and find the girl's salvation army, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana. 5 years later, Simmons would be in the missionary again in an amazing "Elmer Gantry". There was Sharon's sister and here is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different stories. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is that deviltani Nathan Detroit. He has been involved with Vivian Blaine for 14 years and hates his gambling behavior. <br /> <br /> In the real change of speed, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually sang singing here! <Br /> <br /> Movies saved by top choreography. Those drums and the singing process are fabulous. They are particularly recognized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). It is all good, very good production.
