I have seen many television movies in my time as a student, most of the time that the American television gives us. This, however, was well done and planned and had a beautiful end at the end. After just seeing Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than gamut instead of words from A-B which usually provides. It was a great surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time to return to Fly II. It is also good to see Robert Guillaumme in the role of leading again. I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves with weight after her days of Benny Hill but she just managed to cope well in her role. All in the highly recommended film.
