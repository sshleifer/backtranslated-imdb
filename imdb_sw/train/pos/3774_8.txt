In a series of best efforts by Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future, as the chuck De Nomolos badly sends two bad robots, hiding as Bill and Ted around the world to kill Bill and Ted of humanity. The future change. <br /> <br /> In a very good cooling winter, Winter and Reeves are increasingly winning fun for the audience in this leisure sequel. Although there is no shortage of the first trip, the Bogus Journey still has great catchphrases and talks from a leading pair, not to mention hilarious performance by William Sadler, who brings an exciting side to a detailed figure, a bad aggregate. Look for the monitoring of games, the best time for all the films, but one of many of the many methods used to justify the variety. Even though it is still full of humor, this film has a more interesting film to it, and the stakes are even worse and more dangerous. <br /> <br /> This gives a great movie direction and another favorite feature. The creators also set the boundaries of fantasy and the use of originality, and hell and heaven are a great example and now in a conspiracy. The kind of fantasy is also a spot on the use of the wonderful time of travel, although again confused with points and spending time, items and conditions are placed before they occur now, as shown in the last few scenes. The first time I liked this second, but the second time it was a real pleasure as I enjoyed jokes and stories more, and although jokes and conspiracy are no longer the same as their player, Bogus Journey feels good about enough, joke and a conspiracy to make it a good family film.
