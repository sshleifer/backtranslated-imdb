Zombie Things are not something to shout about, it is definitely not a movie to win awards but it is a recreational movie directed by Brad Sykes who led Camp Blood which was another of the low budget entertainment. Acting is as bad as most cheap movies but that makes it more entertaining, zombie decisions are cool and more effective for the budget, the year is also big and big, the movie is kind of a zombie story version from Crypt since we get The two stories on meeting with a zombie in the forest, the story is fun and leaves you to try exactly the first story. Zombie Chronicle is better than movies with low-budget movies out there, if you like low-B-B or zombie low-cost movies coming out of the zombie then watch Zombie Chronicles.
