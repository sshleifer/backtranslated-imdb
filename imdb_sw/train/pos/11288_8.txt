Considered by all critics that the best of Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan films, I have no arguments and, though there are a few other people that I thought of as entertainment. One thing: it's longer than the series I have seen for 105 minutes. I only saw six but this was longer than I had and with the outdoor finale I thought anything was too long. It is a good mix of action, doubts and romance. The only things lost are the color and sound of stereo. The special effects of primitive do not bother me, since that's all they had after the 1930s. Among some, this film is known for one thing: skin! "Jane" was not wearing anything after this film as the Hays principle was introduced during the following Tarzan film. His clothes showed what the main example of Maureen O'Sullivan had. The bottom of the water, however, was not his - for a long time. The woman under the water did not have a very good figure, anyone who was. <br /> <br /> There are many steps here. To the end, it was not overthrown, either. The end continued for 15 minutes, though, and it was so intense that it was about to look. Still, this film gives up everything - except "Boy" (their adopted child) - you'd want to see on Tarzan's film, even O'Sullivan doing Tarzan heard it several times. With its pair of "lungs," that was not a problem.
