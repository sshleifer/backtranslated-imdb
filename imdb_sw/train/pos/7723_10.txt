Several factors make it easy for me to say that I still think this is the most important science fiction, even though some of the acting, short-term dialogue etc.. First, there is a level of thought in describing Krell, the humanoid race from the planet, now it has all died, which were more than 1 million more than the people of the world (we), and their technology, especially 8,000 miles of miles away. Second, there are music and sound effects, which are not separated from each other. It creates sensory feelings, unlike "2001", which had traditional traditional music. Third, its "monster" is not only powerful and deadly that has been seen, also depends on real science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. At the end, and most importantly, the unauthorized planet is the only movie that has been the attempt and, more surprisingly, is successful in making honest, prudent and sensible information on the boundaries or limits of human development (or any other biological) , no matter how long we live as kind. In other words, it predicts our inevitable document.
