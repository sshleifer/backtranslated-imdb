Paul Reiser moves away from the comedy surveillance spelling to write a humorous story of tenderness and gently sympathetic about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. IN A FOLKI MY FAMILY does not set new films, but it is a very good story told that reminds us of the important bonds that the family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been very strong, sometimes driving his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) back. One day Muriel gives an explanation that after years of marriage she leaves! His daughters, along with Ben Rachel's wife (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately seek to find their place, leaving the confusion and hurt and disbelieving Sam for solving out the road on the road with Ben son. The road trip becomes a time for two men to learn who they are and each of them means their status as father and child and family members. Sam repeats the first time in his life and launches Ben now engaging in pleasures and happy living. The journey comes to an end and calls on where to Muriel and why he came out and united to a wise family draws the end of the story of the story. Not all seen: it's good and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser are playing as profitable, but in many ways the film is short while Olympia Dukakis is located on the screen, reminds us that he is one of our powerful matriarch on the film. Well worth watching. Grady Harp
