This was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very good actor who is very enjoyable to see. Chemistry team once received things together, it was just showing what you can accomplish when the mind unites as one and one purpose. This team came back from the mold, with a lot of losses to win almost everything. I like movies like this is really very powerful. Overall, the character of Dennis Quaid gets a chance in the league. You can't do anything, but root to this person. It looks like when someone has to do something, they will do it. Things only happen and makes everything click. <br /> <br /> According to true stories, this film will make you think about the fact that "nothing is possible."
