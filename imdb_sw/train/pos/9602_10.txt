Darius Goes West is a film that shows America's belief that everything is possible if you are trying hard. This joyous filling and sometimes the heart shows a young man who never wanted to, but longed to see, what's out of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the sea. His long-term friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius a reality. They started a little mother - Ben & Logan began an email campaign to bring awareness to the state of Darius: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and raise money for fellas to take Darius not only to see the sea but to see the big United States. To say that young college girls have succeeded in bringing hope and understanding to the disease you have feared. They found Dario's dream and then others. They put their lives to the time of showing love, services and tons of fun for Darius while helping Darius see how he can show those qualities to other DMD sufferers. Darius continued to dedicate himself to the Red Cross - sitting on his seat collecting money (with his friends) outside the grocery store. His amazing smile asks the world that dreams are fulfilling - you need both hope and a group of university friends to help you and care for you. To give Darius and all the people Oscar - no one else is more eligible. Martha Sweeney.
