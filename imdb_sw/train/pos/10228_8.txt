Being a big fan of monster, I saw "Yeti" was absolutely necessary, especially after hearing a lot about it. Thanks to our market of bootleg market I was able to get a copy easily, and I was glad to see that this flick was true, I would say, respect. <br /> <br /> Why good, really, that cheesy giant-monster flick. It goes very fast as Yeti is available very pretty once, and we can be introduced to different characters. They include some uncomfortable, some good, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most uncomfortable girls in any movie of the sci-fi cheesy, to the far. Yeti looks like a long boy-boys out of the original Woodstock Festival, and in fact, he is not a bad dude, especially after being brought to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. . Godzilla hayu - in spite of his awakening in anger, he even spreads (in fact he destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda looks just surprised when he is trying to think things. Yeti seems to understand English nicely nicely (my copy was named in English) and she knows who is good guys and bad people. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti doing his thing, and he is pretty much in the whole movie, and in the usual budget style, he seems to change a lot of change depending on the area and there is a group of " The fake feet "standing there. Yes, the specific effect is not much bigger, but there are definitely some good here. The area where Yeti passes through the warehouse takes place very well, and to another, it uses the windows of the building as a "level level" to go down from the top - losing every window and its foot and often terrifying local residents - with one of the most visible sequences, better better than the "bad" film. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" does not give less if you say, "APE" does not. The fact that even when it comes close to real care is when a beautiful girl causes Yeti's underwear to be strong and lifts its tip in the form of "oh yeah baby". But even this is not bad, and kinda even laughs out of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does not get boring - the story is very good, and just look at a very good actor on the screen will make any male viewer happy. Yeti "Yeti" may not be on the echelon on the top of the big flicks, but it is better than the other King Kong '76 sings like "APE" and "Queen Kong" at a very distant distance.
