The head is onomatopoeic, the sound of the road car on the rail. It is an example for everything that people living in dump cannot. The pain of these people is shown by a road car that represents a life-rich life of a middle class. The little boy's pathos and his beloved father are still very sad. This was the first film of Kurosawa to paint and uses very good hues, only visible in the dream. The movie is surreal and wonderful in beauty. Human compassion is the power to fight, but as usual, Kurosawa takes into account the filming. It is a good job for a movie star.
