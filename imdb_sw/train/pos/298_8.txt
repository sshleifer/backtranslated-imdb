New York has never been seen to be good! And no one in this film. When the script is a little lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it. Almost want people like this were there. Appeals of the executives are exactly what the set (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten is really good.) Go and hire or buy this movie you will be happy you made.
