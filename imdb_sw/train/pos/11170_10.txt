There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere. Maybe the fact I was a child when I first checked it made this experience so memorable. But if I keep looking at it regularly, it's never been old, and I've never been tired. From the opening of the opening and opening opening of the opening to the end of the chaos, there is something to ignore, sad and frightening at the same time, and it keeps crying in your head: sometimes dying is better! I don't think it will be necessary to explain the whole story again. All you need to know is to start from the A (step more perfect for a happy family of the United States) and gradually sinks to point B (ie, you believe, the end of all happiness). Music is perfect, the story is meaningful, special effects are cool, and the Semetary of the Pet is the last part of the world I will be. As I said, sometimes it dies better!
