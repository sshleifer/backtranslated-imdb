I probably saw this film first in 1995. Since then I have come back many times. It's good! I especially like the first and second part, "Creation" and "Civilization of Civilization." Wow! This was very cool in the days of the glory of the CG animation. CG is the most old way than me, if I know the film "Tron" was released 7 years before my time. But this film was a symbol of '90' early. It was the first cooperation of various CG experiments placed on music. I love it so much, I think I'm going to watch it now. Bye
