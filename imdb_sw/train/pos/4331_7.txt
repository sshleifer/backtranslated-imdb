Killed in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the Poirot books well, for it is very creepy and has a final end. There is no doubt that the admission of the television is so spectacular, and some beautiful pictures and music are very haunting. As long as David Suchet deserves as Hercule Poirot, the comedic thing of that period is the war of Poirot and mosquitoes in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as Captain Hastings who was ignorant. The remainder of the cast turns to good performances, but they are cautious in order to avoid two directions, risk in other Christie changes. Some of that part was very surprising, juxtaposition of the period as bad as Togo Pig Five, a place that I enjoyed a lot more than this. What made it particularly creepy, set aside music when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window. About dealing with the situation, it was faithful to the book, but I will say that there are three things I did not like. The main problem was mixing, it's slow, and there are some cases that occur very little. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a tendency to worry, but to interfere with the idea of ​​making him a killer, and to develop the situation, to make him a very unpopular behavior, although I am glad they didn't miss his drugs. (I also saw that the authors omitted the fact that Mrs Mercado in this book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the second victim of the murder.) Another thing that was not surprising is that I felt that it could be more effective if the effectiveness had been in the view of Amy Leatheran, as it was in the book, Amy somehow seemed to be lighter in the situation. In general, despite several mistakes on behalf of the authors, I loved being killed in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
