In fact one person / character is not "there", but the line of my abstract means the power of the film. And all of this has been achieved without the concept of conventional cameras and / or large-scale production, but with good and very good (trusted) stories and good actors present stories (arc). You can call it one piece on the great movies of japan / cinema (such as Tokyo Story etc.), not many wise stories, but it's more intelligent! Acting good, the display rates that are really good. If you want to touch the story and you want to see the film touches you emotionally, than this is going. If you have seen (as in my opinion a lot), I do not know in the story. There are places here on IMDb where you can watch those up, I don't destroy any stories!
