Certainly this is one of the best movies about the love I have ever seen. It is closely followed by no other except "Before Sunset", which is essentially not any film at all, for it refers to two people equal to the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. Okay, that's just like many people are intelligent and wise if it leads to movies. Reading another review, it makes me happy to know how many other people do more movies than conversation. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" very well. The discussion is perfect. It's true, so engaging with funny. It's very difficult that Jesse and Celine fall in love, 'coz you love them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite place is one in a coffee shop, where they pretend their best friends, and another pretending to be a good friend. It's PERFECT. It brings you back when you fell in love for the first time in your life. I must say that if you have a choice, show "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset". If I like, you watched the "Sunset" first, it's hard to shake the feeling of sympathy and sadness for two young lovers in all show. Again, the great romantic movie in my books. Acting wonderful, excellent script, and beautiful places. Little love, better.
