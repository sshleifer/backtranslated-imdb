Before I commented on this film, you should realize that when I saw this film, I expected the usual, fear, B-movie and I wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only provides but actually is one of the best that I have seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is as good as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in that psychopaths in great movies when he got a chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snow player through a mixture of stupid stupidity. As soon as that snowman starts around and kills people, however, you will find it difficult to laugh. The lines that are spoken are completely reduced but really are funny. The fact that all the others are completely lost - only makes it more ridiculous to the film, but it's ridiculous skill. The area where the girl of snow is with the little girl is true in the B-movie, the movie's awesome style. I really hope there is a good customer and I will be there to watch it on any cable tool that it does. Of course it is only fun to watch the first few moments and not a good work of photographic motion, but I like to see people of snow kill people. I gave 7 out of 10, this is a good movie for a date with a couple in the last hours.
