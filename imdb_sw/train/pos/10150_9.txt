Indeed, this film is safe and sweet and full of clich√©s, but it's entertainment, and that's what I watch movies. To be accepted. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. His smile burns and its beauty cannot hide. Like Michael Vartan, I am sure women love him. They both seemed like a real eacb in this film. I don't understand the views that had no chemistry among them. I think we see what we see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were delighted to see, even though the Wa Abo of England had entered into his prestigious Bronx speech. To tell you the truth I did not see it until I read this comment, but I went back to the DVD and now its talk looks more than the British than America, but it was better for its position and discrimination. It is a story of two good people who get married to other important people, but who get their spiritual partner to each other. It can be an impossible story, but who says all films should play as a document? It is not more meant than any dramas which are examined every hour on the tube. That's why we look at them, to escape from everyday life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I am a very emotional boy who weeps easily. Don't do wrong though, it has to be a pleasant place, and this movie had a lot of those. I just give 9/10 just because I save my 10/10 so I still don't see an invisible movie that I know will come one day. If you see it will be announced if it comes to the Movie Center or Movies, or whatever, mark it to watch it. I think you'll love it.
