So I am not a ruin to you, I will be very short. There are some beautiful and wonderful lines from cast. The new Harvard Med School (Brian White) thinks he doesn't know if he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his training because the girl (Mya) has worked as a TV producer. His senior wife (Wood Harris), helped her with her 'creative partner' (Zoe Saldana) to bring her to the speed. They help protect his work and show him the possibility of being a compassionate doctor rather than a player who just wants money (as it seems to be true for many pre-med friends).
