I've passed several times to watch this since I thought it was dumb, sappy, of dated romantic. In fact, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not more interesting, touching as it does in the topic of politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is a sense of uncertainty that is going on with your interests, and not everything that turns out as you expect. But, there is enough wit and charm to touch more cynic inveterate. If you meet someone who does not like this film, think deeply about how you want to know them.
