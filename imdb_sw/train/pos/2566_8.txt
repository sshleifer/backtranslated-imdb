Any movie related to preference in a good way is a film that should be seen by the current audience as the message and the moral of the story will always be just as long as we have a world full of bigotry. <br /> <br /> Besides, the film is the story of old love ..boy meets girl..boys loses girl ... boy gets girl .... <br /> <br /> The weak role goes for the late Kent Smith as Lt. General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is the second second) ... my question is how he served as the protagonist of 3 stars ... The character is wimp in front of his wife and military forces, it is no wonder any respect. <br /> <br /> Brake to insist the south is a little overdone, and some scenes have a few holes but in general, I enjoy the film every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red buttons are good ... I have loved to see the fighters in great roles ... as in the case of Button, the player often can better describe the tragedy of a person than a sheep actor.
