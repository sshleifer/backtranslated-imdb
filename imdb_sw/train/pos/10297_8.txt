Well not true. This movie is very entertaining though. She went and saw it with the girl last night and had to use "I think there might be something in my eye" from time to time. Movie is a great mix of comedy and casual romance. Jim Carey is as good as a lucky author who has been given the ability to change himself and the city where he lives. In fact all the characters are the best. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, flick good to go to see with the wife. <br /> <br /> All in All 8/10 .... note * I'm not a simple grader. That's all from BigV up and out!
