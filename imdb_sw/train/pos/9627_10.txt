That is the shortest of the funniest made by two scholars of comic. From the time they enter, to Hardy when you fall on the roof, this makes me laugh. I strongly recommend that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. I also recommend all Series Series. If you are looking for a laugh, watch this film and you will be happy.
