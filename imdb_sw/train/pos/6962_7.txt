My great girl of Ex Ex turned out to be a good surprise for me, I was expecting a bad movie that would be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie might have a very strange laughter and a fun plot that anyone can get to a kick. I know that this was a very good movie, but Uma and Anna were just cool and Steve had an addition as well as a very cast that looked like they were very excited and yes it made movies to work. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, that's my real friend's name) is not an ordinary woman looking at the library, when Matt, your ordinary man, begs her out, she is more than she expected, she asked G-Girl out of date, the greatest hero of the world! But she gets to know a jealous and mad girl who is real and decides that it might be a good idea that they spend time away, but Jenny will not have it since she fell to another girl, Hannah, and will make her life alive, meaning, let's face that face, could not choose a beautiful girl to break. <br /> <br /> The effects were corny, but you cause them to move quickly, stories and give us a story that worked well and I loved Uma in this film, it was a step from the Great. My Super Ex Girlfriend is an enjoyable movie that should not take for weight, it's just a romantic romantic comedy which I think I could laugh, anyone can. <br /> <br /> 7/10
