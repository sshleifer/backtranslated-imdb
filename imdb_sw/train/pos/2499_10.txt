This film was awesome. It had the original concept (the vampire movie meets Yakuza film). It is a lively and sad and sad movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and views on society. On the part of Gackt Camui, the role of Sho was well-presented, and HYDE was a wonderful surprise for his first film as a vampire but pleasant, Kei. I also laughed and wept for a happy-go-lucky character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second film this film, especially when such a smoking area, fighting events, and most of all, to finish the heart.
