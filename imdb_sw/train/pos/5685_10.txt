Kudos to the director and cast to the same film. Grittiness, lack of appetite and despair drew me in the film and protected me there. I was so impressed by how the date and information was sent to the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc.. It put the film moving as fast as I do not feel the desire to proceed quickly right away. Personally, I thought all the principles worked great ... it was good to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such roles. It made me feel right sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... its exhibition of this nature leaves them with fear. In general, this is a talented film that should not be!
