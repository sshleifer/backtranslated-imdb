All Dogs Go to Heaven is, in my opinion, the best film animation implemented. I'm not a big fan of animation movies, but there is something about this that makes it better than any animation film I have seen. Music is amazing as the exhibition of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is probably one of my favorite songs from any film I see. This should definitely be visible to people of all ages.
