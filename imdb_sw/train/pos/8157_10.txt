Rated in strong language, cruel content and some dirt. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canada Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The Hat Hat Hatcher is one of the first funniest comedies, which I've ever seen. This is a gangsta rap version of this film It is not too many people have heard about this movie gem. If you are looking to get this movie anywhere you don't want to buy even if you don't like rap music. What I can think of at this moment is this film, Authors, World According to Garp, 40-year-old Girl and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of gangsta rap culture.The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who he makes a document about the rap group of the NWH (N **** z and jacket) .This is the basis of the rap group that makes many rap rap songs and gangsta.Fear The Black Hat is the best comedic film and I recommend even if you're not a fan of gangsta rap scene. It is a disgrace of this film not about 250. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88min <br /> 10 / 10/10
