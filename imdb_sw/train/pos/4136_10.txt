I loved Laurence Olivier in the last few weeks, and I was glad when I discovered this gem. I have been seeing it strange when I fight in a movie where I have not got my finger on a remote control if a humor brings his head bad. Lady X's marriage lasts to the last place, and it must be a real pleasure for the audience back in 1938. I just want people today to accept and love true humor rather than people who talk about bad rubbish now they call funny. Mother X's marriage is suitable for anyone.
