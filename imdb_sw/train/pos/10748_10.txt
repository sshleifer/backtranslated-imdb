I should say that the 9/11 events did not strike until I found this document. It took many years to come to grow and destroy. I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and station on TV if there was any talk about towers. I was sick to hear about it. This time it was broadcast on TV for a year and one day later, I was playing my eyes out. It was the first time I cried from the attack. I strongly recommend this document. I am looking now on TV, 5 years later, and still crying on disasters. The fact that this has only one video shots of the first flight to the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and look where they got. These two brothers make me love to be there to help.
