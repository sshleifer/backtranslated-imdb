I am a film of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" of 1997. "Fay Grim" is a sequel of the film, and has a similar style of humor. The plan, however, is quite different. Fay Grim (carefully played with the prestigious Parker Posey) tries to track her husband's absence registers, and finds himself in a conspiracy and ignorance. Support (most of the people from the first film together with Jeff Goldblum, the Burrows of Saffron, and the most widely accepted from the 90-india-partner Elina Lowensohn) is the best and the film has a lot of surprises. The director claims that this is a part of the trilogy of "Star Wars", which serves as "The Dollar facing Back" of the series If this is true, I can't wait to see the third phase! I hope I don't need to wait 10 more years.
