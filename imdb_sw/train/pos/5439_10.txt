It is a clear film with a great influence not only on the buddy type but also a variety of steps. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as much of his series of Star Wars seems to have respect for Gunga Din. The characters who Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks play are the predecessors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca. Even Gunga Din's Sam Jaffe tied in C-3PO and R2-D2 and if he or not: Jar Jar Binks. Today this movie looks like it's not a PC but there is a talk by Eduardo Ciannelli as a leader of the Indian opposition leader for a British raj that can succeed in most people's situation today. <br /> <br /> For this young boy was a great film. Three strong men have a feeling of love. There was a time when young boys liked to kiss a girl in the Saturday afternoon film was mushroom. Not like today when more skin is greeted with happiness. With the delay of mourning they lost guilt. The hope of this film will not be forgotten and a few who are the center of the facility will stop TCM and capture the film for action, adventure, and thousands of thousands instead of CGI executives.
