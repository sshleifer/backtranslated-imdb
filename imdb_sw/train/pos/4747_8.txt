Anyone who has never seen anything like anti-Matrix events has never seen this film. The events of the fight were covered by the psychological action of Yuen Woo Ping, who also made war in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are somethin. <br /> <br /> Li has a supersoldier who doesn't feel pain, who now lives like a library pacifist (got me). When other evil fighters begin to kill drug lords to take drug trafficking, Li is standing with his partner to help them. <br /> <br /> There are some amazing things that are going on in this film (one badguy gets his hand tied with a glass of glass and broadcast). The fights of events are filled with the captives of flying and punch; The body count is the way up there. Li has often been much better, and is confused with the bevy of beautiful female costars (Yip drives some large ass like his supersoldier colleagues). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a master of drugs (no suprises there; makes a cameo in every movie of HK). It is unfortunate that they do not have movies like this in the United States; I don't want to stay in all of these dubbing activities to see what I want most. Recommended.
