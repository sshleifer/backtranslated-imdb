Great surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the wonderful roles of a series that often does he has a professional, intelligent, world character. They do not have a great responsibility but they do a great job to show Lois Harlan as a tired woman, although it is used, covering her imprisonment.
