Uggh! I am not really attracted to this film, although I must admit it is technically well. You don't have to find 7 for the highest production standards, but for entertainment, it's rather poor. In fact, I see this one of the most films of over 50 years. He won Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is boring regularly and playing very much and playing and playing. That's for different reasons with some music that you have a good number of songs with a powerful story and act (such as MEET ME IN ST LOUIS), this film is almost all playing and playing. In fact, this film has about the longest song and dance numbers in history and like there in this, the film will grow fast. Give me more stories! As a result, with a greater number of production and weak stories, this film is like a sufficient diet of meringue - not enough for a long time. Thinking ... this is a film that has hit the "Cardinal Cardinal" and "The Place of the Sun" for the Best Photo! And, making things worse, "African Queen" and "Ace in Hole" did not even be appointed in this category! Even more surprising to me is that "Ace in Hole" lost to Better Writing, Screenplay for this film - though "An American in Paris" had no story to talk and was mainly driven by dance and song.
