Investigation (Dana Andrews) and the traumatic incident accidents kill the suspect in the murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it. The photo of Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere but the story gets water when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls by Andrews. He was doing well well digging himself into and out of a big hole, but he was a thin light at the end of the tunnel for a black film. Gary Merrill is as good as Scalese, the crime boss that Andrews has been turned down and down, and the tension between them gives the film the power and drive, especially the area in the bathroom with Merrill, Andrews, and Neville Brand, and the night when it emerges outside the Hospital Bellevue, which sets what should be the conclusion of the film. High score for the sky, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the overall picture of madness, although the horn of love and the fine order of police elements does not help its cause.
