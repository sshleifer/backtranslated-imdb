The NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) leases the room in the old brownstone where it meets with a few wonderful neighbors and furious hallucinations. As a lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) continues to make decisions on his behalf, he struggles to maintain his purity (not to mention his will to live) if his experience reduces his physical, mental and emotional health. <Br /> <br /> I do not want the best trophies during this physiological film for those unknown to it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not give much to the real sense of reality. Or, for that, any situation. It's kind of quietly, but not like a terrible traditional film. It is more than a story about the attempts of a skeptical woman to deal with a lifeless deficiency in her life. On that level, it works, but it can't be quite enough. What is the "Sentinel" * provides * are other pieces that use the eyes (especially, an exciting, interesting, and there is a Beverly D'Angelo area that should be considered reliable). There are also some visible years, but not so much. Destructive music by Gil Melle adds to the risk. It is not reviewed this film will be completed without inspection for filmmakers to collect the best actors for its beatings. Some of them do not do too much, but see them all together is amazing. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith makes a great impression as, respectively, a tough detective and a troubled neighbor. Other names of the story include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum seem short, and other faces are known as Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey, and Martin Balsam. Anyone who was the director of this film deserves some kind of award. <br /> <br /> Written by screens by director Michael Winner, perhaps known for "Death Plans" which made by Charles Bronson, from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. I did not focus on this very exciting awesome but it has time and enjoys it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
