I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now a popular club of Crowbar Night. It was the last year of 60 years of wild and this movie dropped home. It has everything; The gap of the generation, gender revolution, successful efforts, and conflict between following the "tradition" of one family for those seeking their own way through life. It was a fast, very enjoyable film. Vegas was on the highest point, Sin City in all glory. Beautiful women, famous watos, laugh, collision, romance, and even the end of happiness. The most enjoyable time on all. <br /> <br /> Photo from this film sits on my bedroom wall. I look and go back; during my youth and my time with my father, a good time in my life.
