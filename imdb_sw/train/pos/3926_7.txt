Plotwise this is a very small nanidunnit who engages as a drama / biopic game. However the only reason I wanted to see it first was because I wanted to know what Henry Fonda was really like his peak. I had no desire - it provides warm and charismatic performance. Additionally I can honestly say that I have never been tired at any time during the film, so power *** 1/2 out of *****
