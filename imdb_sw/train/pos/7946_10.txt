This movie is a real masterpiece, it is true. You rarely get such a flick of heart, full of joy, laughter, heart of heart, and a little game to put you on your fingers. A true family film, Bound Homeward tells the story of three brave animals, who decided to cross the Rocky Mountains in order to find their owners, following the changes they have made and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the most amazing things about this movie is its ability to give human beings human characteristics - a voice that makes it beautiful. Shadow is a wonderful, old, wise and brave character, and looking at him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very moving time. Possibly - who does not like dogs like Chance? She should be a very bad pup and very loved on the big screen. And Sassy is a very magician for a cat - she had me at stitches when she was cheating the defender; 'Here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life, chubby.' There were also positive emotional experiences, as Sassy was going on the waterfall (I was scared for him), a shade that fell on the ditch (near tears) and then a wonderful end, when all three pets go home ... include the shade of the ancient shade! Lover at all times - anyone who does not like this film should not just like animals. Use or buy it now, and will leave you with fun memories that will continue to live.
