"Dance, fools, dance" is an old Crawford-Gable car since 1931. Crawford has Bonnie Jordan, a gray woman whose life has parties, additions, and her clothes to jump from sea to swimming. These are approaching when his father dies and leaves him and his brother (William Blakewell) no matter what. Bonnie gets a job on her magazine Mary Smith; His brother goes to work for bootleggers. The head of the head is Jake Luva - displayed by Clark Gable as he plays again. Later, of course, he would turn out to be a romantic hero, but in '30s early, MGM used him as a bad man. Recognizing that her brother is dealing with illegal activities, Bonnie is standing to Luva. Gable and Crawford did a great team. His face words are little on the wild side, but that, with his play, is one of the things that makes fun of the film. Check out the Cliff Edwards, the sound of Jimny Cricket, like Bert. It is always interesting to watch movies, and "Dance, stupid, Dancing" is not different.
