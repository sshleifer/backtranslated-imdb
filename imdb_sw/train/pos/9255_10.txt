If you want to please the fun and loads of trickery, then you will enjoy this flick. I don't understand why someone doesn't like to enjoy this. Take for what it is: a car for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and laugh. Not Shakespeare, but it's good. Ericka Eleniak is quite good and owns in this one - Better than any part of Baywatch - and shows a knack for the trick of humor. Worse did not have many opportunities to expand on that. Tom Berenger is in the role of "Real Navy" completely and William McNamara works hard as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Give a walk with the hopper in the middle of expelling "Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that put my mind on and protect me from laughing. I bought it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Candy brain.
