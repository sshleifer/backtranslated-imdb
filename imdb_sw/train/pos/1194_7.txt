The film focuses on bullying Robert Taylor as a buffalo hunter and people who should hold him. Putting among the buffalo hunting numbers, shows the end of the horrible slaughter time and is full of drama and sadness for both buffalo and Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred for the Indians and naivete him that buffalo cattle will never be lost. In one area, they kill animals after animals, sometimes killing the Indians and then eating the food they were burning. Outside of this evil is the unsafe person who has been reduced to ask for his associates (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Russ Tamblyn) to leave. It is not a very good film and it is a game that builds up, leading to an improper and very effective conclusion in a blizzard.
