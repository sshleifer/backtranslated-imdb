This was a good historical history. John Turturro is the best as a victim of Luzhin's torture and clearly demonstrates the characteristic of the character as well as his play. Emily Watson is good at her role in helping her as Natalia a good partner. The relationship between chess and madness is closely checked by Gorris and Nabokov's knowledge as 'eternal' (ie 'Lolita') is evident in this film. I think now I will continue to read the novel. It was the end of touch and bad and it was difficult to keep a dry eye. A brilliant film!
