MacArthur is a good movie with good news about a good man? General Douglas MacArthur. This is true, the story of one of the American military figures, and the model known to me since the beginning of my memory. Although there is a continuing issue (there may be others). MacArthur's speech on the film as its 1962 address to the UN Military Academy for accepting Thayer's award did not have the words "old soldiers never die; (That was in his speech to Congress on his expulsion by President Truman. ) in 1951 for his charge (these two did not have an eye to the eye!) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as a prince who promised to return to the Philippines in World War II. his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his ministry, this film will be of great importance to a man known by WW II and the Korean War. and the evil evil of fascism and communism and who hated war as the only soldier can really be remembered. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
