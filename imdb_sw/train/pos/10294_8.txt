Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (at the end of May) and a good improvement in Carrey's old and personal work that did not forget in previous comedies. For untics under the tonrey under Carrey still and zap only with a crackle of her old man, Carrey's strength carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some surprising, tear moments. The realities of Jim's ability to act on show this film. This exciting summer summer hits many buttons, including great things and goofy times that are fully suited to this script. While not yet lost in a photography / act of collaboration, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great festival date with a strong message and spiritual humor and an awareness of its good taste. Eight out of ten stars.
