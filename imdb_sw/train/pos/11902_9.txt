These movies write the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of films of horrible films in the 1950s and 1960s which he sold hard. In "Ghosts" 13 you need viewers to see ghosts (they were colors, the film was in b & w). The "Tingler" had venue seats that had buzzer that were hitting the audience when the monster ran to the cinema. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy for all members if they were afraid to die! The movies themselves were very bad but people who had sex had people running to see. In this doc there are interviews with directors led by the Castle, executives in his movies and his daughter. It also comes into his home life and the kind of person he was (for all the accounts he was a good man). Documentary is a lover, very funny and riveting quite. It is very short (less than 90 minutes) and no time is wrong. You must see for the fans of the Castle and the film fans of fear. My single complaint - there were very few series shown from his photos. That along this is very good.
