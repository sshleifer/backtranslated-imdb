I went to see Mother's Fever and Mother, and I can say that we all liked it. It was not a typical romantic comedy where someone gives birth to another, and blah blah blah ... You were not waiting for the first weather kiss or for them to finally get together. It was more realistic, because you saw them through a relationship, rather than a whole movie that around them get together. People can actually relate to the film, because it was not seen as an abnormal situation, or an impossible situation. It was true, and I think it's the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. All in all ... I'd recommend!
