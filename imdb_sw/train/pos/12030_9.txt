hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) i Love film I liked Desire, And I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on t.v if I think she's good. I am a real fan of the Sabrina magician of the youth too, so this helps my look (don't ask). I like the ways that nicole arranges for her parents to be killed very gently, because she makes sure that someone else trigger the trigger and practices on the bottle, so it gives off her fingerprints (a well-planned idea), behind I think they all went back to nicole as she became like Her old boyfriend comes and puts a camera hidden under his shirt. I give this nine to ten films, and put them on my top ten films. And last but not least if someone sees this film on the mall please say like I saw on TV and I haven't written. bye
