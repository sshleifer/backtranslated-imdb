I'm scared. Surprised and worried that IMDB 428 users who voted before me did not give this film a higher score than 7. 7 ?! - that's C! If I could give FOBH 20, I'd like to do that. This film creates on the pantheon of modern comedy, with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious movies of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you should see this !! If you don't know anything about rap music - learn something, and then look at this! Comparison to the 'Spinning Pipe' did not know the understanding of the conversion of this special film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you would like this. Watch and vote 10!
