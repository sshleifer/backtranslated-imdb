I love this film. It is one of those movies that you can watch from time to time and still get involved. Congratulations! I believe everyone involved in making the film and script should be proud of themselves. It's very simple, you feel like you are looking at a real life band. I would like to see more movies like this. I am glad that you did not choose the popular Hollywood stars in this film because it probably would not have worked. And even though Billy Connolly is well-known, he was very active in the role and I couldn't think of another person playing. Welcome again, I believe that this film deserves the Comedy Award of Peter Sellers for Bill Nighy. And when you come to the last place ... well I can say what !!!!
