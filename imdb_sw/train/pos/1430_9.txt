This was playing at the Amsterdam theater that we wanted to see was purchased so we went to this, without knowing anything about it except the document on the planet. We were very happy in our luck if this was a very powerful film about life and the perfect balance we all share with other residents in the world. This film has the most beautiful pictures I saw in the film and took me from the desert to the sea so that the rainforest and showed things that I had never seen in the film, TV or book! The "world" is a film that every student should see before they have jaded. I will encourage my grandson to see this film since he gets to the planet we leave. This is also a film to see on the theater or a great television since photography is powerful and unusual.
