All work done in the first season has been very surprising. The first look to get Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or if I like to call minis. minis to do the best work that I have ever seen children do. chief executives and information executives, namely Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc, forget you you're looking for a false t.v. show they seem to make this show live. all of this is the best show I've ever seen
