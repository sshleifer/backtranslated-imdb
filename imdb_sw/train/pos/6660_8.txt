"Gandhi as husband and father?" has always been discussed with people in India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story that few would know the information. Certainly the understanding of Gandhi's personal life. Overall, I loved the movie for stories and movies. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna, and Shefali Shah have done a good job. Many scenes of the movie will be beautiful desktop wallpapers ... a pleasant job. Real music of Indian music as a background color during certain parts of the movie provides a good feel for events. However, what I did not like was the story of the story. For several points, I've got a sound-dramatized sound. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good job with Anil Kapoor Productions. I would like to suggest if "must-see-once". 8/10
