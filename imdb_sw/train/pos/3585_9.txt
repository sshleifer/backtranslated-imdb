Good stories about young, leaders, secondary football "star". What? Where will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much would you lose if you were eligible for an innocent girl? Can love beat obstacles? What? Can you win small people with small motives of the city? When your friend scores and “loses”, will you do everything in your power to pay him or her, or will you be a person on it, and respect the right to choose? Will you build and make it your victory over the girl "trouble"? What? Can you stand with someone who is just sin is to have his own opinion, be able to make his own decisions, choose yourself? It made me think twice before giving my judgment on who was right and who was wrong, but one is for a very positive-movie very exciting theme. Thumb up!
