Christina Raines has a good example in New York who wants a new apartment and starts meeting with wonderful neighbors and revealing secrets on the building and she herself slowly build up to the top and end of the film. This film has all sorts of good things from the Roman Catholic Church against the devil, on the way to hell, with mysterious rituals, for the growing conspiracy, and ultimately for the famous talented actors and famous film actors. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, and who can forget John Carradine as a former priest. Many of these ham actors - especially the Meredith Burgess offer good performance of comic / desolate as one of the neighbors with a little bird and cat. Meredith does not remember as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some artists don't have anything to do like Jose Ferrer in the role of thanks even though not more than cameo. Sentinel is a beautiful movie with a lot of psychological features and some really awesome scenes. The last event is exciting and still rainy. I see a sexual offense and free hostage in the film, especially any place with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it very important? I don't think. Also, the things of the father / daughter were too small, but the film is always working and has a speed to win. Director Michael Winner works as a job and it is best to create tension and a terrible time of film. Carradine exhibitions are very suitable.
