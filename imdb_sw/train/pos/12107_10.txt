I saw this movie as a child on the part of the creature when I lived in New York. It was a very good movie, though not as good as the Horror Hotel. I had bought this film on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because on a DVD I bought there are several cases where participants talk in French and / or Italian and no titles are given. Then the other respondents respond in English to what it said. Type of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some executives are written differently than on IMD. Besides, this film is different because Elsie's behavior takes its clothes and provides nude shot in one area and in another area Julia tries to seize Elizabetha (Barbara Steele) to do with her and beat the bed with kissing when Steele opposed. The area was in the TV version, but it was greatly changed. I wonder if there is any additional image that can be inserted into an ultra-remedied version? It seems unhappy that some of the old classics of the low budget have been hit by bits and sold for all kinds of planned versions. Where are the master bands and all unused photos? <br /> <br /> In addition to the first boring minute twenty minutes before Allen was released on the Castle, another part of the film is very good. There is not much harm (but the face of Herbert after the Julia clubs are good). A fascinating and mysterious, foreign, and interesting story of Barbara Steele makes the movie better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele was not in this film, it would be a big zero. He makes the film ten!
