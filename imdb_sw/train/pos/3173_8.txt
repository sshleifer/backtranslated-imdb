Imagine it's a terrible thing to lose ... especially when you have talented actors. The author / director Jones desired no time to look at the viewer and the main character. Anyone who has shared a house with a slob will be crying with laughter. Anyone who has arrived when the meter of the meter puts the ticket on your windshield will grow. We all wanted to redeem a bad problem from a person's head. These are just snippets of what was stored during the "Cross Eyed" view, a heart-drawn film that should be a continuous stone for Jones and its sense of humor in front and behind the camera.
