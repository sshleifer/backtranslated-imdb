Solomon 's King's games bring us to Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides when he returns to England and becomes the father of his son. He finds that his wife's parents have taken care of his son and that he has little chance of securing his bond for a lot of money in a suit of law. It comes to Alison Deedy (Elizabeth Elizabeth) whose father is Africa and is being held with an African tribe for the compensation of her father Elizabeth had sent. Elizabeth wants Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. It is a good way to help characters who go with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want a map too. <br /> <br /> The movie focuses on your thoughts to the end. Patrick again strikes a decent man who comes to help a woman in trouble. Patrick is a very good actor who can easily show enthusiasm, lose and despair, a quiet and quiet person, angry and strong; In Solomon's cases Solomon his character actually laughs. I would like to see Patrick Swayze in the story of love and love again, one that is not appropriate to lock his jaws and be strong. Maybe a little play would help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and it is useful to watch it.
