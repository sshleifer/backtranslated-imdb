I do not like "inflation grade" but I just needed to give this 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw last night and woke up today to think about it. I am sure that the remake of Hollywood that someone tells me about, along with J Lo and Richard Gear, would be better, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was a emotional and stimulating thing to me that it is very difficult to reflect any way that can be improved, or its environment has been changed to a different culture. The stories I saw worth looking, and for the scenes to fight scenes or guns go away or whatever kind! Imagine that! All the characters seemed good, ... even non-base characters had a good development and enjoyable character, and giving it seemed to be right. It is always difficult to find a good music video in our day and age, and maybe this is not quite good (there is much to learn how to play, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who have played for a dance in life we would think so much of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell stories about a middle-aged man, and succeeding the family in Japan, looking for something ... he doesn't know exactly what. <br /> <br /> For the Japanese team who contributed this film, thank you for creating and doing.
