To be fair, I expected the car to run in this film. There was only one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' was a great movie that I enjoy having a DVD. The only true names in cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a professional doctor of the radio and B-Movie villain par-best Billy Drago as Revelation-quoting Freeway Killer. But all others offer good performances. I loved so much how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a bit of guts. He could have been the main character of the powerless, but he is rounded as he drago with the help of the hunter of James James Russo. Russo, I am afraid, comes as a replacement of wood, but again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very good but for the back story Sunny is given by his former commanding officer. Dangerous behavior is very high in the film and the lonely road of lonely nights and the killer who strikes its length in its gray gray sedan is the best way to create tension, and the music used to strengthen the film is well suited. I don't know why there are some people who hate this film. Different blocks for different people, I think. But I was very happy 'Freeway' and I can recommend very much.
