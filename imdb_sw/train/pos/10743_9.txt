I have read a lot of information here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a horrible piece of history. There are a few who think that the added information is weak and worthless. About two brothers meeting back after a tragedy and a hanger of a cliff on Tony. But I don't think the subject is not necessary. As I many of theorists think that our own life is narrations. We live and make our own autobiography. So if we talk about our lives this is always in the form of information. We don't write facts like: Birth, Childhood, High School etc. We create stories about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we know the story, we want to keep history in the story too. Because in the form of stories we can identify ourselves. We can better understand what happened in history when it is told in a story. So that's the purpose of adding stories to the document. Stories are weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If I was out there I would like to have a feeling of brotherhood. And the next step, make a blockbuster movie about it. True, it has recently come up with a great film about 9/11. Although, there are few about this issue, but none of them like this document. But what if there is a film in 5 years? I agree that it is worth trying to get more than 9/11. But I also accept that movies are one of the best ways to tell history. What? How many movies about world war 2 have we seen? If I didn't see these movies my views of WW would be quite different. I remember seeing the list of Schindlers, and I cried for hours at the class. Movies give you a good picture of what happened in history and though it is a lie that contributes to the tragic memories and injuries. So my point: telling my story is not always bad, it makes us realize the story, and makes us never forget what happened.
