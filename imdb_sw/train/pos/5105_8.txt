How can one say the fact that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best documentary of Texas's life for that period. Consider the following: Men beat their wives, they are wearing glasses at night, marrying and fighting war, committing adultery, and compete with the bulls. Try with a movie name that shows real life clearly. They can't make them again. It seems that current films are always about people who have a lot of money, live in a big house, drive expensive cars and don't work. This movie has a celebration area about getting a trailer for the ring! <br /> <br /> However, I check it at least once a week. No child. I have given this film from end to end. feel free to write an email to learn more about my reason for calling it a document. Consider the following scenarios: Bud finds Sissy - split - he has fun with the waves, he walks the plane - returns half of the peace sign respecting his horn to add effect then destroy. <br /> <br /> Buds mother calls him closer. 18 hours after arriving in the city, on Sunday, to see if he has a job yet - all he did is drink and set (x2), with help from a uncle and aunt who covers for him. "You all live like a pig" Think about why this area is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? What? Can't count it without showing a dirty ditch? God I love you! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help him give a cow. Just a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes only remove her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh, you didn't hit my husband the other night, then let's get this goin 'lesson, so we won't say the fact that he wants to comfort her in the future during a lot of Bud and Sissy struggles, which in a whole way happens to the public - in Gilley! <br /> <br /> The image of the wedding reception of taking a session (oh humanity!) can at least arrange or move chairs out of the way. "My legs are momma of sweat" <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you don't have to put a veil like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology. It's a real life document. I just loved the director's ward ....
