This is a very good Spanish movie but I'm worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world do not know what the Spanish Civil War is about or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a great opportunity but I could see how the film can be controversial until you gather all the pieces. I doubt whether this will be a great concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other audiences may be confused until later on the film. The movie comes with Carol's 12-year-old and her mother returns home to her mother. Years have passed and you gather that they come to Spain from New York City. In spite of caution, Carol says Spanish well and many films are about how it changes. Why he and his mother are alone, I will leave them now for those who have not taken the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the Republican side (who eventually lost in this blood dispute). The movie receives a unique color for a good camera function and music. The slow and flight run is not bad you are the person who can accept the film in this way. I have seen other Spanish films about this war and this represents them very well - it's not good or bad - just a piece of the film's beauty on those who were left behind as well as coming well for flick. PS - If you don't know which side, Republicans were mostly social and supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the United States). Politicians were led by Franco and were supported by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy.
