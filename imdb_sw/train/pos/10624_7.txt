I thought I must qualify my post after reading other reviews. The movie is not good, but it has a lot of great things. Lights and events with the camera function are good. Stories are slow and weak, but entertaining. Acting is bad, but no worse than you will find at the SyFy Center. Music is good and gore is good. It has a large picture of the skin in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the full film and when possible, it was still enjoyable. Women are very attractive and a leading actor does a good job of stimulating and attractive. Movie was very clean for modern films and suitable violence for 13 children and more. There were no sexual events. I gave 7 out of 10 and I think it's okay. I would like to look again if I had nothing better to do. The angel who hit the gay gay was the worst feature of the film, the devil is completely creepy.
