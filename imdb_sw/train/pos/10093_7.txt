The beautiful shopgirl in London has opened her legs with the owner of miaone tea and recently finds herself living with her in her villa in Ceylon of England. Although considering the book of Robert Standish, this initial introduction is a very reminiscent of "Rebecca" of Hitchock, and a beautiful woman Elizabeth Taylor with a chief of staff in the house and (almost immediately) her husband, who is still under the father's finger. its dead-but great. Taylor, the last-minute player for Vivien Leigh, was seen to be a bright-soft flavor in the style of high quality, and its performance was quite powerful; however, once the husband Peter Finch begins to drink heavily and asks for orders, one can think of his commitment to him rather than an eyechistic (this feeling stops the end too). Still, the film provides great votes for soap rabbits: a romantic game, a little travelogue, a translation drum, a beat of elephants, and a long breakout for cholera! *** from ****
