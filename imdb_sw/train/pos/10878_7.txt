Personally, I enjoyed cutting the cut. It was the first time I saw the release of Australian characters to watch. The most common type prevents the popular film hollywood. For each of the most common cooking games and dramas coming from Australia I would like to be able to see the movie of the horror of the home which was not a deficit of anything. I didn't even think it was a spoof of other movies. It was a great fear of landscapes such as fantasy at Elm Street, not shouting or knowing what you did at the end of summer and therefore there was more suspension for unbelief. I think it's about the time of Australian films attempted to get more in common form. <br /> <br /> Ward was natural, scary enough and only just fun. I would like to give seven out of ten and I didn't do anything big. It did what I was expecting to do, pleasing me and fearing me enough time. I enjoyed it.
