The most popular was "popular" with tension and the release of the cartoon where the main character is located in a dangerous danger, only saved by the hero at the end of the second. This casper is alone I can remember where death takes a hand. But even in death, there is still the end of happiness. It 's always in the cartoons of Famous Studios is that "good always prevails". The Pope always gets his spinach on time, Baby Huey always hits dog foxes, Little Audery always "learns his lesson". And some of the FS cartoons are dark and sad. <br /> <br /> You give them credit. like I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I don't think anyone was putting a good brand of cartoon at that time than Paramount. Paint, animation, music (Winston Sharples great), editing, sound. They were consistent with a bright example of the best that the art form had to offer.
