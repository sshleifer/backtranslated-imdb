Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without the UK's emphasis, he much more than he does with his high definition and higher than Ebenezer Scrooge. It is best when it fights Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. As Scott stands in front of a large window, the sun's light provides top cloth over it; all you see is its silhouette. Added to Scott's voice, a great blow, the effect is moving ... much like the first location of Marlon Brando at APOCALYPSE now. "Fear," really! However, if they say, one thing that works for them can also work against you. Because Scott reflects such an abstract idea in the movie, proves infectious. To put it another way, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "after," even though it should not be. What can you call the effect of "Doctor Smith", since Jonathan Harris used the same technique when playing that role with many other heavies (step with the same screen). Really, I don't think of the glib of Scott hears liability. But others "Christmas Christians Carol" can. Look at the film and judge for yourself.
