In the past it says that the artist must get his great knowledge and magic on the heir, an old man who is very old and very proud, known to all as "King of Masks," he needs to be a young man learning to pass and develop. His wind and humanity, tho, found him to pay a few dollars to a young man who was evacuated by a natural disaster in China, in this case, a great flood in the 1930s. It takes his new, 7-year-old friend in his grassland, to live with its valuable and beautiful monkey, "Great," just discover that the child is the child of the child. The life is once transformed, as the love he feels for the little slave slave enters into the traditional stupifying that requires to pass his art to the young man. There are many stories in this one ... many people are touched, and Chinese culture opens itself to our Western eye to explore. Thousands of years of inheritance comes from under the drama, and a few will leave this DVD to dry eye. The technology transfer itself is not great, since I have seen the sound levels everywhere in the meter, and actually can see the video transfer lines in several parts of the film. It is highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
