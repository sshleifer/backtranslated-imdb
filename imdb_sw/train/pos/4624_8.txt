Believe it or not, the Inspector Final Inspector Car is what gave you anything of Gadget. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm twelve years old, so it's not clear that I wasn't around when the Inspector's Auditorium on his job. Indeed, I would hear him, but I did not know him. When reading, remember that I haven't seen the original SERIES (I would like it!). That's just about a Gaba of something that I have ever looked at (even if now considering) and I will focus on what I liked about it since everyone else is very bad. For all of you who accuse, I've had sex down there, too. = P First, for the child's sense of humor, you can see this film is very good. I thought it was, so let me out. I also thought the animations and animations were good, and I am also happy there was more Gadget in it, for he is my favorite character. (I don't like Penny.) Then there was a Claw (his voice was bad, though) and Madcat; I thought they were well done too. The gadget's Idiocy was seen to be very good, if not spread (ie, hand-hand hand-hand). Can I make a good photo, though = = P) Oh, and I liked the song that entered the credit. Yes, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> And, like all movies, there are other obstacles, too. <br /> <br /> Car talks? What is it with that? You can say this was aimed at young boys. That won't bother me quite if you didn't have the fact that cars are essentially saved the day. I would like very much if Penny and Brain stopped. And, apparently, the gadget liked his car more than it would be natural. Very strange, say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Great was the most important for Gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he wasn't very happy with people, but he didn't hate Gadget, from what I've read. As an inspector, his personality was widespread. Well, that's so much I say about this movie. I thought the animation was made on the basic plot of the car and that it was very good; more than the Gadget's live action videos (created, played, connected!) at least. Maybe I just enjoy it because this is the one that has put me in the first place Gadget, or maybe my mind has gone wrong, or maybe I'm normal, but I've loved this movie, even though I'm too old for.
