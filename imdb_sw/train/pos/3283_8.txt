As a surreal partner (in the art and film) I was delighted to discover this film at IFC. It is obviously a protector. Most of the other technologies say a general plot (not all right) so I can't bear any bearing with that. The main thing is the alternative concept of the world that brings with the anticipated disease of Ana, and how she can connect with another person after being "alone", and finally with her family, which I believe is still at least a little. It just could be called a terrible movie to have awesome scenes but it's fantasy (for a little hint of "coming age" just because Ana is before the boy who "hates boys"). I strongly recommend those who enjoy the decrease of their thinking.
