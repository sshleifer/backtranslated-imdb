Again, it seems to be completely unknown, to me at least, that "Arthur" is only suitable for 6.4 out of 10 possible. One of Steve Gordon's masterpiece is "impossible" completely if it is not "impossible" to isolate the different components. That he was able to make a friend of laughing rather than breaking tears, itself, strange. That gave Dudley Moore his most beautiful role, and every aspect of the movie concerned with its results, including the logo, seems to me patent and egregious. I encourage everyone to sit through this film and not laugh loudly. But, it seems, almost a third of his listeners managed it. Well, I, for one, I've got to get Gordon's all interesting and proposed, and iikes the pastor of Geraldine Fitzgerald and Stephen Elliott killers should be the dead son of the characters of nature. Even the black administrator managed to escape the exile, and the late, shouted Sir John Gielgud had the right to accept his fees, but it was not okay to carry out his duty. "Arthur" has no efforts to "Underztand," very little to reduce corruption, "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not booze, it is another drug to choose, including meth, and addiction is only symptoms, not goals), he only looks in his form of kizzizi.
