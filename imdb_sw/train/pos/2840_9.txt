I saw the screening of this film and I was very happy. Not often I see all my actors in one film at the same time. I really enjoyed the pocket area and it is good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together. I think their chemistry on the camera is a direct result of their time with the camera. My proposed section was too far away (surprisingly) a piece of Bret Ratner ... Without giving too far, I'll just tell you that there is a surprise waiting for you ... The feeling that they had lived together together. <br /> <br /> All Chris Cooper and the groups of Ethan Hawke were filled with punch and surprise who seem to be true and similar to the experience that I have had in a big apple. Most of the films are a great opportunity to take a date ... especially if you have already enjoyed the city. <br /> <br /> I can't wait next to Love Cities.
