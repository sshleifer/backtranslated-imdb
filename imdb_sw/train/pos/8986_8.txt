Anton Newcombe makes a film and he is the main subject. Watching him while the song is not the whole album showed a quick guy that real talent. He thinks he is a god but it is bright and interesting. DW is not really interesting to compare music or otherwise. "Hey, do you get a driver's license?" , Anton says to cameraman, "Well go to this guitar pawn!". Good use of documentation / home videos. Great to see rock rocks are still being done. Doc cool about the creative process. If you would like this to see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sent out! on DVD. Good Anton experience is this film. 8 out of 10
