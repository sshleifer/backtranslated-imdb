Mama Night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I dreamed of a great desire. Instead I got a film that shows perfectly the beauty, humor, sequence, and above all other discomfort of the novel Vonnegut novel. It is definitely the development of Nolte to date. Catching failure and independence for Howard Cambell Jr. from time to time to show the trick of his speech and tears behind the tears behind him. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutly hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is offensive in his squad for the truth as a Cambell partner. John Goodman deals with more than efficiently as "King of Fairy Blue" of Cambell. The story of the Pinnocioesque of Cambell trying to become his own hero and without knowing that his villian good is a bright and clear view in what we are like people. And besides that, it is one of the most romantic movies I have ever found. Cambell is a body of love and all foolishness. And in the amazing concluding movies, he finally learns that being a real boy like his Blue Fairy wife gave her a desire. And he knows that ... well, look at the film and you will see. Mother's mother is undoubtedly in my mind one of the best films made. It is a good story of poetry that carries inside our emotions and is completely loyal to its original author.
