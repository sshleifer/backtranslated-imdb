After seeing a lot of Greek movies I feel a lot of doubt for many of them. But after watching this I felt surprised. Style is beautiful without a great attempt. You cannot claim that the screenplay is very good or the image is complete or technical object. It is a real story and it occurs in the rural areas of Greek in the forgotten areas from God. The movie is like punch into the stomach and I would really want that stuff not like this. It clearly speaks of the discrimination of the Greek people (ignorance) for anything different. The problem of this man is not that he is a former criminal. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (that's why all the good things he does turn back to him). And he also speaks of the apathy of the people, because there are other people who are faced with the hunting of the King, but they have no confidence to express their opinion. Finally you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the community to be a religion and try to act as God says, but at the same time he does it right with the King. This shows how people easily reduce their feelings or their beliefs based on the established system. Finally you can have a good lesson from this very bad story, meaning that you can understand and be part of this community only if you want to be one of them. If you want to remain separate and even alone, you are lost (and not far from the truth) I think it's a problem that the story is true and this should be a bell for everyone. There is no comment on the main actor because it has already been awarded and I believe that his play was good. A small comment on Hatitsavvas (who attacks the police), he is like a dinosaur, has had many responsibilities and I am sure that this role was very simple but he is playing so great that you can't deny the great bravo. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a beautiful Greek movie.
