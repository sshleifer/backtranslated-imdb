During transporting trains through Europe, Jesse's American (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States, and Celine goes to Paris. "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite suggestions, in fact one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen. It's a small movie budget with a very simple and realistic story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the conversation is wonderful. The focus is surprising, sending the emotions of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have completed my 1,000 verification number on IMDb, and I choose "Before Sunrise" for this important number because it is a very special film for me. I can't understand why this film was not selected for Oscar, which has very good screens, leadership and presentations. Yesterday I have been watching this film for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. Voting for me is ten. Headline (Brazil): "Antes doing Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
