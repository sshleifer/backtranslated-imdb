Maybe most of the films, this is not for everyone. For some people the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen when they themselves are a good explanation of their own hell. For others the way this speaks of a certain depth they know is, some part they wish to contact. I think it's where I work in my life these days, but I count myself in the last group camp. I saw the meditation speed of this film near the hypnotic, gently help me in a particular area near mythological. This is a true story of the trip, a beautiful picture of many of our distance we must travel if we call the perfect circle at the end of our day. Much as written about Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Sawa, although I don't know there are words to show a good balance of sadness and the glory of the wisdom he has given us for us. Now knowing that he was discussing with his own death while sitting on the tractor he made me like to have the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had little to be satisfied with the truth he brought to many people, not just to "act" but to share his humanity completely with the same cruelty of cruelty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of the economy, I don't know the full loan has been given to Mr Lynch for the courage shown by allowing the stories to develop so slow. Man out of film production, I even understand there are a few places of modern life where the word "when it's money" is very accurate. Entering into our hearts is not an adventure that can run, and on his loan Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he did not just tell the story - he had invited his audience to spend time and their own deaths. No easy task, that's. If you would like to get the film's ability to let you know the value of your own value, you can do worse than spending a few hours with Heart Stories. And then give a little time for just a moment to listen to his voice at nighttime.
