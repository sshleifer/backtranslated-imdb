This movie is intelligent. That is more than many other movies, it reduces common denominations - ignorant people probably don't appreciate. The story also depends heavily on the conversation. It has a certain parallel to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is very lighter, somehow less abstract, and just better. <br /> <br /> Script, characters and even a little surreal atmosphere feel quite completely. Actors are actively playing. I have often seen a movie where the script and acting has worked this perfectly together. Conversation goes into very private matters, and the risk of becoming a little more. It takes, however, to sit on the right side almost all the time, though I have seen a little shorter and shy. Comparing on this beautiful line you need strong talented executives. Sometimes, it produces good results, and in general this movie is very amazing! Just very, very rarely "love" in the films shown in a way that I feel reliable and true. Every time it is available, the results are amazing. I think the best and non-timely beauty of the woman's actress has helped very little in this regard. It still looks amazing in this film, 12 years later. <br /> <br /> This is a gem of a movie that you can't miss. One of the best movies I have seen since the 1990s!
