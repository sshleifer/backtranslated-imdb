Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's star in this "modern" music show the comic capabilities of MacDonald. Surreal's 40s songs seem to be annoying fashions 40 even as they have now. The appearance of the eyes and the set (yes B & W) to increase the quality of surreal, the dream of the entire film. Many beautiful songs create a film, and "Twinkle in Your Eye" total number, including a fun number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the big cast is Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also seen in small portions are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> It is great fun and beautiful to see MacDonald's amazing in its jitterbug / vamp system. He can do it all.
