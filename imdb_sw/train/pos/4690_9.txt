Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in children's classes in Entomology and I can still remember the excitement of children; were spellbound! It is not just about staff who have built and live in "Clay Houses," but also about other animals that use mounds. There is a wonderful place that cobra fights with a fox track when colonial colonization looks. It is not only for entomology classes, but also for teaching about the environment because there is a lot about cooperation between termites and other organisms and all the ecosystems that live in and around the hills. I would like to be available on DVD, so I can look at it again and show others.
