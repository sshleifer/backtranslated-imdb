Police Police Police do not have a shell of course, one of the most astonishing exhibitions made, but not just in the animation field. When the first part (Acts 1 and 2) refers to action and joy, the second part is very large and one should not treat the second part in the same way as the first part. Creativity is really out of this world and the reputation is more brilliant. You must have an extra level of mind to understand the problems of the Second Part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte jumps over the tanks and does not make any sense. One can also question the possibility of Bonaparte flying on the wing of the Helicopter Gunship though it was cool. Buaku rules.
