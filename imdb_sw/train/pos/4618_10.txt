I enjoyed this film. I was fifteen when this movie went out and I could get involved. This will be the movies I will show my children to inform, the feelings they have are normal. It's amazing to see how we can be so desperate for things at a very young age ... who knew that we'll come back again .... again and again .... great movie!
