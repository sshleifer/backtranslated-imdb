After reading this review of this film, I really started to look at it with great doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. However, this is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. Many of the reviews I had read, said that a hard plot made it very difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end connects to a lot of things that you feel like striking because you have lost too much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", for it's not funny (in fact, it's very dark), and it's more intelligent, in the way you see the episodes from different views (and, in one of the The best episodes of the film, Jason Statham uses five minutes to lift it to move with himself). The way it is similar to two films I have just explained, is that it is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who gives good performance as a guide, and Ray Liotta, who uses many films at Speedos, but provides good performance no less. If you have time, and you have time to reflect on the film, and even look again, it starts to see all the symbols and tips put through the film. I think it's amazing, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on his game.
