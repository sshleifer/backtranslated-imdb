In all versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of all. Welcome to the original story - with a small breach and withdrawal, e.g. The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus swineherd recognizes Odysseus in hiding in his home - a real acting scenery and real and all the donations to make this a truly memorable masterpiece, not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Despite the fact that the discussion with headlines is entirely in Italian, if someone knows the story of the story, it can still make headlines and tail of what is going on and what the speakers say (if you have a good copy of Odyssey by hand). At least I did, and so much helped me to learn Italian language to better understand more movie.
