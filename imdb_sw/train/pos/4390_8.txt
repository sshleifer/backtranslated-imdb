In the process of attempting to establish the understanding of the audience and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) the film's representatives undermine North and Jayhawkers. Missouri never left the Union and the Union Army is not the invading force. The kings of the South fought against the Rights of the Government: the right to have slaves, the elect of the law and the judges, and to use the political destruction system. There is nothing good in it. Missouri workers had been able to travel east and join the Confederate Army. It seems to me that the story is not related to controversy. When he leaves the followers, not because he saw the wrong in his way, he certainly does not give up the power of the cause of the abolition.
