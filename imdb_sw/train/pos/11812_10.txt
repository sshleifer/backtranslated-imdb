These movies are the best movie to watch the book of comic. Sets, clothing and colors are very clear as entering the comic book. This is a movie I think of when Mob is mentioned, suits, hats and perspectives. <br /> <br /> Hoffman offers comic exemption as Mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries, and fails, winning Tracy on. This film has all ethnic tribal people - they hide people in cement, they drive people, they tie a good man and try to beat his boy's house. This movie is common in the sense of the word, even the angel of the camera sounds the comic book. It's very good to turn on an old movie and see that someone knows how comic should be movies after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! You see this MOVIE!
