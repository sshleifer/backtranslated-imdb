Diagnosis The killings have been shown in many days of BBC1's day since I was investigating when I was sick from school 10 years ago - I know I should not enjoy too much, in the same way I should not enjoy 'killed wrote' but I am totally addicted to all and even to DVD box-sets .... OK I know that it's sad! Dick Van Dyke carries a show as a star like Dr.Mark Sloan a Doctor at the Community Community Hospital who is also a LAPD Police Officer - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - a real man) of life) is a Police Officer, who needs his father's support for many suspected deaths. With this trip is Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) Pathologist Specialist in the Community Community and for the first week of the week was Scott Baio calling Dr Jack Stewart, who has switched off and left a year 1995 and hope to continue with the best things ... he should stay where he was, he had not done anything to remember since ... and his appearance for many years was in the Creation of Baby 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear! Dr Jack Stewart was changed by Dr Jeesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter who entered Baio's shoes with ease. <br /> <br /> The series is very implausible but what series Whodunit is not? (The death wrote - everywhere Jessica is going, someone ends up dead, or Dowling's Mystery hidden under the Hurricane Revolution by Nickkick of Nun) / The series was lighter until 1997 this is because the Assistant Normal Briggs Hospital played with Michael Tucci and Nurse General Secretary & Mark played by Delores Hall, After 1997 all these participants were not in a row and became a grittier and bigger budget, events included many more steps, a single hospital. is beaten. This was a family show to Van Dyke for reasons such as Dick's Son Barry, also had Dick's Daughter And all her grandchildren do appear in various events. When the series was going to be a little deceptive, one place I remember Dick van Dike plays all of her family, which was just a little out of the ordinary, but for 'killed' in general a very good TV that had many players beautiful Stars. Since this show has been completed in 2001, Dick & Barry have been found again in the 'MURDER 101' series of TV made by Channel Hallmark, a lot of good following the same way, and still enjoys. Dick who is now in the mid-80's does not seem to change a great deal, and it looks like he will work until the end of pain. *** / OVER OF THE SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
