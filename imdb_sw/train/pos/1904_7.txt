The 1981 comedy still adds thanks to the collective efforts of the author / director Steve Gordon and star Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, in just forty years, died after completing this, his only film film. It is a huge loss of unfortunate since it shows the true hand to the self-driven privacy that makes the whole film possible.
