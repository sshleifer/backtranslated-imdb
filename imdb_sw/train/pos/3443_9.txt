A lively, honest, confident, and psychological film that is experiencing the pain of the pain caused by rape - "deficit" is a film under-radar due to lack of distribution because, in fact, the film is so with cruelty in its exhibition, that if it had been presented to the exhibition, it might have found itself to be a great hate. The movie deserves to be found not only for its dark themes, and not just for its amazing direction and real style - but most of all for its exhibitions. Chad Faust is quite stunning, bringing enough disease and enough weakness to make one, not related to, but understanding someone's lost perception of deviation on his sexuality and not only women she rapes, but also a fragile uncertainty within her own . It is a support function that is hard, bold, and emotional in the Faust section. And difficult to forget. Still, standing is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is a complete revelation. The visit-de-force of great tics of truth, and one of the most subtle, but the top-like-can be exhibits at some point. While Dawson is seen in the most beautiful exhibitions in some of the worst films, he shows here what it takes to give an exciting and moving motion, in fact and emotionally. One of the best films of his year (and in 2007 was stable) - if the film was smuggled and the sound of the show, I would be praising him, along with Dawson and Faust. Worse it was also an improper way for an extended appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
