I really enjoyed the Night listener. It is one of the best summer movies. Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. They all played just the right sign for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds touch to the amazing comic. The Collette Tone is as good as Mama, and never goes up. Everyone is very reliable. It is a short movie, less than an hour and a half. I saw the release version is generally nine minutes longer than Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more misleading images were cut off from the film. <br /> <br /> The director told stories and made in a direct way, which is an enjoyable change from many directors these days who seem to think their work is attracting the audience instead of telling stories and telling them well. Do not put sand and printed with ads. It's not the joy of Hitchcockian. Check out the Night listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you expect to expect Hitchcock you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint to the movie was end. The director can leave a little more to the attention of the audience, but this is a small quibble.
