This is the most beautiful film. Color photography is as good as it shows the breach of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant colors. Other local events in different homes, etc. are equally brilliant. As for music, what else could say unless Lanza's voice was on 'its peak as many of the world' known and loved ones. Dorothy Kirsten is also wonderful as her soprano sound is similar to that of Lanza in a pleasant harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their traditional independence and life stories of Caruso. There is little value in the story line relating to actual events. For example, the facts related to his death are entirely made and do not accept the true relationship. There are some very good web sites that say the true Caruso story and it has several pictures of it. These websites can be found using any good search engine. There are also several books available on his life history. But, the line of false stories does not do anything to make this beautiful film. Lanza sounds, Kirsten, and chorus members are the real stars of this film. Enjoy, I know that I certainly did.
