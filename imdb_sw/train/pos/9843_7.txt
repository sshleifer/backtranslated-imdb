* May be demolished * It can have corrupters <br /> <br /> In Shrek (movie) & Pixar (studio), this is the most traditional animation film. Put together the characters who are usually not visible together (not mentioned, try to save the human baby and bring it back to his father). They start as an enemy and live as a best friend. If this sound is like a Disney film, it is (just released through the 20th century Fox). The trailer on the movie was one of the best I have seen for years, but the film does not live for the prospect of the trailer set. The problem is the fact that the creators of the film did not make the mind of the film viewers. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is aimed at children. Parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 minutes. The attention of their children focuses on something other than them. Theme is excellent and sound is good but this is not the most beautiful film. Children will love this film, adults will only love it.
