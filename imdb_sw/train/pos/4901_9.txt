No message. No sign. There is no dark under the circle. For a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and good fun set to-find and people who really had a good time doing it. It is an enjoyable drug and some of the trash to be out of the label. Of course anything with Judi Dench worth is worth watching. And the singing of the brilliant jazz Cleo Laine is a bonus. This woman is in the same league as Ella late. This goes to my film shelf to be deleted anytime I don't feel the need for a warm experience with a good natural bottle. Just a beautiful film!
