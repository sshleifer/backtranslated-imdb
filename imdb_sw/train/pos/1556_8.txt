Like other people who spoke about the "Time of Fr√§ulein" I was accidentally injured on this little gem on the TV night night without hearing before. A wonderful mix of myths of legends of the heroes on the heroine of the fight against the uncomfortable on the one hand and the appearance of the truth and by the investigation of the battle in the trenches on the other hand had me walking from the beginning. This is one of the best five movies about WWI (others are "All Reliable on the West", "The Ways of Glory", "Gallipoli" and post-war wars "La vie et rien d'autre "). And the area with a gas poisonous attack is actually a malware; horses and men are seen as apocalypse and masks of their gas. I just liked to have closed the film.
