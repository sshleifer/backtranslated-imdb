This is the most amazing movie I have seen for a long time. Artists gave beautiful pictures of characters in the film. The story was shown correctly. The story begins with a young woman from the British Islands and her father travels to Nauvoo, Illinois. He has been a member of the LDS Church and does not. He thinks he is stupid to make a trip and despair. He encourages her to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. This is the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The movie shows the accuracy of his life and some of the history of the LDS Church at the same time. It was sometimes color, but it was needed. Emotional words were very reliable, which caused my feelings. The movie was awesome. The way the story was presented was touching. After the movie passed, we just sat and could not move. I was surprised. For people who know little of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I would encourage you to see this. If there is nothing else but to get the knowledge of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I would like to encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony of this great man. This must be seen.
