This is one of the most popular movies. If you are looking at T.V, then you may also not see the film. Almost all funny scenes are destroyed in the preview, except one that just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being a funny one. It's usually Jim Carrey shouting and it's really true. It's not just going to see this film hoping to surprise. All for all, if you would like Jim Carrey or comedies it is a must-see, otherwise just check the previews and you will only be satisfied.
