I saw recently on the cable station. The movie is good; it is one of the few songs I have seen which is inappropriate and light and dark. It shows some of the glory of the age as well as the player. Some of the drum series of drums are very much, I don't know where to look next. One day I will go and see this on the big screen, so we can see what happens. But what motivates this to another is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. It is not just for someone who is risky but there is something else, some demons inside. He gave me the impression that if you were lying to him, he was capable of anything. It was almost like the character of Sykes was on the severity of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I found Bill Sykes's Robert Newton from the 1948 movie, and I thought he was 'just an egg', but the performance of Oliver Reed caused me in my bedroom.
