In shame, before seeing this film, I did not know and Helena Bonham Carter. I had to do some research, to make sure that he had no problem, as was his behavior, and (well?), what he suffered. I was very scared of this beautiful woman. He smoked without weakness. Who could think that sexuality involving the final wishes, and requires, of a young woman, can be interpreted as tender, and romantic? Well, they may, when the right singers present in the right way, as they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how good Miss Carter was seen in this film. I have often said he was a very beautiful creature who ever hit the face of our world, but he seemed to have made himself in this special film. I hope any of you who watch this film will enjoy as much as I did. Thank you for leaving me my opinion.
