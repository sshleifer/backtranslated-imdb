The best film on marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will come to a dangerous and attractive world and family. This decision can be better or worse in our lives and the lives of our children. The actual input or help of 'friends' - or an employee if we come out. Real family responsibility: they can help or they can destroy us. A mad priest who may not be very mad saying what can happen according to statistics and facts. Couples who think in a 'special' marriage, live a bitter story in their later history. <br /> <br /> Who likes wedding contract? No, after the priest told his own history? if they come out later in the other hands, if they don't know WHAT is marriage. That problems are real, that life requires real participation, preferably, from each other. That the real victims of divorce are children, by the real name ?? Andrea in the film - or names. That pregnancy is simply simple: sad, sad and happy will not be there after pregnancy. That the state and social security think every time under real family problems. Confusion of 'friends', lack of trust because of weakness and despair for Steffania because Tomasso lives her life as that alone. Maybe someone might think that this film is a terrible film, but it's not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the depths of their hearts, love a good marriage and family, if not, Why do they like marriage? True and good marriage depends on only a couple: each of their decisions, of each single step in their lives. Family can be where everyone feels loved to be his, just by being present. Screenplay is amazing. Exhibitions are beautiful: Steffania and Tomasso, Â¡are almost proud! Best orientation and script. Paint and camera management, superb.
