Very good series.I had never seen a real mix between games, action, doubts and Sci-fi never before. I am fascinated every chapter. Screenplay is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators create these amazing stories, each character has a wonderful history, problems, storm relationships, offers to show the human condition needed to create close characters. The most wonderful is the fact that all the characters are related between them: numbers, encountered before you know, and so on. Others, the powerful security system and the Darma plan are things that are not lost. JJ Abrams, what have you thought to create this amazing story?
