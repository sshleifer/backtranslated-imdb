I was not alive in the 60's, so I can prove that this film had a proper representation of the period, but it is certainly moving to the fulfillment of the experience. There are some excellent exhibitions, most especially for Josh Hamilton (Joint Honor), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brother divided by war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor character who has long overlooked by many, offers a heart-filled performance like their strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values ​​as one of his sons makes him proud to go to Vietnam but returns empty inside, sometimes is opposite completely. All in all, this is a powerful and touching film I hope everyone gets a chance to experience.
