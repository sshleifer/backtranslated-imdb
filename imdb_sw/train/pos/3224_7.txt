I watched this film with the hope I was given: the good things of the cowboy sci-fi. What is really amazing is that Kurt Russell did a very good job for a very important role. Think about trying to act under these two restrictions: you don't have any conversations, and because you play, a military robot, you are not allowed to show sensitivity using face-to-face expressions Howzat? Kinda like ask diva to make a great aria when gagged with tap-taped. In spite of the words and words that have been shipped, Russell removes a strange character. Her robot becomes human, despite the obstacles. Great job! As usual, Jason Isaacs makes sure that he will come down in history as a great animal-host man who would like to see and burn. Connie Nielsen was beautiful, soft, mother, and good. I do not know how much of my emotion depends on her acting and how much of her physical beauty, but it was difficult to take her eyes. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was very small and reduced. Much of the plot is quite normal, with a large amount of weakness, but as with the sci-fi sense of comic, I don't see what is wrong with the least weakness. At the end of the story, the good win over, and the audience enjoys the emotional satisfaction. Yes! The kind of feeb who thinks Russell did not have a good job to do is the same kind of feeb who missed all the facts.
