This movie is very good. if you have the opportunity to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the movie is not worth anything to do with its origin since 1932, Pacino is doing a good job like Tony Montana around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way on it where he can say anything and make the sound very good. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good and swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another sky how the actors can tell. (its very sweet) even though the film has many stages and the plot goes very fast on time, not keeping the exact aspect of the real time at the time, it is still easy to follow, but you must have your eyes beaten all the time to lose anything. private, I found that watching this film makes the three hours seem like a wind, it's just really good. This video is one of the films that are being done and well-directed not only that you forgot that this film was made in the crappy's 80s but it makes you the root of the bad guy ... "So say good night to BAD person "
