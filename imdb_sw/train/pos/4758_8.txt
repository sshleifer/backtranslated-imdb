After an unknown phone call on a plane that had collapsed into a stored firewood, two police officers found evidence that this incident occurred and that one Martian had gone away. They drive around the Hi-Way Coffee nearby and then let them stand with seven passengers waiting for the opening of the snow in the bridge. However the driver explains that he had only six passengers when he was on the bus. During the interrogation travelers, the wonderful things happening in the supper, and the lights are getting exhausted and turn off fast. When passengers are given and then follows his journey, one passenger returns to the diner and defines the plot of the invasion of the Earth. <br /> <br /> "Is the real Martian Please Stand?" is one of the best periods of this great series. Interesting stories has wonderful and wonderful conversations, wonderful characters and situations with quite amazing and unpredictable action end. My vote is eight. Headline (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("Martian")
