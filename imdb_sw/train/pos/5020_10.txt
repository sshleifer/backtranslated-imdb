This is the film that should be when trying to catch the essence of what is very surreal. It has this odd sound that is not very popular in the film, it feels like a series of dreams and brings you into the haunting memory of darkness. The children were very honest and I expect other things to come later. A very natural job for those young people, I do not know if Bill removed it or there is only good, but no better. Bill scored as I'm concerned with the comments of KevNJeff about Mr. Paxtons acting badly, what one can do in that role. He played that part well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke's version)? Wow ......... Listen to his opinion. A great flick to make you feel very uncomfortable, if you want it? Image search you get a high level too.
