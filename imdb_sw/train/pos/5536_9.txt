I really enjoyed this show. Even as a young man I was interested in all games and that includes horse racing. It was always difficult to make a series according to corruption racing and at the same time getting permission from the race tracks to record publishing about this complex issue. One part I especially remember around the horse is expected to win a great race which looks a little off color. Siringi was found on a solid floor and everyone thought it was medicine, but nothing was seen in blood tests. But they all realized that the horse did not have doped but had his cartilage of the knee removed. If you run a car without fuel and the engine takes over, the horse broke down with a bad result.
