When I saw this film, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should be in movies. I have seen many movies related to rape, but this comes out. This movie has a form of originality that is rarely available in the movie today, don't leave television movies. It says that I am sure it is very true for many victims of rape in small towns today, and I have found that it is reliable (which is difficult to find in other rape movies). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were wonderful in their play. I guarantee this film to anyone who enjoys movies with little truth to them. I really enjoyed it.
