Terry Gilliam's interesting height-length feature of Chris Marker's film LA JETEE is filled with a sense of intelligence, but it still touches your heart's gratitude for the very cast. Gilliam's film for phantasmagorical work with script by David and Janet Peoples playing with your head as was the poor James Cole (Willis in Steve McQueen his like - better than McQueen, even!), While being convicted from the future for whom he does not know if he comes or goes as a team of scientists continues to look at the bad eras when trying to prevent the sign of 1995 which is death to humanity but it will have no effect on animals. Willis, Brad Pitt who says Oscar, and Madeline Stowe as a psychiatrist specialist offers some of the best performances of their work. Even the symbol of the Paul Buckmaster cucumber is haunting. This does not miss!
