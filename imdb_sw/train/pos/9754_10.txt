Ann Raggedy and Andy Movie are so pleasing. We love watching Ann and Andy singing and playing, with the knee and wrinkled knees. This film is what made Camera and Knees chosen to be popular, singing his song, "I am nobodies I Love You". If you like Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you will see why it is a movie children love, and adults!
