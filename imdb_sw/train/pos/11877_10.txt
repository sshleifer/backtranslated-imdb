Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. Cuban refugees named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for American Fantasy. Montana then becomes "king" in the world of drugs as he uses his criminal rule in Miami, Florida. This movie of the gangster is very violent, and some scenes are bad to see. This movie has around 180+ F-words and is around three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never be bored. You are happy with the master of the drug, and in some cases you see that Montana is not as bad as other Crimes. This is a jewel and I recommend that you see this. Not eligible. 9/10
