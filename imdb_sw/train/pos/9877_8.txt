<br /> <br /> Submission Lily Mars is one of the kind of films that depression seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now you know my preference, here are some reasons I think this movie does not stand. Though the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, it becomes a star, and the success of the heart of its director (Van Heflin) is a beautiful Hollywood story of the period, writers differ its themes a little more unusual. Although Lily gets a great break when the star is over, it doesn't fit and it keeps growing her pride and returning to play a small role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (said enough) <br /> <br /> 3. The provision of support comprises very good displays. Byington's Spring as Lily's mother is very strange, as Fay Bainter (mother of director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). Supporting the performance of the stand though it goes to character actor Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, one-time actor who turned out of the theater. <br /> <br /> Value look for sure. One of the films that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
