I watched the last night on TV (HBO). I must admit, that tension in this movie did not have many documents of the FN era. I liked the way the chip would all be quiet one time and then Pinda the next minute. It was normal. Ahh yes. Ladies, villians, cigars and heroes cops! It has all. This movie has provided all the products to me. I really liked how they mixed communism in a conspiracy, very often during this film. They were also very scared since the majority vote was popular in those days. I rate this movie is one of the best I've seen in FN type!
