Was the most accurate of the script for the 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they are still working! I thought the participants did a wonderful job with another bland script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to hate this film. I personally can't see how that could be, but jealousy is just one of those films that you can love or hate. Much like Napoleon Dynamite and every movie Leslie Neilsen ever made. You think it's one of the worst movies made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this browser because of inspections. Look and see if you are one of those who love it! If you do, I am sure it's worth your money. If you don't like it ... well, now you know.
