I just saw this film, I saw the first time I was 7 years old and I could only remember the end. so I watched it as, the last 10 minutes, and (I might look like a child if I ha ha) I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was very sad for Anne-Marie because she said: 'I love you Charlie' and also: 'I'll miss you Charlie', just make me cry-ha. it has to be one of my favorite movies all the time, it's just a suitable film to watch. WATCH IT ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but, I love this film, it's its real classic. xx Maverick xx 10/10
