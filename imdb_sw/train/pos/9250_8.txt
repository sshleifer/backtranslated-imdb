Clark Gable plays with a man who uses the dame of boiling Jean Harlow. She tries to breastfeed her as she claps her tough attitude. Despite their worries and concerns they fall in love. Gable during an accident when a person is in pain, runs from Harlow to a faithful woman's prison where she knows she is pregnant. Anita Loos' writing and Howard Emmett Rogers are excellent for many interesting and fascinating characters (including a Muslim female woman and an old black woman and her father's father played very easily. Gable and Harlow show their matches as actors add tell the creatures and quirks to their characters who send them over to the roles of Gable and Harlow, and the trend is better than you would expect from Sam Wood. This is one of the best of "love criminals" and "women's prison" and has a good boiling conversation written.
