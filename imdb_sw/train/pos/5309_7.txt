The best thing about this film is that it's fun. It is filled with amazing characters and fascinating, starting with a blade, the innocent Pecker (played by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day of life. Other famous characters include a friend of Pecker Matt ("he is a dwarf, but a good boy"), a sister of Pecker Chrissy (who sleeps sugar), and a Catholic grandmother Pecker who finds life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room . <br /> <br /> The movies make gentleness on how daily life has a lot of wealth to offer, and it is successful to do this without having a heavy burden on it. There is always a risk, when delivering messages on the value and honor of "ordinary people", to lose within the "perfect than you" type - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing listeners to get the point when allowing the room to breathe for the audience to compare this message with their ideas on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend a movie because it's very fun.
