Document without losing for words ... ever ... Let's take that this information is more than a spoof, let's think it's a comment on the Japanese community. And if this film is fond of an unusual memory as it comes, a regular wordplay, quickly goes, and if it is interpreted as it is - in its current revolutionary version as it appeared tonight in Cinematek's Copenhagen - It is still it's quite fun. But for the patient, and the only true and clear patience, I talk to you fans of Jim Jarmusch as well as to restore ADD, I believe this is a film for you. It is an intelligent video if you allow to win. Very good, and totally kitsch, and Japanese culture completely. And quite experiment. 2D view in 3D world. Anything, Enjoy those who want to see a Japanese film that causes Japanese culture culture. Thumbs up if you're in a completely different situation.
