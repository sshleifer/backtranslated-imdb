I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a big pair. This movie is real and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can't keep a good dog down" with that song on sharing, I think it's called "What is yours is yours". This was the last movie with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie but I find the voice of Itchy is very happy to hear. Although some events I have seen scary, I still have a hard time looking at the area and Charlie's dream, and Carface announces my entry. Other characters like King Gator I've got very funny. The end was interesting and sad, you make me cry a little. I am giving this film 7/10.
