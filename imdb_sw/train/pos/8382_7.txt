If you like sand sports games are very good. Some of them are cheap but the robot war is worth seeing. I have enjoyed a long battlefield for some time and this is just a great movie I saw that comes close to that feeling of what it would be like to run one of these big mech. If you like genera then your favorite games are Meki Warrior Three and four and if you have Xbox and $ 350 to save Battery of Steel. Movie fits to see at least once. There is a need to have more movies on the same theme out there. Remake less and more original work. Enjoy
