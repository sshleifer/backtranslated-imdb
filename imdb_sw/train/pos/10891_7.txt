You can live Christmas live. I thought the television program was a little less. I love Ben Afleck. She plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a family, who is willing to pay full visitors. Valcos with James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew is lonely around the holiday because they do not have her own family so she rent a family in Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who well remembers playing Maude's husband Arthur is employed to play Duda, grandfather. When the whole situation comes down, the fact can be painful. The dwelling of Valcos loses away from Drew's situation. The beautiful girl of Drew and her parents visit amazing. You can't buy what you want! Acting and text is mediocre but the first level is drawn to the final location.
