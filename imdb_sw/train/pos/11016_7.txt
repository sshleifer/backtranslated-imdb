Good work to show, but nothing new. This occurred over in the mountains, which showed a favorable atmosphere and such. One person takes a group of foot soldiers, the leading rivers, and blows the butt. It can be called "Rambo Goes for Rockies", it was pat. It had one very effective area in the first film which had me cringing in panic. It's not a bad picture, but it's just the same, okay.
