This is Columbo which is directed by Steven Spielberg in the first step in his career. It is not a pity but a small taste of good things to come to Spielberg can be seen in this film. The movie is essentially in the same style as most of the 70 movies of Spierlberg and TV work. So it means that other characters tend to show some of the quirkiness and none of I just talk about the Columbo character alone. The kind of strange behavior that perhaps could be seen in the "Spoelberg" film of 1975 of "Spielberg". But most of the little tips of the original Spielberg elements, you can't call this film work-and a good star star star. Not that it is bad, of course not as I said earlier, it is not too sad. <br /> <br /> This movie started very well and promised very much but after it was well opened, which as always the killings occurred, the movie became a slower type and also bad to watch. Few because more is the Columbo movie and a book that does not have real time, it's not good because it is a movie that is looking for a look. The killings were well-skilled and the concept of having a crime story of a journalist murdering his girlfriend writing was very likely and interesting. The story however did not look at all its possibilities. At least that is the feeling that this film has left me. <br /> <br /> The movie was still good looking but even thanks to Jack Cassidy's character, who thinks he is wise then Columbo, due to his secret / crime experience writing and tries to give him all kinds of light as possible, leading away from himself. But actually Columbo knows well and he is his first suspect from the first time but he as usual plays the game together. <br /> <br /> Movie has a good overall style and uses the best position of camera and editing. To see that too many of these were similar to the future work of Spielberg, especially some of the camera angles. Columbo's best and best movie but don't let Spielberg's name be connected to increase your expectations so much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
