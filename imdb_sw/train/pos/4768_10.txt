I LOVE IT and WAS SO Shattered that there's not to do another season! I would like it! it was the best show ever !!!!!! there's probably not any chance they decide to cancel the show there! ha ha I want to have it anyway! I would be very excited !! I really would! I lose it! and it had been destroyed so I didn't know what was happening to Jason! I think they should do another ... I also think his silly that you have to write ten lines for post comments. I really want to know what happened between jason and nicole ... maybe they can make a spin off!
