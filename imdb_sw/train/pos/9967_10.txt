There are some things that I will never understand; why underwear comes in a third pack when it is clear that it is not enough is an example. Similarly, I will never know this film, and that's a brilliant. If you are approaching this film you expect a real movie, you can also approach Satan expecting to embrace; although that may be possible if you greet these figures of Satan. Take Part for example; ineffective politics, camp, model of the devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create Satan's garments from the red and red colors of the condom. However, it makes the hilarious moments of any film ever. Hardly, this is not down. That can be used for each other character, a little girl girl who does so with an innocent disease she probably overcompensating for some serious crime she is part of. Then again, if Santa's re-inter-space center is real, no chance he could have resisted for a long time. Put it easily, if you haven't seen this film, you can't imagine yourself being a bad buff. A delightful character, acting, concept, and radar-close radar of the radar makes it necessary to see above any film so far (if you are after a clean laughter that is).
