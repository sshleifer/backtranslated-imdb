This is one of the best audio movies I have seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This movie is realistic and romantic at the same time. In my opinion we need more movies or movies like this to keep the culture of southern Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao did very well in this, also their couple attracts many people to the movies. This must be a film, a family and a romantic. This movie is also from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is best for them right now ... The movie's environment was good that is also a great attraction. This movie must see ... it was recommended for everyone !!
