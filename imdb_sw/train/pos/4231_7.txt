When returning from a Christmas shopping trip, a woman in a rural home who is suffering (Basinger) finds herself fighting for survival after a disagreement with a group of emerging young people taking violent violence. It is not possible to get out of the way to the United Kingdom, the start of Susan Montford's instructions might not be available. This is a disgrace, as the rate of writing, leading and making is really good, and certainly comes from your average quality directly to the Flick of the DVD. Kim Basinger gives its best performance at some time as a wife of a sterile wife (Craig Sheffer). When Sheffer is not available for anything more than being a threat, it is in their shortest moments that Basinger unites - showing weaknesses of pain but still stimulates the anger that will ultimately reinforce its competition with the youth. It is a very good performance, it has emerged, its change from the victims and the defendant plays a lot. Lukas Haas I was thinking I was thought, as he (with three other young people) was not very much threatened. However, all four young people were more than physically set, later scenes that Basinger returns to the table against them did not want to work entirely. The fact that these are four ordinary people, although they are not slightly less important, is why the film works as it is. In addition to a few speed issues during the last half of the movie and among the cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that holds the viewer with something to contemplate when the film is over. Some may extinguish with the slow burns of opening events, or a sudden end. Others at other times brutal abuse. I say give them the opportunity, it is certainly more suitable for your time than Saw V.
