The Great Nurse (1975) was a Italian actor who made the star once Bond Girl Ursula Andress. Someone was he hot in this film. He was installed and built as a house * of # @ brick. Ursula was smoking in this movie. I have never seen a traditional fabric filling. Mrs. Andress star as a nurse who is employed to care for the rich man. Even one in the house seems to hit the boots. One night, the nurse decides to take the grandson's heat and give T.L.C. for its former client. An older man takes it to his nurse and this is for the whole family. What kind of work did the family employ to be outside? Will geezer fall by his car driver? What? How can he cope with the octogenarian crone and other family members? To find out you need a copy of NURSE NENSE! Italian but very badly in English. It is highly recommended.
