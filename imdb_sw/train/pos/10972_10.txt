I saw only recently but I had discovered for several years and always been impressed by his head. Now it's my property as one of my favorite films. It is hard to describe the amazing thing of Maysles discovered but everything works in amazement. It has many images and memories when you feel you are getting into a very private world. I loved this film and the characters in it. It is as if the film artists have spell the audience and pull us into the wonderful world of eccentric Beales, a real historical family. It has a visual appearance and I found myself going away from all of that, cooking my grain on the cob on my bed table. It has a depressed air that dwells inside. Falling out of the greatness of this respected family. Money has gone but their air and kindness remained, with their beauty. It took you from the first and long frame after the finished film I found myself wondering about their destiny. He wonders that if I walked on the east coast of Hampton I might hear the Old Edie night and see the silhouette of Little Edie playing in the window behind the thin hanging creeper. Not possible.
