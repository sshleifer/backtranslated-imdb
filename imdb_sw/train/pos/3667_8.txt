Hollywood North is looking at satirical time in the history of the Canadian film when the Canadian government issued a major tax break for films made in Canada. It was often treated as a rented house or a cheap way to get American films made. For example, Porky has left. Anyways Matthew Modine has a novice manufacturer who wants to make a Canadian revision. However, in order to earn money he needs a US name. He gets a free cannon and learns that he should take into consideration until the film is no longer the same as the original book. Live well in Canada but can't be understood outside White White. Americans will think we are attacking ourselves but we did not know that we are dealing with them. For Christians 8/10 for the whole world 5/10.
