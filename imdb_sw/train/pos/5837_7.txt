With Oliver Hardy who was hit by the horns of the horn, bell, phone and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and stability with goat's milk. Associate Stan Laurel comes with a great solution, living on a planned boat so the sea of ​​salt sea can help Ollie get all the rest she needs. It is a great motivation for all the hijink of the shadow to consider, as a boat is installed by a hungry goat, and a whipping run (Richard Cramer) as well as a journey. I got a kick from all the ingredients in the film, starting with the sign in the measuring factory - 'Silence While Men Working'. Early stories in the boys' bedroom have a number of mixed pipes and materials mixed, and Stan makes bananas into little banana. Laurel has a few lines in the picture, as "We must have been forbidden", but what I had was was the answer to the ship's criminals - "The conservation is the final law of the average" - right! I'm not a good student of Laurel and Hardy as many on this board, all I know is like a child and seeing them as a fun today as they were back in my youth. In that calculation, "Saps At Sea" provides a beautiful clock of the hornophobic fun, well through the hornomania.
