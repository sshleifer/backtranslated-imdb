'Sexual intercourse' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I was afraid that any film on the subject would be moving directly into sexual transparency events to shock and disturb the audience. After seeing 'Business' and 'Holly' one, one film has encouraged me to want to change international laws. Others felt like an attempt to fail to call me five minutes with emotional music and suicide. I do not believe that turning this issue into the tears of Hollywood's jerker is an important or important strategy to adopt and it should be a nickname 'Holly' in collaborative power but with power and poor condition of these children are forced to endure . 'Business' died between heroes and ignorant and events related to the death of the next cat's photograph that represented children are forced to commit other horrible acts. I have seen this distrust and sometimes irritating for that reason. If I wanted to laugh at cheap I did not prepare the film on children's business. For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that really means something I would recommend saving money on a movie ticket to be given to 'Holly'.
