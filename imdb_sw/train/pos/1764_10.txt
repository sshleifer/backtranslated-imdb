Steve Carell finds himself in his first star position in the 40th Annual Virgin, with only responsibilities in films such as Bewitched, Bruce General, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, we just got a little taste of comedy which Carell really makes its own. You can explain that Will Ferrell will cause a "pleasant air" but Carell takes on another level, everything he does is innocent, pleasing, and hilarious. I'm not hesitant to say that Steve Carell is one of the closest scholars of our time. The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours of laughing (or 4 hours if you see it twice as I did), fully healed and great leadership attracts the audience through the entire movie. The script was full of too many lines that you want to see the film again to try to remember all. Music is suitable for a great film, and you can tell the director what he did. Filled with sex jokes, dirt, and multilingual, this film is not for everyone but if you liked the Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie available in those lines, you will love the Virgin of 40 .
