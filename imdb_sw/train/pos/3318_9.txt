The most beautiful and beautiful movie presented by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a fan of baseball and addict movie light, it's hit homerun to me. Laundry and a lot of real baseball events and real ball and real references to the failure of Bosox changed. And it is very interesting to see a film with a head-to-head video on a hill, on a hill, to serve Kevin Costner trying to make the audience from listeners. Jimmy and Drew did a good job as a young couple who were beaten by Jimmy's "jones" of Jimmy. It was a little whacky and out of the left field, but there are really Sox fans that are fanatic and live their lives through the luck of their beloved team. The film hit the speed and the end, even though it was possible, it had a lot of charms and sensitivity to the most popular movies, without worrying too much. <br /> <br /> Also enjoyable was the return of Willie Garson on the screen. I miss the most famous "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & City. He is always happy, even doing or says very little. <br /> <br /> Buy yourself two seats, popcorn, and be ready for fun time. "Fever blow" is the winner.
