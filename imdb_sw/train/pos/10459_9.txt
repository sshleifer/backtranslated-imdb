I did not expect to have a great impact on this film that shows the family as you expect to live near the house. They are ordinary people of the body and blood, not as usual Hollywood Hollywood. They are experiencing a very common problem - a debilitating disease. But the story line connects the heart to the subject of power. Providing, script, leadership, and acting flows with a spectacular insufficient viewer into the story. Make this alert and its message will encourage.
