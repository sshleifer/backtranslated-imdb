What can anyone say about a film that has one of the most, most Muslim, and more often than weirdly - I never say 'mercy'. and Fairbanks were in their heyday? This is an epic on stubborn people, sometimes ignorant, courageous and honest who fight for respect and freedom against injustice. I liked it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were serious criminals. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender, and physically.
