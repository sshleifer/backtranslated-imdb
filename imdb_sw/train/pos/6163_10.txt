This is one of the few films that I think the translation of the film to improve on the original book. The story is clear, found, pleasing and interesting with music numbers are of course unique. I loved the example of the 'former house of protection' and 'Portobello' of the spectacular, a great mix of the original animation of the original artists, though these days do not stop the charm of the piece. The history of World War II did well and was not left as the film began, which often occurs in 'evacuee' stories. Most of the videos that are not widely available, provide the ultimate pleasure for people of all ages. Exhibitions from administrators are very effective and all the texts are well tied and well designed. Assured to put a smile on your face!
