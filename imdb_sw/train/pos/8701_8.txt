For everyone who expects a traditional film of superhero can be a fun surprise. It is more obvious than a concert rather than a movie of action. It focuses on the feeling and is the same as the Greek catastrophe - whatever the main character continues in some way. That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law in his hands and society doesn't appreciate it. Sasha is wrong. When he runs, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so that things are not too hard for him. As you can see, the plot itself is very strange but the movie was not strong. It reminds me of a bit of animation in recent movies with Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an area of ​​action it gets so strong before realizing what's going on, it's around. But the director does not want to please us with a pleasant action. What is more important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are very big. Marks are very small, which also makes it very difficult to focus on the film. So basically you need to be very patient to look at it. <br /> <br /> What! The movie has its value? That's a very difficult question to answer. I don't think this experience has given me so much, but somehow I continue to think about this film and feel like looking at again. Particularly due to the atmosphere, which is very true, but it is not good because all the time Sasha and Katya are optimistic. After all it is young, who have all their life to live. So it doesn't matter how hard there is always a little tune of fun when they are together.
