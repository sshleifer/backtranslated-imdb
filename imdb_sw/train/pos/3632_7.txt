As predictable as a Hallmark card, but without merit, Rookie makes a strong transfer. Dennis Quaid, the most intelligent actor who works today, is perfect as a science teacher turned out to be a Jimmy Morris player. The movie has never been sleeping for children, if it is expected from a screened film. As a sports film, Rookie is one of the best I've ever seen since Sunday was all released.
