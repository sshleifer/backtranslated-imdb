I doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw the Secret of Secrets (2001). Now I know about four times (I doubt that I have learned a lot from Without My Daughter (1991). <br /> <br /> Objective is a good budget for Iranian comedy on girls group (working for each other) The women are not allowed to attend soccer matches, so the national armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who are trying to get out of their own. The boys, but they catch. The movie is more put in this pen holding where the girls are detained by soldiers, waiting for some unknown penalty (though, a girl who is dressed as a soldier says that she was a single insignia to be killed!) The movie examines the deviation of the situation The idea that women of football matches happens to be very pleased to experience the best sex? aka 100 years ago. This Farce comes to the head when the girl needs to go to the bathroom, so the escort soldier begs her to give her eyes so she can't see graffiti. The conflict is not entirely about gender warfare: at one time some of the conflict occurs between the solider in rural areas and the girls in urban areas. Fortunately, this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost to this neighbor and the cousin of the great Satanic Satan. You should have his feelings, but no one should avoid this film because they think they won't get it.
