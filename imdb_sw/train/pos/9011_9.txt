I've got this movie for an accident, but I'm glad that I did. Kenneth Branagh's work came almost to steal this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their powerful chemistry has been made for a more enjoyable movie. This movie brought the attention of the best movies that Branagh made by Emma Thompson. Carter's star has turned here as a youth with disabilities wishing to complete himself was a good performance as I saw from a woman for a long time. To show a person with disabilities is difficult to get rid of, but his eyes are actually expressing his pain in his life, he did so faithfully. If this movie had come out after the current film with beautiful women "hate" themselves for the roles (Shakira Theron, Halle Berry), I became sure Carter could focus on Oscar. If you are walking on this film on a nightly night as I did, I believe, it's worth the lost sleep.
