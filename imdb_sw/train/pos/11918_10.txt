"Angels in Outfield" was the first film of 1951 from the Ted Turner library; Disney saved in 1994, this time, using Angels California (now Angels Angels) as a team (Disney used this with Team Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey; also, good use of words, huh ?????). This movie was close to the children who were looking for a family. Someone promised the family boys, just as the Angel won a pennant. So, he called God one night about this. The boy who prayed would see the help that comes along the way (and the Son alone); for example, when the first angel had dropped, the player hit the ball so hard not just blowing, so the ball was held !!!!! For the season of all the Stars after 1994, the Angels were on the AL West (which my home group Rangers is one and still are). However, they lost the game because the boy was in court instead of White Sox / Angels (there was no Central Department in Baseball behind, so Chicago was West), and no angels were present. Thus, the new law was created: no angel can help in championship games. But wait! In the final game of the championship, the angel won !!!!! It was a real miracle! <br /> <br /> I liked about this film: This is a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the last few years to ask for school help and things; look now! My work was good !!!!! Therefore, this suggests that if you believe, God can send His angels to help you with any problems you may have in life. And second, this is a baseball movie of the family, which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie, too; I have seen recently on New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). "Angels in Outfield" will change your life forever once you have seen it! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
