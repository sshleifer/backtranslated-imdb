I was fascinated by stories and because I am going the same way with my parents, I was really united. It is easy to forget that a person whose body once failed was strong and enthusiastic. And then there are mistakes they have made and they should live with them. I liked the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? He is wonderful! Search real. There is much more likely that I have seen in the film, but nothing was shown - it was made very good. In general look and feel for the film was wonderful, real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, it drives a person down. I loved how the filmmaker approached the woman's life, never had any feelings, never too much - enough to connect us, but not enough to knock down.
