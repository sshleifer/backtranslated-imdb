Dr McCoy and Mr. Spock have been detained in the old ice planet, when Capt Kirk is in the same period of colonial planet. However, it is an old pair that has a more trying time. In addition to freezing temperatures and temples found only in caves, there is a third host, a beautiful and beautiful Zaretta (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time at this time, he starts slowly turning to the behavior of his father, hearing a natural attraction for Zarabeth and throwing "attention to the wind" about leaving this place. Just with the "reminder" regularly Dr. McCoy Do Spock holds to understand the truth. This stands as a few times where the character finds a "feeling" and Nimoy (Spock) plays with a trick, coming closer and hit the bejes outside Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly for the initial phase, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to find a girl, another with this. The "old man" Ian Wolfe is trying to replace "Mr. Atoz," the artist is responsible for sending trio in the past.
