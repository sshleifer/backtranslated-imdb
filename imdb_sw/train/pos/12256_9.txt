Kate Beckinsale is as good as Emma ignorant and still can't fail in this state of Jane Austen television. When I read that the novel I had any doubt at the time as the protagonist deserved to be considered a heroine of the story: he honestly, he is so fair and he builds that man is tempted to love him very much. Kate Beckinsale's translation, however, saves Emma from her own to say: she has been shown to the guilt and hospitality of all of her character to a perfect perspective, and one cannot help but come in and if (not speak of her love) despite her improper qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not alone, why this television series is very interesting; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, describing the personal magnetic character of this character (which seems more because of this role being not very well addressed by Ewan McGregor in dealing with the 1996 screen of Emma), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton, and Olivia Williams should all be in their responsibilities. This production is briefly, a good success and one of the most often seen and increased pleasure.
