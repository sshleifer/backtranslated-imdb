Solino really moved me and her very interesting characters. When the simple story of an opponent between two brothers, it was not just about hate or jealousy. I was very interested in this film how I could identify and feel Gigi going exactly when she was going to take her mother to her home home in Italy and failed to attend the film awards ceremony of her film. Seeing this attitude he had worked hard in his artistic dream and his feelings of responsibility for his mother were sad. Even when he tried to communicate with his father he was very brave. And like in real life, many fathers can never pass their walls to reach their children. I was even able to identify with the brother of Giancarlo, who was more sure of an older brother, was very sure. Very good film that made me laugh and cry.
