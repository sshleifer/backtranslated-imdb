This is a good movie that I don't think it gets enough loan like Fever Night Night or Grease at the work of John Travolta. He plays a person who loves a girl but also a pig that is led to accept her feelings. Rather, he wants to join the cows walking because he thinks it will show his care. Although it was released in 1980, it is still today. The sound of the country's music is strong. 10/10
