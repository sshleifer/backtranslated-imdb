This animated feature (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is certainly one of the most oddest subject of the film: creation in the 9th century famous light bill, the book of Kells. In this wonderful retelling of the story, the prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in the monastery was ruled by his uncle, the abate Abate who are concerned to prepare the defense of the Abbey from the impending attacks and the fearful Vikings, must enter into the forbidden forest forest to find the materials that master The illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. In order to do this, in the forest unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously with a luxurious lifestyle offered for writing (there are some computer animations in several key passages) through which he wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with the use of very creative colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but it is wonderful wonder, not by far setting the type but eye opening type. If a person had a nitpick - more than a certain anronisms, as an African player in the 9th century Ireland? one will say that a mix of Catholic and pagan Celtic loyalty in this movie has not been fully involved. And the comic aid is sometimes very broad. That's why I can't give them a higher chance. But these are small problems with the most interesting and interesting film.
