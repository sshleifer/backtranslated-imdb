First things first! This is not a movie of action although there are many steps in it! I think you can compare with American movies! Where the worst players' team is successful in an unsuspecting game, win the game or the most contested competition! In this case it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first these road gangsters seem to be good for something! But we will soon discover that they do not want to be a pig and actually achieve something in life! It is good to see them fight training! I wondered how this funny film was! From beginning to end you will laugh at your pants off! The Korean actors are very persuasive! Go see this beautiful video to feel good!
