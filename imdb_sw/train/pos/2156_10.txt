This movie is among my foreign films that like, some of them are Amilee and My Life Like Dogs. Compared to such movies as many foreign films, it takes a piece of life to make it a basic heart lesson. Japan, a man who has drifted his normal life and living life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out of the dance studio window. In an instant that takes his train to pass, he is enthralled with it. But is it only for its beauty, in its distant view, or the relationship that all will discover that they are sharing? <br /> <br /> What! We beat Dance with wonderful characters who cannot be remembered who have to deal with the reality of breathing by changing them through the world of drums. To break down traditional hammers and stereo styles of the Japanese community, they all destroy themselves with pleasure and find that happiness not too far away. It is one of those movies that are magical and meaningful and, by itself, pass by commonly to show true magic and miracles that life can be.
