As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you with a very high expectations. I walked with joy and all my expectations met. It was interesting, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The movie begins with two cabbage hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to reach one place but compete with the way to go. That was amazing, and then the film goes to the best skits I've ever seen. There were four surprises from all good. The four will begin to talk. One Shia LaBeouf organization like bellhop at a hotel who finds love for an old woman. The second thing comprises Orlando Bloom as a music manufacturer who is doing business with Christina Ricci. Another has Anton Yelchin and Olivia Three as two people walking, a third character being disabled. The best includes Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a couple of former collisions. I will bring attention to that Nataile Portman is making an impressive first-to-lead text, and writing a skit about the guardian, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q is the best as a sex person with a farmer. New York, I Love You are obviously beautiful, if not better than the Paris Je'Taime 2006. The attractions stand well, and the film shows how indie films should be. The film, however, does not have many prominent directors like Paris Je'Taime, that's why it was wonderful to live according to its quality. If you want to laugh, look at the bigger effects, look at the amazing amount of good performances, and just be happy to have fun and certainly go to see New York, I Love You.
