A great idea, very cast, and mercy did not have more time to make a story. I loved him and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now there are REAL women! Still, Dench and his only character had enough substances to carry the script on some of his limited time. I have that in the tape and will continue to look at it, and hope that there is a tip at the end that shows that there will be good. <br /> <br /> Top version! - No Question! - No move! <br /> <br />
