I can't believe we don't show again 70. I have all 8 season show of 70! I totally love it! I sleep in bed every night and watch several periods before going to bed. At the end of the long working day it is good to blow back and have a good laugh before bed. I was very sad they took the show of the air ... at least we still run again! I hope and pray they will come back with at least the reconciliation ... If maybe Donna finishes college and finally we see him and Eric get married! What? That will not be wonderful! It would be even better if they continue for several years!
