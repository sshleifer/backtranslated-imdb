Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) comes from a rehabilitation school and comes back to charcoal. Her sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing a good job to keep her out of trouble, but it just seems to follow her. In addition to its partners and the Termite group, Gabe is followed by real-life groups who plan to set fire to random buildings to cover insurance. They need someone to be blamed for destruction, and Gabe is. It's on Termites working in their rules and giving their gangsters dessert just. <br /> <br /> The area that introduces Dead End Kids is absolutely true. The boys walk on the furniture of the new lady on the street, and continue to do so. They say to each other by telephone calls and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in the seat. The boys started to start fighting the new boy, but after they proved to be a good fighter, they asked him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The activation section is also very good, it is full of evil that appears to be dangerous at first, but in fact it is clever and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop learned to be a young mayor, he has a dream about school work. This is strange, with a small hologram of children walking on his face and asking him questions. The Angel Purses His Eyes is a big head because it succeeds in the success of angels with dirty faces, and tells the truth the children are doing. They were known for the odds and far from setting, these boys do well in this film. But instead of being concerned, it makes some laugh. This is a preview of how many boys will be in the Bowery Boys series. We even get a few words taken from Leo Gorcey.
