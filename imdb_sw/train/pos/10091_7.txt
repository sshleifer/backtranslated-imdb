I looked at the "Walking Elephant" for the first time for 30 years and was hit by how the story line is similar to "great" Rebecca. If others have said, you have a good sweet thing that has died on its feet and another delightful and delightful master, just to get his marriage threatened with an inevitable memory of a larger family than a lifetime but still strong. You have a strong and uncomfortable servant, a dispute that will keep the couple together or redeem them equally away, ended with the fire of a luxury house. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Walking to Elephant" is also allegedly the atmosphere of the bright jungle for "Letter," Bette Davis love triangles to put on the Singapore gardens garden instead of Sri Lanka tea farm. Maltin offers the "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are not more good, but I enjoyed despite its predictions. Elizabeth Taylor did not look at love, and Peter Finch does a reliable job as a good man who can overcome the influence of his cruel father. Dana Andrews - a loved one in "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Life" - loses as an angry admirer of Elizabeth. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior features in the film history.
