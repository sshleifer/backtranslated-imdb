I had a few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of complaints to say it's more advanced and inserted. True, it is more than three hours long, but I was surprised that it was going very fast. I don't think it's locked more, I think the IMDb level is very good. The film looks amazing, with beautiful clothes and good effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely comes from the target. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best displays as Jack, and Kate Winslet is as good as Rose. David Warner, a good actor, stole every area he has. The story is very rich, and it is hot on the development of character, apparent and the story of love that moves very much when needed, although in the first bit of the movie is slower. The last hour is very riveting, and I confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic fell. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music mark by James Horner was good, although I've never been a big fan of My Heart's song will continue. 1996 services were good, but they were unfamiliar and some historical accuracy. In general, I offer the Titanic of 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
