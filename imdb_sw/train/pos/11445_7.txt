A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Cities allows fans to see its work in motion. Looking at Goldsworthy to create its pieces, one continues to be grateful for each stone, leaf, and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy explains how the flow of life, rivers, and waves stimulate and affects its work. Although, I was excited about the film that revealed many pieces of Goldsworthy (no snowballs), I feel it's long. The creators of the film did a good job of bringing Goldsworthy work to life, and creating a beautiful film that was fun to enjoy.
