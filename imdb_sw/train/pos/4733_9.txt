Once again Jet Li brings its charismatic presence to the film screens in the Black Mask film. In this film Li plays Tsui, an escape from the plan of a super soldier who wants to restore humanity that the deal has been taken with him. In doing so, Tsui decides to have a library for living a normal and peaceful life, but eventually he claims that he will clean up his problems before he could continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program escaped at the same time as Tsui, but they want to get even the world instead of getting inner peace. So Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent its former team partner from providing information that can lose many innocent people their lives. This film screens to the screen at the speed of worry and does not enable its audience to go. Military art is amazing, but because it uses wires are not available as eligible for US viewers. If you like practical movies that have an interesting story and requires a good performance to work because they are dealing with psychological and physical conflicts, then the Black Mask is for you. I am pleased to see that some of the Jet Li movies will finally get a sharp stream in the United States and expect to see how changes that the release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of the best films of Li, coming out and seeing May 14 when it will be opened in America.
