I saw this movie once as a child in late-late show and fell in love with. It took 30+ years, but I recently got it on the DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a list that is known in the warfare movies. We watched it last night for the first time. That sound was good, however it was grainy and it had trailers between reels. However, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed by how true the game was. <br /> <br /> The list is here somewhere. If you are true to get it, I would be too hot and I would see if I could find you. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
