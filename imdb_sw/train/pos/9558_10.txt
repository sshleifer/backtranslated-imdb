So I feel very big in the anime area, and very few shows I'm not looking. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend to anyone. It is possible to have the original series so far, it's just about everything that I can ask for. The story of the side, by saying, on the unconditional love that will not be approved, the comedy is very clear, and very well put together sound acting cast (both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If it's not for a very strange feature, it will be just another anime. More / less, as I have seen, 'love or hate', very few people have seen this series will reach destruction for them. <br /> <br /> First on the basis, and everything you can pray during the day, bet the house in this series. I am ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
