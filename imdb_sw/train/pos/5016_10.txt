This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's a lack of Corin Nemec and its humorous link to the courage of Cheryl Pollak, but it certainly has something to do with the sound of the voice. Also, some characters have a limited line or movement or when they are interested in themselves. Finally, the story is one that always draws my heart, and the last area is interesting. All in all, I like this movie; is perfect for girls night, girls' concerns.
