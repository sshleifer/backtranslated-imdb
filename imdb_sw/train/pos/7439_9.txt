Ancient Mariner is a true piece of work, as the original poem was / is. The publisher / environment with the old mariner himself is well, open, and without pretending. Artistic work along with the poem reading is fully suited to the time and work itself, which makes the audience in the same period and still connected, still moving forward, using the best efficient moving techniques failed by MTV manufacturers before and before. The most obvious in the current work. (MTV brought television and video static movements that go through, often reduced in meaning, from theme to theme without moving forward and without a clear relationship with the theme or story). Sounds, exhibitions and power of Redgrave reading bring this poem to the touch of life and all its fears, quarrels and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the wind and monotone constant (in this case a good feeling under the theme of the story itself) of the author's writing of the sad story of the mariner and the spooky. This is necessary for any love of ancient poetry, sea, great story, close to the true ring, and the story that has remained a permanent effect on the world and our culture. Who does not understand the meaning of "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop of drink?" Experience the best. Thank you Mr. DaSilva for bringing this life for us, never forgetting.
