Fabulous, wonderful, probably Disney best music adventure. I loved this film for over 35 years because it is thoughtful, cunning and fun. Even in spite of the "silent bed" incidents, other events and conversations are magical and interesting. Could they appoint any better than Angela Lansbury playing Eglantine? I can't imagine anyone who is more suitable in the role. This classic reminder will be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he had a few movie movie roles, completely shines in this adventure. He was a comic specialist who often forgot these days. Connecting, prim and the right Englishman - no one can make a slapstick and pull like gracefully as he does. It would be dangerous to fix this film because Tomlinson has died for a few years and nobody can get into his shoes and make his right behavior. Playing clothes and weapons have a magical anura on other movies and witches just don't cry. I enjoy the places that Germans invade Eglantine's house and must protect it in any way they can. <br /> <br /> Great together, dancing under the beautiful sea, sea. Richard and Robert Sherman appeared themselves in the mobile numbers. Both are fantastic and worth note, Portobello Road being one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film that still continues today !!
