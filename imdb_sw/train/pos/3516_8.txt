Ella was the best, Franchot had no restriction on the top (But he played the same part in other films such as "Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost nonexistent but the film was "happy". > <br /> * The horizontal spoiler *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook got beaten in his films but I seem to remember many other models. I will avoid calling the killer but I think it is obvious because of the "exciting" demands of the plot. The most well-written text of the film (for example: everyone smokes a cigarette and the police were indeed the stock of the stock. And no corpses were shown, unlike the today's festi). The typical period of the period period. About 8 out of 10.
