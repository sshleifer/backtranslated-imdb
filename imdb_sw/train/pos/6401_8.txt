Men of Honor have many good things. A good practice of action, a lot of "feel good" scenes, a good score of music, but a part that really makes a movie is a good acting. Many by Robert Deniro. Men's Story of Honor Responds to Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be South Africa's first marine navy. It writes his worst struggle for being a poor farmer to get to school and even more. It's a good story, but it looks like it's been done many times before. Man, against all habits, refuses until they are able to accomplish their goals that they have set for some reason for years ago. It may happen, but a lot of struggles that Brashear faces in the film are of course including C.O. of the dive school hit by its final test. However, all of these have been created for the area when Robert Deniro finally gets into the movie. Deniro has a Sunday General Society who is a teacher at a diving school in Brashear. Once Deniro comes, he leaves this huge array of pride that you can't hate unless you have an amazing power. Before the movie is completed, Deniro gives a lot of speeches that would trigger the way it is cool but you are also chased by the way that they beat. Finally you should certainly doubt some of the aspects of the film, but to accept, if it's all true, you would be pushing your seat for the first twenty minutes.
