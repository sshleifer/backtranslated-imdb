This was the best part of the two parts, although I had never seen the old people, I never thought the doctor could go against anything that comes from a normal situation, of course the difference but not the most common. This part brings things that we are afraid of and how we humans, in the future, will fight with the real failure of life when many scope say it is impossible. Since this is a family film I am surprised that they brought certain things to fear and faith, especially if it also attracts US viewers. But who cares about what Yanks says, we hit the rock! The doctor who has shown the possibility from the same place from the new series in 2005, first to be so fearless, from the fun to the great, from light to dark. I hope many old fans one day recently say "The old doctor who has returned". 10/10/10 out of 10
