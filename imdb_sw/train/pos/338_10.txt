I saw this film at the Amsterdam Film Festival and I had the opportunity to meet with both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, both who live and live in New Yorkers. The movie name in Amsterdam put the River on your right side, making the sensitivity element of your little bit. Also important was the relationship of love and gay. Tobias Schneebaum had members of the groups he learned as a human being. His close association at the age of 80 and the departure to escape was a very moving move. I can only recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a migration story which is anything but a traveler.
