If there were two more interesting artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith together in the most interesting movie in 1968, I don't know who it is. I first saw this beautiful gem of satiric 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I think of any year that I failed to stay looking again. It is intelligent, wonderful, neat, wistful, sweet, gentle to attack, and quite surprising. The love of these two directions of the community is very good and much more likely - not more than Maggie Smith's extraordinary attempt to bring the right card into the deck, a place that is a good taste and a beautiful picture of the loneliness of heart. And the end of freezing on the face of anxiety, anxiety, of love as he asks, "Are you right?" - Has anyone ever seen the sound of worship so perfectly and honestly? I don't want to know anyone who didn't like this movie.
