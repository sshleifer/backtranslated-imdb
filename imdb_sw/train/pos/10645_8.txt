Adolf Hitler's mission to seduce his will around the world is the second in a series of seven parts of the film produced by the United Nations War Department as a training tool for new soldiers entering the Army during World War II. Hitler's plan was pregnant and a good pregnancy, starting with the Eastern European conquest, spreading to Europe, then to the 'World Island' which included Europe, Asia and Africa. His last step will reach the seaside for the ultimate victory of America and the World. In 1935, Hitler ordered national registration, if the whole country fell under its destruction. School pupils sang his praises, and German boys were trained and trained in military camps. Uninstalling Austria in 1938, Hitler was followed by connecting the land to the border with Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later that year, the world was shocked to learn that Germany had signed a non-brutal agreement with the death of Russia's death, a method of delaying Hitler's military action on many borders. Immediately, Germany invaded Poland, bringing the victory of Hitler right to the Russian door. He could deal with him later. It was this time when Britain still did not oppose Hitler in Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a contract with Germany, his false statement saying 'Peace in Our Time'. It didn't turn that way. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information to learn in this phase, at least for me, was released by a small snippet of photographs from the German Hitler center in '30'. Guided by the United States of Germany take cue directly from the country. Hall - Madison Square Garden!
