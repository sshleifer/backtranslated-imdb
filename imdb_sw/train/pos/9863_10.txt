I thought that the Ice Age was the best movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without children, I still seem to enjoy these animations, animation. Sid is the best character I saw at one time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was very excited, and I didn't think that his behavior could be matched or even beaten) and even more interesting than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I am sure) and I will remove the movie from work (often ... yes, still). My favorite part is where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I would like this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to understand what the senator is trying to tell about the "tigers" ... "The packet of the wolf, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pocket packet, derm packet, false pack, trouble pack , panda pack, airplane pack, pack of fish flying ... "or even that part goes! That's part of the funniest about the entire movie, although I also enjoyed the humor behind "setting forests on the map" and many other places too. The only movie with animation that can fix off the Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
