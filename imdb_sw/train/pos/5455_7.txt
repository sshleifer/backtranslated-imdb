The original preliminary film, one film that has led people to insist on the Code of Hayes relied on. Barbara Stanwyck's stars as a little girl whose father has no problem with hitting the customer. When he dies in an accident, he is released out of the world with the knowledge that his nubile body can get him whatever he wants. He goes to New York and keeps climbing the corporate ladder, one bed at the same time. Although it is obvious that no real sex has been shown, the film is very strong. Unfortunately, after the first value of the shock (near the time Stanwyck locks the car inspector to be able to travel for free), the film becomes a tad of repeating and lighter. Stanwyck himself is the only thing that makes the film worthy to stay. As always, he is wonderful.
