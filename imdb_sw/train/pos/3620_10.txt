I saw this movie tonight, open at night. It was good !! I am a great fan of sports movies, and this was the same as above as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was good. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and she had to buy a drink once ... well ... she kinda stood ... but did not means: C) [not anyone believes that ...]) ALL, it's a good movie. Everyone who loves a good film games, should go out and see it! : C)
