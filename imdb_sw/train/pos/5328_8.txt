I can remember first to see this on TV. I couldn't believe TVNZ to allow! I had to own it! Too much humor will be lost to non-NZ'ers, but let him go! Since the end of Y and Matt and Chris have gone to good things and better (?). The main player of the NZ, Randy Campbell has often been seen on England's Balls of Steel Balls. Yes, it still has f - ks on all its stunts because it has been enlarged. The 'home port' Deja Voodoo has released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band has a team of the Y-Team and includes as 'I'll give you one of My Beer (but I've Got 6)' and 'You Were Even Born In 80' The West also showed a film of the length of the 'The Devil Made Me' which will be released in early 2008 in the NZ. , if you don't get these funny people then you can only F% ^ K OFF!
