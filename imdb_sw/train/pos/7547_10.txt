Panya sauce first appears to be a highly animated film. The best way I can express is that it is quite acidic. Although not quite random. The story is about Nyatta, the little boy cat and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very sick and dying, however, Nyatta sees her soul taken to death and can get half of it. The story is about their efforts to bring about the fullness of life. Even though most of the content in this film looks quite random, it's not. Many of them are typical of life, death and regeneration. You can also view records from other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This incredible small film has a fascinating story, full of meaning more than what you see on the screen.
