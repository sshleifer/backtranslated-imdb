Let's start this review with good information - I am so happy that they didn't decide to make it with Tony to shoot and make a retrospective season if other people were talking. True, the creator and author of this part David Chase did quite the opposite. We don't know whether Tony will live or die. She is in coma and her chances of survival are very small. This period seemed to be very slow, and dreamed by Tony's dream was in incorporating improper identity with Asian kings who clapped the shs from him was quite, flat-out wonderful. After 45 minutes I have found a very sick person who has suffered from depression, but that should not be the reason for resisting this section. It was a strange and incredible part, but it was still well written and sharp. Edie Falco gave an extraordinary performance in this period as the wife who is fighting against her husband may perish. I also saw an AJ drop out of school and swear the vendetta against Junior, which AJ will not have to pull the balls. Silvio now does a boss that opens many doors for problems in later periods. There were many things in this period, too, and I think Vito's 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can meet its destruction if he keeps SOB a greedy desire / TARGET This was not a great place and just a desire because even Tony kills people, we if we listen to him and we hear he is our hero of show. This was an important part for the series, although it was a little snake derived from the conclusion. Kudos for the performance of Edie Falco, and David Chase and authors for creating this absolutely natural and unpredictable twist plot. This is the only 'Sopranos' season where I don't have a f * cking clue where it goes. I can't wait for next week. My testing: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best Line of section: (Paulie for AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
