My review: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Compare with today's non-brain movie (just a step with special effectiveness and nothing new about thought), "Soylent Green" asks something that does not exist again: Think. Well it is not a great surprise day someone eats "biscuits" that creates a human body. For all that happens on this planet, and see how meaningless people are all, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course this film takes a young age but the idea behind the movie is real again. Rich in Paradise, others in hell. Good luck today is TV and idiocy as "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is good for brain cleansing. It is a pity to see that the human mind has not continued as technology. Since writing all stop. If you like the truth, this film is not for you. If you believe all politicians too. If you don't like to ask yourself a question about now and later you should never see this film.
