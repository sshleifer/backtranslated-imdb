You should be one of the best politics satires I have seen so far, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei, and all supporters. The best way, to be very comfortable and very unexpected moving to the end. Effective errors were done well and reserved. Very surprised. All in all I fear this film thumbs great on. It is very important for American intervention in the mid-east, and as such, it can get a good opinion from people who do not share the political view, or those who are not just politicians who know the darkness of the dark and doctor. Indeed, in places, the comedy was very close to the fact that it was the border between funny and terrible.
