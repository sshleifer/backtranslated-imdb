Dudley Moore is wonderful in this classic classic classic. This film is a magic film that depends heavily on administrators' talents. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film can be a catastrophe. They are not always shot and sometimes have corny music that tries to force the mood ("psycho" as anti-wedding music), but acting is winning. Arthur's style is hilarious, and his opinion of drinking. But he does well in a mature, rounded character as he learns to live by his own will. The latter is similar to corny, though. I never give away, but can be improved. It should see many times.
