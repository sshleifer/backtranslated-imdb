this is one of the funnier films I saw. it was short, but they were happy. is the Altmanesque screens, the physical sense of humor, and the enjoyable friendships were a pleasure to see, and a piece of life many of us can see. and I can say to the level of loyalty that I was afraid of Steve Carell's underwear ... really was. Interestingly, this is a good comedy, an unabashed nature which is essentially on love, and many relationships we can find ourselves on the way. Catherine Keener was as strong as Trish, and all the friends of Steve Carell were guilty but beautiful, and very happy. The idea that thought that Carell was a common killer is a hilarious model for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple fact is that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. was highly recommended.
