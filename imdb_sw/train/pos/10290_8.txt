Bruce Force is the best work of Jim Carrey since The Truman Show, and was a good surprise after some recent "Hey Hollywood - look how good I can do!" forestry box office. It is good to see Jim knowing and accepting his power. It will not get a University Award but the film itself will live much longer than the "most gifted" film Academy. She is on her form in this recent film - it's like a return to an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all work well together - well in their comedy roles, super timing comic, and clearly have fun together but without "mother Hey - look how funny I am" of comedy. The real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carre's Nemesis (Carrell's Daily Show fame), who left off with the best and funniest events of the film. I laughed more than Carell than someone else in the past three years. I can see that religious nuts in the United States will be on God's treatment, but the bottom line of the film is true for all the theological beliefs - we are citizens of the protoplasms trying to get through our short life using our free care. Without marrying children we are complaining about, this may be the goal of people with poor priorities (who know type - men are decorated with gold on Sunday morning and near television, selling prayers to God). And again, about 0.5 percent of the country will deal with 80% of the media will be lost. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is just an entertainment film, every member of the audience laughs wondering what they will do, and a feeling-good feeling at the movie conclusion. Walking down any major road in the US has to prove that God has a very great feeling. It's the best kiss of comic to remind us of what Jim was carrying. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - it's great to have you back!
