Cinderella's story is one of my loved ones from Charles Perrault, and the beauty of sleep that also took place in the Disney film in 1959; This film is a beautiful, beautiful Disney fabric. <br /> <br /> The film has a great voice; That's one that I like in movies is a very good voice, and I like also songs; My favorite song is romantic "So this is Love." I like the mouse from the film too, it's good. My favorite part is the scene after speaking, the little bird tried to wake up Cinderella until the morning; I also love when the animal friends of Cinderella (mice and birds) make the mother's birth dress for Cinderella, so she can go to the ball ... up to Drizella & Anastasia vipate to bits, b **** es!
