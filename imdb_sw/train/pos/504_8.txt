Okay, the recent history of Star Trek has never been good. The following parent was lost in his last few seasons, DS9 boldly stayed where nobody stayed, and Voyager began to get worse and never lived by his promise. Therefore, when they announced a new series of Star Trek, I had no high expectations. And, the first part, Broken Bow, had some problems. But, in general it was stable Trek equipment and losing good <br /> <br /> I get nits out of the first way. The opening theme is lighter and I don't expect to sit on a regular basis, but that's what you lose. What was so bad was a freeous rubbing lotion area that just about dismissing my wife out of the room. They need to despair it out. But, the plot was solid and moving well. The characters, though still new, look good and not everything you can expect. Vulcans are obviously released very differently than before, and a little ominous theme. I loved the language, who is the first character of Star Trek's failure to stand proud of the face of death, but instead it faces phobias and fears. They seemed to be true to the Trek Lot, which has been a great problem in the previous series, although they have a lot of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, technological innovations that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of travel stories time. Anyone wants to start the pond for how long before Borg appear? <br /> Everything, series has great potential. They see the world with clean eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how things have been in the future series. Did Klingons leave only to attack the war? How did we meet the people of Romulans? The Federal Form did who and who only put the World in charge. Why are basic instructions so important? If they are dealing with these things rather than hitting events during travel, this will be a fascinating series. My favorite line: Zephram Cochran saying "where no one has gone ahead" (not "no")
