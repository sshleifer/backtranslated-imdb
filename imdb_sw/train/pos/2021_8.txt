I think of the publications of Israel stepping into the old dirt that was far away, pulled by the weight of the lower skirts. Together comes television: on a large scale, has the power of redemption, and effectively as those BBC producing so fine, Victor's literature gets a new disease in life. Religious themes, ethical values, can be easily increased in the world not easily disturbed, and known by cooperation, things and domestic violence. But these ancient stories, well told, have great power, and this is a secret gem. It is difficult to measure today how the power of the power, workforce and wonder of Ann Bronte, "Wildfell Hall Planner", was actually. It comes from the first level of blocking corsets? body, mind, social? Her heroine, Helen Huntingdon, avoids bad marriage, comes cruel and drunken, not only knows her husband's anger, but the tolerance of society and rough rumors, destroying her life. He pays the price; but he is proud; he falls in love on the way; she comes to be beaten but won, and strong. I like watching women like these on the screen. <br /> <br /> Actors are the best? Brits better should give. The story of love is the effectiveness of being addressed, with real enthusiasm and emotions and practitioners alike. Tara Fitzgerald sits every aspect of the hard heroine, and as described here by other retirees, a very misunderstood and beautiful face you could live with that stirring hairstyle. Toby Stephens, motivating, contributes to good, young and motivated young people, who come out. Rupert Graves (one of my most famous British actors) has enjoyed as a scandal village (so much that you close to him. No one is perfect). A support supporter creates a world that drives without feeling that good harmony has been made with modern flavor, and without feeling preaching. Another classic BBC, it was suggested: this is how romantic literature should be dramatized.
