This stands for its origin. I am too tired to watch Indian movies which are a hot pan of the whole Hollywood and Brit. Some errors were unavoidable, however, this film is a must-see. The Surya chapter of the clean-cut soldier, confident (as opposed to alcohol, the hungry money we usually see) was amazing. He has come for a long time from his work Nerukku Ner. I loved the film so I could own it. I am not usually in the form of unhealthy violence, somehow I felt for each character and therefore I can't bring myself to call it "unnecessary violence". I am not happy with many melodrama and exciting events that relate to many Hindi and Tamil movies. I really liked this film because of the same lack. ACP Anbuselvan's view to evict his wife, is not excessive, is to encourage the heart and make me want my eyes out. There is some time I look at the film when I want to beat FF. I have often wanted to do this in the cinema. You didn't want to do this while watching this movie. I have been hoping that Ghajini will remove it soon.
