This film is briefly, the movie center. The film migrates carefully with pictures that inspire a sensitive viewer. The movie opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children want to take revenge on another child. In fact, they work in their world of what they have seen in the adult world around them. Later we meet these three children again as adults in the sanatorium. Here we see how life has been done for each of them. One is a sexually abused patient. Another person is a hustler who has been sick. The third child, a young woman, has been nun and serves in the sanatorium. This film is harmful to the impact of violence on the psyche. This video has a peak that is certainly not for members of squeamish viewers but is logical and also moving. Acting is the best and script written well. There is a music mark that provides an undercurrent of fear in this film. This is not a film for biographers but a film for listeners listeners.
