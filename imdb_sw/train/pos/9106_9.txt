Since I watched it for the first time, "Piedras" is a very favorite and one of the few pictures I can watch from time to time. The great screenplay shows the life of a group of women (all in some way connected) with comprehensive understanding and understanding. Ramón Salazar got a compulsory film at its first start, and he shows himself a director of the best actors. It is not that all the displays are best, though. For all leading women, they start at an average (Najwa Nimri) very well (Vicky Peña), but a standing ovation must be directed to Mónica Cervera, who is believed to love Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides can be attractive as a female nurse, and there is a good leg of Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and her own director, Ramón Salazar. "Piedras" is written for beauty and displayed, when I see I found so much heart that I could not stop thinking about the day. I strongly recommend.
