Two businessmen are on a journey - men's men Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and a shameful Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra) innocent. They meet good Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both love her. There's more but maybe revealed. The story (even in the 1940s music) is ridiculous and everything is so good and appropriate - it's very fast. Also this film is very long. It's 140 minutes and that way is very much like that story. There is also a number of boring and Jose Iturbi and its orchestra. This is still important to be infected. When Kelly plays or Sinatra or Grayson plays this becomes magical. None of these memorable songs but Sinatra had a very good voice. It is a shot in rich Technicolor and MGM all of the gloss. Acting is the same - Kelly is fine (although seeing him as pushing) and Sinatra is just fine (though seeing him as a shy person was also blowing!). Grayson is not given anything to do but he is very strange to look at. Some shots he literally took my breath away! There are many things here: Sinatra and Kelly's great play with the number of singing; Sinatra sing anything; Grayson's two songs and popular animation sequence Kelly plays with Jerry - animation mouse! Tom also does funny funny. There is also a young Dean Stockwell stealing every area where he lives. It is therefore very long and the plot is not suitable but it is still suitable for infection. This was a great hit in his day.
