In 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, being a Cuban citizen for the past five years, has been lost from the face of the Earth, leaving Fidel Castro to announce that he probably died, while he has certainly left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live a presumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara makes the idea of ​​losing the corrupt government, of bourgeois there. Once again, Steven Soderberg takes place where 'Che: Part One' stops (it's better at this time). The placement is more on target, the task of making it ever so much (including the turn to look for patients Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). It is worth saying, perhaps it is better if you see both films, to get a true story of Guevara and what kind of person it was (I had a clear opportunity to see both films on one screening conversation - about time long!). As with 'Che-Part 1: Argentina', this film does not mark MPAA, but has a language of salt and violence easily to change 'R'.
