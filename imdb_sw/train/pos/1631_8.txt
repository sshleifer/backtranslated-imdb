This movie has all. Optical eyes, joke jokes, play on words and lines. It is about a group of boys from different ethnic and social groups that meet to defeat the common enemy. If you look at this more than once, you will find the quotation as a Animal House (and that's what I love Animal Animals too). I place them on 15 funniest films. A member of the Military Youth Institute is a paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this film is correct). He is sad, careless, cruel and should be taken down. A group of boys who do not have a first relationship, end up together so they can survive and overcome the Messenger and the wacky program only Mad Magazine that can write. Must see - you will love it!
