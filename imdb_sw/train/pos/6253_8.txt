This film is good. As often heard, it is really true and sometimes cruel, but unlike other people I am obviously not of the opinion that it is depressing, negativistic or breaking Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: In fact there are some very serious cases in HUNDSTAGE and other characters are very bad people, at the same time looking at love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls. And that is how it described HUNDSTAGE to me from other films that are trying to show the 'ordinary people' lives in an intense, realistic way; their breasts, their wishes, their dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove, that the lives of the class people work is garbage! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very scared to accept, that almost anyone lives like 'clean' and 'normal' as we love other people to believe. And that every life has its dark sides and often sad. Very good place: The old Viennese man, looking at his old girl to play 'eastward', as he calls. I think everyone who sees this area does not know the meaning of beauty and he has to ask himself, is a proto-fascist: Anime in HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who have been removed by the body of a 70-year-old woman, playing with all her hair to her boyfriend.
