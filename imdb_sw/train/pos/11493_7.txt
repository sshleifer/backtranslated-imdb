The unborn child is a very good movie of the terrible budget that uses fear associated with pregnancy. It is well-prepared by Brooke Adams always good and the style of the movie Mr. James Karen, although the support is equal to the average b-grader. Music, and Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's chapter is quite intelligent for this kind of thing, although there is a feeling of misogyny about it. The trend of Rodman Fender is only enough, and there are some cheap non-compulsory events. If you are a fan of Adams, whose film work is not available as appropriate, see; he is great, as always.
