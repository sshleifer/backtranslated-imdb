I enjoyed this film. It was a pleasure to see the closest version of Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> The population does not like the film, but it should appear in the context of a natural story that is. The movie uses flashback to show the gentleness of the young man and the events that have been created in that woman. Before the Web. Before Willie Garvin. The action is slower, and for my taste is not enough tension is available in today's events. However this is only acceptable to obtain such a faithful version. If you like Glory Blaise, you will enjoy it even for its errors, if you just want the flick action and drive drive - forget it. br>> <br /> It has a sense of being the first franchise, but if I've never been encouraged anywhere, I suspect that no longer follow. Unfortunately.
