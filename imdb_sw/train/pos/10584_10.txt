"Footlight Parade" greatly attracts many levels. There is no way that "thought-providers of the theater" could be released in any world of the world, of course. Consider the huge dams and three fountains of the great story for "Waterfall," for example. (Berkeley told John Garfield in "They Are Doing Crime" six years later and the Children of the Children are singing "For Waterfall" as they took their rain.) \ T in the picture.

The "Waterfall Waterfall" number is amazing in that regard. Girls change in their bathroom suits on a fast bus through Times Square and all its lights. Girls spreading-swimming on the camera provides a type of shotch shots that does not appear for 35 years. In a few months the Production Code will eliminate those negative proposals.
