This movie was a tragedy in the Box Office, and the reason behind it is the guilt of the movie, the beauty of the story. Music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such stories is very good, the director tried completely. Abhay is the best and surprising and he shines once again in his role, did a good job in comedy or in emotional situations. Soha looks sweet in the movie. The star of the star star was the same. Music and all songs are beautiful, Himesh is awesome as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, its beautiful movie and feel good for us. Abhay best works until date. I will give Ahista Ahista 9/10.
