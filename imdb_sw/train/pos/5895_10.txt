I had read the news about the Olympic and personal journeys of Dan Jansen before seeing this film. I am always fascinated by the story of hope and win the events of life change, and this was not an exception. The role of the characters supplied gives them a sense of family relationships and how they are affected the lives of others. I can't say with the accuracy of the specific details in this film, it is custom to take a creative license when organizing the script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is important here. <br /> <br /> It is a film worth a story that should be told. I felt a feeling for the characters and was happy at the end.
