Okay, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has a great line of stories and plot with great actors and executives. Jeremy Sumpter is hott and he is perfect for the role! He is a great gunna in Hollywood. He has a bright future! This shows the best for a long time because I love so much this show, and I hope it has achieved a lot! It's very interesting. I've been waiting to be out for 6 or 7 months and finally here, and it's good! I also have that tape, too. I can look at it whenever I want it now! Very badly once a week though. I wish it was at least twice a week because now I would be on Tuesday every day! Hope you all like to show this! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
