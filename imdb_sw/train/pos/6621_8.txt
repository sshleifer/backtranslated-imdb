I came back from the pre-release of the best sci-fi film. It style is unique and very unique made. It is locked by real actors, but has been changed to a black and white color that you have never seen. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It is a combination of the success of French and sweet cultures. The story and the memory of the Chain of the Blade, and if you liked the one you would like this, too. Story of the story is intelligent, not available and has a little good problem. This film is a must-see for safe unless perhaps those who don't like sci-fi or b & w completely.
