The summer is so full of Blockbusters and film events, and not mentioning some of the ambitions of these events, that I had ole to get the film I can just sit and enjoy. If you don't want to read more under the page (no providers), I will count it here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some violent violence parts, many deaths, and small blood items, not for small children), but does not try to be overly corny or beyond its limits. Imagine that it's worse, a little more magical Princess Bride, and you will be around. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I am, perhaps, not as a film leader like others ... Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel a job. I am also a great fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I get bored with the lines of the story again and again with the film and more flash than filling faster than you can count 10, and this film is a diamond in the severity. <br /> <br /> At the end here (August), I was tired enough for the bursting expectations from the great hits that I stopped seeing Bourne Ultimatum for Stardust. After I had my full confidence in the Transformers for my Fiction controversy, Stardust verification seemed attractive, but I was worried. Like many others here, I was completely surprised. I was going to consider seeing another source of fantasy movie clich√©d from here to breakfast. Don't be deceived, it's really a story of a story, and it really has witches, magic, and it really needs to be stopped by unbelief ... But the most exciting thing I have found, is that it is not based on anything I have seen or read in the last 15 years. , and in fact it's a very good movie. <br /> ((Unlike other 90% movies that seem to continue to look like spines on the side, perhaps the sign that Hollywood is leaving the ideas? and others "so says NYT and such and no doubt)) <br /> <br /> Stardust didn't have me bolted on my seat because of the jam-packed action on each side, nor did I sweat a shot because of hook hook after the yellow hook threatens to reject the sharp tension away from echo in the theater in a big boom. It didn't even work a great blast to confuse my thoughts on what is happening on the screen (Transformers, I watch them). It does not attempt to show the latest CGI techniques, nor does it offend my mind and the dimwitted dialogue with the lines of stories that are so simple I could make them in 3rd grade (the boy I hate). <br /> <br /> I just ... I looked. Look, and enjoy the creation of a beautiful creation before my eyes. Of course, I would know what will happen in many films, but you forget. It made my heart spread to a place, but the most important thing I saw was that I left the playground to hear better than when I entered. It is really a gem. After the widespread widespread summer and many remake and films that did not depend on my expectations, this was like a tasty tea tea cup to erase all the hard work that I have already been through others trying to get out of my money. It 's not for everyone, but for yourself; If you enjoy the wonderful films that stand alone (Pastor Shepherd, Black Sauce, Crystal Kizito, etc.) then you should see this film. This Diamond is looking for its way in my DVD collection when you refuse stores, you can trust me on this. It is just amazing.
