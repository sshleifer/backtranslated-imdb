The best modern. Good work with Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and young Irene Cara. Tony King was very real in his position of Satin. This movie was one of the "black" movies of all the 70s and different movies of the "shipping" of the time, this film was a conspiracy, and it had done well. The sound of the film, played by Aretha Franklin, was popular on R&B charts at that time.
