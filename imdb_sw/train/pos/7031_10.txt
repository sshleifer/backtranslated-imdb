This is a good movie, I played a short time ago. It had extra pins - so. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was good. The arrangement was also very good. Unless the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it does so for a long time. In general I give 8.5 stars. They also added several parts, but it was still cold.
