after watching Hunter Deer, which is a masterpiece, Jacknife's film had great shoe filling. and it is very good here, such as Kathy Baker.but this movie is Ed Harris, who gives power, feeling and effect of performance.The movie depends on play action, and there's one or two scenes where I felt definitely to me.by that I mean that for those one or two scenes felt like I was looking at the stage of action. The same theme, but it's two different films.i thought The Deer Hunter was good, and I also think this movie was great.it is acting in this which makes it very nice to me, Jacknife is 10/10
