'The second beginning' as described in the title, shows us the beginning of the human race. Putting a long time before the matrix existed, this short video written by Wachowski shows us a world that can turn us away from us in the future not far, setting at the end of the 21st century; greed, power, control, vanity etc.. The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or service is common among false stories / fantasy stories. The second launch cannot focus on this concept, however rather than a simple person against the layout of the machine, this story describes the struggle in which the machines live, the acceptance of the world in the world dominating humanity. Where the matrix film shows a human perspective, these short stories describe the two sides of the story. 2/2, answer the many questions made by the original Matrix film, such as the war came out, how the sky was black, what caused human consumption as battery and also leads us into the city of the machine called 01, which may have the importance of the film Matrix Revolution film. We will not give away too much of the story, because I do not want to destroy the view of the viewer's perspective, however, I would recommend to anyone who is attracted to the abdominal world or anyone who is attracted to the Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
