until HBO began to restore this month. I remember laughing loudly in the playground back in 1991, and now again in my living room. If I see it has continued, I must look at it. There is no question. This is more entertaining to me than the other, the most popular spoofs like Birds! (which I like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "sudden speech! The last signs of brain fever! He can call any time!" give me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg has never been funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. they all turn into a beautiful display as expected. I started to give this 9 out of 10 stars, but I realized that for the type of film there should be, there was not one thing I could change or improve. So it's 10. I need to get this on the DVD, that's all that suits.
