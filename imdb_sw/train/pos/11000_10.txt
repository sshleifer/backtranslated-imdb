If you're signed in to the film and prospects, throw it away now, because no hype will make this film right. To distribute this film to one type will be criminal. It is a thriller of spy, has black elements, bits and pieces of action, false science, and cyberpunk all closed together with a brilliant story, loss of mind, and very good performances. <br /> <br /> The comments here have emphasized almost that they are derivative, in good and bad way, of other movies. But as they say, every story emerges from Shakespeare, so once you can pass that, you're in hell of a journey. <br /> <br /> You will need to stop your lack of certain points, and when you put it never to be wonderful, there is a section (read: elevator) that faces a low budget and some cheesy displays. Don't feel that it means it's the same level of cheesy Sci-Fi's movies, though, because this is on a very high level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn off. This is a pure psychology. But if you are interested in sitting down and dedicating 90 minutes of your life to experience a novel movie, by all means, do WORD! Check out this movie now before being cool to see!
