I had a mixture of "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and led by Bertrand Blier when I was looking at it but I finished it. I can't call it vulgar ("Dog and Dumber" is bad, "The most beautiful" is stupid and unkind); I would call it a terrible and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, in particular, women do not like or even hate. It is a picture of a misogyny (or looks), and how two ways to combat treating each woman you encounter seems impossible. But beyond me I think about it more I realize that somehow comes as a beautiful beautiful gem. I am fascinated by how Blier could overcome it. The movie is very entertaining and enjoyable: well written, acting and all is the first class, and the music is sweet and pleasant. In fact, when I think, two friends did a good thing for the women they met: they prepared a woman in a train (nice, beautiful blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie work and one of the most amazing discussions René Clément of "Uncertain Games" (1952 ) at the age of 6) for a meeting with her husband who did not see for two months; found a man who was finally able to get Marie-Ange Frigid (Miou-Miou) has come out with satisfaction; they introduced and educated the young and very ready Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen shows.) Meet them with Jeanne Moreau lifts this comedy to a horrible level. In short, I do not like to meet Gerard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Pierrot's Patrick Dewaere in real life and welcome to dinner but I had a good time watching movies and two hours around the fly - he never had boring.
