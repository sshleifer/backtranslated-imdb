This view is quite valuable. It has the best talent of talent I have seen for so long. The cluster of the show is unique and clean (I think executives at ABC are not also used that, if it was not a real showcase). However, this show was reliable and interesting characters and wonderful lines of story. I'm probably not in their age group expecting to show a show, if I am in my forty, but many of my friends also loved it (After 30 - mid-40 years) and they die for quality displays and skilled members to throw . I don't think that this show was given when enough to get the audience. I believe that given the most time this show would do very well. Sometimes ABC does not provide a show and possibly a real chance. For many exhibitions have been given opportunities after space and not close to value! They need to provide quality to show the real position and time to really click and get the audience. I loved the characters and I expected to watch every part. I have been watching events on ABC videos and show continues to get better and better. Although I think they should give us one more event (No. 13?). We want to look at what we can! Bombard ABC with email and mail and see if it is possible to save this show from collapse. It certainly worked for Jerico. Other things are required to save and this show is definitely one of them.
