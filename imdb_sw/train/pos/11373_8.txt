Here is a wonderful: modern-day film about a common killer who does not have a fight to fight, nobody was seen to die, no car motivating and no loud sound ..... and it is happening in Russia. There are only two short events but it's terrible. Some of the stories are the work of detective, and how much of the red detective is needed to solve the murder. This is a very surprising movie, and "surprise" describes more of the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), too. However, the story is incompatible and it is quite interesting all the way. Rea is better if you have detected, you are considered. Jeffrey DeMunn is as bad as a killer. The Russian model of Donald Sutherland is a suspect but he plays only a character in this hot film. Once again, the story is full of voluntary agendas, here and there, with only one interesting reference to homosexuals, the full legitimacy of secular psychology, police and government officials to be boorish / bigoted / bigoted , yadda, yadda, yadda. Alternatively, it is a criminal and low-crime film. This is the only film that may be unknown but is interesting to people who have seen it. Since it depends on the account of the real life of this killer, it is more than a decline. Don't go because you just have nothing about it.
