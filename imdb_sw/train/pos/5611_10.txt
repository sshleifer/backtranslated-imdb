I saw this film when I was playing with my idea of ​​moving into my home and establishing my own life. Maybe that's why I took it seriously. I thoroughly believed in the psychological destruction of the poor behavior in Paris of permanent construction, dust, fiance, selfishness, evil, evil and decay. I give all credit to Polanski crafts in his direction, play with him and his unsuspecting script but I failed at the end of the horrible area and I had to be awakened to the sports manager's office. Luckily, my life alone did not turn out like a disaster like this (so far) but I have always honored the artist who can make these exhibitions and so totally jewelry in reality (fake) is trying to convey. Simply put, a person is a specialist in the first order and loan to the human race. This film is a lot of events, a lot of good and great drama. If some exhibitions were given in English (events with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with many characters) and Polanski made himself in English and French, I wholeheartedly recommend, if you seem to be two languages, switch sounds from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate screens when looking for great transfers on multiple DVDs. This film is part of Polanski called "apartment building trilogy" which also includes "Repulsion" and "Baby Rosemary". Unfortunately, the "Repulsion" has not yet done for the best DVD transfer in Region 1. Without saying, these three films will make a modern box of wonder.
