I loved the AWTWB of Tom Barman. You should only let it come to you and enjoy the time it stays, and don't expect anything. It's like sitting on a caf√© and beer, sunny sun, and watching people go. Obviously it will not put you in the future, that is true, but that is not necessary for a good film. It is only experienced during the film that is good. I felt that there were fewer tablets that could work less, but that a fan of Lynch didn't care that again :) And I * liked * style, or taste of this movie. It is lighter, but clean, and the sound of the voice is beauty. Any music partner will get her captive out of AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I will give 8 out of 10. <br /> (10 music skills)
