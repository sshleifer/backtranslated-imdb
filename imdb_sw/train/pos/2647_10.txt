This movie can be translated into many different levels. Listen to other movie hits and say it's a story again or w / e and that's about drugs. It has more pictures on drugs; however, all parts of the movie (and why I think it was personal) is not really about it. In fact it mocks psychology and social conditions. It shows, for the second division, that the character of the main character is watching the video of the patients online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to show that all of this destruction that we are open to make it easier for us to be mechanical in our field instead of seeing people like people. In addition to the logic area, it also reaches the people who were in the 1% smart classrooms with confused and confused because life cannot be predictable and mathematical and logical as shown on macroscopic levels. You ask for the Heisenberg uncertainty (with all other rules and regulations of uncertainty) not only for physics but for life and leave the opportunity to change your plans and adjust the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It can only go over your head; not for you is for those people who have difficulty dealing with a life that does not work as a problem of math. When you fully read the movie or write your key review I don't try to read the back cover first (written by vendors and parapsychologists)
