After growing in the false streets of Detroit, MI, and having friends who moved to New York's balls, I fell into a life of becoming a member of the House. I joined the Theieves House. We changed the same rules as many homes, but we were a professional base that would add and give credit card fraud to find the instruments and clothes we wanted. I even learned how to claim decisions of checks and driver's license and give them money in more than seventeen countries, until a jealous king called the Secret Service on me and I went to the Federal prison. But, I have learned a lot from these women in this movie and I highly recommend you to look at yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the house here in Detroit and the criminal activities we entered. My book, Identity Schemes can be found on Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But I don't believe, It's better than Paris is Burning, because its 2005 make.
