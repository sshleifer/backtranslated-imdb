Tintin and I recently showed as part of P.O.VV of PBS. series. It depends on the interviews made by Georges Remi a.k.a Herge, the creator of Tintin, since 1971 which speaks of his various experiences publishing his famous character, first in the Catholic newspaper, then in his series of comic books. Positive comments on comic pages and surreal pictures of Herge dreams. I first met Tintin in the Digest of Children's Diaries in reading a primary school of the secret school of Unicorn Secrets. Later my mother got a CD registration and I read the Red Rackham Treasury every month in 1978. I remember seeing some of the comic Tintin books in a local bookstore after that but for some reason we didn't get any because I was 12 years old and I thought I was around them. I have Breaking Free, a book written by J Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. You haven't read yet. The film also deals with the human life of the artist as he left his first wife after his experience with the player who used him (who was later married). His name is Fanny and he is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and its creator, this film is worth watching. Update: 9/4/07-now I have read breaking free. Tintin and Captain are the only ordinary actors who appear here and are faced with the anti-capital of Mr. Daniels and Tintin has been portrayed as a rouser of a rabbit and a peacock on his shoulder who still takes care of Captain who lives. Captain here tries only to get salaries and a wife and daughter that loves so much. They and other construction workers swear by a strike after a colleague dies as a result of improper equipment. The whole thing is taking place in England with accents of the cockney work of intact. It is not the kind of Herge to accept but read exciting yet. Laam, the snowy dog ​​just appears on the upper left corner of the lid (which Tintin is running from the police!) And the volunteer page.
