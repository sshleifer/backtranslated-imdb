One of the most interesting movies posted as "shipped," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text with amazing insight. He wrote in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film too. Tribal color can often disrupt, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave permission (but only strictly). I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in the observation of the ongoing situation of racism which Bakshi tries to strengthen. Wonderful things.
