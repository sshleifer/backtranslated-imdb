I've been reading the latest words about this movie and I would like to answer. you probably don't know the original story of the rap N.W.A. which started in 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band to solo and finally in 1991, the band broke when Dr. which has led to the mass of beef from the beginning of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. This story was largely due to that. The more and more movie was 90 minutes of laugh, the way described the song of bootie juice that the political statement was highly hilarious. not to mention "sweet song" tasty was tasty. and while vanilla sherbert took his ass, as well as the company's recorder also who is hilarious and since they are the bullets of the shot every time also. <br /> <br /> People who did not enjoy this film probably did not get it or is a full ministry, my opinion
