At first I was not sure if I wanted to watch this film when you came to my guide so I could look at the IMD and I think the lid was too dirty and I think I will try to try to expect a film like Elephant. Once you lost the fact that I should love Alicia's behavior well played by Busy Phillips, I realized this beautiful movie this was doing towards the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is important for Deanna played with Erika Christensen next to the entire movie but finally we know that despite their polar opposition they have one thing in common instead of being on the bullet. They share the loneliness and at what level is revealed as the film goes on. <br /> <br /> I've just got to say how I liked this movie and I was glad to see all the good comments about it. I could not even get to the elephant because it just seems to be using Columbine's catastrophe. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Jobs Phillips do it OFF CHAIN ​​!!! That's a good thing and I would like to see him continue to work in other mature jobs.
