I turned this to see the wonderful water of Ethel, who is a biography that I am reading now. I will accept my jaw dropped when pork cups and milk resorts began to intervene, but people can't watch this film as a piece of discrimination or discrimination. It is a very short film released by blacks, for whites during the entertainment industry when it was completely divided by concern for the people involved was the joke of their time, the old trend of humor. We see modern black films doing the same thing, but with new trends (exhibitions), "ho" and "hood" and such. I think if you look back in thirty years, you would find today's movies as a racist. The audience should be aware of this film is the talent of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr., who blows his modern pipe, Shirley Temple, and looks amazingly similar to what he did as an adult. Everyone involved in this film was very happy to do it. Why are you not happy for that, instead of what you think should be?
