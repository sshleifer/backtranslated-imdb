To have "only saved" my 23 YR old daughter from Iraq, the medical aid unit of Anaconda camp, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings of returning the vets to try to understand his thoughts on arrival and wait until after something wrong happened. Regardless of your taking on war and this movie peace is used as a good start for all Americans to start healing our vets to return emotional feelings. The main information of the whole movie is "Take Action" on the problem. Movie's amazing emotional. I would like to highly recommend this film to vet vets the whole mature family and ask that follow-up to listen to the help of the help to return to the Gulf War Freedom. <br /> <br /> Quickly around a year later & My daughter has seen this DVD. He got an account of his feelings and has actually made a promise to restore it for 6 years. He takes his time in the sand is that he did well. Baladi's first-class children found the first level of treatment for a variety of common illnesses not usually free of charge and escort. His look on his shoulder in Iraq's visit was. "We changed the hearts and minds back to the" Big DVD you have to keep an open mind and see all around
