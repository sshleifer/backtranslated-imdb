Zombi 3 has an interesting history in doing it. First, it is a hit column of Fulci's Zombi 2, and Zombi 2 itself of doubt of the sale of persuasive people to think it was a good Sunday of George A. Romero of the Dead Zombi. Combine enough? Basically, no films have anything to do with someone else, but who cares about money. I think Fulci himself begins to worry about the production of half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to walk. Bruno Mattei was brought to the board to help film films and extra events to extend the run time. The Zombi 3 plot is your usual zombie arrow. Scientists develop serum on the island in Philippines, terrorists steal away the blow, and zombie run amok. Scientists want to create medicine, when the army has lost everyone without hatred. There is also a short summary of the DJ Radio that talks about how we are dealing with the planet. Overall, I liked this film. I heard horrible things, but I find the goofy enjoyable conversation. The film seems to be an attempt to promote awareness about pollution, anti-military, man-made, etc.. I feel this feeling was one time a great film, but it had gone towards a strange direction, perhaps when Mattei came on the board. You hear DJ Radio breaking the good news and, "When you see men in white suit & gas masks, their flight to charity." This is actually portrayed in pictures of men on a white gun under the zombies. Later, they cry directly to stealing an area from Crazies which one of the ordinary people, without a command, is killed for error. <br /> <br /> The reason for the year is very good for this and zombie hordes around every corner. Is it cool? I would like to count the way ?? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Bird. 4. Zombie without feet swimming in the pool. My favorite zombie was maniac-wielding maniac at the gas station. She was a bad ass and almost jumped under a building attempt to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Good quotations? When the sergeant insists on destroying the zombie, scientists say, "Do I think that once the ashes is in the air, it will fall down, and pervert everything?" So Sargeant boldly responds, "Now you are talking about science fiction." He also mentions "Fiction Science" told by scientists even at the end when everyone dies. Extra: Gallery, Trailers, and Interviews, especially with Mattei where he insists he led the 40% Exhibition, still unable to remember which one or other important information. <br /> <br /> Below Under: You must see for zombie and Fulci characters. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
