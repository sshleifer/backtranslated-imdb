When I first went to see the brightness I was looking for a good film from what I heard about it and I liked the work of Stanley Kubrick but when I started to look at it it was better than I thought it would be. Sometimes I felt very worried and I couldn't take my eyes on the screen yet there was something that was very troubling everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's Bright version because it doesn't always fit the book of Stephen King but in all my view of the Kubrick version, the mini series and the book are very good. which will allow you to think even after more movies then look for brightness.
