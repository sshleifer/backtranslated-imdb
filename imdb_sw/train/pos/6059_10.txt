This is the best documentation, with beautiful pictures of racing and beautiful stories. IMAX cameras give you a very broad view, as the DVD movie is perfect. Your hearing every speaker works almost all the time, the film is not available and gives you just feel the nature of 230mph. Of course there are some sound effects added but I think it's good, it provides a comprehensive experience for driving events ...
