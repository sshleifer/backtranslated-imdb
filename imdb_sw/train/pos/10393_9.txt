Let's say a short story. I loved every minute. Fantastic fantastic in the realistic style of Arabia-Nights. There is a bad wizard, a beautiful princess, djinn and everyone lives in subsequent happiness. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Just quibble: special effects are pretty dated (love Sabu and foot djinn, though!)
