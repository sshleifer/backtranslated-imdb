My 3 year old child loved it. I loved him, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. As for the level of violence? It is not true that violence, especially the stick of a stick type. No one is really dead, no one, no blood, no suffering, so it's true for children, more than many Saturday mornings. This movie takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should go. <br /> <br /> Before all the beautiful pictures, the textures done with wonder, and the exact depth, not trying to be true, but making the whole art. Moss on stone, rust on metal, gatherings on wood and stone, everything adds in general. <br /> <br /> Example of character, unlike many modern CG movies, is quirky, not good, again in the whole art. These faces appear to be less visible than other movies, but the characters are more than a puppet-like human-like. I think that's a good thing, it gives credit right, how amazing it can seem, it's easy to stop your unbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothes, for par, at least with Pixar likes. Just remember in the opening events when Lian-Chu fights a big slug; Gwizdo is in front of other farmers, and all have deep clothes that have caused me to stop the movie to make it. <br /> <br /> Layout. In addition to Car's will, and even Wall? E. Space has been done many times, but the fantastic landscape of the Dragon hunter is similar to certain events in the Last Enduring Story with the Lord of Pete, but again it is full of art, and with many good ideas being played by effort. Beautiful vistas as the location of Monsters Inc. where they ride all the way to storage, or Wall? E where we see the big garbage he has made, has grown in this film, everything is big, but it has never been; it's just history the whole way! The interaction that walks through the area with a wonderful falls. Chinese wallpaper, islands surrounding heaven. Broccoli in heaven? That's actually where I believe the CG should go, do something that takes your breath away, and do it regularly. <br /> <br /> Sound is good, music is different from not just epic, and with thanks without any sound, and original original film. <br /> <br /> Animation is very good. To lend his leadership to cartoons, especially good use of stretch and squeeze. Sometimes it is not true, but 3D models are not true. <br /> <br /> Character is also good. Lian-Chu, gentle and mild-tempered gentlemen is gradually growing with the attention of little Zoé. Gwizdo's powerful Lian-Chu manager saves himself at the end, while Zoé is not changed, but who wants a good child to make a change? I least love Lian-Chu than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc.. The inner conflict in the group is found by external pressure, as appropriate in the fantasy story of this fantasy This story reminds them of the last story, especially how the world is split. Monsters are the best price standard, except one travel. Doesn't have the emotional effect of Wall ?? E, which is the most powerful point of the film, but is a more fun journey, and there is no recurring music location in the past, and it has steps from the first location. This film is what you want to watch at a fun and exciting time. The entire game has, as I said all the vision, which seems to have been followed strictly. It looks like, that the environment is ready for more adventures, and I for one would hope so. <br /> <br /> One hand side, French actor making Lian-Chu appeared as Jean Reno at first, but I'm happy not he, though one of my favorites. Good hearing new, me, sound. <br /> <br /> I offer a high rating, slightly surprised by the average and low ratings with some; I have tried to address some of the concerns made by the two views and the lowest vote. This movie way as an adventure, and as a European movie, is not opposed to Hollywood, but different.
