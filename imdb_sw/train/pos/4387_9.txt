This is a powerful movie from the historical and epic view. When the story is simple it is clean and straightforward. In fact, it is a simple story of a simple, respectful person who comes to deal with men who are educated and more useful at the time. Poor of Rich, Honorable and Honorable, ordinary but well-told stories without much glitz of hollywood playing on the screen. <br /> <br /> Additional inputs because you can almost smell people on the screen. :)
