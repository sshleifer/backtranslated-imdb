I did not expect Val Kilmer to do John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it's not a porn that identifies himself. In fact, the whole cast turned into a spectacular show in this non-standard film. If others have previously mentioned, search two sets of disk and check the "Wadd" first document; will give you a lot of history in a story that will help you to know the film. Some people seem to be worried about the LAPD crime scene if installed on DVD. There are several reasons that may have been included, one of which John Holmes's case for murder was the first in the US where the video was used by the charges. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the list!
