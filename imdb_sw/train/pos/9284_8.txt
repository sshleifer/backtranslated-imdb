This film is described as comedy, but it was not quite comedy. Like any Panahi film, it was a real drama showing a common thread of social equality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; is more lighter than the dark and bad Circle (my famous Iran film). The empowerment of girls and the ban between them and the soldiers were all quite honest (like a document) and for a totally hilarious. <br /> <br /> Fill out the actual matches and after the amazing. Increased originality such as Kenny Australia, of course a very different film. <br /> <br /> Displays from all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls? they were very honest. It was very moving to see the desires, desires and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing a necklace is different from their daughters should go to this film? will be a real eye-opener. To me, the soldiers represented the current concept. They started with the official policy of the stock exchange for all girls' requests. When the film went on, they found it more difficult to maintain this situation. While what looks like Teheran all goes into wild parties, everyone is found in it, and the ignorance of the current policy is obvious to both and both. It was the end of moving and unexpected, and gave a film of a good combination of emotions, frivolity, drama and social definition. Although they are adults of the movies, I think children aged seven will continue to know this film (for as long as they can read the headlines) produce quality films such as Panahi and Kiarostami lovers. Perhaps the obstacles are the power of directors to be very resourceful. Australian traders (and others) can take a leaf out of their book.
