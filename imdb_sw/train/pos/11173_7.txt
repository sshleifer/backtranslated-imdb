Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are a major part of many awesome films. This, it has a lot of them. This movie was very good, only TOO predicts. And what horrible movie does the stupid people? This is the greatest and only lost victims are asking for their lives to be taken. The Semetary of the Pet I found that it was not good enough. The way everything is installed is realistic, but it is not afraid. For the most part, acting was a trusted SOMEWHAT, doubtless was insistent, but the level of entertainment was placed in a high level; My eyes were shared on the screen. All fans of Stephen King should see this film, but for anyone else, expect exciting OKAY.
