If someone else said here, every scene in this film is gem. Most movies are lucky to have one place that is perfect, but the Jewison director hits the house every time. Those got the right to take the best script, and in addition, the music settings of Dick Hyman's opera and other music carried out in full match. It's hard to imagine how they put the right mood at all of the film production. Comedy is a trick (in particular), with glass-working glass every little inflection of the story. Cher is the origin of the comedy, Vincent Gardenia (who I know more about his role in Frank Lorenzo for All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80's) deserved a stardom greater than he had, and Aiello bader bader The tip of the ice when it comes to giving udos to this great cast. Did Jewison ever write about this film? <br /> <br /> Would like to read it. It's hard to think why the average rating here on IMDb is very low ...
