Many of these viewers complain that the line of the story has already been tested. That may be so, but the addition of the author and DrSuess as the scenery makes this show should look. For adult tips in series and touch for childhood through the set, the show reminds and reinforces. The show part of the show is not the view of the local audience. The misguided plot and the love line scattered in this paradise seems to be what they see honest audience returning to more. This is a success that ABC should never allow. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, the way to strengthen the moment. Episodes 9 before the authors of the strike left the viewers want more.
