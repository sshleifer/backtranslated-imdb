Eddie Murphy really made me laugh my ass on this HBO stand comedy show. I love his comments of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "Honeymooners", Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson as well. I saw this for the first time when it happened in 1984. I laughed hard, almost fell my seat. I think this is very funny. Eddie Murphy, when he was "Saturday Night", made me laugh, he was one of the best people out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is its best position on performance near "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I offer "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up with 10/10 stars.
