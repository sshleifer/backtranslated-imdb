Why does it make an independent film? In the day and age where the latest fad of the most common hollywood is seen rugged and cutting edge, Sorry to say that the general public tends to be an independent film usually not nothing more than marketing ploy strategy. <Br /> <br /> That's why we should be glad that the film as "hate" is available. On the board, this film makes sure it contradicts its own template (a traumatic emotion). To love it or hate it, "hate" is not afraid of what it is, and in watching this film, you get the real meaning that Kallio (director) did not just make this film lose its fake blood everywhere, he is in this telling story. Good. You can find this film in the awesome movie of your video shop, but don't be disappointed, this story is also about love, about good people interfering, and that light-off end of the tunnel. If you expect a smut, or a bad evil, don't have this film. But if you make better points of fear / charges, see this film. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell made this film, and I'm sure he is proud to tell anyone that it is not "Evil". Bruce has never tried the bank on his "ash" picture, and it is obvious that he was not involved in "hate" so that he could do it either. <br /> <br /> I advise, however, for all the dead who refused to rabidly anything provided by Mr. Campbell is watching this film out and seeing what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> Acting done well, though Nothing on this film is a oscar caliber (perhaps deliberately), it is good to see compassionate displays in the awesome movie. In many cases, artists in this film have not been even tried, and "hate", it seemed like all the participants took the swine in the swine, never to use the horror film. <br /> <br /> For reviews, "hate" is about the potential as an indie film gets. The layout is very fast, the movie is good due to the budget, and "hate" continues to speed up, without any down-points or improperly impaired. For all, hatred should not overlook the look of all those of the multi-million dollars, but personally, I don't see the problem. It's a film with people who really care about the medium. People who reached the thier to break the ass bags, pulled out of the nickles and declined, threw the wind and made a beautiful film of damn. <br /> <br /> Check out this one out.
