When you see this film you begin to realize what was used under Dudley Moore last. There must be twelve films like this in our memory. It was ready to give the talent before going to Hollywood, both as a player and a musician. But more is reminded of his pairing by Peter Cook, on television and in one or two different UK movies. Perhaps the best of these was 'Bedazzled'. Always longed to be arrested by Cook, who is jealous and consistent made their cooperation and enabled Moore to realize its real potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. Moore's Clownish player as a drunkard cannot be accepted. Script fits perfectly in its manner with hilarious lots, almost surreal to agree to the conversation. There is something that Britain refers to that I am really surprised to get an appeal to the American taste. Tommy Cooper, anarchic player after the same style wanted to draw an empty. It's the most dangerous of Moore's children that are very interesting. Liza Minelli and John Guilgud are playing dancing against him, but they still have one very best liners. John Guilgud especially gives him the free and authoritative authority which is a treasure to look at. He always steals any place he says and deserves quite his Oscar. I am correct if I am wrong, but he has never played another role of comic. It is a track movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It is not found in the same level of happiness that it reaches, but it is still good. Guilgud gets only to appear as a beginning and as a spirit. It's dark. And there are some interesting soul-seeking. It will be disappointing if you look at 'Arthur' first. <br /> Hollywood looks opened in Cuddly Dudley after these two events. Finally he returned to England, was injured and apparently died. But 'Arthur' is a sample of what might be. We can only think of other great movies that he should do. <br /> <br /> You have lost it, sadly, Dudley.
