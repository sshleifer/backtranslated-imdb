The comedy which worked so wonderfully was a small British effort "Divorce Lady X (1938)". It shows the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before the little film about the uncontrolled desire in the 19th century English moors. And when Olivier and Oberon are very uncomfortable for comedyball comedy, it all goes along well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who has completed in the magazine's Logan's newspaper (Olivier) of a bad woman for a bad mist of English to prevent travel. He does everything possible to hate him - but, through spiritual things, he falls for him. And she falls for him. But the bad case of inappropriate identity occurs when Oberon's Lady X (all that comes from Oliver in the newspaper) thinks Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse, and more exciting, Mr. Mere (Ralph Richardson) is going to Olivier wishing to get a divorce from his wife whom the beloved President thinks must be Oberon! There is good conversation of war-sex, and a fun search for sex politics. You can see that Olivier is not very confident and comedy, but actually Olivier he is a fully professional, and offers. And they use the screwball direction and return, perhaps not easily, but for gusto. Oberon was not as shocked as an actor, but occasionally he was able enough, and despite their interest in the screen-off of them, he worked well with Olivier. This was done in the early Technicolor which looks very much today (everyone seems to be white than Michael Jackson), but maybe newspapers need cleaning.
