This is an amazing account of the hunt for the first Soviet Union's first killers. I had come in, expecting the movie's half-movie movie, but I found myself fascinated by the way to force the story told. If others have said, there is a lot of fun here that sadly does not exist in many multiple screens. <br /> <br /> A large loan should go to Chris Gerolmo, whose screens and mental leadership view the viewer until, until it is impossible to feel emotionally. The work and the whole cast are also very good, especially the two heads, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their proven performances give their behavior a great deal of trust, and the area that has the first meeting of the committee after Perestroika really touches. If you prefer your criminal films for a little bit and a little bit, I have suggested to look for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
