Unlimited is the way we have to reach Beauty. And sublimity is the elements of this film being done. If not the best, it is my favorite one in all the movies of Bogdanovich. This unique masterpiece reminds us, as many films from the director, what life (or must) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and love. As the song films take its head (the most popular Gershwin structure) the film makes the impossible reality, and tries to let us know that no one can judge anyone; all this with the gentleness of the comedy and the time of good direction (the first ten minutes, and the followers following women, almost without a discussion line, built on the looks and views of the characters - and that "Bogdanovich touch" according to view-view - is a class in the Cinema language, something that PB learned well from its favorite directors of the Golden Age of Movies. For the highest talent and voice of glory (including the best of "Trilogy" of Sinatra), this movie, full of personal consciousness and compassion, and far from self-esteem and vanity (as some journalists wrote), deserves the best place on the Cinema History of America than where it is installed. It's not "short-term, short on substance": it's hard in its simplicity, and good, quite good.
