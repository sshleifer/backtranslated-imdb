"Painting you see, then remember better than you saw it." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), a painter in Light Lost.The movie is in the old Hollywood style, star Ronald Colman and brarage support which includes Ida Lupino in his first important position, Dudley Digges actor (who also played by Colman in Hala.), with good performance and good actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The name and opening of the motion of the film gives them a lot of fact that Dick will lose his sight. He is swept out of a gun powder as he and a beautiful baby Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a pistol. Later the wound when fighting in Sudan is a catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by desire, and he cannot reach his full potential until his point of view is scared. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and her own damage is regulated. Lupino is very powerful in this role and removes Colman very well. His evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> You did well and well-directed, this is one of the favorite melodramas of Colman.
