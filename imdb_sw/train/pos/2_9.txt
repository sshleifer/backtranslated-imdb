Bromwell High is not a very short thing. Professional writing and full delivery, this teaching of students and teachers at the South African Public School of London leaves you with a laugh. It's vulgar, causes, bold and sharp. The characters are a large part of the British community (or more appropriate, of any community). Following the Keisha, Latrina and Natella trips, our three "defenders" wanting the best time, the show does not stop parodying every subject thinking. Political reality comes from every window. If you would like to enjoy it shows that you are not afraid to beat the joy of every subject that can be considered, then Bromwell High will not lose!
