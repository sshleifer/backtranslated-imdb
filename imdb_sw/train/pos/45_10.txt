The home room was a great movie if you ever played it in your life. It keeps you want to see more. Ask what Alicia secretly conceals. I think I watched the film 6 times in a row and never have been interesting. Plus I usually silia on the movies but this makes me cry every time. I would like to get more movies like that. All in All I thought was a great movie. The more you look at the more you become part of it. The end is the part that has found me when she cried when she gets her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt like it was just broken. And how his new friend came to comfort him when he never got. I loved her very much.
