If the filmmakers have made any attempt to establish the truth in the plot, it would be just one waste of time, money, and creative effort. Fortunately, to throw all the truth of the wind to the wind, they have created a strange comedic. Who can pass a film in which the visitor's experiment uses a whole film like Jack Nicholson, full with the Lakers shirt. Do not remove this film as trash.
