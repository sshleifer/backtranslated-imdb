This motion picture is steady, high-haunting and efficient (one of the best Chamberlain exhibitions) and stories that are revealed to us for a while. Additionally, music fully impresses and helps in maintaining a fantastic, cautious and high quality. Weir's story has been enhanced by using aboriginal, their stories and their tension with a large number of white people giving a fantasy story that is awesome. Although it is not related to stories such as kind, this has taken the same feeling in me as the "Heavenly Lathe" of Ursula Le Guin (1980). <br /> <br /> "Last End" is a great excitement and some time of horror. Remember, "spraying and cutting" did not make the film a terrible movie, it is a psychological feature of fear and fear that dwells in us all.
