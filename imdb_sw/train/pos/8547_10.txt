Many people hated this film, but I accuse them of two facts - 1 - They want to be very much like the first movie of the American Pie. and 2 - trying to take it too. What I got was the best of all six, and I love Dwight. The plan is predictable, I will say so, but what is this young man not? Road trips, Acts of Evil etc., all of them are very amazing, but it's still funny! I say this is worth watching, I love it, I get hilarious. Don't look at it when you compare it to the first because it's not right. After looking at Naked Mile with this, it became clear that all the American Pie movies were around, and just about, Stiflers. Which is FINE to me. Check out. Enjoy. Love. xD
