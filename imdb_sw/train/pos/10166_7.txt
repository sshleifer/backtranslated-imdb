I looked at this for an eight-hour trip (perhaps because of pressure and length) I found it softly (emphasis on "gentle"). The real idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her partner loves someone else, she decided to make sure they don't have one, but eventually she leaves them to do so. To sad the real film was not good. Okay, there were some laughs and all actors did well. But since the start of the plot was about prediction as the flight of the flight I had. I think a gay-but-not-gay friend of the story can be a better job. Talking talk was a good idea but to be honest: it wasn't very interesting. <br /> <br /> In the summary the film was more interesting than to appear on the front seat, but it was almost a call.
