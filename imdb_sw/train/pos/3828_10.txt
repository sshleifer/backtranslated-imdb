I would like to comment on this film. Alas, my search is always there. If any good citizen can help a bright host of this sick planet and restore his belief in humanity by providing a place where it is VHS of the UK or a copy of a VHS DVD; he could, free of charge, thank you forever ...... ... If not, I will have to restore the Gothic of Mr Russel's best in the skills that those who have seen Summer Haunted (for better or worse) have improved their pleasure of watching the events of July 1816 when I, a member of my favorite plot, remains its case alone ...
