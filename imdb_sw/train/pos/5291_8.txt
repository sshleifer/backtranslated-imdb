It has been just a week since I saw my first movie John Waters (The Trouble), and I wasn't sure to expect a second time around. <br /> <br /> When the previous film was high on top, Pecker is actually an interesting film that attacks the artists in New York by T. Anyone who cannot imagine what these "experts" are very high on of modern art, they will enjoy seeing these self-sustaining snobs on Pecker, a boy who got a broken camera and began to shoot his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was as good as Pecker. There were not many animals in any role in this film, but he shines. Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with another good performance as a partner of Pecker. In fact, it was the year of the flag for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex, and Pecker.) Lili Taylor, who had a very good role in The Haunting, was also a great part of the film and actually made it fun. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting events, but we must say the best is when the crown collects the screaming, "We want a bush!" "We want a bush!" "We want a bush!" I thought it was a Republican contract until I saw the police chasing the player. <br /> <br /> I will need to find more water work, especially Hairspray, now which is in the news.
