Jim Henson's Muppets were my dear since childhood. This film makes you feel like a child again. Okay, Muppets returns with Miss Piggy and Kermit Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on the Broadway in the music show where they are but New York City. You will see universities and mayor of New York City Ed Koch. However, the film returns to this year and I hope the children of today will learn to understand the heart of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the group is looking for him in New York City. It is worth looking at children and even adults like myself.
