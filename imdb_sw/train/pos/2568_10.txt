In this series of k-9 of K-9 act-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they have joined another investigator [Christine Tucci] and his partner , meaning Doberman called Zues who does not live with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley is not good with his new partner or either. That all changes as the movie goes. The movie is as strong as they are a guy that really wants to kill Dooley through him treated him in the past. There are some major events related to the death of Dooley's wife which does not seem to have a movie because the film is a practical procedure, a dog's joke, a fart joke, and a joke about a dog that cites bad guys in a particular area. I know that it looks like a very little humor, but some of it is very real. I haven't seen this film for joke, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a great striker of James Belushi and the second is a series of steps. James Belushi is a funnier than he was in K-9 and the order of action at is better as well. It would be nice to see more characters from K-9 return, but it's still an enjoyable movie. If you are a James Belushi striker, you will like this film.
