If any film style can be called "my pleasure", it would be this kind of fantasy of fantasy. Guilt is the wrong word for it, though, if I am glad to be a regular offender. "Stardust" is a beautiful fantasy stock, likes which one expects from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman off, as it was). It is not Mirrormask's dream, not an adult preference of the Labyrinth of the Pyramids, and not the most common love of the Princess's Princess, but it has only what the girl learns sufficiently. Wonderful lovers should be happy - the special effects of the work has finally become good and affordable enough that these items are in common production now. Stardust's story involves a young man named Tristan who, in order to find love and adoption of the most beautiful girl in their small Wall, goes to an adventure to get a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, the star of the fallen Tristan is actually a woman named Yvaine, and not the only one who seeks her ... witches have their eyes of pride on the immortality of the stars can give, and fear of the brothers on the Kingdom of magic leads the heads of murder to his leadership. From there it is anything that can be predictable, but it includes elements of fantasy, some of the definition of warmth on the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. For this explanation, DeNiro's performance is a spot-up ... not many of the many actors use to show homosexuals, but an extraordinary person from a person who seems to be an odd and common character (so a continuous joke around his character similar to DeNiro himself opens in other types of acting). DeNiro was not unique to his own photos since Brazil, and that says something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a kind of film, perhaps, which will continue to children's shelves and fantasy-lover. I can't say it gives anything new, but it's not really there. It is true those who are well-known and spoil that will be most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
