I have read some reviews and get some of that comparison with a real video video (for example it takes to get into music music), Britney Bashing, etc., then let's take a look at the movie and the message. <Br /> <br /> I found this movie between 10 out of 10 to 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. By the male male average .... 2 out of 10. <br /> I love pop / rock music, I am 45. I know Britney Spears but never know she really sang Stronger until I read credit and these comments. I didn't recognize his poster on the wall so I wasn't worried about any 'promotion'. <br /> <br /> I'm watching movies to have fun. I don't care about throwing, lights, manufacturers, directors, etc.. What is the film and it attracts me. I watched this film for messages. The great world crisis is a low self-esteem (which is another whole story) to look at the message in the mind, for that is the area of ​​interest. The movie is lighter, bright and breathing, good for children. I found the tan of Texan began to disappear in the movies and of course there are so many ways to submit a stop / do not stop the message, so yes, it was a little predictable. The greatest message even ... must be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie of the family, but for a bloke looking at yourself, getting Hannibal.
