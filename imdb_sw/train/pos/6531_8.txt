I loved this film very well. I enjoyed it, but if you don't, that's your fault. Emma Roberts played well Nancy Drew, although she is not like books. The old fashion items are hard when you see them in modern times, but they seem to be good. For me, wealthy girls had no clothes that made them rich. I mean, it seems like they got all the clothes-fitted to the sale of the garage and just decided to put them all together. All the clothes were made, especially when they wore cotton clothes and their usual clothes. I don't want to make the movie look bad, because it is definitely not! Just go to the theater and watch !!! You will enjoy it!
