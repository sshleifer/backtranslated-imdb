This great movie has failed to register higher than 5! Why not! It is a beautiful picture of the life of Christ without the terrible feelings of the Passion of Christ. John Cash did great things for God that would be shocked and stopped in places where they should focus more, like our churches. The film itself took less than a month to film as Johnny saw the great presence of God leading him that way. A great loan for everyone involved in this trustworthy film that will always be appreciated by its fans. Of course, Billy Graham's meeting found that it was enough to use it as a major source of education for new Christians.Thanks Fox for producing that. .Movies are not available through voting as this production shows! In summary I believe that this film is one of the greatest documents of the world as it is quite clear, shown with great faith and great witness to the Christian faith!
