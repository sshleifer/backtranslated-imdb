People who produced this beautiful film have done a good service with a novel that stands as perhaps the best false work that focuses on human crimes and humanitarianism published. Nolte plays the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and does his own, remaining with the Vonnegut show of a person who has lost ALL (by and) to Love. <br /> <br /> There are no weaknesses in this good review.
