This film needs to be seen. The worst picture of what is going on in the world that I have seen since Darwin's dream. Go see! and if you are fortunate to open your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of DVD. Writing is bright and the direction is sufficient for the ideas to come through, although it is very difficult. Joan Cusack is amazing, and all others are thrown out is also good. It is an inspiration that John Cusack got this movie, and, I believe, had his own money. It is a wild, non-existent, non-existent, non-existent tourism resource, but still succeeding. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher did not show guts to say what this film says.
