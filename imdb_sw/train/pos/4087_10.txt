I must say, I thought I saw it all. I am buff of the movie very jaded. This movie has not stopped me, in any way. I am a way ago. But it took me to some emotional places that I did not know I could go. I had no idea that I could get (ick) the idea of ​​political tolerance. Never suddenly. Forever. Forever. But there you go. He did it. I should give the credit provider. He was struggling. For the first 40 minutes this movie is TOTAL produced. We start with a clear picture of two sexually active horses. After five minutes of this I started to ask myself whether to buy this movie is not an error. Then an old man in a wheelchair conversation with another old man about two people getting married. Then some cheek of the guy's worries. Then we see (in short) the hot chick to get it with the player (but this is too short). At this point I was cursing the movie loudly while trying to stay awake. In fact, I slept on a 40-minute mark and forced to finish the next night. Finally you get good things when a girl (who knows who, or who is in this film) has a dream about the gal of Victoriano's ruined by an animal in the forest. The area is going for a long time and is meat (heh-heh) of the whole program. Well shot, well changed, and offers products. They are trying to connect the plot at the end and it's kind of meaning but not kind. Oh well. I would like to recommend this film. The first 40 minutes made me like to shoot myself (and my TV) but the last 50 minutes bring it completely back.
