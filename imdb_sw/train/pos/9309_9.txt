Dear God where I start. this is a bar no better film I've ever seen. The camera alarm is good but in my opinion acting was better. why the script scripts of this movie do not write great movies of the budget I can understand. another is thrown. it's good. this is the best movie ted rimi out there for sure. I know some of you out there probably think "no way he has better" but no mistakes. The island of raptor is a work of art. I hope you have goten the best movie of the year instead of crash movie Crash and a group of no names with no raptors. I believe this movie is absolutely amazing.
