Before the film as 'The Chainsaw of Texas', 'Suspiria', and 'Halloween' changed the fear of eternity, there was a more Gothic era and very little time in that kind. Films as a series of Hammer Horror and 'Baby's Rosemary' were scared by happy audience over the past 60 years and 70s. I can't tell you how often I planned this film during my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not need to adopt the slasher films and the zombies of the 70 and 80 years and the film as this production from the famous, but sadly for a long time Amicus film company was a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: Great music, music. Good performances from the cast of stellar. Movie theaters. Very interesting and old attractions, especially in the first and last vignettes. Sometimes the haunting and pictures. It goes faster, but faster. The house is one spoon, headquarters. Design a massive production and decorative design, which gives the film of the old Gothic feeling of feel. Much depends on the feeling of cold and cold than on the gore and provides free for exciting. Cons: Continued issues for the first half. In addition to 'Clothes,' all stories feel like they have been done before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, 'Waxworks,' has a good acting and it is time, but it is the fourth most powerful for the issue of fear and suspension. Low budget shows regularly. Last thought: After seeing this film for the first time for many years I can see why I used it many times. It is not a jewel in any way, but it is a good example of the time when terrible films were made in style and class. Look at this with remote lights. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
