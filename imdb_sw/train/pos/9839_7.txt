Hmmm, this is the place that has been hit down. Though there is a LOT of bad writing and acting in part. I think the most beautiful of evil success. <br /> <br /> I love origami parts and 'misleading' at the end. I love it very much when Michelle fights Tony. In fact it is one of my favorite episodes of Season 1. For some reason, people have always reluctantly reincarnation events, but I still loved them. They are the best, for writing. but the theme really attracted me, <br /> <br /> I will give you three stars, but if the text was more consistent I would like to give four.
