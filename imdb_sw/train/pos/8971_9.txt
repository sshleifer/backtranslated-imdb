In general, I am not a big fan of motion-stop movies and the first RUKA didn't care for him. However, knowing that this film was made in the oppressive Tzecoslovakia during the Soviet era, and more I watched the film, more I realized how the film of this innocent film. This course made the film live and gives you the power to stay real as a work of art and political information. <br /> <br /> A small sad film has been made without any conversation, but it is quite clear what is happening. A good wooden man makes a pot of clay and has a good time when suddenly an emerging hand appears to appear and destroy the pot - making it an image of a hand instead. Yes, a timber man tries again and repeats his hand and does his own thing. However, over time the hand stays more and ultimately eventually intervenes. And, at the end, that person has died thanks to the hand of the hand and hand, with a sign of true hypocrisy, gives the funeral funeral! As I have said, this film is an obvious attempt by Jir√≠ Trnka who is brave to meet his government's authority. Not surprisingly, though the Czech people loved the film and made it the main character, the state (ie, hand) prevented this little image. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his nation opened for more than two decades later when it was called "Velvet Revolution".
