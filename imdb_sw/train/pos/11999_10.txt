I have seen this amazing production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the technician's wife - I don't know the name of his character. I went to BYU with him and lost touch and he-named maid was Kim Luke-and I wonder if anyone has any information about it. He is not on the credit list. This production was excellent, the tears player on all accounts, doing the best for all. I think I don't even want to put it in the general 'act' category, more like 'show and hear the amazing events that caused the opening of heaven to this last state' ..... something like that. If anyone works with Kim or has a website or something please let me know !!! He was wonderful in his role, by the way ... Thanksgiving, Melissa Thorne
