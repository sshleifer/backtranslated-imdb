Back in 74 Eric Monte made a classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker has always appeared to be a star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos often felt a little jealous of the popularity of Jimmie Walker to win millions of fans while sitting and watching the Best Times. The show would have died as JJ did not want to have to save his habit of Kool constantly. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I had 3 when you left and 8 was finished. Instead of 1974-1979 it must go as the 1980s when I grew up.
