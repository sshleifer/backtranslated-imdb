This movie is one of the all-time visitors. I paid 10 rating. The story is of the famous 'Bushwhackers' from Missouri which fought in the South during war between countries. Clothes dressed were real, history and why they fought it very accurate and well researched. There was one true war that was not done as it showed ... but it's not bad for Hollywood. Employees were well healed and would be the most brilliant characters or director really knows how to get better from them. I witnessed it was a good combination of good, making super get the right people and doing good for the executives. Not only one or two ... this film has been hurt! It has actions, romance, doubts, good people and bad people (sometimes depending on your personal opinion) and all history has entered the same film. It even has Spiderman and Jewel of the future. And she is good!
