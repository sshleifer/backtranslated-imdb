New York City Player Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and is fast growing; as the film opens, the recent play for Mr. Caine climbs Broadway. The viewers of the TV love Caine, and she eats. Through Long Island Railway Caine in Montauk, instead of its residence in East Hampton. When he finally arrived home, Caine is comforted by the highly recommended wife Dyan Cannon (like Myra), unfortunately a serious heart attack. There, Caine and Mrs Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap", written by Christopher Reeve's younger boy (like Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of the former Caine students. They believe Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is a hit required to revive the work of Caine. "The Trap has been set?" Guided by Sidney Lumet, the long fall of the Runway of Ira Levin has not lost its original nature. Release is enjoyable and twist stories still considering. One thing that did not work (for me) was a call for a living curtain; indeed, it played well in action. "Deathtrap" is a fun film to watch again; The exhibition has died - but, in a hurry, greeting Reeve offers Caine at the East Hampton train station must be easy to describe "Hello." The area is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look the same. And, ballyhooed love area is amazing tepid. But, play was good, "even the talented director could not destroy." And, Mr. Lumet does not break down. Deadly Death (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
