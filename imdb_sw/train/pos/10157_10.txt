This is a look for gospel entertainment as presented by Johnny Cash (decorated with black color, of course) who sings too much and narrates too. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is very interesting. Also look at the example of Jesus' blonde in this work ... for fun, try to think about five Jewish men who have blonde hair ...? However, to present the fun of the main and most important story of all.
