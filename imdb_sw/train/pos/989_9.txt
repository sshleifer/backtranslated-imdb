All my friends and I think this movie was done well. We expected a comedy of a bright heart but we got a full movie of action and comic bushes. We all thought that this film may not have done well in the box office as a preview leads us to believe it is a comedy. I was fascinated by supporters who supported and undoubtedly Dave Morse always keeps a strong job. Most of the wounds are veterans are not the first time and they were stable. We all felt that the text and direction were the first level and commented on each other about buying this movie. If you do not buy rent for a good time.
