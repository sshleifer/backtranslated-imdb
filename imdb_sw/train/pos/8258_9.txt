At the risk of shouting a little, by looking at me first I am a kind of relying on this right to parallel with 'Shaun's dead'. Now, thanks to Simon Pegg as a wonderful view of comedy, I realize this is a rather substantial claim. And how much you agree with that last statement may be the first test as 'Fido' will get an appeal. Through comedy takes place where 'Shaun' is closed, unless we refer to the origin of the 1950s of the Middle Ages of the Middle Ages in Central America. The Zombie War is over and the zombies themselves are changing well, important members of the community. This, so we are told at the outset, in particular we appreciate the scientific advances made by good people at Zomcom - play well on romantic comedy perhaps? The beauty of the film is in the background of the neighborhoods to maintain basic values ​​when you make the place zombies and the unique risks that make it. Charm and equality which makes this is almost enough perfect. The themes you can expect from the most comedy of the incoming kitsch - through clean living, focus on presentations, feelings of oppression, parental values, social beauty and the left-out problem. A heartwarming story of a happy heart and full appeal that brings life to the full and the most powerful film. It's one of those functions where it shows through that everyone involved has found a kick to take part. It is also fun to pretend what Billy Connelly learned his script should be like ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is possible to enjoy the fun of this film unless your father tried to eat it.
