This film brings many memories of old movies, where artists did not need to take their clothes so that the audience could watch their films. Firstly I think the main part of this film is an amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it is obviously made to the film. I have seen many comments about the film being sweet and very difficult. In response to this, I think to some extent this is an accurate analysis, however considering this is the film Barjatya I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, has been toned very low. HSSH was about to fail to watch somewhere. In this film however, when the exciting time comes, you find yourself shouting, you want a budding couple to be better and expect there is nothing wrong happening to them / something / something. with the Shahid and Amrita presentations. They all did very well, especially the Shahid who appears to be popular in the film. Amrita looks just amazing and should be taken seriously as a great future star. Although I was very excited about the film, I feel it was too long. Some in the middle can be reduced and perhaps could be made more. Also I think the music, although it is suitable for the film when you see the situation is old and the movie could benefit if the voice of the top voice so far has been found. Although picturisation of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. <br /> <br /> For all, I totally recommend this film, romantic, looks wonderful and has an amazing peak (I am not going into details, just if you haven't seen it.) you are ready to sit-pick tissue!
