Gundam Wing is a fun show. Thank you for getting me on Gundam and anime in general. However, after looking at its predecessors, such as the Suit Gundam Mobile, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I see Wing to be Gundam Lite. <br /> Characters: The long-held feature of Gundam is having their characters get into trouble and grow in maturity. This does not happen in the Wing. Heero is the top dog at the beginning, and he is the highest dog at the end. Personally does not change, growth is never found. The best character is Zechs, who is with all the intent and purpose of the hero in many series. But suddenly the series pours the battery and turns it into man because there is no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: The wing has good suit suits. Gundams are super cool, and Epyon to be my favorite. I even think of a couple of OZ suits designs that are compatible with Zeon's usual suits. But sweet suit suits do not always keep the series from stimulating characters. Conclusion: Finally, the wing has pictures of cold fighting, although it is full of modified fingers, but the development of the plot and character development. It is interesting, but it will not move like the previous Gundam.
