He-he-hello !! This is a very fun movie. Basically, in Girl Girl, you have your fun-lovin ', free, early to New Yorker's 90's player. With his friends' friends, he meets a mature Turkish supplier. It is an old age story for new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It's a comfort to see a female slacker to develop that mature woman. Hope has been given us all the slackers who can feel like their only skills they can maintain during the hammer and trophies by throwing parties better. <br /> <br /> For a side note, Parker Posey makes this film beautiful. I've never been a big fan of him, but this film just makes me want to watch all his movies. There are subtleties that have defined his character. If you want a good laugh and when you have fun, make sure you watch this film. Regular displays are necessary.
