This was necessary to see the document for me when I missed the opportunity for 2004, so I would be looking at it again. I was very sympathetic to the main character of the film, because, this is true, I have the worst case of the skin problem, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a traumatic pain, sometimes sad and emotional about a young man with a serious skin disease. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (because of the loss of sound muscles) and never comes to pregnancy, but is 36 years old. Jonny had a very bad feeling of humor, even narrated from the outside of the grave while showing his body in the coffin. He says his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, a big brother and a wonderful style, and Jonny's assistant, Nell McAndrew. Achieved BAFTA for the Best Editor and Best Director (Truth), and was chosen for Best Sound (True) and the Prize of Flaherty. It was the 10th number on the 100 Great TV Battle over 2004. You must see the document!
