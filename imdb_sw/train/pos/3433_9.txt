I first saw this in a foreign film festival. It is a nail nail that is beautiful on a plan to eliminate the treasures of a billion billion or so with gold. All have been shot, the grainy style which Hollywood does not use often - but it attracts the status of the new Baltic states of beauty (note: Tallin was actually a little too little in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There's a lot of humor and some romance, too. I do not want to destroy this amazing but logical surprise, so I will just say this heist film begins from the big script, and the leadership and performances are high scores. FUNCTIONS IN TALLIN is a very fast and brave model of its kind --- I would like to put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and miles ahead of the 11th month of OCEAN, though (deliberately) not as green. Buy or create it now.
