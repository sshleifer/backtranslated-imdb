Wow, I forgot how this film was great even when I danced when I was looking through the garage. It is a kind of wonderful mix of bio's Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and stories about fighting a great hero to save young children. Vignettes are good (especially the speed of Demon), but the best part of this movie is a part of the hero, which Michael Jackson returns to be a car, robot, and finally it's a spaceship (and it's as wonderful as it looks). Joe Pesci is a hilarious, and has enough pictures of beautiful and beautiful music around! The true truth is however a wonderful video of "Smooth Criminal", which makes the movie own for the same place!
