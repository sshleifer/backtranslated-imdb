I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley Festival Festival and I voted for the best pictures. Justine Priestley is hot as a psychotic ampress, but it's complex. This is not your usual psychological movie. Many interesting and natural pieces of type. The "Death Street" type for young people placed by blues mixed mixed by that of Amanda's favorite thing is marrying the top performer and who comes with blues who has little time for her husband as her job takes. <br /> <br />
