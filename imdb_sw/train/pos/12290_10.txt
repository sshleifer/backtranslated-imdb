Hotel Du Nord is a fascinating game of guilt where Marcel Carne showed the story of the rough love-love which also works as a rebellion against a cruel world. The film is entirely dependent on a number of innocent lovers. Pierre and Renee were mistaken when they believed that the injury had ended their misery. Hotel Du Nord has its useless charm as its residents have become an integral part of the establishment. There is an integration feature for each group for Hotel Du Nord to eat, talking etc. Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of film produced in the 30th and 40th years as the Hotel Du Nord has some kind of political feeling. During the rehabilitation of Parisiani roads, it created a form of nostalgia of black and white people to provide a unique genre of poetic reality to its oeuvre. of Saint Martin canal remains a massive mass.The movie im popularity of people can be judged due to the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared as a national session.
