I can't remember the name of this show. I am looking at it when I am eight years old. It was the best show for me. From what I remember about it, it's still great. This showed star Lucas Black making him the first boy I ever lost. I am from that country, so compassionate boys have no appeal to me, but for him I would certainly have discrimination. Which after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Lights Friday night, and Tokyo Drift should see what. He is a good actor and has been since he was a child. I am with this show and want it to return. If anyone has ever seen where they sell the season please please email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
