Unusual Couple is a gem of comic. One of the funniest script ever dedicated to celluloid - just exceeded by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: obsidi to force Felix and Oscar, responsible. Oscar's wife is standing ready because she cannot live because of her irresponsible view. Felix's wife left him at the start of the movie, and after an attempt to commit suicide he came in with Oscar poker friends. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and filled with single brilliant towers. You probably already learned "F.U." shock but still work carefully from the time of the Comtau Comta. My favorite time is when Lemmon tries to cancel its sinus at dinner and when the Pigeon sisters are beaten by Matthau very much and Lemmon is completely out of its feature. This requires feedback to repeat!
