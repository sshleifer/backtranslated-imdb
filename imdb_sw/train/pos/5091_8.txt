Look at both parts twice. He was delighted with the story and enjoyed seeing Patrick Swayze as an old man. He believed as much as Alan Quartermaine hunters and was certainly better for the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I agree that I would like to see someone else like "Lady in Disappointment". Alison Doody should stick to slices of modern and not intervals. He did not look for a woman in the 1800s. Some of the cast were severe and followed such plans very well. I am glad to see that the generation of this generation are not afraid to try for different characters and they are not afraid to look like they grow up. Age cannot be avoided, but let's not reach. A 50-year-old man can be very sexier (and, Patrick really is sexy) then young green, no matter how good. Hoorah to the lines of behavior to go along with a nice smile.
