I need to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was a general, offensive, hilarious, and powerful. Well, there is so much humor to all the tastes. If you are in a humorous situation that is involved in declaring people falling from skateboards, for example you will have a good time for it. Or, if you like to enjoy people in many acts of fighting to get worse, you will have a good time. And if you are interested in scatological humor and bad conditions, you will enjoy the show. I enjoy all three types of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" provides. I would like to have a hard laughter and show situations. "Jackass" is like walking in stocks compared to this. So if you are tired of a common American stupidity of Jackass, try the extreme English ignorance on this show. With all respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has a little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily or easily lost. <br /> <br /> Now, these need to see a psychologist. Especially Paco character.
