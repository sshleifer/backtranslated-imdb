I went to see Sky's Vanilla and great, big, big! .. Tom Cruise's fan, my stupid friend and my partner ... what I can say. I was hit by a movie and especially TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving film and not all I expected. I was reading a review and I decided to go to see it, I am so happy to be 'forced' to see it. Strangely I can't say why, all that I can say is that I have been totally involved and cannot stop thinking about it the next day. About what I felt about the film, all I can say is, NO STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) is about people and events that make their lives and how small events, like getting into a car can change everything ...... <br> /> <br /> Why the critics wrote, yes perhaps it was the original film of Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a completely different translation of the subject, and for no reference to narcissistic for Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even imagine writing a few lines, of glib describing the film just to go and see it! I do know this is not a sensitivity but it is not what kind of film.
