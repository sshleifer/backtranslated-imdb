I chose to see this film the day that was opened in French, as a personal way to reflect on what happened last year; The collection works as planned: causes a tornado of thought and emotions, working as a respect for the mind, never stooping to a cheap feeling or responding to the knees. There have been many claims made that the film is anti-american: when I can't talk to everyone in this regard, I am one of the Americans who got the information that was not true. people make a lot of noise on the part of Egypt, and the Chahine, because the sound of a Palestinian suicide bombing claims that citizens in democracy are "justice goals" because they elect governments that bombs want to attack, but this refuses further in the piece : Several discussions have been discussed, no one has been imprisoned as truth, and critics - if they have seen a piece - they seem to forget the fun and warm dialogue between the director and the spirit of the American talks, and the great surprise of the director on the hearing of the catastrophe. Too many films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, especially the brilliant work with Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, as good as usual, effectively explains the true story of the injustice committed against the Muslim family after the anti-Islamic hysteria that has opened - and still dies - states. I saw a large piece of Gitai and a few in the media criticism of the terrorist, and a piece of Penn was very interesting and interesting for my taste, although I expected to love it. The ban is very good and it works in it. USER EXPORTER: One inspector under the accuracy of the collapse of towers as a time of happiness for character; My reading is rather that the fall of towers is, because light climbs his room, opens in a loss in his life that he refused to recognize. and this is a kind of beautiful piece, because we know that if the towers blocked the light of this man, then there would be nothing but smoke and ashes, not light, flooding through his window.
