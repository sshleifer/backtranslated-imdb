How this has never been a religious film I do not know. I think it has been disturbed to be angry as a real comedy! The attempt to run away from an effort to get off as a quick excitement, but take the quality of action (good God is bad), story story, demon possession actions and child rescue car in The account is nothing that you can do but laugh. And laugh will be. The films are made to please us, and the degree to do so may be a sign of the value of the film. This film is a priority in entertainment, I cut the beginning to the end. One time I got a short breath and almost sparked it, it's really funny at some point. When the child was being removed out of the sunroof in a holdall with a helicopter and a robot experiment who managed to maintain a constant speed similar to a car with a full plane of a flat flat which meant a hook of a pig did not break the car's car pieces, I was very surprised. But when the child began to move around in the air, almost fell the bridge and almost collapsed on the tree, the tears had fallen down my face. It also happened to me that the black soldier was a guy who played Jesus in the video of "Like A Prayer" of Madonna. He seems to get everywhere.
