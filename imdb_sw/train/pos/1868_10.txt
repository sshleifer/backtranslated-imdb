This movie describes the life of a man who grew up in a bad environment but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a decent man. What's more is that this is a true story. Antoni Fisher is innocent and still was treated as just because he was not white. Antony Fisher is married to the same women for ten years and had no fraud around women, coke, cigarettes, weeds, alcohol, or any of the things that are well-known in the areas he grew up. Nothing more to say about this film is better. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
