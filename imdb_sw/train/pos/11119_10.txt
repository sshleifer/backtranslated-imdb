There are many reasons why I rate so much sopranos, one of his great victories being a cast and character building. Each character continues more and more every series. Also every series has a list of 'small characters' as well as main. A good example of character (who was only in three periods) that you can feel is David playing gambling carefully with Robert Patrick. The details of everything build a full series of TV. The show refers to a member of the circle of people Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his life of crime with his role as a father of two. The show is not afraid to have the courage and strength and conversation with the picture and this is what makes it so reliable. When Tony runs things with Paulie capos (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) wants to promote. Each part also has a family of Tony somehow that includes his children and his wife carmela soprano (Edie Falco). On these problems is his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) tries to get what he can from Tony's business despite the arrest of the house. All actors are powerful and complex characters, but the two who are coming out more are; James Gandolfini who 'is' Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger generation (20-30) in crime. If David Chase did not create this modern modern television festival that may not exist, like Wire and Dexter. So Sopranos is obviously God, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of the TV
