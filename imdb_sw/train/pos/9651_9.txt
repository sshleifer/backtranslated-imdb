What was seen for the first time was another French flick assisted not more than having a strong feeling for me, for a second look, a real and quite satisfactory presentation. Cedric; he apparently didn't know what struck him. Poor listeners; we first met in what seemed like a beautiful and romantic story just led to the return of the darkness of the uneven. These two did not only possess it from meeting them for the first time. Like Mathieu and Cedric were engaging in sex, the absence of emotional emotion was not possible by Mathieu, a man of intelligence, to find kindness in sharing life with someone whose minds were more concerned with drama and finishing on the beach. <br /> <br /> For technical information, I liked camera action in this film. The theme is not completely needed, although my French "certainly." I could look again without translating into English and enjoying it even more. This was a photographed, very professional image. Although many events seem to be trivial, I beat nine out of ten.
