When the actor should play the role of the actor, false or true, the task becomes more difficult than playing the role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman found himself as Anthony John, a double stability. He put in his character all his talents and honesty. The face, character, gait and position spoke well for what Anthony John was going through during Othello's play. Coleman also did very well as Shakespearean actor in short events like Othello which was part of this movie gem. The revelation of Coleman's face as Othello suffered and doubts about the credibility of Desdemona were within the scenes of a look at the look. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr.. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, unless this role was twice as serious and hurtful. Shelly Winters seemed to be sweet, dangerous and pleasant at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman loved his role in this film on all others played with him winning Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would like to see this movie regularly and never feel bored.
