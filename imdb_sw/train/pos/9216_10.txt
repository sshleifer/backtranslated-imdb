Mjinga, Mjinga, Mjinga. I think Angelina Jolie is probably the most talented actor today, but this film is not just the value of her time. He deserves more, and so everyone else in this movie. Talent is just passing. Sorry, but I don't feel like writing this review. <br /> <br /> I offer NO star out of *****.
