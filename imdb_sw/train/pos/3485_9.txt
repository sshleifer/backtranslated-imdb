This Wrestlemania did not just do it for me. While other things, like the royal war and the involvement of the celebrations were to lose good old days, therefore, it seemed to be the top of "Your House" than anything else. More than the average ... the value of several matches as a team team match, although it is worth recognizing that the head change did not have any meaning, as it was changed the next night.
