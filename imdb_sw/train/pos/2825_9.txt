This film was quite a surprise. I didn't have much hope, to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood film? So? Probably something wrong with a hand-wrestling hand and moving face to which the silent films show most of the time. Yes, I am wrong. Greta Garbo should shock the studio as he did me, because this film has made him a star, and so it should. He usually understood only the power of standing, or simply meaning for a long time, so that his effect could feel and not just appear. I continued to think about myself, how did the modern actress get into silent silent film? He was only years and years before his time. <br /> <br /> Stories are not all interesting, it's a common story of love found and lost. It's just Garbo's performance as Leonora, a small village village that does well in a big city and then comes back to find someone who has left, gives them life. Star-star Ricardo Cortez can be used, but his character has never been developed and thrown by the script around. One time she dressed in Garbo dresses, leave in the huff, then come back suddenly and give it again. And let's not talk about his terrible events with Garbo and then his wife. The most common way, he did not have much work after this and I can understand why. But he is just like something fun of Leonora's disease. There is one very strange line in this film that says all. "Leonora, you become clear." Yes, quite clear. If you want to know exactly what it is without seeing the entire film, see the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo view sitting alone in her luxury car says everything. "He should be very happy, he has everything he wants" - yes, Garbo's face says all about it. I see this again, Garbo is just amazing.
