I enjoyed this film as a little child. At that age I thought that the antics of silly baseball were funny and that the movie was "cool" because it was on sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what the well-planned movie was. This movie opened my eyes as a little child to other children's disputes dealt with the real world. Such a large-scale approach is not in children's movies these days that I don't think is the benefit of our society. Certainly antics of baseball appear to be dumb now, but they motivated children. No seven-year-olds will ask to see movies about babies, but they will ask to see a film about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children a valuable lesson about the world. As an adult, the performance of Al and other angels seems to be very unimportant, however they will give credit to the actors to play all the children with Danny Glover who all performed a wonderful job.
