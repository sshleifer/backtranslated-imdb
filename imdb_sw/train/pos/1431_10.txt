This is just an amazing movie that you will ever see. I thought it was just another document, but it's something else. It doesn't try to teach anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I won't say about the quality of the image, because you are obviously from other views not compared. The world is beautiful, timely and sad. It may laugh, it can grow. Sometimes all at the same time. That's the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel animals, but because you come to realize how our planet was fragile and what treasure we were blessed, but we don't like one thing. <Br /> <br /> This movie should be displayed in school. It's the most amazing film you will ever see, so go see it. Who knows, maybe it's the last time we can see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would like to measure it more easily if possible.
