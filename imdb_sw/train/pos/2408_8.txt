Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ and had trouble with gory violence would like to see this film instead. Although it was not successful in the box office of a bicycle or TV, The Fox Movie Channel still finds good intentions to show this to everywhere. I loved the way they taught Chris Sarandon and the men who chose his students to sing in Hebrews. However, Sarandon did not have long hair like any other Jesus would be in the other film, his appearance was so close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised or bothered me was the place where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Although it may not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like a garbage in front of the famous people of those days. David's Story ". But compared to his image of Pilate and Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he built a well-sketch of the Roman emperor.
