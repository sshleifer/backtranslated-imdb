Any movie that shows the PIG federation (People in the Government) that the threats of power that are in real life have a lot to suggest. <br /> <br /> Alas, the script management and editing and even, from time to time, lead is an error in order that there will be people who will resist the whole movie and ignore the good time. I saw the original way back if it was new and hated, despised, hated. He thought it was a horrible piece, a bad junk. Now, however, I didn't remember why. I believe these two should not be comparable or even connected. Think about two different films. <br /> <br /> Make them like two different films. This "Point of Destruction" provides an opportunity to integrate, banner for people who want to promote self-interest, who believe human rights, who know the threat to government's independence may be particularly, federal government. "Voice" carries a new hat state of New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." At one time it would be the motto of many Americans. <br /> <br /> With its clear errors, "Vanishing Point" is a fun film.
