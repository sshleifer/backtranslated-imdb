Clean the film directed to the family. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I couldn't see Steve Carrell like anything but Michael liked from the Office. Boy, I was not wrong. He should win Oscar for his performance. I will surely buy this on the DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he is not on the "kind" movies. I saw two other people at the age of 30 and we all agreed that it was a good movie we have seen for a long time and it is really clean. Just 1 cuss word! He doesn't even know why it was PG13. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, concert, romance and more!
