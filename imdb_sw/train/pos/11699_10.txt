I've seen this film twelve times and it's amazing. But the only thing and that was that at first, there was much discussion about who was going with. I think that would be interesting to make his remake. But on the official website, they said they will not have a restructuring because many people have found safety while looking at it. What even happened to Patty Dunning now? He is a very good actor. He has made several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we have not heard from him since. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting in RD Movies. But in general, I must say that the series itself is like left to fail the old school.
