I loved this film. When a boy in the bank with $ 40 million in gold dies, his cell mate is used as a "Bait" to lead a high-end madman (with a monitoring device put in his jaw without his knowledge). It is a step, a kind of spy type and enough drama events to put it light. Reminds me of the Enemy of the Country. Good work and good plot.
