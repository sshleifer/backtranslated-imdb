Saying this film is a Catholic spirit and a false fiction of history is not true. That's not this film. What this film is about the Church's infringement (though this can be changed to any dynamic body), the ways in which this abuse affects people and families and the way many people choose to allow and often engage abuse without thinking of themselves. The fact that it is a Catholic church that is wrong is because the origin of the true story of the film depends. This writing as a propaganda against Catholics seems to lack the truth about the Catholic Church that sometimes did; Its history is often not great and it is something that the film like this shows and which needs to be mentioned. Yes we should comment on violations made by other organizations but not the removal of this film. It is a wonderful film that has brought me tears and worth looking - 'if we can't learn past, we must repeat it'
