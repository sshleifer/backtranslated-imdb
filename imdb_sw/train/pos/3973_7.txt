This is the "history" of the FBI's entertainment, but it should look like a lie, because that's exactly what. What else could be when J. Edgar Hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in production. James Stewart is the best, as usual, and supported by hand, except for Vera Miles inability, it's good. Murray Hamilton is very good in the role of helping as Stewart's partner and best friend. The success of the FBI which highlights the film is certainly all true. What is the most important thing that comes from. One of the most embarrassing films of the film is the example of John Dillinger's murder. It is very displayed as it was done, but no mention of it is all of Melvin Purvis, the Head of Chicago's Office who led the work. Instead, the operation is shown as false chip chips were operating it. It said that Hoover was jealous of that the Purvis got after Dillinger killed; Purvis was sent to a remote station, and later after the FBI left. This is no doubt why Purvis has never been mentioned in the film. But the viewer, at least, stopped to think that if Purvis was treated like this, is it about all the agents who did all the other activities shown in the film. They were also completely ignored and replaced by false deception. The film can be appropriate in its FBI activity to the end of WWII. However, after that action, the film would have us believe that the only threat faced by the United States came from the Communist, which is undoubtedly what Hoover believed. Never worry about the Mafia. Never worry about lynchings that still continues South. Do not worry that the whites were feared to keep them from voting in many parts of the South. I don't know if the FBI began to connect Martin Luther King's wire when the film was made, but if not, it wasn't too long after it started. <br /> <br /> As I said in the beginning, this is a good entertainment, but it should be seen as a conversion of cleanliness which is.
