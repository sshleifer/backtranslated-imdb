Frequent tests are often the main fault. It often comes to look like a film camera was placed only on stage (such as "Mother of the Night"). Sidney Lumet's direction puts a live film, which is very difficult since the picture did not come out with real challenges. Still, it is advisable to look at why. Chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship are amazing. Caine is as strange as always, and Reeve gets one of his few acting positions. I agree that I've never seen Ira Levin's game, but feel that the change of Jay Presson Allen is honest. The script has been greatly added, and lets you think. "Deathtrap" is a great film of entertainment, and it is recommended for almost all stage action and screens. 7.4 out of 10
