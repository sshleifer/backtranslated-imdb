First I would like to say that I didn't like the fact that Rock got a name that has homosexuals. Next I feel Regal must have his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy field. Rob Van Dam had an Intercontinental name for a long time Brock had to win. I am interested in the storm and the Christian being an advertising attack, the best match was the Book T and the Big Show in my opinion.
