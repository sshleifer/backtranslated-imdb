Some of the best movies that are community as "comedies" really emerge between comedy and game. "Student" and "Butch Cassidy and Little Sundance", which were also made in the late 1960s are perfect examples. What? Is the salary with amazing tips, or the most humorous dramas? In many ways, "The Odd Couple" comes in that kind of being comedy but very much with deep underpinnings on human nature. Much of what is happening may be of the audience to the audience but the characters did not laugh. Even though the television show of the 1970s, the original "Unusual" couple is not only about a good person and a dirty person who are forced to live together because of their marital status. . It is true about two opposers who have to deal with why their marriage has fallen and how their idiosyncrasies are exposed to themselves outside their marriage. The beauty, the character of Felix Ungar (Jack Lemon is fully beaten) and the worst, the character of Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau), is just beginning and to some extent. As the story opens, we see there is more to these men than just beauty and deception. In short, the story is true about Felix Ungar, who will face a close divorce from his wife Francis, whom we do not meet but is an important character in the story. Next to suicide, Ungar goes to the only place he knows: the house of Oscar Madison where a group of friends of poker is always dependent. We learn that Ungar is not just a member of this "poker club" but the group knows what is happening to him and trying, in the wrong way, to help. Madison shows the best way to help Ungar is to allow him to come in until his selfish desires are exhausted. Unfortunately for Madison, he does not know what he enters himself. Madison doesn't care about the fun-going-luck if the slob instead of the role of the fridge whose refrigerator was last cleaned while Herbert Hoover was still in the White House. The idea of ​​Madison's serving snack is to grab the moldy cheese and strengthen between two pieces of bread, and then throw the contents of the chips package on the table. On the other hand, she enjoys booze with women, for a short time having a good time. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is not only a neat neat smarter that finds more happiness in removing an apartment than meeting women but knows more than many women do about cooking and eating well. At one time, he calls his ex-wife, not talking about the merger, but to get a recipe for his diet. Sometimes, Ungar wanted to use cabbage cutting for evening to coleslaw. When Madison seems to be unable to hold, Ungar finally confesses that he was only doing for someone sitting with him because he can't stand coleslaw. Who is this man? But he has another interesting character: Felix is ​​also hypochondriac. He is concerned with his health at the point where he makes amazing guns in public places claiming to help his sins. He seems to have every health condition in the book. And if they had done more, Felix would have had them. Finally, he is very involved. <br /> <br /> Run in the cinema is recorded on marriage. One time when Madison was trying to persuade Ungar to enter, he says, "What do you want, wedding ring?" But little knows that it's not a good person who can't deal with a aggressive boy, but in other ways around. Their friendship becomes a mysterious relationship of Hell. And the peak is happening when Oscar invites two British sisters who have no rest to get along with good and bad results. This is one of the best versions of its kind that has ever been written and flopped, and the great performances of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in the roles that are hard to imagine better playing with anyone else. It is unfortunate that writing to this caliber is sadly missing from many comedies produced today.
