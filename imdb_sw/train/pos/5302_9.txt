This movie has always made me welcome. By comparing this with Mother's Serial, Mr. Waters has returned to his side of grittier. This is not as close as beaten. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. Messages about how success and popularity change someone - but more importantly how they change people around you. It is not a false time in this film. <br /> <br /> Anime are romantic images ... but I want to believe that that's what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's amazing to look at how Mr. Waters has changed ... This is actually quite a job.
