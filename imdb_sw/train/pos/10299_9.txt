I am a great fan of Jim Carrey. I cut my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also love her in her great movies, especially Truman Show. This is a cross between his very strange side, and his great side. He is very realistic in this movie, but there are places that are very bad, and you remove them very easily. he is an active actor. <br /> <br /> As for all others, I was delighted with Jennifer Aniston's acting. I think he's more than just a beautiful couple with a huge ass. Morgan Freeman makes God very good. For Steven Carell, her small events are very strange, especially in the anchor area. <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to test this 9. Acting good, funny script, and some very serious conditions makes this very good film.
