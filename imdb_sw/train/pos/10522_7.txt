This is a good performance of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. The movie is an innovation, frequent cross-diving borders, but it certainly avoids the trap of doing this looks like a detergent soap TV in clothing, because the whole story is derived from the conversation. It has the ability. Mrs Paltrow is clear, if her behavior requires, but the distance required from other characters is accompanied by a more improper force from her actions. In other words, he doesn't seem to take care of the results of his efforts to make a match. Some of the aid assistance is the responsibility of doing more work - especially in the style of action but not the place of motion pictures. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - without his own fault, except that he had left a feeling like gay-dolly of homosexuals in "High Life" which is now hard to accept to play any great part. The glory of works goes to Toni Collette who can accelerate the heat, and Jeremy Northam who sets his character to a good level.
