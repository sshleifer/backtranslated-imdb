The whole way to make this film, one of the first colors of the international color painting, was to make it more accessible to citizens. And it did so. All people did not want to sit on a love story about two young foreign lovers in ancient Egypt if they played with a typical 300-to-40-bed house with soprano and sound equipment to sing a beautiful music. Therefore, the opportunity to look at the good princes (Loren little, Della Marra, and slinky Mrs. Maxwell) who makes the story possible to be trusted, to give those who do not know the plot or the best of the opportunity to be opened in the beautiful arias which otherwise may be . In general, the introduction of surprises for one of the great works of Verdi. I remember seeing this while I was in junior high school and I really raised my interest in opera, a form that I didn't know. I still look at this film with love and it would be very helpful for those who can understand the great music that accompanies better than the average pictures. Luciano Della Marra was positioned as Radames, and unfortunately for the audience did not appear in any other film.
