Do not make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the most simple Jane, and she will never be the best. He is an awesome eyes. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. This is a good film. Not only the Tarra Aura is common, but it also feels the ongoing saga. We are collaborating with two white-hunted hunters who are looking for horns, one of them with love with Jane, another, a roguish stimulus whose character can be one of the best and best examined in the history of the movie. looks like a classic. There is no uncomfortable discrimination shown. However, Africans are shown as individuals, and finally, even two more heroes than white hunters, and stand as such. In fact, one who is not his name gives more sympathy to the audience than any other characters. Finale, too, is one of the reasons for enjoying this film. Major attacks of the lion have not been filtered, and fear is described by the effects of behavior more than the modern movie movie could do with the image of the image. If I leave anything out, it's because I don't want soil pictures for those who haven't seen it. But it's everything you can want on the film.
