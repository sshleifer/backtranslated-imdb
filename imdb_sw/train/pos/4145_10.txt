This is not the Theater Theater. You should not go into it to expect it. This is a fresh FUN girl and thrown the most wonderful of the female leads. As another person here said, this is Mama Mama's film meant to be. And the only barrier that I see this film is that Tina Fey was not in it - instead of being the most intelligent and the most powerful girls in the world. The film is very clean on the face, but if you look at it you will know that it has a lot of messages and meaning for any of us who wants them to come back and do it again in life to know then we know now. FUN FURE and I recommend to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
