This is a good movie, which restores the spirit. From the use of a real villa that encouraged Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel in the 1920s by casting a leadership, every choice was absolutely correct! The excitement of this film is not recommended after regular viewing. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would like to see April of Enchanted released on DVD on widescreen format.
