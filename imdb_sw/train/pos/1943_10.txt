I had the opportunity to see this film twice in the 2006 photo migration in Birmingham, Alabama. I was very happy because I was looking for a second time when they had a follow-up. When I think of films on the holidays, I will often expect to be mixed with breach, often and feel the project of defining students. There is nothing wrong with these types of projects, of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a common way of making independent decisions. For "mainstream," I mean more like a film produced for the release of the nation - in other words, a film that you will see on a movie theaters. <br /> <br /> Writing, guiding, movies, making and acting in this film are all quite pro. There is nothing independent of this film. As a preferred director, I always watch movies that will encourage me to stop giving birth and push hard to find my job. This is one of these films. When I was looking at the Great Bad Swimming, my incentive level was amazing. I felt like my adrenaline entered. The reason I felt this way was because I was attracted to every aspect of this production. I left the excitement of excitement and already started writing the project for a long time. When the movie makes you feel like that, I know it's very good. This is the first project of the feature from Ishai Setton and I found myself eager to have been my project. For me, that's very rare. See this movie. It was shot and led well, and throw it better. Paget Brewster provides reliable and very good performance. She has a reputation for it, charisma, which attracts you and lets you look at any time while screens. He makes you feel like you know him as a friend. That's a gift. I think the industry has been lost for not using its ability to do many times. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also did the highest work. I can't say good things about the bad swimming. I look forward to future projects from all involved in its production.
