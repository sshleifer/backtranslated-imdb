This is a good movie from the lost old television game made for performance. My all-time actor, Robert Culp creates skills through trust and belief in the system, knees and knees fear of crime, and the psychosis of homicidal. Youth is a collection of clean sneering discrimination, and the final message of this film makes the pieces of dragnet look similar to comparison. But what shines in this is a great speed of the movie, creating a quest with paranoia for degrees, as well as a feel for all California surroundings. Cars are also very big, if I remember. I give them this 10 film, and I hang anyone to watch this movie and I am not happy every minute. Remember, just because it's made-by-television doesn't mean it's not a good art.
