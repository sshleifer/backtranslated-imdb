Eric Stoltz provides an extraordinary performance like Joel Garcia, a successful young journalist who is wounding and paralyzed by special hospitals for those who recently recently broke his neck in a traffic accident. When learning to adapt and adjust the weight of its small physical body Joel becomes a fast, fierce friend, who impresses Raymond Chairman (wonderful Wesley Snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker Bloss (William Forsythe very), who feels threatened by The different types of fellow patients are forced to cooperate with the room. Joel also gets great support from his loyal and loving, but dear brother Anna (who was beaten by Helen Hunt). But he still has to negotiate and have disability alone. This amazing victory of the film is their refusal by refusing to clean up or lack of sensitivity of what these men use. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote a thoughtful and comprehensive script) and Micheal Steinberg describes the story with a unique taste, that is, warmth and heat, particularly addressing the disarmament and the reality of disability changes one's life, including and especially sex life (this step is done very strongly in the sequence of sequence when Joel and Anna are trying to fail to make love in the motel room). In addition to the expected deception, this film offers more amazing surprises of dirty dirt, clay humor which has been shown by the sequence of Joel and Bloss making a secret night trip to the strip club. Very good work as well as most importantly: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are much better, and help stand out with Grace Zabriskie as Blooting 'doting, a good mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as nursing nurses. Despite the worst, the film eventually proves it is a very exciting, exciting and enriching commitment to the amazing strength and stability of the human soul. Just a little bit strange game.
