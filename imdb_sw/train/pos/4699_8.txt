This was done for what crime "Not Another Modern Boy" made for school. I laughed all the way as 2 groups fought each other and between them. Comedy unsubtle use more jokes and gags which made me rolling all the way. I think a great gag in the entire film was at that time never seemed to go forward to drop the characters killed in 30 years.
