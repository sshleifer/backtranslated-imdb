The man ... I have been foolish to decrease (not the right time, there is a long list!) Watching this film and finally got the opportunity to do so. And "news" is: Wonderful labyrinthine! <br /> <br /> To "follower" of Von Trier: All Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in Dark, Five Obstructions, etc ... Europa is probably different for its greatness in knife words. Everything is very beautiful and claustrophobic! In fact he feels the feeling of being in this "time of thinking" of the night of the night. Take from the heads of surreal movies like Bunuel, Bergman, even the 40-star films and the acids of Von Trier's protection guide the film-art area as "the best film manufacturer" of these days. His authoritative approach to dealing with extraordinary issues, without being irrational, cuts the view of the viewer with the intention of treating some of the deepest wounds we take in our hypocrisy. It looks like Utopian as it seems, I believe people like Von Trier can help the community in many ways in a broader feature. Daily films and filmmakers who carry this kind of power do not need again, as a reflection tool, perhaps it may be the beginning of a new era: "The time of emotional control over our fears". This is what He always gives us through His work. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
