It is a good Swedish film. It was the first film of Swedish which I found .. it's simple & comprehensive. <br /> Michael Nyqvist did a good job as a popular conductor who wants peace in his city. Frida Hallgren was as good as her inspiring partner to help her continue and never stop. The fight between the conductor and the hypocritical priests who loses war with Michael when his wife is holding Him and protecting Michael's good reason to help his city city find their own peace in music. The only thing I didn't like is the last .. it was not good but it meant a lot.
