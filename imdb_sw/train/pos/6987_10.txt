Put "something" of UFO aside. This was the best document I saw. A true report with Neil and Buzz ... must see. Interviews and reports are disclosed since most of the information was hidden in 1969 and released only in 2006. No documentation so far has an explanation or accuracy for about 47 minutes. the first month ... Neil and Buzz may be the greatest hero of our time. Do you see someone saving his own life? Not so. Neil saves his life after only a few seconds to choose him from death. Surprisingly to watch. It is the brave people who do not know all the details proposed by the moon and the courage of the men when they were faced with a certain death, from the unstable computer ... 10 stars!
