I don't want to go away so I don't recommend this film, because the only problems I have are because of the many devices of the plot material that is used in the film - the most common form of every movie of children has made it seem. That doesn't make it bad, it's not something I would like to distance. It is a little saccharine, so I can say that for the most part anyone who is looking for something and a few little disappointment in the open-children's film like this. However, all of this comes out of the window when the girl (one in all trailers) comes to the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the judges have been wise to tell these boys, do you focus on a little more squirrel? every time it gets tough. That doesn't save the film, but you can leave it 'at least there was one feature that I couldn't stop laughing.' And of course, visually irrelevant, but that's almost released by Pixar flicks. Of all their stuff, I would put it down ... but that's not the worst itself.
