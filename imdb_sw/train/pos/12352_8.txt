My partner and I all enjoyed this film very much. The viewer has been deleted from modern life to ancient Japan, at the same time exposed to the current theme. The characters are real and deep; has a predictable end and story, which is very comforting. The story includes small plots in the life of several geisha living together in the poor district of the city. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to real romance or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
