When the stress comes out of New Orleans, it is Richard Widmark to rescue them in "Fear in Settings," one of the small films to celebrate Elia Kazan's great. Kazan keeps pace, and there is a lot of touch - the events between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and location at the police station to show family life and work life and the average citizen relationships, which are in great contrast to The life and relationships of young people, shown by Jack Palance, who is weak, is the person, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also interesting pictures - Palance has several scenes and executives who seem to come to his knees in height. <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing and fierce talk as stories are not quite up for leadership and presentations. It has fewer issues that will be visible to the viewer as easily. That aside, it's good to watch. Kazan was a good director.
