Indeed, it is obviously different from anything else led by Lynch. There are no unusual things, no violence, no dirt. However, it is a good flick. It's a little slow but maybe it was deliberately because it's a six-week story of an old man (that's my best guess for his time) trip. The characters are everyday people and so, they are honest. The exhibition is beautiful and the last area was very touching. Everyone who has a brother can consider. Lyle and Alvin don't even say anything. For a time they return to the old days and all the fighting have forgotten.
