I liked this show from the first to scream, and I always expected to watch every section every week. Plan, characters, write, special effects were best! Then the sci-fi center has started again and canceled the show of entertainment, well written. I say again, I know all the participants will return. I would recommend buying a DVD, I am. I hope the staff of the sci-fi center to get this comment, and realize that they need to share more with their audience. I just watch one show on the same channel now, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm sure that soon they will search for it too.
