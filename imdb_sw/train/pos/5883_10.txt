I expected, to be introduced and talked, for voice and physical statements. Work each character played was done for quality.The lyrics, words, each sign, sun, told all.The movie spoke to me. I pointed them to a different perspective of a person who believes in mankind. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also without disbelief, for sacrifice and human dignity was shown. Power without grace, locked and without feeling. To require power at the expense of humanity, it is incredible. This movie made me afraid for people who are no longer in the world. And, it's sad that I think about them. I love this movie for dialogue and describe words for everything. Make this film a blessing.
