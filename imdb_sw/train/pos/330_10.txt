I am Italian and when I look again at this film I was amazed at its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the minds and adult feelings. Now I can understand it was a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), and then it went. The film's Epic films are good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' did not have an English version because it is not enough funny ... is not suitable for the audience of the horn and coke. However it is suitable for Homer's pathos and reflections of nature. In Italy recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, a beautiful color. You can find it in file sharing, but it's just Italian, and without heads. The worst: also the dialogue and sounds of this film are wonderful.
