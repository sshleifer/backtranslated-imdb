I lost this film at the end of last weekend, locking the sound surround sound, and I got a great sound from special effects. This movie is renting a great movie, special affects where there is enough scary my wife, but I noticed some of it seems to be suprisingly computer generated. I have not gone to the movies and seen this, but the night is afraid at night you don't feel like going out of the film. I would recommend!
