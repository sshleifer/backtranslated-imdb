Rohmer returns to his historical stories in the story of Grace Elliot, an English woman who lived in France at the peak of the French Revolution. The man was always thought that Rohmer was conservative, but who knew that he had a red-blood reaction. If you can set aside the Rohmer administration of the unabashed administration (and that is not easy to do, given that, for example, the lower French classes are shown here as secret booths), this is really elegant, intelligent and polished. The lack of funds for the great entertainment of the 18th century France, Rohmer has instead the artists dancing against open color cards. It's fun for fake, but somehow it works. And the visitor Lucy Russell succeeds in compassionate behavior that should not be.
