This was a very strange comedy and great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were completely cast as parents, and the children were also too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice of playing Bridget, who was a kind of toned-down version of Kelly Bundy from Marriage to Children. Writing and presentations were the first level. <br /> <br /> Sadly, John Ritter died during the series, and put the damper on things. They had to fight to change the show and bring many members thrown, and it was obviously a bad situation, but they handle it well. James Garner was a good mix. It can be long and Ritter lived. I really liked it when they were brought to Ed O'Neill at the visitors' place. That was good. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
