This would be very happy to see in the hall, back in 1996. There is a pleasure pleasure corner of my delicious movie which actually thank the really good shocker movies. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is panned sometimes sometimes because people tend to have strong emotions on dental issues. Perhaps the ADA campaign on it, for dentists report their apology for this film and for "Marathon Man" (which only has one event comparable to many in the "Dentist"). It is amazing to see that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. full picture. The cuts quickly heighten the tension that in the area where the Dentist "takes care" of his wife there are only two quick cuts to show what's going on. Others are left with our fertile ideas! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has a good experience of playing with psychologically "off" characters and sold quite a lot of compulsory dentists. <br /> <br /> For me, the speed of the film was just right. The creators of the film reveal the wife's evil in the right way. All of the characters in the dental office look like they are real people working in a real office. There are many tension when they are faced with patient people who await the arrival of teeth. At the same time the dentist has left a great psychological collapse! Unlike many films of this type, the script is very tight. All victims get into the trap of the most commonly used traps. Two types of law enforcement even involved in a small part that ends up creating a shocker to appear near the end. It is certainly not with a heart of despair or phobic teeth, and it was highly recommended for fans of intelligence.
