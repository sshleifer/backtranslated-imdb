After playing nymphomaniac in WRITTEN WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said well to her sister / wife's duty and demonstrated the ability to play mantraps and their best. He and Gloria Grahame played this kind of walk - and with his efforts here in the leadership role, Malone won Oscar Executive Assistant. The image that does not exist is the same as Oscar standards, but it is a strong melodrama power under the hands of Douglas Sirk's power. There is a close view of opening the opening area and puts a drop to all parts of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, RACK STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as head heads. Internal barriers between the wealthy family members with a background of oil are the primary focus of the game, with emphasis on powerful players, Stack and Malone. Both are taking advantage of both hands and Stack, too, should be awarded for his good work as a weak brother, alcohol being sent to despair for his wild intentions. <br /> <br /> The names of the names are less amazing to do, but they do it with their common knowledge and faith - Hudson and Bacall. They play their roles of compassion and calmness and understanding. The use of color is especially amazing (as is common in Sirk's film) and it still does not stop thinking of the film as the Technicolor black film in LEAVE HER TO HEIGHTS. You should look at and enjoy interesting displays from the whole cast.
