When I was standing on a Hollywood video I watched through their permits outside the movie and there was a DEMONICUS for five buckaroos with fifty percent! I saw just once before and could not pass this great deal! The second look was better than the first. The box is cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonicus I still recommend you do or rent and hate Demonicus to give you another chance if looking at another can change your mind. If you have seen a copy on the Video Store at the price I have been given so that you don't pass it as it is a great deal! <br /> <br /> Demonicus is a very different but highly entertaining movie. it's like watching an interactive video game and out of play! It has very low budgets and administrators I am sure that no one knows. We started a video game I mean a film with a young man and a woman in Italy and there is a cave that looks like a railway / train road and says not to go in there and what does the usual things! NO! He goes into and finds many objects of gladiator and weapons with a completely preserved body of gladiator's story called Abuse! The seat that came from the shock was sitting and his body was so beautiful. every cave is completed by Pot Caultron? Power is wearing his armor, hats, and weapons or two. He does something that is not something that one can do, put on a hat and is taken with a spirit of fatigue! From there he walks around just to kill all the people of the camp near the back of true piracy. Now, I said before I became a video game.I have trouble explaining but it just feels like that. Music looks like video games. The actors are very frightening. Also the movie also has serious mistakes as a boy runs and tries to look for his girlfriend at night and still runs during the day while looking for him out to rest! <br /> <br /> This game has some errors but it is not as classic as Werewolf but it's fun if you like a low-budget cinema succumbing to fault then better to see Demonicus!
