I've been a big fan of "Killing: Life On Street" so when I heard there was a movie to re-come, I couldn't wait. I would just say, I wasn't disappointed at all. It was one of two hours of the most powerful television I ever saw. It was good to see everyone again, but the great pleasure of all had Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always a powerful part of the show of all together.
