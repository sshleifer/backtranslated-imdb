It was wonderful! Photography, editing, movies, music as well as sending us to the risk of tourist destination. It was the joy of "decreasing," without experiencing danger. We were there! The dream and end-end pattern was pure. Spoke to me. Keep up the good work! Another kind is the City of God. Also - laugh! - Comedy, Search deeply Susan. Good together, and good performances for all. Sorry, I think the Training Day is similar to that, as well as amazing performances and strings. I had to change the channel on some sensory surveillance, but all-by-all, a good film!
