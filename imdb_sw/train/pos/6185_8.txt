I watched him at the Universal Pre-Code session recently released, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the car until the end. Many of the other advisers have revealed the story, the mystery of murder in music, but I wanted to add a few extra notes. Brisson and Carlisle are much of the bland, compared to even the many small players, and no one seems to have a proper voice for what they are singing (Carlisle being a trained opera, little Brisson emerges on some of it and the details below). Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie are playing well, for a good time of time that makes the ball move between the number of music. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are without girls, but we forgot the pregnancy of a beautiful jazz Ernestine Anderson in the number of "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his early performances, sounding like Hawa Arden; Patrick would continue to be a producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there is Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe of the wardrobe - you will also look at David COPPERFIELD (such as Aunt Peggoty) and BANK DICK. Music is very good - Brisson set up the "Cocktails for two" levels in two different cases; "Marihuana Tamu" and the girls who had been smitten behind the back (the blood dropped on one white skin was very awesome); "Ebony Rhapsody," and Orchestra of Duke Ellington and bevy of good players, both of black and white colors, mixing. And I believe this is just one of the earliest music mixes - and clothes have nothing to think.
