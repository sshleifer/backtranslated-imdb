There are a few artists today who can put me captivated in the entire film just for their presence. One of the few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career out of creating the characters that are heavy in view but it is very dangerous to the heart. He takes the opportunity that many other artists will be able to make a phone call and enhance the power, the emotional power that explores away from everything else on the screen. His skills are shown well in the "High Tide," a film that resembles him for the second time by Gillian Armstrong's director, who gave Davis his first success and "My Good Work." In the film, Davis made a young woman who had promised to do it in the world, despite no problems with her community and promoting. In "High Water," however, the character of Davis, Lillie, is the opposite: he left any hope for the future when he was young, and, after the baby's birth, runs his duties and takes life without leadership or meaning. When he finally meets his daughter, the thought of caring for her baby is terrible; he knows this is his opportunity to accuse him of his failure, but how can he be faithful with his daughter and still gets respect? Gillian movies Armstrong are talking about stories about characters who want to communicate with each other, but to deal with the barriers imposed by their personal behavior and alcoholism. "Oscar and Lucinda," for example, was about a man and woman who needed each other's love but they were always misled by their desire for space, represented by their gambling penalties. Here, we have been brought into a world of broken families and mother-to-do to live a life of her own problems and to relieve herself of her own independence even though she is absolutely sure that it is too late to change properly. This is not just a good performance in the middle of it, but also a rare success: the most influential story of redemption.
