The movie was given a long wait, which where a little disappointment because of the expectations I had set up. After looking at it again I must say it is exactly the same. First of all it is very true for the original history (of course not quite) and it is as done to put the right to the movie. The history of humility as a child is shown and is true in nature. Acting is probably not near the plot is narrow, but when you compare it to the movie's Vitti 1966 movie it is the best way because it doesn't try to be music. Normally I would suggest only to Blaise's fans or to someone who finds it on TV.
