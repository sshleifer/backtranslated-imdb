Rigi's race, written by William Mastrosimone according to his action game, where Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, was attacked in his car by Joe Joe (James Russo). He can go away but the fighters tell him that there is nothing they can do. He knows, however, that Joe got his wallet and knows where he lives. When his family members (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) lost their job, Joe gives him an appeal to finish what he started. After Joe despised him and despised him in various ways, he had the opportunity to beat him back and close him. Knowing well is in another word "his word against you" and that no rape was done primarily, he has no intention of making him easy until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his goals were. The film eventually matches the appearance of his two opponents. By continuing, Marjorie shows the same evil that one needs to ask if she is not as unesed as her nemesis. Fawcett is doing enough work, while Russo is as good as a lost person who does a good job of running the situation. And only two characters on the screen for a lot of time, the film has a close character that shows it will work better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young does not know the embarrassment and features that he used over the situation; The film does not have to worry while watching. And while Marjorie has a high hand, things are changing so that it can be easier to encourage her to go to the blood, and one hope that Pat could make her see. “Wickedness”, I felt, was a good movie which at least kept the interest and the highest level of equity. Woodard and Scarwid are both good in support (Scarwid has a good time when Terry reveals himself to be a victim of rape), and speed is consistent. In fact, the discussion is not very often, but the material represses every step of the way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
