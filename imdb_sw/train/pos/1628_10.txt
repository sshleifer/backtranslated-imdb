This is a bar no film with a hilari that I saw. Starting with four criminals sent by their fathers to Wienberg Military Academy, the sound installed that continues to continue this film every goofball film, and is not recommended for the second. It's hard to try to explain this film; The aspects of softness are widely seen and thought for the beauty that on the first look it seems to be nothing more than a boy of 80 stupid desires. But it's oh much more than that! Fresh from the ideas of those people on Magazine Magazine, Up Academy serves on the formula and style that I've never seen twice with any of the "funniest" offerings coming from Hollywood in the past years. Basically the film is full of ivory materials that you might think the authors were a couple of 14 years of age. Watch this film if you like to do "sand." A classic. *****
