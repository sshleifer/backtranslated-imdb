I enjoyed this film. Acting was as severe as it was a conspiracy. Jeff Combs has more talent than he recognized for. The only part of this flick that I changed was the end. The death of the creature was too large for Sci Fi Channel. There are some religious messages that are interesting in this film. Jeff Combs openly played the model of Messiah and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the fight with Chirst. There were tragic events that had the 'end of the world feel'. I only saw this after my third look of this creation element. I know many people will not be able to get records of Christianity, but if you look closely you will find.
