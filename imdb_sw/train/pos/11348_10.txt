I loved this movie when I was a child. I cried every time I watched it. It was not strange to me. I have completely identified with the characters. I would like to find it again (and hope I won't have a desire!). Pufnstuf stones !!!! I was fascinated by the fantasy world. And I movie was loooong. I wonder if I've ever seen the series and confused? Acting I thought it was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He had a lot of dreams for the age of 10 (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970. I still can remember the vividly characters .. flute was quite reliable and still I can 'feel' bad wood. .
