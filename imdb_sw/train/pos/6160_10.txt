SPOILER INFORMATION! I was looking at the extended version of Bedknob and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like to leave the original version on DVD. Portabello Road could be cut to the original height. It was too long and found the movie together. Although playing is great, it would be better to leave on the DVD as the deleted status. <br /> <br /> All in this all is a good movie. My 5-year-old loved it. And it is amazing that movies that I enjoyed during the childhood are passed to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** from **** / / <br />
