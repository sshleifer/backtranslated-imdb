When I wanted to watch this film since the first time I watched the trailer, I was very surprised by this film. While some of the features and actions of the characters seemed a bit too "cartoonish," the dark state of the film really makes this experience very different. Many children will not understand the shortest time in the film, which makes this film rather than an adult. established again, confirming Hans Zimmer is a boy going to the news of animation, and I never thought I would have enjoyed the music of Brian Adams.
