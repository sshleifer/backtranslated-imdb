JACKNIFE is a good performance for Stephen Metcalfe 'Strange Snow' (screenplay is also written by Metcalfe), guided by David Hugh Jones, which examines the most frequently forgotten outcomes of the war against the devastated veterans and brutal war . It is very difficult to come back to the 1989 film now when we look at the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the bad treatment they get at our Veterans Hospital. Three friends went to Vietnam War with just two returned to life: the problem is that when all men had fought the war one of David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) has been devastated by a serious illness after being infected that 'he is' in the void of drinking and very clear school sister Martha (Kathy Baker). David losing his brother Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city to try to help his friend. During the events Jacknife first provides support to Martha and finally two days - in Martha Prom should attend - and at the same time David fall completely, destroying the relics in school and frightening people of the city and students. Jacknife makes Dave believe at that time in Vietnam when they lost their friend and by doing so to bring David to the point where he can begin to rise to his recovery. And patiently Martha gets her needs recommended by Jacknife, too. All three executives offer the most beautiful performances: Ed Harris provides its most complete job when De Niro and Baker continue to set high standards with their work. More people should help to revive all this film but they have forgotten that it is the brittle idea of ​​the destruction of our war to bring men to fight with the families who receive it after the end of the war. It is highly recommended. Grady Harp
