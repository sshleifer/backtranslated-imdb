Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) When Stanley Yelnats IV was convicted for lying for stealing, he is sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. In this camp, Warden, and his two wives, Sir Sir and Dr. Pendanski ordered the supporters to dig holes after the hole after the hole. But why? Stanley knows to know. I have never been willing to look at 'Holes', and I must admit, I just watched the film, because I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of it, then it doesn't matter. 'Holes' is one of Disney's films that the whole family can enjoy. The story is good written and incorporates an amazing idea of ​​incorporating past barriers. These are not misleading and offer a great backward story. All strikes are good. A small star performs better and adding to Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is fun. Shia LaBeouf shows that even 17 hours, he can act without any mistakes. This is a Disney film, of course you will enjoy it as a family. "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
