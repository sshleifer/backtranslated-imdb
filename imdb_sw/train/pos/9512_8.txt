This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I, in particular, liked a new way. I don't see the end is coming, but when the Law was not first struck, one suspect will come back. The story comes and may be more psychologically, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for it. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe Michael Jr. it may be so unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. But, I can understand playing in that area could not take our feelings there because it had a great story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe it is not right. If his behavior was more complicated, he did not want to take care of him if his child had violated or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw only the first time on DVD.
