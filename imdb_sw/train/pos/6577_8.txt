With a few exception, many of George Bernard Shaw's games have disappeared from the hall of these days. Arch too, also talky seems to be a general decision. This BBC version of one of the funniest Shaw games does not reject the decision. Certainly it is an arch and talky, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British reminder, it is fully beaten by actors who - except Helena Bonham Carter - most of us have never heard of it. Carter is as good as a Bulgarian girl who includes a "chocolate soldier" specialist (Pip Torrens) and later loves her. One can compete with the interpretation of Sergius's ignorance (Patrick Ryecart), a Bulgarian officer who led the charge in the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had a bad shot for his guns. However, the role of inviting to play with Ryecart was described as more active. Other players are the full letter. Carter as an independent Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss soldier of fortune is a playground, of course, and it's amazing. Yes, "Weapons and Man" comes as a designated game. But it is likely to see Shaw's movie that does not give its origin. Such plots are generally clever. However, Shaw is about talk. Steps are small (even in St. Joan) and the sets are not being heard. Enjoy this for what it is.
