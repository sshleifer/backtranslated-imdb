Before this, the "Fifth Five" was better. But to deal with this screen of "Mama Night" is very real to the book and continues comedy, secrets, and intentions of intent. The amazing thing was not made by Hollywood or idiotized of the movie "Breakfast Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this movie is that you don't need to be aware of the book to follow (if I think you are doing to the Fifth Fighter). That's true of the Champions breakfast but they did such a bad job that you are better off just reading a book and seeing movies! Nick Nolte did a good job in this film.
