I think if the film has magic, I don't need to be water or seamless. It can fly background details, go very quickly somewhere, very slow to others, etc.. Magic in this film: the library area. There are many smaller in Stanley & Iris, but they do not prevent the good impact of looking people helping each other in areas of life that seem to be very unknown, which is very difficult to fix. Both characters are wise. However Stanley can't understand enough to work because he can't read; he can not read because he had a very adventure during his childhood. Iris, though he has learned well, did not have enough adventure and so can not understand how to move back to U-turn his life took. In all their faults and their strength, the characters congratulate. It might be a little stretch to admit that Iris could wake up to work a year after year in the factory, or that Stanley did not hide and read to him enough to work in construction or other good work to pay. And when these "secrets" are described in the story, their opening is seen in some way. I think no one took time to reflect again the script. However, is it a good movie? Think what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton could do on the screen if someone was!
