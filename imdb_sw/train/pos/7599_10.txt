Before losing everything on TV was predictable. You can predict who would die or who would get something, but in Lost you could predict NOTHING. Everything was so amazing and it was really secret because it had so many secrets but because there was no such thing before everything was so great. I was so big. LOST is a modern art work. It gives you something to expect every week. It's a skill. The neighborhood is brilliant is quiet and warm in the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are the work of the elite each of them especially those who are already on the island. Castaways are very big but they can never predict their deaths because they have a lot more to do and much more to say and have secrets that affect other castaways that die with them.
