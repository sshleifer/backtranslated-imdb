I read that this was not good, that the story is not strong, that Volckman feels somehow fail. I don't agree. First, it is well implemented. Volckman is doing well not just trying a new approach, but having a goal that should reflect on: Will immortality reduce the value of life? The big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see it trying hard to create a feeling, and it doesn't. This should be applauded. I am sure it is an interesting exercise to create characters in that form. I've seen artists reduce the form at a low level to create a time frame. I recognize this film with this. Besides, it is more interesting than a dream-scoping of Richard Linklater, and the story of Volckman means more than Linklater's stories of life lost drugs. Old news. Everyone knows, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are more stories there and loads of holes in them. Very good work.
