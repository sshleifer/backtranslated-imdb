Putting in the central neighborhood of Willard's thinking in the 1950s, this dark comedy with tiny fingers with American buttons as a mania gun and violence, wealth and development with Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and disappear dead. Yes, it all seems to be heavy, but I believe on this, it's almost as light as a feather. Zombies are clearly visible among the characters. Good questions occur, such as: who will be a zombie (90% of people Willard choose this last method, while only 10% prefer traditional funeral)? Who has many Applications to make their bids like robots (they have been a social score)? And, what kind of possible relationships can be made between living and dead dead? Somehow, the director Andrew Currie, who also wrote a delightful scriptplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), puts these devices that can walk for an hour and a half without falling once for a good laugh. Casting super helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are chiefs, assisted by young K'Sun Ray like Timmy, innocent child and good heart who works as evidence of justice for each end of the farmers. (After just seeing him in "Memento" and "Matrix," I did not know that Mrs. Moss had such comedienne chops.) Design and music are very 50s, for tee. Maybe this is not for everyone. In fact it will be a hard film of Bizarro's annual award. But the intellectual comedies that sit funny from start to end are among the most successful successes in making movies. For me however, "Fido" is a hoot! My article: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Appearance on 01/30/07)
