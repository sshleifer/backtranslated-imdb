Another Spanish movie about the war of 1936. This time we are told about the story of Carol (good played by Clara Lago), a little girl living in a Spanish village from New York. It is a journey to establish, and will soon find out about the social injustice, their stupid war and conflict, on the contrary. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes its best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a blow, beautiful pictures, and a beautiful script. He tries to take part in the war, shows us some facts and let us take (ok, the truth is clear enough to make us decide what we have) and it takes great advantage of the presence and renewal of two young stars: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Careful production. <br /> <br /> My Flash: 7/10
