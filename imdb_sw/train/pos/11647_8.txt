I can give you four reasons to see this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best films in modern Mexican movies. <br /> <br /> 2. Four beautiful stories, relating to a great deal. <br /> <br /> 3. Give you a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> 4. To explore bitterly on the great trouble in this country (and many others). (/ POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE) <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this film for a good story in comedic conditions about the exercising exercises against the common people and still expect to be interested in his efforts. Then Antonio Serrano gets the biggest piece in the second piece with the successor of the Italian heritage and "Peter and the wolf" - similar to anecdote. <br /> <br /> In the third story, which seems to be more self-reliant from this series even in the environment, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of someone in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after a recent lynching in Tlahuac and traditional in this unpleasant thing in the Mexican State, this story cannot be updated more. <br /> <br /> And finally, Fernando Sariñana returns to dark humor in a "great finale" which he puts together with many characters from the previous series in one of the best comedy pieces that have been published. Describing the location of one of its original films "Todo el poder", Sariñana offers the final lesson of the theme. And by the way, throwing an event that transforms the film with Anna Ciochetti making short striptease. Once the movie is over, it gets a good feeling about having a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) and a very painful lesson. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own shame and this is a good example. This film is evidence of how Mexican people have learned to live in the midst of crime (and perhaps agreed), between two fires: Criminals and authorities called full corruption. Even this movie is thought to desire because almost all good people have been victims of crime and do not have this unhurt. If you had an attack without a beginning then you are lucky. At the same time, do not lose the opportunity to see this film, it was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And a good life in Mexico ...
