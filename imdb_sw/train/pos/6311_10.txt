This movie is highly hilarious, and has a great partnership of actors like William H. Macy who always performs this kind of work, perhaps its representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is a very good actor showing his exciting work in the brother's Cohen film "Oh brother, where are you?" which makes it one of my favorite movies! But it's hard to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. My city has no good places where the purchase of a good film. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster but didn't know it in the original name, so maybe it would be easier to get if I had a name that they gave in Mexico, does someone know?, Because I can 't remember! Cheers. A.
