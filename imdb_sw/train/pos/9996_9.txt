I haven't read some comments on the film, but judging from the average standard I can see that it is not available to be extra. I looked at the second time with my children. They really liked it. True, there were no adults around the floor, but the happy voice of children made it look so. It is true Mel Brooks farce, and a lot of moral content - how sad it is loved by our money, not for us, and how our friends and our partners love. There are many other films on such an issue, of course, many that will have greater or emotional impact on adults. It is difficult for me to imagine the consequences for family members, however. So, for children, 9/10 from me.
