I liked the first pair of stages, acting on Pacino and Cusak, especially their events together. The humor of the environment and the juxtaposition of the old and youth idealistic was made. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; he was an active and interesting character. The film left the road to me when the assistant mayor started to spread around the corridors to reach the bottom of what his master did not want him to enter. No one has good intelligence encounters in the compound left in the junkyard. Here the story became implausible. What I do not understand: why did the striker and Vito shot as the end was giving them a statement that could bring a valid judge?
