Several participants mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. He was 25 years old and had 50 when this movie was released. I think the difference does not matter to the game of doubt like Vertigo, but it means a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character appeals to him, but it is unclear why his children will be attracted to. Still, the movie works as a romantic fantasy. The place he looks at his head, with his dark brown faces and a pleasant voice for him and the cats, is a real magic. So it's a little jarring, then, when the area has changed to the top of Flatiron's construction, and we see a very old age difference. When he embraces him, he gets on his fingers through his hair, but he leaves the course and just throws his fingers off against his toupee.
