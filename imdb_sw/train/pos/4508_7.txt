I was fascinated by photography in this film, which was hit in the Alaska area. Although it is basically a song, we see many of the Eskimos involved, such as hunting, playing, creating gloos, etc.. And their customs, like offering their offerings to strangers, are often in the story. The hunting process was sometimes in stock photographs, as it was easy to identify the past events, but even these were amazing. Spear fishing for lax, hunting of walrus, caribou and even carrying polar and whale made it appear to be a document sometimes. There was no cast list, which strengthened the flavor of the document. The filmmakers tried to make it so true, and the locals speak only in the Eskimo language that can be translated by someone on the screen or by headlines. Introduction said that except for white traders and the Royal Mount Canadian police, he had no executives in the film, but this was not true. The two leading actors, who played with Mala and Lotus Long, were in the world of birth, but were professional actors with the original film and you could see sometimes they had practice. But they were better in their duties and continued to work on Hollywood. For all, the film has value to look at.
