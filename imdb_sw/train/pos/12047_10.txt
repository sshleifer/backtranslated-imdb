The first and only time I saw that black woman I thought only the time of my knowledge was seen on TV behind 1989. It was Christmas night with my father and I was looking into the bedroom shortly before we went to midnight service in the church the village. I was very young at the time but I don't know who was more afraid to walk through the church building to the door of the church that night or my father! <br /> <br /> There are many things about this film that makes it so interesting but I think 0ne of them is the fact that there is not much in the sound of sound that has in the background of almost every movie of Hollywood, so every creak, The thump and bang are more amplified in your head if no trouble. Another reason why it is different from other stories of the spirit is no reason to jump in the closet so that it does not necessarily see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is among the clever like anything that cares more than your own mind driving dreams to think about what's around the corner or behind the door! The wonderful story of the soul, I have never seen anything that can be similar to all the waste that is repeated on TV I do not believe that the BBC has deleted the (for my knowledge) just to show one!
