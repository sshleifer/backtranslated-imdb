This is a fantasy movie for kids according to Boggy Creek Legend though I do not know why they called it Rudi to Boggy Creek as it is good. Dawn Wells' stars as a mother of 3 children who disappear in the pond near Boggy Creek and 2 other people with a monster comes to their help. Yes it is very silly and plot is corny but this type of movie is perfect for the group 8-12 y / o which targeted. It is not the demolition of the child of G-rated kiddie and at least you are not worried about leaving your children alone when they look. To fully set 8-12 y / o, older children will be attracted to thinking that they are disabled.
