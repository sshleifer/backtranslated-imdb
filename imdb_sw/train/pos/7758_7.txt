The most unusual Melodrama over its period (between the 1950s) and the proper diet of the matin√©e. Rock Hudson, hulk everyone has love, plays his normal role, but during the Giant, he did the same year, when his material and star-star (Taylor & Dean) were on average, in this movie is just not good to add more caliber of mushy stories of how difficult to be rich and happy. Brother and sister with demolition (Robert Stack, disgusting his way through the film in alcohol drinking, and Dorothy Malone, playing a very richest girl on top) the end of the lost and Hudson gets Bacall - who is rather timber in this section which a good habit or witch to make him go. To clarify Oscar Wilde, a good end to happiness and bad without sad, that's the meaning of lies. However, I was interested in reading that the film depends on the true story that confirmed the plot. Like other films of the same period, homosexuality is hidden in gender terms. Perhaps the film can be restored: Stack's behavior could hit the truer if he had hidden homosexual feelings for Mitch for marriage. In addition to Todd Haynes From Heaven has been enlarged on Heaven All That Allows, also dominated by Sirk. Perhaps Haynes could fix it written on the Wind and give us an unpopular film.
