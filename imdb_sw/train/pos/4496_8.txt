To put it easy, I enjoyed this film. The reason for my interest and happiness was not related to anything else except the issue. I had heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how Northern Britain makes a career of class life and attitudes used to be (like their experience) and this is an interesting sign that looks honestly represent what they told me. Specifically, the indifferent ancestor who "knows" is what is appropriate for his family as well as his stubborness when this concept is facing. (Not much has changed in !! !!) People who have seen play may be disappointed with the film because the story is not easily accessible in different media. Somehow, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, as a result of the way it happened to a social event.
