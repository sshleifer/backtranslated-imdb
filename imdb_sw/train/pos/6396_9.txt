Do you think you have been hard? You should watch this film. Carl Brashear is the shape of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to diver diver, must be an inspiration to all of us. And significantly, after watching this film, I learned that what is shown is not half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work so far as Brashear. De Niro, as usual is as good as the southern redneck who teaches him. George Tillman in his second element only (after the "Soul Food"), has made the leap much like a film manufacturer. If you want to be transferred and relocated, you will surely need to look at this.
