First I bough this movie on VHS than I was just buying on dvd, it's on my favorite movies of all time. I have read the book, but I think the movie is better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow like Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley was well chosen. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie! <br /> <br />
