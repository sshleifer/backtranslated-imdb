The young woman in the world was alone. Both were alone because the boy had a gift and a curse in one bag - he was able to remove the sword from his hand. There was a wound on his arm because of this "gift" - the wound of the worst weapons in his body. First he kills his second father who drinks his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As easy as at all for superhero - he achieves the right .... but the community decides that this right is not necessarily a risk that is certainly because it is not suitable in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the great hero dealt with Artem). Tkachenko kills as a person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blame from the authorities and runs. In flight as from the authorities and the Mafia meets a girl (who did Chulpan Hamatova) and loves her. Everything that looks ... hasn't been told. Know that this film is more about emotions and feelings but not about actions. This film is full of the pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.
