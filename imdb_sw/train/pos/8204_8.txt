Sudden effect was better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It created a great movie, but then I saw a villain (s) and I was desperate. The sudden effect was different from the original phase. The program had different trends in this film, like Dirty Harry did not take many police channels this time. We also do not see human beings to the future, which means the timing of the screen for them, which is ideal for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steal a show like Dirty Harry, he said. Pat Hingle was enjoyable as General Jannings, Harry's new chief given. Bradford Dillman appeared to change his name to Captain Briggs here, or the way, he was not different. Michael Currie is as good as Lt. Donnelly, the head of the rage of Harry. I enjoyed myself Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, a little punk who has vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was as good as Horace, a friend of Harry. Audrie J. Neenan was as good as Ray Parkins, the most famous city of the city. Jack Thibeau was healed well as Kruger, the offender. Now for the worst part. Sandra Locke, Longwood's lover was a great surprise as Jennifer Spencer, the love of Harry. And Paul Drake was surprised as Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie would be much better if not by better writing and acting on a certain part. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
