A few years ago I added comments to IMDB on the "Real McCoys" TV series. I said then and again it was a charming, exciting, and entertaining show, well done with wonderful features. I have seen recently on the DVD four times the previous PLUS Reunion of 2000 by Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As another writer here mentioned, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not impressed, but maybe they can be monitored down through SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> Reconnecting display has been done well and giving us an unknown insight into the show. One piece of local news that we did not find is like Kathy Nolan felt to stop being shown in a serious conflict agreement, which left Luke to be a “widow” in the last year, which was not very good. Nolan continued to make a comedy bomb called "Broadside", about women nurses in the Pacific at WW II. Get it? BROADside? No, it's not funny. Unlike wonders, salacious, and TRASH violence on TV now that undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" is welcomed by good values ​​and good people. And I thank all those involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for I have brought my family. We never missed it.
