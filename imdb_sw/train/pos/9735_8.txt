Although the middle line of the story has been passed, in several screen shots, it means; get the "nitty courage" out of the way, taking into account the key relationship that makes "political offices" and use these non-trivial events, used only for the comic effect. However it works well, especially with Pegg on the front seat. The film is finally very clever, playing well on the trans-Atlantic Pegg relationship with its collaborating stars and connecting the cross between the upper and lower animal communities very well and quite enjoyable in the story story that despite the predictions A very special journey. Different characters in the film are presented well and throw it is definitely a further step in the film. The relationship between Pegg and Huston and "love, hate" the relationship between Pegg and Dunst works very well in a story that is because of the best word, interesting.

It is one of these films where every little detail pays a great job tax. From the gender observer in an all-surprising voice it is well-measured in what can be described as a comedy.
