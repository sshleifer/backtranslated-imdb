After reading comments on this movie and seeing a mixed view, I decided that I would add ten cents of value to say I thought the film was good, not just in the beauty of seeing, writing, music marks, acting, and leading, but by setting The whole story of Joseph Smith and the road he went through life of suffering and suffering by believing in God how he felt and knew it was his way. I am so happy, in fact, to have a small part in telling this story of this wonderful man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity to emerge itself, regardless of the religious approach that can walk, this only adds one to more decision to live a life that we should have with the true love of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.
