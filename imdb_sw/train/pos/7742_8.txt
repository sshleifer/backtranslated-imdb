Many actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern film film a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was so attractive as all of them perform good performances and amazing characters. Patric writes this story on this night, playing an old and mentally attack striker. Wow, that alone makes a person interesting! He looks dumb, but he is not. Cut is a slinky, attractive, stupid, intelligent and sympathetic co-conspirator program of ongoing kidnapping. Bruce Dern is also in combination with Dern can never be attracted to any film. <br /> <br /> The movie can be taken a kind of downer for the average viewer, but I saw it interesting .... and I don't like the movies that are contemptuously contemptible. I found it a kind of criminal film quirky. Look and see if you agree. This is an unfamiliar film film that should not be the case because it is just a good story and it has been done well.
