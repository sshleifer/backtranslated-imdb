I was so happy to see the release of the amazing stories of the first season on DVD. I forgot the stellar publishers of executives and directors working on this series. For a long time the only way you got to see this amazing series had VHS 2 or 3 or while Sci-Fi could run again. However, when Sci-Fi would host the flight again, generally agreed with the same periods. There were few good events in the First Season as the message they did not repeat. Does anyone know how long this series ran? It says 1985 to 1987 above here on IMDb but I thought it was running over two years. If you liked the Twilight Zone, the Night House and the Outline, you would like this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
