My wife and I took our 13-year-old to see this film and we were very excited about the fun of the film. It has more appeals for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and especially refuse to Hallie Kate Eisenberg, "Boys are very strange." It is comforting to see a film that shows that boys and girls are very different from their emotional and social shapes. Boys really do these kinds of amazing things and they usually live to tell stories and fear their mothers silent! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and a 11-year-old boy, I and my 23-year-old girls went to see the movie the second day of the boy out. We were happier the second time around and everyone was beaten on it. It is clean and fun made by the forest before the youth reminiscent of the Classic TV "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel that the sleep problem is not different from "Freaks & Geeks" that didn't survive its first season but bought out the release of the DVD. See it especially if you have boys and find it stimulating conversation about happiness and security! Girls will love it because of the opportunity to say, "Boys are wonderful!" Don't miss ...
