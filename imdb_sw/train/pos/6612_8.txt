If the Last Dream brought the CG to a whole new level, this is a reincarnation to capture the motion. No film or cartoon, this motion picture seems like a ritual for Noir Film, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and a new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris as much as possible, the characters seem like real like you and me. They define, travel, trembling as real actors in a way that is not available before. <br /> and hope to get intelligence. You will be more likely to make it before half the way from the film. The situation is very simple compared to the most popular sports, but this is definitely fun for the eyes.
