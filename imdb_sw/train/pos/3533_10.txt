Unfortunately not available on DVD as yet, but worth searching on TCM or VHS. The Secretary believes his boss was charged with murder, and bravely takes many of the most dangerous letters in an attempt to establish the truth. The movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I mention! jazz band sequence where our heroine wants about the killer, is one of the most erotic events in Hollywood history, despite being in a very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. With budgets - Long Island looks somewhat of the mountains - this is the movie's original style and excellent vision. Ella Raines was a good actor who discovered and Haward Hawks who knew a lot about these things, giving the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German filmmakers, Hungarian and Czech - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who emmigr√©s moved to Hollywood, and brought the original original vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given as a great place again, and eventually ended up in the poor western produced.
