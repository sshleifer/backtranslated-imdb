Okay, this film is stupid. I mean that in a good way though. It was stupid for the purpose, and it was one of the "stupid" movies that I saw. Jokes and gags are evil intentions, but are provided in such a way that it struck all the correct details with me. Support partners were very deep and uncomfortable. There is a very good plot, but it does a good job. Elvira's behavior is a focus here. It is proposed and interested. Cassandra Petersen has a world of talent that works only in this movie. on this talent of work he had physical characteristics that were clear, surprising. A few men did not agree with that. The sections that show his statistics were also some funnier events on the film. I liked a smile for an ear from the first place to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of comedy, and for fans of beautiful women. I would have done more movies than Elvia more.
