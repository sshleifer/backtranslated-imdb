This is my first CG film that I have ever seen. Usually, looking for other animation films makes it easy to see. Not Ice Age. I wanted to see when I saw the trailer and Scrat, a lesbian sauce. Ice Age was an enjoyable and enjoyable film. The story is essentially a version of the animation of Three Men and Child, setting 20,000 years in the past. The exhibition was huge. Very good. It is one thing to create aninmation of lobby, it is quite another thing to create objects to catch knives and Ice Age is good looking with its stylish pictures. Blue Sky Studios is a company looking for the future.
