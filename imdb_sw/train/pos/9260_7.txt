There are sad stories of women and their repression in religious, political and social ways. Not minimizing the film and stories about gender damage and reproductive rights, as well as salary, wages and social cuts, both in the name of Allah or God or other fraudulent rights, but sometimes it is necessary to take another way and light it on that. It is a 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. Torture is high and several women are trying to hide themselves as men get a match. The women caught (Played with Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani, and Mahnaz Zabihi) and the imprisonment for the accusations gave the most interesting and light descriptions of this country's , most likely, all Muslim countries. Their cooperation with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them, both city and village, and the father who was looking for her daughter gave them a good time if we thought about why they had unwritten rules. It is especially about the generation of society that feels that it has to save women from the odds of those people. Instead of educating men, they deny justice and rights for women. Seeing changes in the soldiers involved and reflecting the Iranian society, we are surprised that this film does not play any Iran. But Jafar Panahi has won in his hands for those who can see it.
