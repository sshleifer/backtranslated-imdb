Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to replace as a secretary and a rich family of Hughes to get over her boyfriend. Almost immediately he is drugged and transported to family property in Cornwall. When he wakes they continue to tell him he is Marion Hughes, he has been mentally ill and bound bound ... but why? Perhaps you can guess why but not mind because this is fun. The "Margin of Narrow" and "Mask's Face" is one of the best B images that have been made. (B pictures were under budget pictures were made quickly with a small budget and no main star). It's just a long time it needs to be (just 65 minutes), headed well, fast and exciting. It is the only obstacle at the end that I have found a little too easy to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actor) is just the same as leadership but Dame May Witty is good and George Macready is the best (and awesome) as criminals. Well worth the infection. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.
