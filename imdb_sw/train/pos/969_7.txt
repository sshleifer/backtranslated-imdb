Miike makes a movie of children's adventure, not different from the Neverending Hadith. In fact it is one of my favorite little more than the director's movies. Even the worst Mike is much better than many beautiful films, though, and World War Yokai has much to offer. It is at least loud and frightening as many American children are stumbling. I may think of the children themselves will find a lot of love in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all Miike movies, it can move very slowly. That means you have a variety of strange variations, where sometimes there is a great chain of action and the next area will connect forever as the characters talk. The story itself is not very good, either, and the eternal lack of incoherency brings its bad head. More than what I liked came from the technical side of things. This should be a movie of the most expensive Miike, and it seems strange. "Yokai" is a Japanese spirit, and comes in different forms, fantastic, and designers of clothing, staff of special effects, and everyone involved in the designs has done just the best work. I found the 1968 film this is based on the core (Yokai Monsters: Spook War), and the suit of the suit suit of the ball you can find there to be turned into the most suitable instruments by using the state of art and special effects. I loved the appearance of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who plays the shadow of the dark eye, white, white, white hair of the bee and whip. He played, with luck, with Chiaki Kuriyama, who can remember as a boy of Lucy Liu in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The film hero is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who gave voice to the Spirited Away Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle.
