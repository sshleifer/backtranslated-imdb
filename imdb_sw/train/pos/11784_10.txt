As well shown by the original posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - and really good, Rockstar: Supernova - is Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Don't know who they are? They are awesome, powerful, Rockin 'House Band whose music and talented music has shown this more than the American Idol's sad clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the night "conditions"? That was the accuracy of music and perfection as I saw it. The Secret of Suzie McNeil of the Queen 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the Ty Ty's Memories of the Stone '' You Can Not Always Find ... ', JD Fortune singing "The Mind of Judgment". The common denominations here is the Great House of House. It is as good as the INXS was theirs, they are saddened by their old soul, although JD's life-style has some degree of resting new life in their music, this show is on HB. <br /> <br /> Memo for producers: Third Season (if we have been blessed enough to have that) should Rockstar: House Band. Get the best musicians and go to the place.
