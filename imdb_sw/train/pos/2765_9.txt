These are French and Belgians doing what they do well. It is fun, fun, interesting and interesting. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, Down's Syndrome patient and his efforts to have meaningful relationships with man, everyone. This should not be done by means of focus but in a great sense of fun and trust. Georges and management company of guru, Harry is dealt with amazingly - shifting from comedy and tragedy back to play again with delightful ease. <br /> <br /> The eighth day puts the same Hollywood as Barry Levinson's Oscar Rain Man or Robert Forrest of Zemeckis Gump well and true in the shadow. Sometimes, it creates the humor of One of Milos Forman's Flew on the Cuckoo nest and Dennis Potter's shadows thrown to a good level. <br /> <br /> As a hatred of hate and yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns but another good performance. But it resembles the wise Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It is a very powerful movie with many pieces of memory - part of the shoe shop, the showroom of the car, the George dance in the original 'Jesus knows' area, the meeting area, the fireplace. If you haven't seen, there is only one thing to do. Just hire or attend observations in retro movies near you and see what you have lost. Still better, buy this film. A talent of skill .....
