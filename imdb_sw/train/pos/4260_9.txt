After the first work of Fatih Akins "Im Juli", which was very good, he created a beautiful Italian family of German. It is a German film, which unfortunately is a bad situation, because we rarely produce more than average average movies;). But this movie makes very good snapshots at that time then. "Solino" is about Italian immigrants who arrived in Germany's "Ruhr" area during the 60's. The characters are very interesting. Especially Gigi, the main actress. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played with Moritz Bleibtreu, is not good. Yes, you can't believe the role. But the character is good and fits perfectly in this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "Godfather". Most people probably hate this film, say its boring. Not too much tension? - Yes, but a terrible movie. 9 out of 10.
