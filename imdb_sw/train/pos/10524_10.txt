Jane Austen would certainly agree with this! Gwyneth Paltrow works amazing to find the character of Emma. She is funny without that much, but elegant. He puts a very reliable British brilliant (not to be Britain himself, perhaps I am not the best judge, but he misled me ... was also the best in "Sliding Doors" ... sometimes I forgot he is American ~!). It is also brilliant by Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida's Law (sister Emma and Mother's sister) as Bates women. They almost steal the show ... and Mrs. Law do not have any lines! It is highly recommended.
