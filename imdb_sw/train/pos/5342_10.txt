I was so impressed with this film in many ways. First of all, I want to say that Clara Lago was a very valuable thing! Very beautiful girl. His work was also good. True to life and very human. Although I don't like the places where he had smoke; I hope it was just a false money. Any way, was very strange and the story was moving. I found myself in the story and his character. Very interesting how I came to discover this film really. I was walking in the blockbuster and just happened to see his beautiful smile on the cover I was walking. Luckily I looked in the lowest direction that this movie was! I asked myself, 'Oh, look!' So I took it and saw that this film was described as good things like "Gem Little." I read the plot back and then I think that, well, maybe I would like to look at the IMD first and then come back and lease sometimes. I am glad I did not, because I certainly would have been lost. After finding a movie with my friend, I knew that I would end up rejecting this film, so I returned to the place where I found it and wiped it. It was and I had my farmer for a week, since school started with me this week and I didn't have any time to look at it, but tonight was a good place. I went through and I got a good movie, a good score and moving the plot from beginning to end. I had a lot of emotions and I must say, some pieces were almost bothering me with tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to mention special to a young boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was wonderful. Also the actors who played Carol's father, whose name is unfortunately not listed on the site. His voice was just love and very gentle that I could see his love for Carol. Even though his appearance is not popular, I felt his presence. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. If you are a person who is transferred to the light, but the emotional film, then this is obvious to you.
