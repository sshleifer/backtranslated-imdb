This is a fascinating series that takes people of real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with a series of continuous character in the story. Detective Railway "Matt Clark" - takes place in tracking popular chaos from Old West in a story which is at least partly based on real account. In this sense, close to the anthology series, and as someone else said, this unusual structure contradicts the actual events, but it is a series of fun and a lot of action to satisfy the hungry audience of 1950 - and still stands well 55 years later . Clark eliminates a strong figure in its western gear while going on some of the worst baddies of history. And her girlfriend Frankie is quite a dish. If you are a western fan, make sure you check if you have a chance.
