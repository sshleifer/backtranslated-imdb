Although it was unfortunate to hit the spectacle of the festival here in Austin (SXSW Films) only if we were tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves the audience. Looking into the "Scottish games" as call operators "Macbeth" during the production to avoid curses, this is a good, effective and delicate treatment that enters the group. With amazing surprises, and looking and sounding better than his small budget would show, this is a quiet gem, not a world class, but it is quite satisfying.
