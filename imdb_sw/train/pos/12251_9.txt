It has taken some time to view this version unfortunately I don't seem to be able to rent on a video store, just another version but I liked it. I was always a bright with another Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, since they are not UK by nature they have to prioritize, and also to me it doesn't seem natural. It seems to set. Sorry but I don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a good job there. I couldn't heat the characters, but this version is warmer and more than the kind of person I thought about Emma. It's definitely the version I will return to now. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley did not look good, but he persuaded. I also like Jane Fairfax best (played by Olivia Williams). I have never taken him to the film version, but he is best shown in this edition. Come to think, (instead of Mr Knightley) all the characters play well, and much more on. Unfortunately all went out around the same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Mercy ...... I also love the new location at the end. Made by Kate Beckingsale! So, if you're a fan of Jane Austen, don't forget to check this.
