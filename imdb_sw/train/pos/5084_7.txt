I was surprised, that 'Fury Fury' 'was a good film ...... Maybe because, I didn't have any expectations of this movie ..... However, the film has holes in the ...... I would say, that you can't think who was behind all the deal, to the end of the movie .... First, I thought, was Robert Ryan, using the same way, like '' Gaslight '' where the husband tries to evict his wife, but I was wrong. .... The main problem, and the movie is, they drive in the whole direction of the whole, which did not give them a sign at the beginning. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert took their place well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, actor good character, who stole an image in this one ... Those who like movies, which prevents you from switch, will like this ......
