This is a very good film ... that's just a part of the crippled and it's very simple, and the movie is not entitled to the right of the big star (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the most interesting actor here was Kay Kay Menon (not confused with the singer KK). In an area that first meets the character of Amitabh, I thought that someone who could just look at AB, keep looking and say a word, and still look at the power, it is a good actor. In fact, he has proved that he is eligible again in Sarkar, with AB for the second time. He should get more responsibility, he is brilliant. If you have read some reviews here on IMD, you already know the plot, and I agree that the entry of Akshaye Khanna in Pakistan was very little. And the little sides of love shared with "what-his-face" was not really needed. But he is a good actor (as shown in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is a cool look, always. and AB ... what I can say. I don't know if I am his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can compete for the spot. <br /> <br /> Looking for a spectacular, based on the sound, though slightly guided by Hollywood's like "Escape the Great" and "Bridge on the Kwai River".
