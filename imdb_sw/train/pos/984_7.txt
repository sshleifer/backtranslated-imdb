I appeared on the "Bait" on the cable one night as it started with thinking, "Eh, why isn't it?" I am glad I had a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. Faced with flashy infinite direction should be with regular friends. But in general, this film worked. All elements have joined the same, and pulled off what otherwise would have been a very bad film. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think, it's from Jamie Foxx. I don't know who sought Foxx for leading, but anyone who made this film is a great grace. It is believed by amazingly amazing, Foxx blows through the film, smooth like butter and funnier than hell. You can tell him he works by instinct, and silica does not fail. The plan, at an unnecessary moment, unites very well, and there is even an arc of behavior that Foxx character grows as a person. Again, they could walk and without any of this, but it made things very good. I wonder how low for this. Maybe I just took this argument on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd like to give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
