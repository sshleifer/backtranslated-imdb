I have seen this to be a pleasant, interesting and happy change. Unless two major errors, the cast is amazing. I discussed earlier comments - Chynna Phillips is a bad miscast as a teenager. During the 27th, he is very old (and, yes, is shown), and is not recommended to sing "chops" for Broadway style music. Vanessa Williams is an honorable singer and, for the person who does not play, she is enough. However, he is not Latina, and his character is obvious. She is also a very mixed mix, which gets inflammatory. <br /> <br /> Girls fan club of Conrad Birdie's Apple Apple shines very much - with special weaknesses for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed Tyne's performance, although I am not a fan of his work. Finally, Shriners play is corrupt, especially dorky three in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
