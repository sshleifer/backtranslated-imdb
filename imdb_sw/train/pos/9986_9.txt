If one of the few Canadian who did not read a book in high school, I thought I would add my opinion. See the movie without knowing the story before in any way prevented from film. The characters have very difficult problems, everyone can recognize them in their own way. The beauty of coping is that everyone is allowed to implement their own ideas on the lives of the characters, rather than having a spoon view. You can hate them or hate them, and you still feel the effects of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne actually brings characters into life. I would like to recommend very much.
