If you would like "Othello," you would like this flick since half of the movie approaching the sample production. The movie has a great mix with Signe Hasso and Winley Winley as women in Colman Life when Edmond O'Brien plays a journalist. Two players I helped were Millard Mitchell as a journalist who finds angle with Joe Sawyer, a 1940 reply to Drew Carey, who plays the striker in the case. Great time bright in this with worldly originality.
