I think this film adds a distinction and is very accurate in historical construction. The way that shows different communities leaving together in Thailand is very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese, and various communities are managed by the king. The squares near the court are usually a powerful struggle with a great revolt. Wardrobe is beautiful. The film also takes place in Thailand for good production. The prestigious area as executors is very interesting. It is fun and I think it also applies to the school for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europe in Asia were the subjects of local kings in a very different way from the traditional view of Hollywood.
