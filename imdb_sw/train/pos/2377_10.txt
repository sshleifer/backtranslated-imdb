I have tried a long time for someone to create a reliable version of H.G. Wells' classic, "War of The Worlds". Timothy Hines finally done! I just couldn't believe how good it was! From acting, at great cost, out of the special effects of the world, I can just say! It's amazing! Interestingly, strict, full of first level performances and thrown on! It should appear reliable. I certainly didn't. And I have read these views with no comments, and don't believe what they said. We must watch a different film, huh? And these negative views and the vepsaian boy, any man who is, well, he doesn't know what he says. <br /> <br /> Continue good work, mr. Hines.
