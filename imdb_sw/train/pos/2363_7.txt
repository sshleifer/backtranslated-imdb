This MR James 'A View From A Hill' short story was first shown on British TV in 2005, at the BBC's small station which was played on BBC BBC. The BBC succeeds in the 1970 revision of other MR James stories including 'Whistle and I'll come to You Lad' and 'Signalman'. Although it is not in the class as this talent, 'A View From A Hill' is an interesting and sometimes amazing thing. The historian comes to a small rural village to look at the collection of the latest collector of ancient artifacts. While out of the country, he sees abbey which has been bombing for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with the old pair of binoculars and the story of gruesome about Hill of Gallows which are ominously? And what does this gray country offer and her servant knows about the situation? Although it is not scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and the time that had been longer than 40 minutes could be a great mix. As it is, all feel a little rush and a little bit more than a sense of entertaining. <br /> <br /> I offer 7 out of 10.
