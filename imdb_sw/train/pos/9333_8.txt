After living in Ontario all my life, in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard about him from my parents, grandparents and family. So I realized that they would beat the movies on it, and that the beginning would be shot on my street, and his house almost completely mine and I was excited. When you read the Baby Rock Rock book, which is on Marlene Moore you get her picture completely like a man, she was considered to be very nice and people who actually had the opportunity to know her unless her own family whose times were many treated him as a child, except one of his brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you have enough sense to hear those around you who knew you from school you would find out that you were actually injured before you set foot in the institution, you had always defended and what seemed to be unwilling to learn in school environment was true embarrassed about the fact that he could not. Marlene did not deserve the life she was given, for lack of help she needed to receive. It was the government and people around him who were further assisted in his death by not trying to understand his needs and why he did what he did. I am still angry that he was put in prison for defending someone who tried to rape him. As his brother once said, "They did not know what to do with him so they bound him and killed him." I believe it with all my heart. Marry, you are very good.
