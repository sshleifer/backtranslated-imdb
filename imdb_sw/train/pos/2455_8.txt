It is a very good film, but it has also been the American in its predictions. Changing Kung Fu to Soccer and Turkish Family for one Pakistani, and you get to watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) around the area for the area. A good feature that is used as a nail of the movie is the development of a fight with a hidden ninja under the road, and start with a bad loss and slowly continues until the final fight is winning against your soul, as the master Kung Fu stressed several times. At different levels, Denmark's life is exposed to a completely different picture of foreign people: non-native immigrants who make up a large part (actually, many) of Danish citizens, graffiti in Copenhagen neighborhoods, taunting of a migrant girl in the movie prayer. They all show a different picture than someone who remembers when someone hears a word in Denmark.
