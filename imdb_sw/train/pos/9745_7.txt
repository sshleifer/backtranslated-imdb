As someone else said, this is a very good movie. It has a magnificent atmosphere and a wonderful sound of Luciano! I have seen this film many times and I saw again this afternoon. I forgot the song of Pavarotti of Nessun Dorma and I need to get out of the CD! It's a great movie at just the moment during the day was included in the fun and reverie. Eddie Albert is great as an agent with a little up, but all agents are just so. The Italian country is good but there is nothing high on voting. If you need Olivier's balance, this movie is not for you. If you just want to run with the concept of some amazing music, see this film. Just enjoy!
