I often wonder why this series was hit. I thought it was brilliant and also written with cunning to do. I think the next time it will appear in the light you deserve, that's like they provide. Many of the new comedy actors and those who came were seen in this and all continued with many things. Perhaps this truth will make people worth their value and will be given. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and not limited to Julian Rhind-Tutt's Wing Green success. Authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best writers of the modern comedy. Anyone who can produce comedy as Father Ted could not be able to write something that was not worthy to be published. If it is completely released I will buy it.
