Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Just like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can tell them created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who don't have a great love of movies, movies, music and so on would be angry. This is not a normal and amazing television program is too big for some. These people seem to need a little bit more than a line and talk to make them happy. This app explodes with colors, winks on old movie screens, bothers with amazing music and talented performances. There is nothing about the choice made from the clothes to leitmotif. The story takes a lot of speed and it returns but all can be found because the conversation is about love, trust, courage, loss and many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate feature was the end of the show and fled because it pushed the deleted Daisies. Do not approach this as a regular TV show. Think like evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
