I have seen many films, but 'In The Blood Blood' stands alone in class. It is best in each department. The fact that you had a few big stars helps you push up if you care about the characters and their stories, rather than name on marquee. Blake and Wilson turn into a stellar exhibition of duo killers. The fact that many films have been done in real places where crime was done, even within the house, adding additional tablets. Black / white photography reduces feelings and images are very good. There are many excellent movies out there, but if I could only vote one on the list, it is possible to be "In the blood of cold".
