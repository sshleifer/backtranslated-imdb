Probably my movie of all time favorite, self-reliant story, offering and volunteering for good reasons, but not preaching or boring. It has never been an old man, despite being seen 15 or more over the past 25 years. Paul Lukas's work brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of his few responsibilities of mercy, is a joy. Children are, as the grandmother says, more like "wearing midgets" than children, but that makes them more happy to watch. And the mother is slowly awakening to what is happening in the world and under her roof is reliable and amazing. If I had twelve thumbs, they could be "top" for this film.
