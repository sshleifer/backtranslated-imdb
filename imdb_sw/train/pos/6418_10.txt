I loved this movie. It is a definite movie of inspiration. It fills you with pride. This movie has a rental value or worth buying. It should be in every home home. The best movie I have seen for a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is important to Carl Brashear, but the latter gets better. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and a lot of funny lines keep you tuned in. I love a lot of quotes. I spend all the time. They help me to work on what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they should do is work for him. It's a long movie, but every time I look at it, I've never realized that it's as long as it is. I'm very active in it, that goes very fast. I love this film. I watch it every time I can.
