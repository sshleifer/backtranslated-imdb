Antione Fisher's story of insufficiency and child abuse is an inspiration for all of us who have seen or even experienced the problem of infants. When she was lost by an anxious mother, Antonye never met her father. Grow and "church travelers" who use the "n-word" not only awesome and hurt but also as a time of love, as a young man sees how his best friend is killed in hold, permanent racial slurs and hated while serving the Navy, Antone's anger is changed gradually becoming a good force when being organized by a Navy mental intelligence, and love enters his life. The situation in which Anton meets his mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Surprised by an unexpected confrontation, the woman listens silently to the young man to tell her how she lived a life without crime, addicted to drugs, babies left and right, all with her worst form. If the area was not sufficiently capable, one next drive home (and open the flood door): a welcome reception at Anton's home; A number of exciting faces and open arms that declare that he is part of this great family. One of the messages provided by this amazing film is that there are many important and honest people who work to help the unfortunate and unwanted children. Even though some homes and executives do not seem to care and appear to serve themselves, many offer them all. The actor who received an "Antone" file once describing his birth is one of the "bright lights" in the dark of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a French language song, a different choice of headings, as well as additional features and information about reproduction. <br /> <br /> Like Clevelander I appreciated pictures of the area. No matter where you come from, you will be very interested in this biological gem.
