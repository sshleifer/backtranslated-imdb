I thought it was a very clever film. I was so excited and sure I didn't have 'to pray more. In fact I own the film because I didn't return to someone ... What I must do, but I have to put it because of how much I loved it. Also, the fact is not with many foreign films and this is the first. Now, I personally love Finnish things, that definitely added to how much I loved. But in general, it is worth checking. However, if you try to understand Finnish or read a little theme, then this film is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 certainly.
