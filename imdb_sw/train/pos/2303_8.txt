A SON IN MOON is a warm and exciting game of coming up with a farming family in the 1950s. London) who ends with the collapse of her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy changes this family's forever forever. The 1950s are removed with love here and screenplay gives you the characters you come to take care of almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the winning Oscar talent that will continue in this first role with London making a fascinating interesting person. Warfield offers stability to the role of an older sister who is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the parents of girls and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. I was being sent unexpectedly to this quiet and distracting game that emphasizes strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the words "family relationships."
