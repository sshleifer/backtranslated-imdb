Maybe, maybe not immediately before the race of Rodney King, but even a few months before it was enough time. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police were released and the LA ignited. It comes only to show the state of color relations in America. This program has a white Mack (Kevin Kline) and Simon-Africa Simon (Danny Glover) that friends after Simon saves the life of Mack in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a great role) thinks that free brutality is true ... until he gets shot. There is also the presence of films in the movie: Mack and his family realize that they do not live as they want. It seems that the "Crash" is interested in renewed people in the competition, but this was very early. Maybe we won't have a strong race in this country. But any way, "Grand Canyon" is a good movie. It proves Kevin Kline as my famous actress. Also star Maria McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
