When you reach the gem of a movie like this, you realize why '80s were ten years more live thru. Rock songs ruled, and so were the movies ... especially awesome movies. The film writers knew how to please us, & "Trick or Treat" is open to this. When Sammi Curr, who had written more after W.A.S.P. Blackie Lawless singer, died in a hot hotel, his partner's # 1 Eddie, has been broken. He goes to a friend and domestic DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for help. Nuke gives him a copy of the last record that Sammi did; this is the only copy available. It was given a radio station that was designed to live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays, somehow brings Sammi. He helps Eddie and people in school, but goes out of control. It's definitely one great movie. The worst thing is, this film is not published. I paid $ 25.00 to finally remove it from eBay. You should also ... $$ well used!
