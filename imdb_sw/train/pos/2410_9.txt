This film is one of Jesus' most powerful movies. It will not try to tell the whole story, but only to show the interpretation of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is a good dark, players and faithful to traditional Jewish elements and modern interpretation of Scripture. Judah is more common than other specimens, not the evil and evil evil that we sometimes think of, but the very arrogant man, who did not lie in his zeal. Jesus Christ Chris Saranden is a powerful and loyal, devoted and devoted person - very much while also of God. The last conversation has been done carefully and serves as a kind of small talk that two strong men can do when they have just done the punishment. I would like to watch this film again and recommend it to others.
