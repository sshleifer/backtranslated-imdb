In my opinion, this is the best show of standing which I have ever seen. I was a quick fan of Eddie after seeing the kill, but I must say I think this is his best job. I would like to say, however, if you get a chance to go see him live. Ideal! Many times after seeing the suspension schedule several times, jokes begin to age. But I must say, I have seen this show so often that I totally have something whole memorized (which yes, I realize it's kinda sad) but every joke still makes me laugh. This is really good feel. <br /> <br /> Kill the dress will not grow old. I own and look at any time I need a good laugh.
