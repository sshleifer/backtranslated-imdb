It is a story that can be done anywhere in fact, due to the correct situation. Street viewer taking the attention of the famous opera star and the following friendship. An old age girl finds / buys a male child to adopt her art. From there, we follow through the hard of their challenges, but free life on the river. Traveling the city to the city, he does and has a degree of recognition. Despite the times and influence, that person is good and good. Overall, the exhibition is the first, especially Xu Zhu, who shows the road executive. The child (Renying Zhou) is good, and is very strong, and is with much more abuse. Two characters, along with help from an opera singer, Teacher Liang (Zhao Zhigang very attractive), draw a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have described the similarity of this village film and BA WANG BIE JI (MY EXAMPLE); yet this film can not stand easily alone, identical to everything is far away. My only Qualm and King of MASKS, is the end. It was weak, cliche and on craft like a sledgehammer. The listeners were already locked in the story, what is the improper damage? It's a shame. Bring a beautiful picture of a far distance, just dedicated to emotional pathos (and corny) like that. It showed clearly that this film is good, rather than classic, it should be. That aside, the King of MASKS is still very important at your time. I was delighted to see Shaw's Muslims still producing a good film. It is highly recommended.
