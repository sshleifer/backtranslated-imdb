I got the first movie of Bill and Ted for Christmas and I had to get a second when I saw it in the shop. This was (I think) just as funny as the first story but a great wierder. It was funny how they had their own fire and how they played death. What is surprising is that they played with him in dirty games as a clue. The only thing I could change is the Center and Death to be in the band but more than that was good.
