For all the people who have not done anything to complain about discussion, budget, this and the .... who wants to hear? If you have lost the point of this non-good film, that's your loss. All of us who love this film do not care what you think. I am the third person who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this stands in his instrument, in my book. It was not to be a document, or a real account of what happened that night. It is a story of amazing love ever tried. I know that it is modern 90 and the millennium has everyone in the zapzy, but come. One person on this comment board complained that it made a lot of money! What is blind? It made money in every country in the world, and it is the world's most popular film. I will be happy to cooperate with many around this time. Okay, worry, when you crawl under your rock, I have done.
