I am a great Jane Austen fan and instead of being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see if a little left out as much as possible and that you can only be reached in mini-series) is really great. Gwyneth Paltrow actually captures a little clueless but a good rich girl goals and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly and his poise and respect. I was not happy with Ewan McGregor even if I like him as much as an actor but he didn't feel damaged the movie even though. As I said, as a fan Jane Austen there were things I would like to have liked to be seen with who was not but would have made it much longer than permission to feature the length of the film and if it had been I really felt split stories well. I have seen every deal with this book and see this was the best one!
