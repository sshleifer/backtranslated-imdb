The couple (Janet and Richard) are going to the camp outside the forest near the big rock. After the camp and enjoy nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is the abandoned farm house. Recently, a pair of surviving prisoners were shown and, after a very inevitable delay, they continue to build Janet and tie Richard in a plane. This last house on the LEFT film should be one of the most disturbed films made. It is one of the 70-year-olds who are sick and lost. Additionally, I've got this very good and beautiful in a drop of deviation. I love TERROR of CAGED. Real music supports to provide credits with a film and a lot of beauty. I saw the film enough. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 / When I had no thought to stimulate because of the beauty and insist on the film in question, I think it would be many people. Acting is not very good nor is it a talk, at least in earlier cases. This film takes more patience than usual, and not everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a good film. It's not a great movie of fear that I have ever seen, but it is really a great pleasure. It's not very easy to find. It is possible to find it in the most used part of the shops if you are looking hard. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of garbage movies then it's definitely checking.
