Shakespeare Behind the Baa was an amazing and interesting film I saw all year round. It is about the prison program, somewhere in California if I remember correctly, where prisoners have practiced and made Shakespeare different each year for the past 14 years. The film tracks their production of "Rain" due to performance through performance, and in the process we learn some amazing things about these men, all of which are of greater crime. The truth is indeed a stranger than a lie - if anyone tried to fix this story in a false film, the audience never sold it, but knowing that it really makes it a reflection - real; I screamed loudly when I learned about one of the brilliant crimes of felon. It's like a certain part of Oz, and more entertainment because characters and their fantastic stories are real.
