This is a wonderful game about the way of life in Texas's powerful tonk in the 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger offers two reliable exhibitions like Bud and Sissy Davis. This film opens the country's music location and has helped establish America for mechanical cattle. If you like a good romance film, then you will love this film.
