This is the last part we deserve. At the end of the last season, things were left in 'life develops' mood, which was difficult to distribute that this true series deserves. Although it is not a fun show, this series has always made you think (a few on television), and this is not different. What? Death is justified by thinking? 'Is the ethical values ​​of society, or is the society characterized by values ​​that are chosen by a few strong?' 'What is the death of righteousness, and can there be?' All these questions, and more, come from the authors of this weekly show, and this is their last thesis. Good acting, good writing, work of a wonderful camera, good editing, clean leadership. If you have seen the series and lost this at first run, then hold a copy in some way. If you have never watched the series during the race, then this will stand alone, but it can be heavy to try to try and who all the characters and what they cite in their various pasts. For those who were observers of the series in the last two seasons, this is looking for very satisfactory.
