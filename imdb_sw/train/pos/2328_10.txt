Full cinema is few. Even my proposed films are guilty - The rear window looks at a small point sometimes, the behavior of Chris Elliot on the Groundhog day is not working, the music mark in our Best Years of Life is also cheesy, the beginning of the Cabiria Nights is a little slower - but this film is fully released from beginning to end. The script is brilliant, acting is the most beautiful round (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, both are flashlight), leading and photographing enjoyable, and the music mark touches without being intrusive (like some of the Miramax symbols that handle very). Every sad moment is moving the truth, every time the light makes me suffer. That is one of the best films I saw and I would like to have more films like that. I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone to the best after this film, but I am sorry to see that its recent films are more explosive and fragile than this great film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! Must-see.
