I saw this film last night at a special movie show of Nürnberg, and it was very good. I must admit that the composition of the original music player of the cello and the player / xylophone player affected the film's situation, but the film itself was also powerful in the show of the awesome Nibelungen saga. If you are interested in silent movies or in Nibelungenlied, I strongly recommend this film. Clothes were extraordinary and creative, sets were powerful and foreign, and acting was extraordinary and breathing (as is the case of the “events” of silent film) Unfortunately, I haven't seen the first part of this film duo which involves Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after the death of Siegfried, while Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norse versions of the story) begins to plan a plan of revenge against his brothers. Also, I watched this film in German; I am a native English speaker and I have a basic German skills. It was difficult to read the titles (what do you call in silent movies?) For the first time because of the old German script, so I suggest that if you look at German that you are sure you can distinguish your "k", "f", and "s" in the old script. :)
