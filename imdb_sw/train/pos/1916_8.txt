"8 IMPORTANT SURVIVORS ... TO MAKE MY MISSION OF GOD," is my opinion, it's absolutely ABC classic! I don't know I've seen every part, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say the part I liked. However, I think it was always funny when the mishap occurred. I always laugh. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked to show more when John Ritter was a guest. If you ask me, his sudden passing was very bad. Everyone always gave good performance, the production structure was wonderful, the clothes were well organized, and the text was very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network returns to the air for fans of the show to see.
