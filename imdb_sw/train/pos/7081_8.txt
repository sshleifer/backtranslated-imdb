The story of this film is very amazing. The virus is free and only 1% of people are saved. The only thing we know now is that the animals overlap the earth above and there is a place where they say, "Twelve cows did that." In fact, the community had to be underground to hide from the disease that was killed more than 500 million people. It seems that animals do not have this contract. Every day the modern scientist tries to discover what kind of disease it caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or only man created it. They all know that there is a group of animals around the city on them, deaths began in 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least what the poster says.) So, the current suspect, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is sent as a "volunteer" to get samples from above. After making his "volunteer" work, he is asked to go back in 1996 to find out what happened in the world. Cole admits to the story of twelve monkeys starting. At the same time the story of the machine when it gets badly very badly, since 1990, to some time during the 1950s. head to eliminate the story. The whole story has been done well and I would like to give the top grade if not the end. I did not like you at the end of the film and I had lost much. I was looking forward to the end of explaining what happened, but not everyone thinks this way. So I gave 8, but if everyone had the same opinion I would like to give them 6 or 7. <br /> For all film work, I give A +. Bruce Willis is good for this role and does well, but Brad Pitt is 100% quite ideal. His work is so great, he comes into that very well. I never cared for Brad Pitt until I saw him in this Club and Fight. There are characters or similar in this film, he is a little more ... insane in this film. So generally I think this film is quite suitable to look at. For many people it is a great false fiction, just think it's a jewel.
