Although the film is open on the date, the audience can still recognize easily and trouble the bad Buster in this modern and funny funny story. Buster fights against odds for three different years: Age of Stone, Roman Age, and Age of Moden, you play almost the same character as just changing the environment to help us identify the "age" difference. In this film we see one of the first comedic images of discrimination of "caveman", who succeeds his love not for romance but with strong force, with a funny loss on anti-gladiatorial Roman, two comedic drawings which long before that spoofs like Mel Brooks' "World History: Part I". The basic theme of the movie is simple but convincing: Although times can be changed, we are still facing the same struggle even in modern times that we won in earlier times before "winning a girl" (remember this is the head of 1923 America, when chauvinism was still in vogue). It is a pleasure to watch this film more than thirty years later, and think about how things have changed from these “modern times” to now.
