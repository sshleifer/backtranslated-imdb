This is a wonderful movie about the archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. He takes (look really fake) mummy out of the funeral cave and brings home to learn. Well, soon she starts doing a good job and talking to my mother. And soon afterwards his son has the spirit of the mother. Even the incidents of visitors occur when the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. This is true to do, in general, and will make you sleep the first time you try to look at it. But if you're going, you might end up. <br /> <br /> Aha! What is the secret of mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy angry that has been removed from the cave? You can't guarantee what the inspiration of the spirit is, but if you like shenanigans on small budget spots (with 70 hairstyles!) This will have some appeal. The way I have described the story is much more obvious than the way to a self-made, interesting film that sets out stories. Could it be a boring film can be interesting? Okay ... somehow this succeeds. Perhaps this is a good movie for the heart but it has been done in an amazing way. I don't know. What I know is that I enjoyed a little bit, despite her gentleness. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Baby Spider" will be fascinated to know that several music songs from this film are used in this (including the theme song of the theme song) A horrible sequence and beautifully shown by the walls and rocks surrounding themselves and finally attacking some people in the camp. Other events in the movie are just spooky or quirky; but this one place is very awesome. <br /> <br /> Check out this! It's weird and it's worth your time. You can even want one on your shelf.
