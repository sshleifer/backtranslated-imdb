I objected to this film and I understand why it was not a great hit in the movie. "October Sky" feels and looks oh so familiar. And it is. All combinations of conspiracy and sensitivity have been considered before another film - and perhaps even better. But despite the knowledge and resistance of all kinds of Hollywood, this film overcomes and looks on every side. Sputnik is the inspiration of this journey of heart, mind and spirit. Like the characters from Steven Sondheim's MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, they stood agape at their home house expecting to launch their new generation ("What are you doing? You call it a miracle."), Sputnik affects the same as the rocket boys of this story true. When the capital of the 1950 coal town lost this event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as its ticket from life in mines. The best and dedicating trend makes the trip to a young rocket homer and his pals seem clean and new. Those that are particularly affecting the youth of the Homer school teacher. A major obstacle is shown in their stylish relationship. Also wonderful is the father / son supblot that draws the film. It spells perfectly round. Even the mother of Homer gets her time without cliche or entering. The end of her husband is of respect and humiliation. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. The most comprehensive video that I despise has a sign near this film that describes you will like this film or will return your money. At once, I agree with them. You can never look at the sky of October quite the same. <br /> <br />
