I think it takes a lot to tell him to come forward like that. It is unfortunate that when a celebrated person is the one that helps people more. But, in his case, he did what was strange. I have been in the field of mental health for five years and I think it is good that mental illness is not a terrible word again and I believe she helped. I always thought he was good and always would be. I am glad that he wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a wonderful woman and I hope she keeps doing. She has been in many ways and faced with it. I would like to see him working more with children, especially children actors. His illness did not have to happen and I think he would be a mentor for young people. The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched. Suffering TBI that has caused the start of my disease and having PTSD, it is good to know that someone has enough courage to show his life as he did. I believe it has helped this nation and people generally realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Mrs. Duke, or Anna, which you prefer.
