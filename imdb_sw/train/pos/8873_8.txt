This movie came and went into the movie. Because of its nature you can see why it did not receive it well. It was guilty because of its shape more than the actual film itself. Learning Top is not surprising but it was a good film that tried to talk about a fearful issue in the United States: racism. Story / Training: Higher training is introduced next to Malik (played by Omar Epps), a track star who must deal with being not fast, with a powerful professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). He is a friend of Fudge (Ice Cube) with a beautiful woman named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later they end up having to deal with some skin campus. Remy (playing with Michael Rapaport) is a frustrated child who ends up being a friend of the local skin on campus. Once you put their views on it, it becomes like a racist like them. <br /> <br /> Comments: Higher Education does not exist without his mistakes: Character development is not enough, good performances by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and leather leader (name I forgot), Busta Rhymes is not recommended in this film completely. Many women who turn out after being sexually abused by men were clich√© 'before this film to find out I did not like this film by Kristy Swanson. Other than this, this film was not bad half. Laurence Fishburne was as good as Professor Phipps (though I could do without hearing), Fudge was the best of the Ice Cube performance and Michael Rapaport was as good as the confused Remy. All of it was one of the best movies of John Singleton's and it was one of the reasons I was wearing on the trash he is now setting. Cinema requires more movies like Teaching Main, Mississippi Burning and American History of X and small movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and very remake of Shaft.
