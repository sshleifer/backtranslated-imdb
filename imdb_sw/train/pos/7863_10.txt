This movie is an eye opener for those who can only delight the life of the stars. It tells you how people who would like to do good can not. With a bomb explosion area is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and taught just doesn't happen !!! It can add BP to 10% <br /> <br /> All characters played very well. <br /> <br /> Some events can be / can be avoided involving young people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very old person in nature. It is not a movie that can be seen by the family. <br /> <br /> Compose is great !!!
