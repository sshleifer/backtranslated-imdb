Closed: alive burial brings us to a break that has just opened, and will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> We start with a boy in a gear blowing drifts, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that's useless. anyways, he is almost blowing off one very big one, when he sees the rest is open. in spite of his best efforts, the higher authorities tell him his day is over. <br /> <br /> recently, as everyone expects, the sea hits. See, I will not show you again, all I can say is this movie B designed for the family center (which I have just seen, and the fact did not have ads that proves that the movie B) anyways, is a good film very much, but it's not recommended. First, when people were struck by ice and snow, they were buried. not just followed by flour. or, what about CD to screwdriver? impossible. and finally, what I can't stress enough, is that the blast cannot stop the gun, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> more, it is worth renting or watching TV, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie has been tested for PG, but maybe should receive something less. The boy almost lost his leg in the elevator, but his foot is cut off the leg, the boy is selected by the electric and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are sitting next to. <br /> <br /> enjoy.
