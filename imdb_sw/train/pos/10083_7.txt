The fact that this film was published on a DVD is still done - on TV and fuzzy images were very restricted to many films ...... and so on. This deserves better treatment. The story is about the conception of the road who needs a child to adopt his trick (the rules of the day) and the wind and the little girl instead (not usually the way) .... and the problems that make up the future. The old man bought a child auctioned slave and soon gets a child is not a boy, which certainly thought it was a case. The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of look-funny and the tooth-lost tooth and grin infections. The little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is cutie. how these two manage after that little to be done in the last minute of 15. <br /> <br /> Overall, it involves a complete story and game, doubt, humor and sadness. Until it comes out of a large mirror, lease.
