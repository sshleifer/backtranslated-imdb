Surely this is a wonderful show, done in a way, like the movie Tim Burton. It's worth checking, if it's more creative than this season's exhibition. Better, not "real" show. I am wondering why the public view is ready to accept such a show (which is not creative) and ignores such amazing displays as this actually has a creative design. <br /> <br /> While some decide the base, I think it's very common. More interesting than "Spirit Whisperer" and "Out". I think it's something funniest on the tube since "My name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, with stories and music is amazing. If you like to enjoy it shows that it is far from the beaten path, I would recommend. It's not surprising if Twin Peaks was, but it has a great kink for it.
