One of the best movies I saw in the last five years! Healing is an interesting everywhere in the story of a little love and courage on the eastwestern part of New York City and two leading superstars in making. Love, charming, sad and provocative, this is a very enjoyable young city that places a shtick of a long stretch of Larry Clark into a shell where it is ... although it must be acknowledged that Bully was cut on its normal fees. Lift Victor Vargas is one film you will find for missing ... so don't forget!
