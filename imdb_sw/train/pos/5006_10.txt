I remember defeat on this special time of channel-surfing in 1965. I've never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought "This might be the best thing on TV that I will see in my life." 42 years later, which has taken the truth. There is still something amazing, so honestly wonder if the talent shown here. You can talk about all the stars you want, this is the highest of all! <br /> <br /> You call the name, can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is actually the story of the story. His ability to pull anything he tries is a story. But this special was given at the beginning, and helped to create a story that she quickly became. Despite growing so far in a very short time, he has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of his talents while he continued. But they are all here from the beginning. You can't despair in watching this.
