This is the next low-down film Jack, an uncomfortable person, as he walks through conversation, is visited by dead friends, isolates himself out of the building, and often, he cannot tell the truth from the invention. br> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really reliable. Confusion and fear but firm and, sometimes admit to what he sees, we follow him trying to solve what he sees and find a way to sleep. Establish a dog talking (other genius) and children who appear suddenly in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any information about how they got there (more than hallucination) and you have an interesting, cyclical mind, minute 43 And the swimming area is sufficient to get a fan of Dom coming for more.
