The children I took from this film were loved (four children, aged 9 to 12, would give 10 stars). Emma Roberts was delightful in the role of the head. (He expects to see more of this generation of Roberts later.) After being exposed to Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, there was a joy to enjoy a girl who was not seen as she did local work. They also enjoyed seeing the support associated with Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with comeo of Bruce Willis). Final extraction: a good film. (Note: I've never read a series of book, so my opinion is based on the effectiveness of the film only.)
