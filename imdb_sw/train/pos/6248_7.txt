Being Austrian himself has been dropped directly into my face. Fortunately I do not live anywhere near the place where this film is done but unfortunately shows everything that Austria hates the people of Viennese (or people around the area). And it is so easy to read that this is the intention of the directors: let your head go into your hands and say "Oh my god, how that can be!" No, not for me, (in my opinion) the widespread swinger of uncensored club is not necessary, I look at porn, indeed, but in this context I was more concerned than putting it in the right environment. <br /> <br /> This movie tells stories about how they deceived people who suffer from a lack of education or a bad company trying to live and live in a world of deficit and boring borizons. A girl who is treated as a sexually active partner (and still continues to return), a female teacher who gets her eyes by putting her "most powerful" partner on the line, an old marriage that has almost every cycle mathematical day (he is the "official legacy" of his ex-wife), a couple who have left a divorce with the former husband faced the actions of his ex-wife clearly having a relationship with his masseuse and finally hitchhiker who asks his drivers a non- usually and sets their nerves to be just awesome. When you see it you hear anything. You don't even have to be shocked, sad, sad or feel like doing anything ... Maybe that's why I have put 7 points, so it makes me feel the way I have never responded to. If that is good or bad it is up to you!
