I am 14 years old, so maybe you'll think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. The boy is right. I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won the College Award for him. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten years old. I saw the movie Oh, God soon and loved it. This was also very amazing. George Burns did a great job. Walter Matthau (this is the first time I have seen him doing). And although they had very little responsibilities, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That specific were the movies that would be wonderful if it was actually done. Let me say this, if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie immediately!
