Surprise is not terrible and for beauty to one of Disney directly to the video to throw off sequels. As the previous verse (The Lion King 2) was pleased to have Disney brought back the original sound artists that made a big difference and they maintained a good quality of traditional animation. Layout rotates for a while but we are distracted by the non-joke rope starting from hularious to quicker. In order to break down the plot and joke they gave us a silly music program, which resembles a joke, comes out of entertainment for a quick trip to the fridge. For many parts MST3K-like time is bland and full of untapped capabilities and actually not add a whole lot to the movie instead of doing like a long flashback drive. The new characters are at least pleasing, and the former characters are doing their work so I can't cause them there. In general this movie is not bad and makes the frivolous filling good among the big names of the Lion King.
