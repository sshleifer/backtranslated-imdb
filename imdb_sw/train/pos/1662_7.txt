Artemisia film can be considered to be anger, or as a true artistic license. Who / who can fly? In the written history, Gentiki Artemisia was standing down, and still confirmed that he was r *** ed, like Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem has proved with skill. <br /> <br /> In the movie, under different torture, refused to accuse her boyfriend / oppressor. <br /> <br /> What! How much can the movie be lost from the history that has received, still informing the human heart? The answer is not hard to find. In the film, the director and cast were filled in the hole in the historical record, and the power of thought. That led to a conclusion that differs from the record. It should be so. I get a _both_ record and a movie to be compelling. In all movies and (apparently) in history, Artemisia was a painter, before all. <br /> <br /> For this vision, made in the filming (ra), I'm really grateful. I have seen a film that encouraged my eyes. David Broadhurst
