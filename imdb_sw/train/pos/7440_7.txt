Just seeing the movie, and the horrible thing was, people are talking when the movie was hit as characters. The movie had its time, but also lagged and was rather ill. It was meant to have a farce, but as soon as you see the worries of people in the movie, you think yourself "People like this are around us" All attempts to find the sympathy of viewers are beaten if actors do one thing stupid after another. On the other hand, there are serious insults (and surprising). I think I would wait a video - but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes his shirt during the movie! (not good eyes!)
