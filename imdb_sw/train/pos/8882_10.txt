John Singleton's films of the best film, before Shaft's detachment, this is a movie that creates a balanced and mysterious view of the 3 main stories, each having problems identifying young people. The most popular is that it also addresses the problem of independence among young people, a problem that is not overlooked by the media and other films that focus on social and economic problems and whites. This film shows that white people can be the same as ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this film is that it deals with many topics without getting deep. It is not just about racism, but about how difficult to adopt a new world (college), date rape, sex detection and separation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each give the best performances, and hand cures are the same as Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college campus and cause little violence. The worst is a caricature of professor and Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Indeed, most professors are nutty. But not as flat. Skin fibers are also a bit of caricature, but I think they are as well as in real life. Overall the slide of the bottom film down, if you liked American History X you would like this. <br /> <br /> 8,5 out of 10
