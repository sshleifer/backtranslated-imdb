Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex, and exciting movie that existentially refers to what exactly a line tag says :. LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film category can focus on the frustrated girls of the film if someone looks at them from different angles. Thinking about the following: <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not going to go through the film area and location, so I'll need to explore my orders, (and welcome your ideas) but try this and see it as a film does not come into place: What? Now, I'm not talking about the piece as described by the 'Plumber', since that sequence itself could be really interpreted as a rationalization within the mind / dream / unconscious state David Aames, but ganga really between truth and dream. It seems to me that the real car crash, so it is another (no explosion, for example) is likely to 'ganga' point, and that any particular sequence containing existential / dream / unconscious / non-existent The realities of its feel - if it's shown the screens before or after the accident - in fact it is a part of a private Aames journey towards self-indulgence in his own mind. <br /> So, then, we are left with two very last questions (if you know more, let me know): it's a really realistic Aames, and where do you wake up <br /> <br /> If you do not get quite tied up in a real chain of details in? The plot, or exactly why his dreams are scattered, this movie becomes a fascinating search for man on a journey to find himself and that means in today's pop-culture society. <br /> <br />
