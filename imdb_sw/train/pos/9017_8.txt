This film has a great job to show the patient's ALS (Lou Gehrig's) problem. The lesson has been done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is an influential person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that he was just doing it. Kenneth Branagh, a good actress, lives as a quirky artist who performs evil and is forced to give the relationship to Helena as a part of "social service", an alternative to prison. Looking at the development of the relationship between these two is treating from beginning to end. Tha the fact that it is the text of the text does not prevent wonderful displays. One comes to care for them both.
