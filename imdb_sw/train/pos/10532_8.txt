Make the world go. Take off my shoulder. Say what you have said, and make the world leave. Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a string, one for emulation, and another for kissing the baby. Nor was he guilty, but faced with the charges and their house on the burst, they ended up, well, no. The whole world, except for their home, left. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of weird, but funny, too. What? What would you do if you were alone in the world? Two friends enjoy each other's company, and do what they want. But, that comes quickly, it seems. It begins to improve their lives by hating remote records. The effects of the voice at this time were huge. <br /> <br /> Things have been good at the end. This film was a product of good ideas, and written and guided by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of two stars. We must see.
