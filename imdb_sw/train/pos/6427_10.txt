If you like to enjoy ... and want to just relax and enjoy ... claimed Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started well ... but Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... amazing moments for the delivery of good conversation ..... led by the boys of Bad ... but has Indian Masala. .. people think it may be uncomfortable and ignorant ... but the fact that David Dhavan leads and Govinda is working ... should not raise any questions ... proposed movies in one form (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero no.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Ek Ek Gyarah.
