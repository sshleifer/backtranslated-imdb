Greetings again from the darkness. What an excuse ... an exciting thing that is quite interesting! The new girl of "IT" Rachel McAdams ("Crashers of the Wedding" and "Register") guides during the screens in this beautiful hero of classic concern from the director of the famous cinema of Wes Craven ("Scream" movies and "Night Night over" Elm Street "). Craven even has come as one of the passengers on the plane. What does this one work, is the first 15-20 minutes of the first time we see McAdams communicating with 4 or 5 people or someone or on the phone. He is natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow in the "Batman Begins") in what appears to be happening, the film takes flight. Look at the two types of flirt when viewers know something wrong is alcohol, it's making a film decision! The flight board is a mesmerizing and 30 minutes more than the board is very claustrophobic. Craven prevents us from thinking about the participation of others and if anyone comes to rescue them. As with most exciting, only being allowed occurs at the peak when sheep become a superhero. The interesting device makes us believe the little Rachel needs to be confused by seeing this, but we can't help but get a little involved. The previous events include angry hotel guests, ambitious passengers, Cillian's injury and FX hotels. The power of the film is in the development of character and psychological games between heads. Sadly, the good shepherd of the Brian Cox screen is less than to use, but in general this is on an amazing average excited value to see all but finale.
