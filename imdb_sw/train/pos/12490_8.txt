Allen and Julie enter the cabin in the mountains after their daughter was killed one night. No one knows who killed the little girl but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple goes into this cabin and haunted by people who committed suicide and no one in the nearest town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of fun and has many places that made me fly. Some places are predictable but once in time there is a place that I didn't expect. It was a very good movie that was not the worst movie in the world but it was still scary to do it well. I also loved the last because you have left the viewer to decide how it ends. It is also a kind of sad movie such as a very disturbed movie.
