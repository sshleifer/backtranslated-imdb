This last video of Dutch speaking of Verhooven has made me beautiful. As a buff film to watch all the small details and cross reference etc. in any movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses. I have not read Gerard Reves, which the film is standing, but I still believe we get a picture of a poet / candidate candidate who reveals himself (through - no damage here). The hero to fight around the characters who have enough goals, as he has. All of this in a well-written cinema, Paul Verhopven can turn otherwise instead of "gesellich (?)" Dutch sites being a film-black environment, amazing!
