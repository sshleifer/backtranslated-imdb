Why Dynamo did not have any pants? Where to go? Never explained. That's why this film was so amazing. Plus Starsky gave his children AIDS! Great job too. Richard Dawson deserved winning Actor Best Supporting! A I D S My favorite line from the film is "That spot" A I D S. This movie was for "airplane". I tried to give this movie "stinkeye" but continued to play. What am I doing wrong ??? !!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like it to show. Why Dynamo was not wearing pants. I know his hand was skewered but ... What is it and those future futur nets. Why is it not a family of Ray Combs to get a net? He could use one. AIDSSSSS
