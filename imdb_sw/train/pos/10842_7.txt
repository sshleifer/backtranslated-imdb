So I used "Still Crazy" instead. When I beat Hardcore's comments to a boy in a video store, he said it looked like Crazy. So I used it. I was desperate? Well, if Crazy still focuses on the fake of the classic rock instead of the punk band, but that's the same. Crazy still tells the story of the Wonderful Fruit, a broken rock band in the 70's at the peak of their popularity in the great rock festival. Twenty years later, all members of the band are struggling to make life, and are given the opportunity to play the festival during the twenty years of this festival. They take a commitment and decide to fix it on a permanent basis, visit Europe in the process. Some of the most amazing hijink takes place, and all the characters pass through the change of craft. To watch this film, you feel more like a viewer of the carefully planned document than a participant. And that's not so bad.
