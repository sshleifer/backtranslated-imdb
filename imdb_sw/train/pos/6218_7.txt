79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did nothing but a good film together. Although this is not one of their best, it's the best music. There are a few of the mobile numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make two amazing performances earlier. Ball is very good, and blonde too. "Let's see the face and music" is one of the best duo numbers for music forever. Harriet Hilliard, better know as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" has a sister of Ginger Roger. The basic lesson is normal, but by giving us this unique, it works. Best patterns of art and logo.
