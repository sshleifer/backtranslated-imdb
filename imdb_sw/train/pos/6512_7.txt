My son's sitter was a fan so I saw many old moments when growing. It's not a fan of Scooby Doo so I don't know why I left the TV when this show was displayed. To my surprise I saw it enjoyable. For me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * eliminates tomatoes from the fans of others * so I would have them just concentrate on those two. However, this can cause natural fans to show dislike. I like the voice that does, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked to listen to him even before I knew it was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi tells me if he enjoys his work as an actor. I also get a kick out of the techies with their little autistic habits and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or make out scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show, of course).
