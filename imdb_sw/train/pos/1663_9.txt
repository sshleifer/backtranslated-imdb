I enjoyed every time this beautiful film and I was fascinated by a female painter I have never heard before. So I began to explore his life and work later. As could be expected, I realized that the film was not exactly correct in history. I was surprised a bit however very badly about the film because this is not correct. Come, people, the film should not be biography (nor novel!). Any historical film distorts the truth, because it should be a work of art for its own right. The film director has the right to use objects from fact and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a good film and I think it has brought many people (including some that now offer negative comments) to explore the life and work of this artist.
