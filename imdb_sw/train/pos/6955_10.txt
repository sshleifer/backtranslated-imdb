My X-Girlfriend is a one-on-one car ride. Specific effects were excellent and the dress Uma Thurman wore they had a bear. Uma Thurman is a comedic actress who came down but confirmed everyone wrong and put her columns like a girlfriend. He was just a FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also as good as the average Joe but he was a brave man working with one of the most executives of all time. This support was especially good especially Anna Faris who was very good (Better than in the franchise of Scary Movie). Ivan Rietman did very well to lead this film because if it wasn't for him and Uma Thurman this film would not do well. This film is open 10/10 for cast (Uma Thurman), is a director, is a screenplay and from a natural plot line. This film is highly recommended.
