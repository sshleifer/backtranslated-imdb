This should be the best film I've ever seen. Join the interesting and effective movies with the promotion field, and you have a hub. Dog Dog Dogs had me blowing my seat during certain events, repeating the fear of others, and letting me lie with my tears after the horror. <br /> <br /> The movie left me a great feeling. It is a horrible warfare events that have varied rapidly with the "love" highly poignant and bidding events. The film should not be at the level of Cat III (fraud); no nude events, and 'love' screens do not involve kissing or 'do'. The message that this film has shown me? All mankind, regardless of violence or violence can be seen, they have a tendency to tend. Edison Chen does a better job of playing Pang killers. <br /> <br /> I'm hitting this 10/10 film. It's a look-should.
