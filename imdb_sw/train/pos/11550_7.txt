If you are looking for the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will have a wonderful comedy. As it is, I have seen it as a good movie, which is not small and focus on the comics set by opening events. In order to put it gently, this film has a dreary start that was not ordinary funny, or even upbeat. Once the objects get lazy, however, you have left with a comedy that still lives well after more than three decades. Certainly worth checking out, especially if you are a little fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their original work.
