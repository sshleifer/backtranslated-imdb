Very good restructuring of novel and amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai have given them their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural flair in movies and I felt that way. It seemed like a bollywood eventually gave off it is pleasant and had some of the best quality performers on the screen. The content of the video, the movie shows very much what happened at the time of the distribution by showing the suffering of a particular family and also shows that loyalty in one's life goes beyond religion. The best place is not the game of losing and melodrama. I just loved it.
