Long film about the most important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these whites who did not live in apartheid, who actually died long before their normal time. Already an old film though it does not show the importance of Biko, what he represented. His life and teachings have been reduced, with very good words. When the film was released in 1987, the aim was to push South Africa on the edge that makes him free. So the film aims to show how South Africa's apartheid apartheid does not like, in 1987. This film should look beyond the death of Biko, thus introducing its discussion not on Biko but with a white and run journalist. who lives. His escape is important because of the abuse he is a victim, with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and that can only happen in England. Film shows a way to escape South Africa, while racism is still standing and killing. So don't try this way to be true and true. Couldn't be. But the film is too old because it does not show South Africa and any historical distribution, the identity held under Nelson Mandela's presidency and what is called forgiveness gave those who want to be forgiven say up and forth. The film is strong and emotionally but this historic limit causes it to be weak today, especially because the film will not mention the third ethnic group, Indians. All films or films have the same destruction: they are looking for someone to have a picture from one view. That explains why the film is so old, it seems to come from a long time ago, as if nothing had changed completely. Remake is important.
