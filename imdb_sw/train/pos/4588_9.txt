Rated PG-13 for abuse, humorous humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13 + (must be G) Canada home video rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I have seen the Police Story several times now. he did because he did not like other police films he had to have a star that was a guardian. Acting is not so bad and the plot is very good. t remember the plot well because I saw this film back but what I remember is this film has a lot of great steps, stunts and comedy just what Chan film beautiful needs. Runtime: 106min \ t
