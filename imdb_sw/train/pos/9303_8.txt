When you see this film you should realize that it's not an ordinary movie. It has no real story of characters, a group of gangster characters who come together in perfect harmony. Talk is wonderful, you can just put back and listen. The film shows why it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. That is why the user's comments on this film are mixed. <br /> <br /> I for one I love the film and suggest it to all who love the same liners and things that differ from the "normal". We cannot put a finger on what is so strange about it is a wonderful world where hurricane forces dominate. Place of love and danger. Movie which you can see more than one time.
