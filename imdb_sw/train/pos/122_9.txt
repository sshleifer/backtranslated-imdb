I had lost my faith in recent films made by the traditional Genre Hollywood film. The story line fails, and the camera function is copied only from the last flavor film. But then I saw Zentropa (Europa) and my faith was renewed. It is not just a fascinating story but the use of color and black and white is stimulating. The author (Max Von Sydow) takes you through a trip to every step of the path and leads you into Europe. Unlike many films are not cut after a second show (for example) a knife but lets you look at the beauty that destroys but the feeling of the end of the person. I think we can take something different from what this film is trying to say but it's certainly worth taking time to know what it means. I would like to talk more about the film for anyone who wants to email me. Enjoy!
