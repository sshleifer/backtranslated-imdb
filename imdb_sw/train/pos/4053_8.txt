I remember this love more than the Nausicaa of the wind valley when the story of the story was very bad to me. Laputa, whose name appears to have affected his release in U.S. to avoid the confusion of its total audience of Spain, has a knack of the cartoonish of Conan's first production director. In fact, Pazu has a skeleton with an immortal power of Conan - who gave us a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and came to his feet, then began to run. This makes it more pleasant and interesting to watch. Techie's fans of Nausica can be disappointed with flying bugs and retro technology via Laputa - exclusive discrimination can be a robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Wind Valley, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to the environment. If it has a head all the time it is fighting a war. The importance of living in general - this is associated with a flying fort, has been discussed for a while, and has not been followed. In general, I now look at the piece as being at the intersection between feel good and corny.
