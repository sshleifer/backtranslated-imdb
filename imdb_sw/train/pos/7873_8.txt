Page 3 is very interesting and stimulating to the eyes of the eyes which subtlely demonstrates the life of the hypocrisy of Mumbai. From artificial kiss for waiting for the nose, leaving the stones uninhabited in revealing the terrible life of the rich and famous. Return, rumors, corruption, and scandals in every dark corner in the glitz world and glam. Humanity and generosity are similar to the oasis in the desert in this world where Darwinism of the Society is thought of now. Everyone has a desire to get more money, more popularity, and high reputation, leading them to do more shameful things to consider from signing films on funerals for children. Anything is possible in this city where there is a very large gap between community classes. The audience sees the evil of all these classes through the eyes of the main character. He sees the breathing and frenzy state of mind that the community lives. Sounds, journalists' business, politicians, and all madness have interacted in total confusion! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a good song such as Peppy Main Doob Main Jaongi. Bad films and excellent character development!
