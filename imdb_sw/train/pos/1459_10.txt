Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen an unconditional document on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: UNIT IN CHINA. The film has zero animation and combines the image reviews and interviews with four young Chinese workers living in the factory factory. They play with fingers, jump string, and dance. However, most of their days and nights include work, work, and work - but the work of their work focuses on strengthening and looking at. The owner of the factory in China is very unlocked, however admits to home the effects of globalization when "punishing" workers. The incredible track of Mardi Gras from China to Carnival, the film shows how local is connected with the world through a stimulating and attractive way, stimulating footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting features of this film is the introduction of the culture of the staff and the writers of Mardi Gras to each other through photos. Here, the film comes full circle and shows how the image can be a point of communication and change. The movie should not be preached, not a runner, and allows everyone's opinion. At the end, we - the audience - will make our decisions about the complexity of the film, and the globalization.
