As a white woman I can still realize that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best participants. anyone who accepts his or her work as in the Basic Cover can enjoy watching this wonderful kind of actress. Since I think this is its beginning to lead can prove even more interesting. All works are quite good. If you can't take the world of Manhattan junky or the fact of a life of crime (not the glory of shooting action em-ups) then this is not a favorite film. It is Mr. Fishburne a typical contribution to wonderful relationships. I would like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins going to each other on a certain day in the movie.
