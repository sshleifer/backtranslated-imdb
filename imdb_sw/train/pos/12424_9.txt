I would always want David Duchovney to go to the movie business, and finally did, and made me proud. This film lived for what I expected. Duchovney played his character very well, with the ability to stay consistent with something new, instead of playing the Agent player we are using. So, I give him more credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone playing that character. David was the chief, but none compared to the psychological Timothy Hutton. Very good performance that cannot be tired in all movies, because it will not surprise you. He has weaknesses and strengths, making the story more reliable. I was also very excited about the information, added the story to a good deal, and I had some of the quotes that I did not remember at all. This movie also had a wounderfull logo. I recommend this to anyone who loves drama, and does not know blood.
