CREEP is a terrible awesome film set at real time that doesn't want nothing more than just showing people attacked in an empty subway platform with mutant for 85 minutes. And it just makes it. No more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith shows the game as far as he can set for a series of characters who actually have a reason to be on the highway after being closed. It also creates the nature of Creep with a deliberate (illegally illegal occurrence that occurs in 60 years underground) and that a bit of secrecy works in a large part. Unfortunately, he is disrespectful to the end, actually standing from the end of life where the most difficult of nature will be seen (also said). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted to clich√©d twist to finish! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as a frightening female and all others are well beaten.
