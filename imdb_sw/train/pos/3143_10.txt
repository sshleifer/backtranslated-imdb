If any show in the last decade is worth 10, this is a normal gem. It enables us to escape back when things were easier and more enjoyable. Filled with heart and laughter, this show makes you laugh through three decades of difference. The furniture was bad, the clothes were colored, and even the drugs could be worthy. The hair had chains, the music accompanied by the roller skate, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "the part of the joint was a bad place that". Take a trip back to the greatest time in American history. The fall of love with the characters and the essence of a good feeling of a small town where people were good to each other. This classic is on television as well as "Full House". Do not miss, and always remember "Shake your object of groove !!!"
