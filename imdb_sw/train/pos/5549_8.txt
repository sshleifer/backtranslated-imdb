Silent film The glory of the Family involving Mary Pickford had to be put on a false island off the Scotland coast. In fact, most of the outdoor shots were held on Marblehead Massachusett on the Marblehead Neck near several areas of the sea water area including Churn and Castle Rock. My original interest in the film was because of two things: 1) the film's Marblehead film in my town and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was employed as Mary Pickford's position when copying several movies "cliff area ". Both women were small (5 ') in the situation with both my father and grandmother were associated with the fact that she was standing with him back to the camera for a cliff area as part of the Chiefton to set movies. I just wanted to tell this story to movie historians and later. The film itself (a copy of my DVD is slightly smaller) has been made well by many actions and acting speaking including several events where Miss Pickford shows the character of a strong woman. I enjoyed it and would like to get the best copies even though I don't know if there is one like I saw in the various films that the remaining copies are dark because of the deterioration. Very good films of the genre of silence and many steps!
