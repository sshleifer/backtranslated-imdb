It was not sure to expect from this film. I love watching Brosnan in any movie, he is good every time, but this was quite different. He is a mess, and plays it very aggressive. In fact he reminded me a few times back in unity :) Yes, there is not much violence, there is not a lot of practical, but the talk is lost, acting is very good and very comforting, and it is also very good :) ! I was hit ", but it will be exciting after enjoying a good film. It can't ask more than that. It is worth it, and if you are lucky, some of the dirt will place ads again with evil and will be interrupted, hit down, change ( with an interrupted sound) advertising! Brilliant. There is no look like ad Jack Daniels where the drink goes back into bottles from glasses and gruff American "Twin Peaks" definition :)
