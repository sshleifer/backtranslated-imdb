Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is sentenced to the murder of his unbelieving wife. The night he was killed was out with a mysterious woman who refused to give her a name. After being charged with murder, police visit all the places he had, but people only remember when he was alone. He is sentenced to death by his secretary (Ella Raines) tries to find the killer because he loves her. <br /> <br /> This was done as a B movie from Universal (see characters - all characters with one star - Franchot Drop - on decline). The budget was small and sent out, but what came out is one of the best 1940 movie films. It goes quickly and looks just amazing. And there is an anti-jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. which comes just on the screens and the amazing sex energy (wondering what censors did not reduce). There are only a few errors that prevent this from being perfect. Drop provides bad performance. He appears suddenly and he is just awesome. Also Curtis is hard and bland like Henderson. You really wonder why plants love him - he is so odd. But Raines is good in the lead role. He is good and alive. Also the last area when the killers are after his rings never. He is hardly a physical threat and its effect is only apparent. I still give you this 9 very good film - lacks the right.
