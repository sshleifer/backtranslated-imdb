Regeneration is a good part of Season 1. A new birth, in my opinion, is cool. The more I watch, the more I like it, however it will not happen on 'Very good' for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as part of the new birth. Otherwise, I will now tell you what is right and wrong about this part, <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami. Oh! <br /> <br /> That fish tank was good. =] <br /> <br /> Posted on the window. Especially. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: Your wife is the most beautiful! O_O <br /> <br /> What pick pick random for regeneration. <br /> <br /> Why a husband who died to have his scarf tangled up, try to take his scarf off instead <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Accurate parts, not very memorable. 7/10
