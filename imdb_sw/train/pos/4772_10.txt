This movie is perhaps a touch and promote more that I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a piece of art like this movie can give me a religious experience. One knows that there is a meaning of life. I must admit that when I first heard about this film I was worried. I thought the plot was released and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But being a fan of David Lynch I decided to do it. It took 30 minutes to be fully connected to the movie, but I completely lost it. There is much wisdom and warmth in this film! I left the idea of ​​the movie that I learned something important about life. This is not an example of David Lynch's film, and it was somewhat strange that he should make the film after examining the dark sides of human nature for many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he can express deep feelings and great human knowledge because I thought he was very successful in the Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors around and I think Mystery Stories are better yet. 9.5 / 10
