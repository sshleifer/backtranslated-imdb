All I can say is, if you love Big and Little Edie after watching this film, then you're not a human! Even after watching it for the first time, I walked. It is a skillful experience that is difficult to explain, if I'm sure other fans will witness. After looking at it, you cry to think that these two wonderful women are no longer with us. Of course we have Gray Gardens to remember! I think we all wish to have these freedoms these two women were taken. Although I have always accepted Jackie Onassis Kennedy, he doesn't live in your heart the way to Big and Little Edie. What are the treatments rarely have people like these; I just liked to have!
