"Fear in Settings" is a very unknown movie from Elia Kazan's director and was held before his classic masterpieces as "Streetcar Name", "In Waterfront" and "East Eden". Kazan has already won Oscar in 1947, before this film, so it was not known then. Still "Fear in Settings" is more than a film changed under the radar. <br /> <br /> Something big about this movie is a script to win Oscar. It has a very good idea and its very exciting livelihoods for the crime of crime / film-black. Talk in this film is also quite amazing and offers the movie feel of reality and honesty. <br /> <br /> Unknown mission (especially when given) but still there is Zero Mostel and Jack Discovering in one of their first film roles. Especially gently attracts as a tough gangster, with a very strong face. Still the film causes little to some points. The movie starts very well but after starting the movie slows down and not always makes the right decisions in terms of speed and view view stories are from. However, "Fear in Settings" is still a suitable movie, especially because of its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the movie to be honest to watch. For fans of this exciting type is a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
