This is a concert festival of TV based on fear that gets right. On Friday the 13th was not connected to the movie. Poltergeist heritage: I am not sure. It can be connected to privacy and movies. It feels like they just give us a popular title on the show so fans will look. <br /> <br /> Shows Freddy to be burned by parents Elm on the street (in part 1 I believe) and the amount of parents were disappointed. With all the children he has set up in the first 3 movies, you expect to have more parents. But oh well. <br /> <br /> Freddy is essentially the author of the show. He looks at the actions of people in the real world sometimes involved in some way. Like other anthology shows as a story from crying, there is a common problem of surprise or surprising. It does not exist but believe it or not: violence sometimes passes the movie. This period took several seasons and was done throughout the 4th movie when I heard it was canceled because of the protest parents. I looked at so many things that were tested as a child, so his shy parents had to destroy everyone. More than 4 movies came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
