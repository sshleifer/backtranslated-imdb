The dirt and fraud experts feel it is "a great cry from Deica's best" Those suffering from a severe lack of innocence will have difficulty connecting with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke directly. Its Italian does not have a private survey of modern Italian film writers, or Pietro Germi's private inquiry, the gentle gentleness of Mario Monicelli, a Visconti reminder or a cold Antonion observation. De Sica told us a story as a father sat beside the bed of his children before going to bed. No mental attempt. Miracolo A Milano and at a minimum Il Giudizio Universale are true stories, or what we are today we call the authenticity of magic. The movie is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is a kind of behavior that you accept with a heart but that, usually, requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its pure form. Great.
