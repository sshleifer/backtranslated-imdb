This movie is one of the most funniest, sad and thoughtful images that seem to have grown again in the Balkans, 45 years after the time shown. All characters and common disputes are given with anger, sadness and love as together that it is impossible to decide whether a cry or laugh will be the most appropriate answer. The fact of being shown by such a shortage, however, make a great film to see if someone wants to understand a bit of what had already lost Yugoslavia to his spirit. In fact, no diplomat involved in the area should try anything until they see this film, and its twins, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Have I mentioned it one of the funniest movies I have seen?
