The 1997 Fee College of Low Fool's seemingly free choice of movies no one can bother to repeat for the series. Drifter lost, lost (Thomas Jay Ryan) emerges in the city. His rantings of anarchistic and fraud encourages the garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry is trying to ask the sister's sister (Parker Posey). If the poet succeeds, Henry decreases. No special about characters or stories. The Harold's and Maude Spirit had already been quoted above to make a screen. But Parker Posey is not an ordinary Queen of Indies for anything '. So when the author / director Hal Hartley came to the new body for his cast, the film was born. Although we are faced with the same characters as many years, they are in a different kind of dark comedy; this man has gone ridiculous! Henry can be a global spy - and it is possible twice, or even three, an agent - for years before meeting with others. He may have died or hid from agents and authorities of many countries. Everyone wants a walking magazine, an unknown journal that could have hidden secrets that could undermine nations and economies. Posey's Fay is either a woman who has left to go to the lights, or his widow, according to who speaks the truth. Fay's attempts to get Henry and / or controversial papers include the international gauntlet of international people and characters every time. He never knows who to believe or believe. Nor are we. When organizing these impossible characters in Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan, the Hartley script continues to be the most humorous appearance of their first appearance, describing a clear slapstick during the exposure to physical risks. Its slide lights of paranoia, duplicity and musical seats of the geopolitics of today begins to decline to the end. However, fans of the first movie will be very surprised by the invention of ways to recycle Hartley. (5/18/07)
