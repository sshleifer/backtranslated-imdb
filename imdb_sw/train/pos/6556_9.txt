I enjoyed this film. I am a father of a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletes and talented. I want my girl to work so well to solve crime and help others! So for me, maybe this is the standard PG Fantasyland. I read many books of Nancy Drew in my teen years, long, past. Surely this character was sent by Emma Roberts but it was not like Nancy Drew I remember from books. That's due to the script, not to act. Emma is a good young man, striving to be self-confident, strong and proud with good habits and good taste. He is not caught in the competition competition around him. There are some weaknesses in the layout, far from not the same as Nancy Drew's Books, and trying to learn what the commission is. (If, what is CAR, Anyway?) This is not one of its best responsibilities, but I will continue to look for more films. Rachael was too old to lead this, but he did a good job as a young man among the secret. I'm very disappointed in some reviews written here. Others expect a full relationship with books, others expect a more reliable or adult film. I've got what I expected! Good entertainment focuses on young people, and their fathers who want good children and high standards of morality and success. This is a PG Movie, not James Bond! What do you want for the boy's model for your boyfriend?
