He only saw this version of Guys and Dolls of Frank Loesser for the third time with my mother who has never seen this before. He was very happy with the singing of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And he thought Havana series where Simmons and Brando dance on the storm were better. That was very surprising to me and often was the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the film that happened as the story of Damon Runyon takes time for the slow action of non-musical events at first but puts you in time. Another story by Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not for me but they still had their additions especially when the "Sue Me" number. He also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You Rocking the Boat" numbers and exhibitions Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. By looking at the exhibitions around, Boys and Dolls are not much music videos but they are really very good.
