During the Kurt Weill ceremony in Brooklyn, WHAT DOES? finally opened to the investigation. It's amazing that the motion of the motion, from any time, which has the Weill-Gershwin partnership may not exist from the screen. The mark is standing, and CD devices, and Gershwin and Weill, shows only its features, which are great. Yes, the film has its problems, but the mark is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this fantasy music, and Fred MacMurray can't understand the material. Then also, the 'modern' section is written weak. But the fantasy elements bring the film for high scores, such as the work of two women who enjoy leading - Joan Leslie and June Haver. They all have a charm that this kind of work is needed to work. As World War I salutes the history of our country - although in the 'never' system, the film has its place in Hollywood music history and should be available to all to see and find its essential features.
