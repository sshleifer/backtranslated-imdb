Frontier hidden is a displayed fan, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returning from Delta-quadrant. It has some characters from the official show of Star Trek, but most of them are original on the show. The show takes place on the base of Space Space 12 and on several spaces of space, which gives them an official opportunity to show they do not. Participants have the opportunity to increase in leadership, which characters are shown and only one ship does not. The show has a beautiful computer animation of spaceships, but acting takes place in front of the screen-green and gives a green light around practitioners. Not all actors are the same, but many do well. The passages are characterized by characters that develop over many periods. That's a little more like in Babel 5, than in the official shows more than Star Trek. Frontier hidden takes taboos that even the official series dropped from using. All I enjoyed watching it.
