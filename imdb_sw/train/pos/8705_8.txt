Besides the head, The Sword Bearer, and the DVD cover (action / herioc poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a brave film. Sponsors follow Sasha's story, The Sword Plot, who has been cursed with a retirement sword in his front seat. Cool you say, but no, this is a real life. If you had this power as a child you can control it when you say, you are experiencing a mad man, or when your girlfriend is hit. And if you have no control, how do you fight and become a double killer at the age of 12. <br /> This is exactly where Sasha is when we meet him. Wandering without decision after another murder (such as Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets Katya, and these two fall once in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try and change his ways. However, in the past they still chase him, in the form of two police officers <br /> <br /> That is a story, and there is no action on the screen, although it's as much as it is proposed. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Unlike many Hollywood films, we find a little story behind, no bad person (unless you count the Sword Owner) there is a lot of heart development and good behavior. <br /> <br /> Value check if you can find it.
