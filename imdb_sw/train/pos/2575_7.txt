I lost this film from Netflix for two reasons - I had a feeling of what I thought would be silly '50s sci-fi-asco and because it was the first feature-length of the Superman film. Needless to say, after 15 minutes I was very active and very happy. The experimental oil experiments have gone six miles on the world and are closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark are getting scores but they are disappointed that the best went out would be no longer. One day later, incredible events in the well make the story more accurate for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that mass molecular masses have invaded from their depths of six miles away from the foundation of the world. Men and Mole Men are a simple but very well-made social feature. Released in 1951, with a leading actor who served in World War II, the values ​​of the story seem to be that Americans are able to become fascists like anyone else. In order to run this house in the usual way of Superman, Reeves even accuses people of lynch hunt hunting men of Molezi to be "Nazis" at the same time. Even in the 1950s, science that directed the film was not available. Six miles of digging through the mainland would have had a high-cost garment, leaving only a "world hollow center" - which does not exist. It is forgiven - remembering that this film is based on the golden gold book. <br /> <br /> The movie is an unequal mess. Although Molemen is fascinating, it is a little interesting, and well shown, there are several Corman-esquire scenes that spend a lot of time to show us their unusual behavior. Script is both intelligent and economical. At present rates, the cost is very bad, but for some time, the special effects of this film and the high cost were very good. The movie is also very good, and acting is much better than one can expect. I was especially impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
