I was a native of Ireland, I loved this movie, Not only a person who was warm and funny was also honest and honest. I loved a girl who was very fond of and also, was good. They were a very good couple. The end was very sad. Love this film! Although it is a little dirty, it remembers the British or Irish Prime Minister's version. If you like this film you should look great. Same story The little boy falls to the older women, the older women fall by the little boy. Many cross paths, at the end, the best decision is made or the work has been completed. Don't have anything to say, without damaging the entire movie, though I thought the French man was bad, he didn't like me. Umm ... if you love Irish movies, I would like to recommend "The Friends of Friends", that movies are very good. Quick quote, you can't find it unless you look "well, that's my dinner was destroyed." LOL
