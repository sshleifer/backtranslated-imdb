Good film, very touching on simple things, but the divine of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite close, and see if something in this world could be absolutely perfect, which is very good. Just a few things that I depend on, are moving to certain points in the middle of the story. Acting is also very good, and all actors can easily act high in high films. Realizing it seems to have been well thought, and the script should be wondering. There is a time to breathe in fact, and a good rounded story formation. At the time of the film, when the main character reaches the feeling of heaven is the ultimate end to the true yarn.
