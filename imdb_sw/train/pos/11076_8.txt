I will start by saying that this is not good for everyone! The fact is not the person he expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone was expecting was a cockney geezers and a beautiful one liners "do as dags?" etc., but this is more mature than its original work. I would like to admit that it is combining but all the truth on our request we have to see and listen hard, this film requires all your attention! Look back to the cool and amazing look of the film, try to hear the dialogue rather than interesting performances and I think we'll understand more of the entire film. This has an influence from modern modernization (fighter clubs, fiction ideas etc.) but it is quite original in the whole direction and at the speed of the music mark for the second. I feel that if everyone looks at this film from time to time they would understand a lot more and maybe be aware of a good piece of modern cinema that is and I also hope that Ritchie keeps in this free if I away prefer this for its mockney "masterpieces".
