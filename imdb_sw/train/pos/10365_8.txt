This is a true story of an Australian couple who are charged with murder when their young children are lost. Meryl Streep is the best, as always, and can hold our interests even though he has a very bad habit. The frenzy media press around this case in Australia reminds Sam Sheppard's murder trial in Ohio over 50 years. . I remember well the Cleveland Plain Specialist running the main head saying "Why not Sam Sheppard jail?". The prosecutor finally failed with this pressure, and Sheppard was tried and sentenced. After many years in prison he was criticized. I like movies that tell a true story, do it in an interesting way, and make an important step in the process. This is one of those movies. Other beautiful exhibitions that tell stories of innocent people accused of crime include "Rain", "Blue Blue Line", and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film which is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
