Why review is blah for a movie that is very amazing! Everyone should know this more beautiful movie. It's involved and funny since one time, the original, and held well. I would like that movie pretends itself as a good media as appropriate! To anyone who loved the Bride, Labyrinth, and other amazing and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the most beautiful. Robert DeNiro is a hysterical. The chief executive of Charlie Cox is a good man to lead. Claire Danes is as wonderful as always. Michelle Pfiefer does a splash completely with his recent return to the screen. There is also a lot of extraordinary time from small characters ... even down to face words.
