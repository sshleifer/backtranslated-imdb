"Fraidy Cat", 4 of these cartoons, are beautiful. At least I love it, so I wonder that this gets a mixed view. <br /> <br /> This is more than a macabre story than a wonderful one, although it has time to play. The sky is dark and spoonful. Stand is another aspect of power here. For humor, it is a great humor of darkness. In this short Tom, they listen to the sound of an interesting radio at night and is very scared because it's about ghosts, something they believe. When Tom is afraid to die, Jerry looks at everything and can't help but laugh at all. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of white shirt and clean vacuum creates "great spirit". Tom lives a terrible life of all his life. Although Jerry tells Tom no good reason, the way the story is made is amazing. Plus, again, there is no abuse here because this is one of Tom & Jerry's most recent cartoons. However, I don't care the joke of Tom 9 life almost sucked into a clean vacuum. When Tom finally realized that it was all Jerry's plan and that Jerry made a fool out of it, Jerry is "found in hand in a jar of cookies" (deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows extraordinary patience before answering. He looks at Jerry for anger for a minute. The strange thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes half a minute to realize that Tom looks at him with a very big face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. Overall, this is a different experience of Tom & Jerry.
