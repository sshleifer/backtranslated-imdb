This was strange, meaning it was impossible to believe, that the "forgetful tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year, and that film artists, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not create some pictures and shots. But they are shots! The movie, under the worst conditions, is brilliant, and the Irish music symbols have been added to the release of the video to make this unforgettable wealth increase. I was delighted to see this and "Kon Tiki" at the end of the week, which was fun and certainly made me see how people who are suffering and brave and brave can be, or for a natural life or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
