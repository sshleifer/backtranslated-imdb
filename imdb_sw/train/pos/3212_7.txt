I watched this film for the second time to try to find out why it was not successful (commercial or artistic) as it should be, and found a good artistic reputation - which could eventually become its commercial destruction. <Br /> <br /> First and foremost, this film tries to "great" science fiction, the definition of society, more practical adventure. There is a step in it, but it's not really what it is. If you take that into consideration, you will end up with (as others have known) a bad mistake "Guests". But, again, it's not so. <br /> <br /> The movie is really about Todd's change (Kurt Russell) from human to close to the machine and return to humans (especially * back *). But because it doesn't try to give you a typical Hollywood answer, Kurt Russell must make these changes without saying, and largely without a short phrase. And he does a very good job - it can take two views of appreciation. The "social phenomenon" that surrounds it is incomplete and does not adequately describe as Todd's ability to join the army claiming that the upper forces come from his experience on the battlefield or its humanitarian or what, but the movie still makes it a wonderful display of Russell's talent (easy to overtake).
