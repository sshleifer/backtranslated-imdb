Pandro S. Berman was a "Production Production" but that made him a Line Producer. But who produced this epic, did not happen in Arizona but in the California desert of Mohave where scavengers have done away with all the residues of the "gold temple", Thuggee houses, outside England in Muri, Tantrapur village, etc. minor technical errors can be forgiven. What is forgiven is the lack of Oscar for the best music, though perhaps the Academy did not give such a moment. One theme played in various tempos including waltz, demonstration and sweet, setting setting. Brilliant! One of the most remarkable aspects of production was the widow's claims. The clubs who play Kipling appear briefly before and after the war. In the initial release his events were cut, for Mrs Kipling's claims. Later they were introduced by the "relationship" payer of Kipling's poem to the death of Ben Hecht. Surprisingly, this common and old British story had a good writer, who himself hated the British.
