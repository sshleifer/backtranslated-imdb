"Top Top" is, perhaps, slasher assisted over the 1980s. It is one of the few films in a kind that is very interesting. Since it is said, it also depends heavily on the principle of common slasher: A group of men and women are killed directly by gruesomely to the end of the end. <br /> <br /> The reason for the "Higher Top" stands at the top of the cinema in its genre is that it goes further on-over. Marty, a murderer, has good reason to hold hatred against former classmates. They chose him as he was standing naked in the girl's swimming room, he jabbed on his hip with a javelin, and, on top of it, tried his scientific research laboratory so that he could weaken him. So, survivors in this film are about as varied as you get. After a reunion after years - in a high school-based co-ordination by Marty himself - you know that they have not succeeded. They are a group of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It is a mind-intellectual minding why they could not ask themselves why they were alone to show up to renew, which, by the way, takes place at school which has since dropped. And who would think it was a good idea to drink beer and beer found in a building that was left in the room that had to have their old cabinets - with Marty - shown? There is a great amount of faith that the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. The latter makes a little sense or no. And the authors of the picture have an amazing understanding of how April Fool's Day works: The movie claims that cargo will not be allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> For all, movies are one of the best examples of slasher types, despite all its errors. It is difficult to understand why it has not yet found a way to the DVD, while many other fricks are run by special versions.
