After watching an amazing WW1 spy, Those Lili (1969) played by Julie Andrews on this afternoon afternoon, I thought suddenly I saw the most excited WW1 spy. All I could remember is that it was released by Dino De Laurentis. Just took a short search on IMDB to get Fraulein Doktor. Once I knew the name the memory came back. In his time, the most beautiful story associated with real events like the death of Kitchener and the German offside of 1918. It also has a female spy who believes more than Julie Andrews! As with other critics, the first and most powerful records of the war were well produced by men and horses in gas masks. If you are interested in war films and especially WW1 is a film worth seeing if you have a chance.
