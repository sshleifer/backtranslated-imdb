As a "prohibition" for the top of AFI films, the British Film Institute did the work of the document by Martin Scorsese. I am a great fan of the film and boast after seeing so many films. But, I am now in bondage with my image. In this fantastic (even as long) document, Scorsese walks viewer through several stages of American History on the film. This is divided into several parts including Western, Gangster and Noir film. Full of bouncy passion, Martin Scorsese is a great guide to a visit with a wonderful professor.
