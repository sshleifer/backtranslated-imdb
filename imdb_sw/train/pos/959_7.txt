There are many of the drama police drives. I don't know why. It is possible to do with the basic theme of good against evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a text style that we are going to set up the hard of Anne, recruiting raw, on the police force set in the Baltic area. No attempt is made to please the police. They are really down in the world, when hard and unforgiving, Anne on the other hand has a thin heart perhaps a little more understanding of human nature. Against all the law sometimes holds misleading information found in its trap search and other inquiry. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film. It's not one to relax you. There are not many feelings of hope in him. Police seem to be involved in the warfare. Tomorrow there will be more buses, more killings, more family breaks, and more vulnerable children. Let's say. This is the world we live in. As the developing days and Anne is working closely with the police and the families they are investigating. The only true temperature in the film is what Benny, a 12-year-old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of forbidding things. He ignores Benny's eyes and try to help him as he can. I was surprised though he went to deceive Benny's father. It makes me wonder if it was based on the father or his own needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she had a need for children of love and love. Well done well but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
