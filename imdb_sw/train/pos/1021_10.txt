The first and second months started with shakily, and good events have been hit in the middle, and sometimes use clich√©d stories. But as soon as it began to establish the existing world and begin to develop more characters, it became more fun and entertainment. The main reason for this show is successful because of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry way of humor makes it more comfortable, Peter's leadership is better and makes any part of the more entertaining, with Joe & Paul never able to do a wonderful, interesting part together. Once you know what the show is about and know the characters, I'm sure you don't want to like. For those entering the show I suggest the 'Side Side' scenarios, a very good part, and 'Window of Opportunity', part of the comic support group.
