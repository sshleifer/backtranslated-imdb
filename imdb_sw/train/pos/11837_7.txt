This is a good movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Animation is better and easily suggests that there are many manufacturers who create a film that looks like a brilliant like anything coming from the Disney studio. One way from Disney's most common way is that this Dreamworks movie is not worth the brilliant side of the comedy aid. And, there is no sudden moment when the characters break the song. I am sure that the original movie area was not found in Disney's photo: the birth of the Spirit. But it has been done well and should not be. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Don't do it wrong. I have loved Disney for years and I will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of the great price of animation. Once it was over, my children wanted to look at it again. I had the same feeling. I strongly recommend it.
