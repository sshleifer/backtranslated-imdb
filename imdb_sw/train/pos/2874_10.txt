Cinderella is a beautiful woman who is treated cruelly by his old wife and stepisters. One day, the ball takes place in honor of the principal, but Cinderella has no opportunity to go, because the mother of the mother and stepisters will not allow him. With the help of her godmother of fairy and her friends, she is away from the ball, with a warning to return home at midnight. In the ball he meets a good Prince of Charming. When the clock hits midnight, he runs home, repeating one of his glass slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity has been revealed. He and the future later married, and live happily at all times. It is a great job of the box of success, and continues to attract the audience to this day. It has a well written script. The characters don't remember. These songs, including "Fantasy is the Heart of Your Heart", "So This Is Love", and "Big-Bobbidi-Boo" great, help to tell stories. This is my favorite movie, and it has not lost any of its charm. Head of Disney really! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. Recent DVD liberation is the best way to appreciate this film, including featurettes, deleted screens, music videos, vintage radio programs, and printed film!
