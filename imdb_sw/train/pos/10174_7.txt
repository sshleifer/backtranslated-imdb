This was another message of World War II to soldiers and Allies to be careful about spreading rumors. These were called the "cartoons" of cartoons because it was a mix of bright messages with a fascinating character called "Pvt Snafu." We all have ideas, with fear and what - and you, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu adds two bad and two to what he hears and comes with "five." You can begin to panic and all kinds of shocks if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. That includes losing faith in your country and your reasons, as described here on this cartoon. The best way to lose the battle is to undermine the enemy. That still takes place today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," says one big baloney near the end of this cartoon. It is amazing how other Americans have not yet learned. This cartoon may be 65 years old but certainly has significance today. When I write this, there were two terrorist bombs in Europe today and some people still think "War on Terrorism" is a slogan slogan. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Author, popular "Dr Suess," uses the analogies of "hot hot ball juice" here to deliver the above message. And Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the poems will be clever. <br /> <br /> Nothing here, but it didn't mean to be. You understand the weather of 1943 and the right paranoia there during World War II. People forget that the war can be attacked easily and win the other side. It was a lot of time
