What would you say about a man who was about to get married and had a party of his players and some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar? All the smooth trips until he takes a "bachelor hat" off. What would you say about him talking to one of the most interesting players and then having sex with him? What would you say if the real girl was a cousin of her money? Below, right? Well Paul Coleman, played a lot with Jason Lee, leads this experience of noise and low coffee. I had to say this is one of its good leadership responsibilities. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla's atmosphere was well done. His money called Karen is played by the top-and-down actor Selma Blair when Karen, Becky's character, is played by lovers and talented Julia Stiles. Going back to where we left, Paul now has to deal with one problem that happens to another. He has a disease, he needs to deal with some people, and he needs to play fake games and ignorance or any member of each family can get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who have no "bowel motion" for 14 days. * Vomit * All of this causes a long-awaited wedding and one amazing place before restoring all that Paul and his brother had to use. <br /> <br /> Overall, Thing Guy is very funny and it's okay. Sometimes the story can seem to go anywhere and tired for scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie. And if you are a Canadian partner of CTV Brett Butt sitcom, the Corner Gas, you would like to note the small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the man who plays Hank's trick in a series. This movie is the same. It is another hat in Lee's hat (completely blank hat so far, however). <br /> <br /> My testing: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
