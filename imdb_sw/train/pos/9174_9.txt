There has been a film production of Jane Eyre and each other and the recommendation elements, but I think this is what people will still learn and fall in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers more of stories than others do). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing a mark; its performance is very strange and many colors, while it has never been far from the difficult problem of behavior. Jane Zelah's Clarke is more brain than the otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil to Dalton (who, indeed, towers on it!) Its performance standards through the best in second look (once you have experienced a charisma Dalton). There are some technical errors and several times where productivity values ​​can be better; although this very good was the top-of-line production for BBC's at the same time. But, it is an exhibition which is a real pleasure. Don't miss this!
