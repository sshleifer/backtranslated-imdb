In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy, my parents had found a home box office that was very nice to our neighbor. As a 12-year-old boy, this was the first time I saw a boob on television. I can't forget the joy of those times. Wheelbarrows, total dolphins and bad worms, a bed of water, cigarette smoke, 70 fire covers, 'love makin in my Chevy van song, was a new experience for me. Full movie with all the memories you can trust. I own and enjoy once a year. When I watch this film, it makes me get my skirts, and 4 wheels, not in line, go to the garden and hunt for hair with hairy hair. A very good memory of teenagers!
