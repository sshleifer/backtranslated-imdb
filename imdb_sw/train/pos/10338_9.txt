Norman, Is That You? it was (this is the third hand, so take it with the grain of salt) was taken by the American American family from Judaism, when you stepped in and entered the screen. Also, it was one of the original movies that were hit on the video, so the sessions from the playground were not great. Still, the performances by Redd Foxx and others were very good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is PERIOD PIECE: it emerged in the mid-70s early on to know you have a daughter or daughter in your family. For this reason alone, it is very surprising - if not "little". Don't you believe? See verses about curtains, etc.. It's not deep. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually shines in several places. There is a split area when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who has fled with his brother (!) To Ensenada in Pinto. Phone conversations on the border are truly memorable. But ... the best place in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay / gay friends who were doing in gay bars and nightclubs. With my best knowledge, this is the only time that was usually done. And, it's a little published with its short version, I'm told. However, it is the vintage, and should not be missing. People still steal lines from Wayland; that man had real gifts. Enjoy the film!
