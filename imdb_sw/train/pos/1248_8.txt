"The golden baby" was the first film of Eddie Murphy since its megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And even if it is not like "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy's stars as a cluster of lost children who have been given an unusual case. His task: to find the character of a title, a child with a secret power. This film can be the name of "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Punishment" since part of this movie has as an adventure of Spielbergian, kinda as comedy Indiana Jones. Interested in laughing, and adventure with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
