Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his colleagues are making an ambitious message that you see traveling through Saturn rings. His loved ones are killed immediately, but it seems that they are really lucky. Steve returns to the world for the constant humanoid humidity; as it turns out to be a sharp killer, melting every step of the way, followed by his friend, Dr Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). This is often very surprising - with enough lines and surroundings - it's hard for me to believe that laughing is all without a volunteer. It seems to me that it is a kind of effort of the lowest budget effort from the 50s and 60s, and so, it is a fantastic movie. The sequence and the nurse are only cautious. We have even been treated with a series of split screens that are not worth anything, but are still a gas check. <br /> <br /> Author / director William Sachs deserves a loan to come up with this skillful idea; Her small slimy behavior is one truly memorable. I think her pacing is far away; The scenes (like one and the older couple) go for a long time, but eventually he announced a stable product, schlocky, B-movie with a panache degree. Period is more fun. Arlon Obers Music is very excited (but also ignores at some point), and Willy Curtis movies create great shots at another time. It brings me the good quality of Rick Bakers' good milk, which creates a very prestigious center for film, to the bottom of the melting point. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy shapes near the entire film (Sachs also gets my reputation for being a movie facing the ground) and does what he does well. DeBenning makes a hero of mad and mad, and Ann Sweeney is not as hot as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge, and Lisle Wilson is very good. It is also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (making a very unknown shot), Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers "" Eaten Alive "by Wes Cravens" "Mountains and Eyes"), and even Jonathan Demme director in small parts. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun movie in the middle of midnight and gore, enough, and laughing enough for a fascinating level of sci-fi / low-grade / horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
