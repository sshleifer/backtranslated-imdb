I can't believe now this film has been tested 6.9. However this film was probably one of the real Indian movies I have seen. It was very comforting to see a film showing a traditional family film. For the story I thought it was good for the shahid kapur to be established in a planned marriage with their family. She is a kind of happy person to go lucky, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who helps so much for her uncle but the only problem is her cousin does not seem to be cautious as she does so her aunt does not like Amrita and passion. This irritates Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although the family of Amrita was not wealthy perhaps the middle class of the lower class, when the Shahids family was the highest class, they still cared for their families with respect and did not even ask them to put them down which really struck courage. That is because I have seen people being very worried for people who are not right and thinking them down to their standards that I feel is very poor. This movie showed that the family of shahids was ready to look at the good values ​​that Amrita brought and turned to the eyes for the fact that she was not a rich daughter of a daughter's business or whatever. All in this movie were eligible 8/10 I would like more and more of these types of movies were made.
