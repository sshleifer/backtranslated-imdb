This is very good, released for TV film. It shows trouble in the suburbia around 1970 and the kind of one neighbor certainly does not want to be close. The worst and most misleading part of the film was when the punk youths were killed by the family dog. Young people do everything to convince and exploit this poor family. But the boy, does the attitude of leadership take revenge on those punk boys at the end. Of course, the father / homeowner does not take all the barriers from the punk youth quickly and it is quick to take revenge on the lack of support from the police. He stands and protects his home and his family. Very good actor. I can add. I watched this on TV when I was 8 or 9. I never saw it on TV and I would like. Certainly one good! It's a kind of one movie that can catch the night of the night very night and can't stop watching or filming on the weekend. It's kind that don't show again. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing!
