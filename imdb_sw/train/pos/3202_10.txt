I can't understand why most IMD users don't like this movie. Why they think it's sooooo etc. etc. It's not worse than anything out there. Personally I think "Soldier" is a good movie, better than many other films in that kind. <br /> <br /> The reason I loved the "soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script (David Webb Peoples), the great impact of seeing, and leading (Paul Anderson). I think this is the best work that I have seen from the director Paul Anderson, who has previously described the entertainment "Mortal Kombat" and not the entertainment "Horizon Event".
