Finally the movie where the audience continues to think to the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the brother's life, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will continue towards destruction since somewhere goes but down, but we don't know how or when to close to the end of the film. Hoffman is good, as usual, and even Hawke was as respectable as a little brother who basically does what he is told since he can't think of himself. Hawke may have been less out of his element, but played that part well. Adding to this mix of Andy's wife, played well with Marisa Tomei, cheating and Hank; Andy's influence on corporate finance to pay for its sexual abuse and sexual abuse; and the father who finally knows what happened on the day of theft. This movie will make you think.
