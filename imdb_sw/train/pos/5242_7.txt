I enjoyed this film for two reasons. The first is that it gives insight into the world of losing in the northern ireland, which is not widely available in the movies, which many tell us about the struggle of the Republic. The second reason is the performances of actors. I thought they gave the most beautiful and interesting pictures of the seeds that most people don't know about outside my natural rock. For everything, it is a stellar-based entertainment movie from who is in the Northern Ireland actors. Then it causes the world, though it can open the eyes of some people to the unstable world of faithful helpers.
