Believe it or not, for 12 minutes, this film (in 1912) is a full-time film. Very, very few films were much longer than before, but that is definitely not the one that drives a little less than others! No, how different that all actors (except one frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This small domestic comedy may seem like production for the star of the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead the Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that just look like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were still not found and I think Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using a stop motion, the bugs moved and laughed and fought very well - with more stuff than King Kong 21 years later! The movie begins with Mr. Beetle emerging on a good time. He goes to a bady club when his wife claims to be waiting at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he found on the camera and buff into the film. Further, she does not know but Bi Beetle also keeps the Bohemian star painter. Of course, there is much more to this local comedy than this, but the plot is old and very entertaining to adults and children alike. Powerful but also very strange and watchable animals.
