Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a very unique piece of cities, where it relates to the whole plot without failing to convey much. It is the main thing that the basic life of uncertainty is about people of every race, history and center. But to announce that the topic of the film will be a decline of its scope. Similarly, for pigeonhole in some form is free. The film has a lot to say, although there is a very different amount for each viewer, and it says it all in a non-preaching way from many corners, that ultimately, I can't define its own message. However, it works for the accuracy of such a laser; each time, a line of dialogue, and a bar of back music that contributes to the prevalence and powerful message, that I am very happy, and coming very far after every look. It still doesn't feel at all. An interesting film cast and everything that works.
