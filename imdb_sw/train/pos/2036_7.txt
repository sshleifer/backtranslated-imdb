- Little helper here! - When I watched the "Creep" votes today, I was surprised about many users of IMDb movie this movie "1". I wonder: what kind of people do you expect? Are there so many people watching movies without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a movie of HORROR and it's very good! This directly means: it has an incredible story of the hollow, the danger of anger and the side-by-side characters. Why do you complain about it? Just take a popcorn and coke, pretend to be comfortable in your seat and then ... enjoy that fear of dying! The first 60 hours when there is near something else than Kate and the subway station that is unique is amazing. There are doubts and fears in every corner of the screen and you will give some of the jerks just because of the sudden sound of the neon lighting behind you. (In my opinion the voice editor performed the best in this film.) <br /> <br /> When Kate will meet her adherence quality film but still will not be a bad movie. The second part of the film should not be quite, but the effects of the impact have been well done and the story continues well. (... for as long as you keep in mind that it's a terrible movie you are looking at and not a Delivery Center!) So, if you want to pretend to be an hour, very awesome. Watch the first time of "Creep" then remove the movies or turn to your TV. Do you know other information, however? The bad man will die and Kate will be the one who lived. But even if you look at this film to its end, you can't despair. And if you want to push concerns on the next level, do what I did after watching this film: leave the movie for the night of darkness, go to the lowest road down and take the train home last ...
