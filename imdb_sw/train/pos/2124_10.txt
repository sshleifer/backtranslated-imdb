This is a realistic movie in the story, acting, and film presentation. Wonderful workers are full of films, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart become the main characters. In real life he loved him very much, and he loved Jimmy, and he actually gave him his first basic tasks, and helped him to be more calm and appear on the set. "Chemistry" between the two was always, and so warm and enjoyable to see. She was very beautiful, a young woman, and so sweet in her personality. The story of these two young men, and how they finally come along the end is charming look, and fresh magical entertainment. Hot warming displays are also provided by other actors to help in this amazing story. I wholeheartedly give Miss Sullivan 10 perfect in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. You must see to all!
