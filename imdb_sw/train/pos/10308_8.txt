Well, Morgan Freeman is more common than God than George Burns? This sure film was much better than that carrying, "Oh, God". I had quite a load with LMAO all the way. Carrey was perfect as an outsider, and Aniston took her part as a frustrated partner in her normal work. I, for one, don't think that he is bad or can't fail. I think my event was loved when Carrey opened the cabinet to think that it could not hold the history of his life. See if you can see the file in the cabinet which holds the events of its bathroom humor: I was moving over this. Written well and better, this comedy will descend as one of the best of the funnyman.
