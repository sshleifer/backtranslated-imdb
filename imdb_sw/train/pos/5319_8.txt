Do not forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget that in many ways they have not been removed. Instead to give the author of Ida Lupino a great loan to deal with the subject that then (1950) had a taboo in Hollywood. With my knowledge, this was the first film to address the issue of rape and emotional and psychological effects that the crime is affected by its victims. Even though most of the cast statements are of the best legs, Mala Powers, who was then eighteen or nineteen, provides good performance at all times as a young woman, Ann, who tries to run from "shame". According to his work in this film, I wonder that he did not have the best work to do. Tod Andrews, too, has a good time as a minister who emerges to help him. Girl Lupino, certainly works on a small budget, was still able to create some non-memorable scenes such as local and leading rape, and the following police line. And, he created a beautiful end that left me wondering if Ann could have a normal life again.
