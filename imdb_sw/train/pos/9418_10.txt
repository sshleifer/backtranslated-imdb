I've had this film on the tape for years and I have been looking at it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry â€” it's amazing!) Because I wanted to hear the music of Benjamin Frankel's head again. I ended up sitting next to the first half of the hour, facing how amazing to the direction, text, and displays are. The movie is like who is the 50th British star character: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, great as dessicated great old clothes. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, it is not the character of such a character as charming, it leads to charismatic. This is a science fiction in its very clean form and also play it with sound. It's classic all the time, and I hope no one ever tries to remake!
