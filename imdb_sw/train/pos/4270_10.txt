Ko for tamo peva is the best comedy of all times. Believe I have seen many movies and comedies but tell me who will want you to play every time you look. But the fact is that humor in this comedy is special. It is caratherisic for serbia. And all the republics of the former yugoslavia know very well !!! So I think other viewers (for example: Europe) can't be very happy. Because the heads have destroyed something of the hole. But they should at least try! Yes it's amazing! This is the best flick in the history of Serbia and the world does not understand! :-) If you have the opportunity to see this, don't leave!
