Well, this can be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy provides the performance of a de-tour-power! Alas, his work has never been completely, but - finally - he will always remember his first three pictures: "King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll", and "Without You". He gives different people from New York to join the Diana Ross community to create a well-researched and well-known cultural tradition in the United States. Sexy and bright, tender and physical, filosofi and proud, he entices the audience in every area, and in fact it is "good". Watch this one (if you come from Iowa), you will certainly enjoy !!
