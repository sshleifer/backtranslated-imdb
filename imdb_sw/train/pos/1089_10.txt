This movie was held in 1948, but it remains true today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a little place in the country and "builds" there. Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this very interesting film. Great big. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd enjoy this film. This is a black and white film that shows 40-year-old style. Most references are made at the cost of items, and the comparison of today's cost is very incredible. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't enjoy this film completely. I am surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of. Classic realistic.
