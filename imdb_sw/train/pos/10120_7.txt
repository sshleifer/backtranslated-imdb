The movie will start something like low-hyper-kinetic, more paste or dead: more amazing underground activities are made when bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, one Tatsuhito is involved ... and when he realizes that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get too fast. <br /> <br /> The original work of Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with its size in the protection of ultraviolence and sexual acts of sadness, though not one of its eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Instead, it is a good fiction of the genius, as Tatsuhito triggers the underground, a leading guide to the gay leader of Triay who sells illegally exported body parts from Taiwan and keeps close to a young boy (one particular character. kills soldiers at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother is involved in the community, so Tatsuhito himself has to become a representative of dirt and use the same violence and violence to penetrate this area of ​​evil. What is most interesting about a little bit of work is Tatsuhito's relationship with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later back in Japan, and engaged for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt abandoned in China, so he was killed by his father and developed a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a characteristic of Shakespearian's amazing, which is weird enough as it is, a small amount that you begin to hear at the time when his last end with Tatsuhito you. And Tatsuhito himself is a very good example when he has to compete with his lack of control over his brother. Although it would be difficult to say that Miike films are particularly effective in the value of their shock, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose how Miike can create painless, uncomfortable characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
