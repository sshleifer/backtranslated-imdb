This was one of my favorite series when I was a child. The Swedish broadcasting company decided to announce a few times ago when I finished my first semester medical school. I was surprised to see the depth of the links described. Indeed, some things have been made simple but many of them were correct (even though they have been done 22 years ago!) And it is quite clear. I would suggest that all medical students should look at it. It is a great way to learn some basic medical terms for example. Now I am in my seventh semester and I think I'm going to look a second time again after buying a DVD box :-)
