This was a great movie cast good, all blowing in all the jars. And when Dianne Keaton has the best, well, it is no more than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always moved, was better. He should be a star. My only complaint is for one feature of the screen. No characters agreed that the dead woman was not always a good person. And his mother, played with Keaton. Sometimes he breaks the promise he made to one character to show that he was lying around. One of the other speakers said the movie had a "political agenda". That's something amazing to say. There was no politics in this film.
