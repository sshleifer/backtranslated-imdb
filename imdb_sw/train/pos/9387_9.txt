As others said, I looked at this after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of their top 10 year movies. What a gift. I then went to buy it, so we could pay the loan. <br /> <br /> The best quotation? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he knows that someone (Cage) is on his cab. When Cage looks, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I was scared." Yoakum blows his pistol in the face of Cage and "Does this look like I'm afraid?" Great humor after the escape (and of time) escape. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of joy for this. Regularly checking the "Welcome to Red Color" leads to headaches and headaches. Music created hunting, the quality of the film that reminds "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks", however, it does not lose things by going too far in the foreign countries, required "up" itself. <br /> <br /> I agree to view credit 15-20 times. You see, they had Yaakum of the "Thousand Miles from Nowhere" (fully chosen) acting like a trailer trail near the desert floor. . and the snow-covered mountains. This was wonderful, making water. Additionally, I have never seen the best unity of seeing and sound on the film. Also, it fits perfectly the story.
