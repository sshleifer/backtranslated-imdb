The sense of humor in the full title of the head comes from the Sunday School's dictum that one would be better reminiscent of the death of the devil's investigation, that is, the devil does not care when you die. There is no percentage in trying to beat the devil. The actors seemed not attentive during Sunday School, and forced themselves into crisis management, after avoiding the crisis to escape. But even the CEO of the season will have difficulty managing these problems. Throw the dice is more unpredictable than hitting the coin; when people are involved, a possible list of possible results becomes even more than a long list of non-remember film Sidney Lumet. So far, Hawke cannot be an actor but here he had an eye to receive bills among other Lumet All Stars as Steiger and Pacino.
