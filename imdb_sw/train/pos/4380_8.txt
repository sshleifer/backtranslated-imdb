This is a very good, stereotyped action / drama / film. <br /> <br /> The basic story refers to the borrowing of Rob Roy's 1000 pounds, theft, and problems that cause his family and indirectly his family. Tim Roth is an amazing striker and character in this story. Too much cool and looking at his face seems to be able to turn the eyes and look at the evil. Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also good, but I think the authors used the word "honor" 1 very often. <br /> <br /> Some of the cast are powerful, and the whole movie is taken very much and displayed. The action is exciting and playing with a very real sword, but not too much. The story is good and you want so much Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All in all the classic shame.
