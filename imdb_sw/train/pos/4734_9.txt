I am a big fan of Jet Li! He is the best star of HK action live ... and so - this film was hit! I saw it in a video store and, as it was in the usual part of the video store, I did not write its first time, and I was looking at it twice. Once I knew what I would like to rent. My only Qualm (I think I expected) was that it was called (AAARGh) and not the head. Otherwise, the original film / incredible / cool, and fully the stage made one of the best Jet Li ... although all fall under that category ....
