This is the music music made. Humor, talent, romance, and all stages connected one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was amazing. There is nothing else to say. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, did a great job to win the hearts of many to be shown to Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. Women in the film were the same, but men in the film definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It's a real classic that can be counted at any time. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Of course the film will be watched and enjoy!
