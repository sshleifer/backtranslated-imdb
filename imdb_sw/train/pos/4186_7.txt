I watched this flick yesterday and I must say a horror film made for $ 36,000 which I have ever seen (Sorry Steckler) that film is worth finding if you are a fan of a zombie. Reeks this movie of spirit and atmosphere. Some of the shots are the best ever dedicated to the film. The dust from the dust with the dust slows down their victims. Brrrrrr. Canadian saggy women with the maximum permissible permits will allow you to devote them before the HORROR brings its insufficient body to eat the head. This film has been saved from beginning to end. I couldn't ask more of it. My only complaint is that it's too short.
