An American in Paris is a good music about an American painter who lived in Paris. She meets a rich woman who enjoys her colorful pictures on the road and believes she can get her job more popular with the public, e.g. in the museum. Golden Globe chose Gene Kelly as artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect in both singing and especially playing. It also meets the girl Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is involved with her best friend. She cannot help her feelings for this girl, even after looking for who is involved. Filled with a beautiful romance and a wonderful song and dance, this is a very good film of music. It can pull a little bit of his dream of play, that is, America's ballet, but there is a good end of good fun.
