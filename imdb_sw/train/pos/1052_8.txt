Wonderful Documentary on the success of the Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, southwestern Cameroon, for protecting the rights of women and children due to domestic violence acts. In this Islamic culture, where men have always been free on women, according to the Sharia Act, one can consider the problem of establishing legal rights for women and children. After a 17-year effort, the WLA leaders soon started to make a few successes, and the purpose of this film is to share these stories of victory. Leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (President of the Court). They are all struggling in this film, which can be photographed by the wind, although I think a lot of it, if not all, includes a new recording for real-time camera. Four events are being reviewed, and all those listening to them also appear on the film. Two events involve a frequent beat, and forced sex in one case; another involves forced sex on a 10-year-old girl; and the other has a constant worry of the child, age 8, and aunt. One of the women who was beaten also wants a divorce. We follow the case due to the investigation of the complaint for the results of the trial. Results in each case are suitable for women and children. Criminals receive hard prison and / or fine; divorce is granted. The child charges of child brutality indicate that female criminal justice officers are actually sexually active during law enforcement. It is also worthy of respect that all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a very important and well-made film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Mrs. Longinotto, was also inspired by the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with the related themes in Tehran.)
