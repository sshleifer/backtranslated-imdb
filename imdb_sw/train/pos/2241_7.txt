Another player for a small gray country struggling through the modern jungle (for forty years) in the world with natural publishers and overcoming them, this is a good entry to the Ealing principle. Terry-Thomas shines as usual in the leadership, as a person without a feck service has led to a disaster when a nation that is considered to be interested in the interests of the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic leadership, Peter Sellers has put in one of his few exhibitions as politics and uber -uave John Le Mesurier has opposed the kind as a leader of the dirty coup. Enjoy much there all, especially viewer; maybe not in the very echelon of the classic Ealing, but pretty high up.
