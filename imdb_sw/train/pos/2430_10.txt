This Casper is a friendly friend since my youth, and I will look at it on YouTube (Thank you GOD! For You Tube); after I love this short, and it's one of my Casper's shorts. <br /> <br /> I like how short it starts to violate Frank Gallop's anger; until we see Casper sitting next to his grave, reading. When every soul came from the cemetery to "people", Casper decides to leave in search of a friend. But in trying to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper runs. Poor Casper sitting on the log and right; until the little cabbage of the fox comes its nuzzles. Casper and the little fox quickly bag and he quickly calls Ferdie cub and see him as his best friend. Casper and Ferdie's relationship is at great risk, but Casper doesn't know Ferdie's eyes when they play a game of hide and seek. While Ferdie hides hunters and his two hunting dogs come and try to kill a little Ferdie and Ferdie runs as fast as possible as he breathes and starts playing. While hunters are fighting against Ferdie Casper advertisers try to kill him and fly in the direction of hunters and ask that hunters not only remove Ferdie. And hunters and dogs are afraid of Casper. Casper tells Ferdie that the hunters and dogs have gone and that everything is good. But Casper sees Ferdie's body is not moving and asks if he is the same. While Casper sees Ferdie's death he begins to mourn for pain because he lost his "only friend who has lived all his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and has made a village near Casper's tomb. Casper continues to mourn for pain until he finds that Ferdie has risen as a soul himself. Ferdie begins to tell Casper on his cheek. Casper screams for joy because he is reunited with Ferdie. Overall, it's very short; although surprisingly amazing, show death in the cartoon oriented family.
