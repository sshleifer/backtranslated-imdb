I first saw this film when it was sent closer to 1988 and the BBC when I was working on the 2000AD UK. My Pal Steve Parkhouse wrote it on VHS and sent me. So far, I would just like to see Shaw Bros kung fu movies, and their strict lights (so the audience can see the clear point), so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like mentioned by Ridley Scott from Hong Kong. This was also my first thought for Tsui Hark movies (known, apparently, "Choy Huk"). Still for all those who smoke, out of the bedding and special effects of Stop-motion? In Hong Kong's original story of GHOST has a simple story of love, has made the most of Leslie Cheung's best talent (the worst, terrible tragedy of life!) and the beauty and magnitude of Joey Wong. Joey's admission is good, but it is a sign of a voting hand that gives its character an impossible preference which is difficult to analyze. And although Joey is now 20 years old (gawd, who are we?) This will always be a permanent image of the actress. Some experts here said that the film is simple and no surprise, but they have no idea that this film was based on a popular Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! That is like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable end with only a copy of WEST SIDE STORY. (I just loved to wipe my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, the Chinese text of GOST is a romantic romantic story. It has a great tragedy, because we know that the sin of Sin and Sin cannot be together. It is up to maturity, because none of us can grow up until we have a big loss. It is about sacrifice, for sacrifice is an essential part of True Love. And the styling of the comedy of Wu Ma does not give a bit, either. Enjoy the news of Chinese history by trying to feel through the Western culture culture and you will continue with it just good.
