Good and touching movies that deserve to see more than possible to find. Semra Turan plays Aicha, second-generation Turkish migrator, who tries to break the mold. Nor is it at home with his conservative Islamic family, nor with his independent Danish friends, the military experience of Aicha is a struggle to find himself and have the power to let him who wants to be despite family and friends. Director Natasha Arthy can manage equality and storytelling for being detailed without having a speech of fantastic philosophy, and drawing skills of the Xian Gao tool lost in the order of extraordinary warfare. In the end, however, it is the first performance of Semra Turan which gives this spirit of film. The strong influence and required military skills are recommended and the heart of making its own drama reliable. It is well worth your time.
