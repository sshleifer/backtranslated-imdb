How could I adopt a chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I can't and so, I used this mess of the movie. I've never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I got about the boy's story. I also wondered how this film was not normal. Maybe the fact that it was too late and at the end of the 4-hour marathon or maybe it is because it is slow, I have seen this hard story to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom were able to create interesting, unusual characters. Although I will try to recommend this if I must see it, it's a good story of Australian history (based on how the country is small, this is very common and should be counted) and the film has some good practice practices . Try to see the historical value .... (that's right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...))
