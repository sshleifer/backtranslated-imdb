Hanson's brothers - Andy (apparently working together) and Hank (obviously they do not have a shared action) need money. Andy comes with a plan to get the dough that will have a result for the whole family of Hanson <br /> <br /> this film is opening. This is a beautifully embedded journey, full of blood roller coaster which knows exactly what it is doing. As an actor's excitement / excitement game I would like to compare it with joy and 'No Country For Older Men.' While both films have sufficient game supply with fans, 'the devil' is more exciting side because of its fast speed. 'No Country' is a cool film and a bleaker which you can praise, while 'Devil' is more fun. There is obviously less violence in the 'Devil' than 'No Country.' Acting also provides. Ethan Hawke, sometimes timber in the past, brings jitters, sweat and hair-in-the-heads-looking for Hank's siege. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the most complicated pictures of the film and is quick to become an actor, who believes he can do anything. It really isn't bad with this film. It jumps again and out without confusion. Events do not rule, but the film is not suitable - to write (from the first timer of the Kelly Masterson), to direct (veteran Sidney Lumet) and to edit as tight as a dance. In most groups, this is a priority prize, though perhaps the film 'The Departed' and 'No Country' have opened this out of the brightness. If you loved those, you would like this.
