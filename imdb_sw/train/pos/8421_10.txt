Josef Von Sternberg is leading this silent film on the Hand of Silent and the former Imperial Prince for the Russian King who has found himself there. Emil Jannings won Oscar's well-deserved, for his part, for his role as chief who is usually beaten in a small part of the silent image as the Russian head. The movie shines back its days in Russia leading up to the collapse of the country. William Powell makes his first big screen as the Hollywood director who fuels Jannings in his film. This film looks like an impressive for the fall of Russia and for imitation back to Tinseltown's early days. Von Sternberg offers again another classic, and one that is filled with great things of romance, controversy, and catastrophe.
