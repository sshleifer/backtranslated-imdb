My French three-year lessons has always enjoyed this film very much. In a high school culture, within the city, the film provided a lot of discussion (in French in class, but I know a lot of discussions continued in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to one of the Proté and France. I was explaining that I felt this film had one of the "sexiest" events I had ever seen on the film. . One year, 17-year-old Africa and America shouted, "Yes!" as he appeared on the scene: which Proté helps Aimée's evening dress, all the time they test another screen in the mirror. Directors use "mirror techniques" when they want to focus on the internal crisis for a single or more character in the area: this is a perfect example of technique, and is "sexy". Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film. One suggested that one film film was "Africanism", and that no matter where Africa is loved or Africans, one cannot "be" Africa (as the driver tried to do): one must be Africa.
