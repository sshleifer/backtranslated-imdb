I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in a medical research center. For many years I have seen people die from hemolytic effects and blood transfusions, have attended several meetings on the birth of blood transfusions, and have seen several patients being infected with infectious diseases from blood. I have heard many of Jehovah's Witnesses are told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field I have never seen appear, leaving the question, "Is it really a failure to refuse blood or is a huge community benefit from the war on this issue?" of Jehovah's Witnesses are morally upright. "You must abstain from blood" is not anonymous information. Thank you for this film and allow comments on it.
