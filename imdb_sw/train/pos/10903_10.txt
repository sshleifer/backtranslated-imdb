This person is not an amazing thing. You really feel like you have lived his life with him in these terrible events, and crying with his family at the end. He had a strong desire for his cause, not for himself, but to make sure others who are saved do not need to go through this terrible pain. I will watch this video every time when I have a bad day or "down", and it can always make me see a big and light part of life, just like Jonny did, even with its painless pain. My only regret is not about Jonny earlier, as I visited England 2 times during his life, and would be able to say I would like to meet him. It's comforting to know Jonny sitting on his cloud, pain free! Rest in peace, Dear Jonny. You deserve it!
