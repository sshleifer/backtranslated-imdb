This movie is beautiful! Brad Pitt can never perform the performance he gave in this film. Duchovny was a top player, such as Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main actors are walking on a road trip to historical killings, in one of the most frozen cars made, the 1960s of Lincoln Continental. Early grace is easy and delicious to teeth and dry. He loves his women to curse or sneeze, and to wear PWT clothes. Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are Trailer herders from outside the rural areas. Although many sounds in the film are dark, there's a lot of funny scenes to be. Writing, leading, and acting is brilliant. If you like road shows, murder, humor, and animation, watch this film. Everyone offers, and you will need more when withdrawing credit. One of my favorites all the time. "hey ... shave dog n teach you to hunt!"
