I came home late one night and turned on television, see Siskel and Ebert telling their weekly procedures. I've never heard of anything about "Red Rock West", except two thumbs up and seeing before leaving. It cannot stay in the cinema for a long time because of the financial difficulties and lack of promotion, but they said it was more appropriate. Night / day, I followed their advice. They were right, it was the happiest I ever had. As the other readers describe, there are a few holes and a last 10 minutes do not appear to be completed. But it is very good, for the good work embedded at first. It is the best role I have ever seen in Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be fully beaten. Dennis Hopper goes around on, which gets silly but tightens how well everything else works. Set and music contributes greatly to each location. I recovered later for my family, it didn't work as well. Long-term events that created tension in the playground were difficult to understand, along with home restrictions. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, watch and listen to each location, especially at the beginning.
