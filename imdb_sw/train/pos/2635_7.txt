Take me: funny take King LION, as a good. Exciting exciting. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, the "King of the Lion 1 1/2" is actually a direct funny-to-video, which contain the value of the exhibition treatment. I don't see why Disney has been given to the video directly, and the release of prestigious movies like "Little Chaku" and "Return to Neverland" performances. The films are good at video stores (in the "new location"), instead of seeing their posters out of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is just a spoof of the first film (although the events in the "Pride of Simba" have never happened yet), in Timon (shown by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa's (known by Ernie Sabella) view. We see them playing events in the first film. Preliminary words from the first film, like Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, come back to their voice work from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give comedy relief as Timon's mother and uncle of grumpy. /> <br /> So it's not a fun word. Maybe not now, but prepare yourself. The fact that it is not bad in its plot makes it more enjoyable. It's kinda like MST3000 and Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video clip rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
