In this film, made JUST as the production code was implemented, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick "Kitty". A girl from Missouri starts with girls getting a train, and Eadie promises herself to get money while looking for a husband of a millionaires, sitting whole-in process. Not long after meeting with Frank's cousin, (Lewis Stone, was a compassionate physician at the Grand Hotel, as well as Hardy Judge in the "Andy Hardy" film), but not all as it seems. "The girl could not accept such a great gift from the gentleman unless she had worked." Later, someone says "You know we were not just together" and Eadie responds "Yes, and we won't!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to help him when trouble comes to find Eadie. At one time, Paige says "You ought to read me on your list - I'm not a man" .... I wonder what that verse would be a few years before the Hayes code would come to the city. What was he really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the "Baby advertiser" organized on the loan at IMD. It seems like he was just on showbiz from 1931 - 1939, and "Munchkin" in the wizard of Oz to be the last part he played. Fun, cleancut romp as girls expel men all over the country. See Nat Pendleton as a warrior keeper, who was the Wrestler of the 1920s (winner of the silver medal) turned the film star (he was in most of the Kildares Dr, and would appear in four Harlow films). Young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit in "Palm Beach", although the outward city of the city seems to be backward.
