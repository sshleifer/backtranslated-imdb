I bought this film a few days ago, and I think it would be a very good film. But when I hit into a DVD-player, it was amazed at the best way. James Belushi does well as Bill "Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a beautiful roll like a sheriff. The 'end' area, in Bill's house is very good, good work of the camera, good conversation and very good acting. Bill "Mouth" Manuccie has been stolen 12 million dollars from Mafia. With his wife lives in South-Carolina in the defense program of the evidence. But Mafia takes him down, and wants 12 million dollars. Bill could only believe the only person who knows inside, himself.
