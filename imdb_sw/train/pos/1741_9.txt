This is a wonderful film for the full meaning of the word. It tells the tail here in Greece we live as usual in everyday life without realizing how sad. In fact there are so many things but every moment and sadness of life passes beyond art. It is very important for the goals we use and the whole social structure builds up. The film has a deep understanding of Greek ways of life, exhibition, and social structure. Unlike many Greek films with some fast-food recipients, this does not focus on anyone but when you look it feels like someone puts words and pictures to express your feelings. It's not a great fan of traditional music or I can't hear anything else while playing during the movie. If someone told me to say something about this film I will explain the following, sometimes changes between events appeared suddenly or somewhat. I think editing should have refused to match 2hours and a little for the movies. Must see
