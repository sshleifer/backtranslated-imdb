With Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was hosting the village of Columbo. Columbo's first "right", the following two common pilots, "The Death of the Book" is not far from the usual situation. Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of the coalition of the secret genocide. His girlfriend Jim is talented, while Ken has no other talent except the gift of gabe and skills to promote books. As soon as Jim decided that he did not need Ken's marketing skills, Ken plotted to kill Jim. Unless it is a new plot, it is actually a reality in real life story of the original murder focused on one of their books. It is unthinkable for Columbo to work out that Ken is a murderer, though unfortunately other killings should be done (Ken romances and then kill a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to get the point. <br /> <br /> Nothing is wrong with "Murder and Book", but not quite over-notch. I would just give "Publish Or Destruction" on this top: both elements of Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "Publishing or Destruction" is part of the most time and unpredictable. But this is still a big part.
