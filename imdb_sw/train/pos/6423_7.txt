This film is a wonderful shock that never stops the player's full comedy comedy Dawid Dhawan - disruptive heroes, helpers, fingers made for heroines, bad criminals, lust, voicemails and little doses of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in two police duties and conmen. The heroine of Amitabh is a soldier Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is against Govinda soldiers. Heroines are red-smothered props as usual. The conmen have no heroines. Paresh Rawal is doing his crime in DAUD ahead (played Don similar to KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani shines briefly. He makes a retake for "Jaire Angrezon and the eraane" Jail "very popular in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is valid as usual - as a wise police, Pyaare Mohan and Chhote Miyaan group. He imitates the Indian style of speaking with good results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe or not, is not the same as to compare him. But AB is still good. Madhuri Dixit appears as himself in the song "Makhna". He plays like a wind. <br /> <br /> The Shah's music music is awesome. See "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" with the title of the head. Do not expect any LOGIC for it to be a comedy and a screenplay is quite convenient. Just enjoy it.
