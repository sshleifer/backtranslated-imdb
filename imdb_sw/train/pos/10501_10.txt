Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It is addicting that you can play for hours after hours without stopping to rest. I've hit the game 4 times, but I've never got all the 120 stars ... (I've got 111) ... but I hope to get to the end. Even though I didn't play this game until I was seven years old, I liked to watch my sisters play. Now I'm 13 and still playing this, deleting games and restarting. <br /> <br /> Images impossible for N64 early game. Gameplay is addictive. Control is huge. Levels are complicated, but impossible. Bowser's fight is a challenge. I would like to tell you more, but why not do yourself? Put X-BOX 360, PS3, and Wii off and go to get Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, amazing game.
