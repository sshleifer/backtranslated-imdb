It is good to see Jorja Fox in the role that gets very exciting. Also loved to hear singing. Good change to see him out of his duties of CSI / West Wing / ER. The movie itself was entertaining, but it seemed to fly some details in many places. A few of the characters seemed to have one stress per minute and enjoy the next and it was left to your mind to know what. Each character was quirky though and sometimes, I couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they could say next. This movie is not filled with clean people, but it's hard people who can make mistakes, feel bad and then find a way to fix it.
