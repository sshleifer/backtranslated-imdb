I saw this film at a university film after 70 years - I have been waiting for this film to come out on the video (finally located out). It was done in Brazil, so I thought that was why it didn't make the video yet. I've been looking at video stores for the last 15 years waiting for this excellent movie to order out! It is one of the most popular favorites at all times - but warn, it is weird, as Werner Herzog weird - its weakness is attributed to its super-realism. The movie is based on a true event back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans met tribes in Amazon. A white man has lost a safe tribe of enemies as an enemy, so they are determined to kill him. Before they take him, however, they make him a part of their tribe (their custom). The whole movie is like watching the Geographical Geography document as it becomes a recognized member of his tribe. That's right. Cosmic Plan? No. A great understanding in the various forms of human life? Without doubt. This video has a false illusion - this is not a shade of Hollywood circulating on a good achievement ... this film describes as it was (re-read: National Geographic, effective) great) / / <br />
