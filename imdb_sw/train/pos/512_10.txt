"The Way to Heaven" is the best invention of films, perhaps never. I am following for the "Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen," although it is a different kind of movie than "Queen of Africa." "Skill to Heaven" is a physiological-drama that uses the concept of performance and technical effects which, to my knowledge, are quite unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of B&W and color pictures - like "Oz," but the importance of the difference goes beyond the simple - but good - the effect found in "Oz." In the "Stairway" purpose and effect of the difference can be described as powerful. Another priority of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How can anyone be born the best way to make time to stand still? real? And then there is the Skills itself! If you have any idea, you will agree with me. "The Way to Heaven" is a true gem.
