I have seen this true movie because you have a red-colored player (Chris Rock) who dies and returns to the world in the middle of the 50th mans. We do not know that his behavior should change and continues to do as he has. Listens to rap music, plays together, and plays the part of the black man in the city. The real humor in this film was looking at the problem that this character is sending to the black community.
