According to Elmore Leonard, this is a powerful and intelligent film. Myth: A businessman is killed by three criminals. Roy Schieder does a good job as a leading character and a special loan should go to John Glover who has a kind of bad psychopath. I must know that ethnic characters are very complicated and interesting - something that is very few for film action. also have beautiful and beautiful women - the most popular is Kelly Preston as a young youth for Schieder behavior. Vanity gives good performance and appearance as a hooker who is bound by three blackmailers. I am pleased to say that Ann-Margaret is not lost - this woman is a true child. Do not look at the level of this film. I don't know what the public and some critics are faced with this film but my opinion is ignoring them and watching this promoting and low film. You'll enjoy it, that's a promise. Recommended A +.
