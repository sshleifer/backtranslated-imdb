The quote I used for my summary takes place about half through the prestigious country, as the captain of the Chinese coup (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to the group for having more time to shoot more fighters among them, as his only unit has been called back to the front lines. Of course, the upcoming painter and shot is the main character of the film, an old kitchen girl O-Lan (who shows Luise Rainer, 99 years old, won her second best Oscar successor next) finds O-Lan giving her bag of lost instruments to her uninvited husband, the farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), putting the dichotomy of the common money of the mobility to be inverse one of its decline of morals. /> <br /> For films related to issues including slavery, false charges, misogyny, hunger, home invasion, eating family meat, mental absence, infanticide, wounded refugees, violence, civil war for themselves, a summary of the massacre of the road, bigamy, childbirth, adultery, sexual relations, and the number of biblical numbers, the Good Land is an amazing movie to the heart. of another classic quote , from O-Lan himself (while placing a precious sauce his son had agreed to steal from an old woman back in a pot of cooking after the husband Wang Lung shouted on the dirt floor on the other side of their house): "Meat is meat."
