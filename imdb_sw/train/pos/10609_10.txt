I saw this film last night on the cable and it's amazing. What I like most about it is that it is less basic and useful, but in detail. Henry Thomas' (played a child in E.T.) The performance is very skillful (he needs to be someone of a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful villain of madness. And by a miracle (for we say about Hollywood brands here) the child serves as the main character, but the person who does not do or has lines, but not just (and looks for it). Interesting note that Thomas's wonderful relationship w. E.T. was the basis of the film; when his bond w. The child is used as the "Good Child." <br /> <br /> Then there is music - ah, what music! Gillian Welch songs are amazing and the whole color is the best music of the hill country. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing in the sky. I strongly recommend.
