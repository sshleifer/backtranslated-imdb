This film deals with Irish rebellion in the 1920s and particularly one person after informing a friend of the virtue on his head and the following results. Watching the film, I felt that you could take the script and for some small updates, do it again, sadly, it would fit for modern events. But restructuring will not be too close. The good performance with Victor McLaglen (which he deserved to Oscar) and a good collection is being played with many, if not all actors in Hollywood at that time, many of them recognize character actors or the introduction of time or just starting. Very good film worth looking. It is highly recommended.
