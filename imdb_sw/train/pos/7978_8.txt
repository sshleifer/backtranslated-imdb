This film has one link that all revenge movies should have and that is a true feeling. Shock, love, laughter, anger. There are many impressions on this film. From beginning to end this film is very interesting. The plan on the paper looks like the garbage that is thrown in the faces of viewers but not mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington always puts good performance. The plot is brief: the person has depression, the little girl brings life into it, the children get kidnap, someone wants to take revenge. He doesn't feel like anything but better than any similar film out there. For an instant, TAKEN is the same film but when you compare them both, MAN ON MOTO is successful. Participants are involved with everyone putting good performance and leading is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like a city of Mexico, it looks like a city of Mexico. Everything is carefully shown. The fashion trend is something that I enjoyed and brought the best from Mexico City / City <br /> This is one of the films you will take once a year to look at or a film that you will ask your family and friends to watch. From beginning to end you are rooting for the main character, making it a journey of motion. There is enough action to make you happy, there is a steady development to please you and then Washington will bring a smile to your face. Watch this film, you will not be discouraged
