I must say, I was impressed with the quality of the film. It was better than I expected. The situation and acting is quite good. The director did a good job as well. Although some cases seem less, it's a pretty good movie. The idea was very clear and the truth did not reveal itself even to the end. A psychiatric hospital was provided very well. The plan was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find a boring thing even though the story line is very focused and takes time for development and story. The story of the story, is a good movie for its kind and it is very amazing.
