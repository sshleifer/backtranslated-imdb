I will put this short and sweet evaluation .... I think I saw a trailer for this and I think I'd give it a 5 minute whirl and my original ideas were "what hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I walked and after 20 I was taking my jaw on the floor. This film is a good example of how the film can be, and more is French. This film is a high-eyed film of a closed film in the future of the future sunny film, the motion of the motion is very clever and the black and white color style though for the first time it did not do it for me fully I and at the end of the film and I found myself wanting every film made like this. I think my ideas were helped by the big dubbing would be much easier to destroy if they did not put the most respected actors as many voice actors do not know the feelings for the characters (Just watch any Hong Kong film in English to see the perfect example) I gave 9 though I gave 2 more because of the clean and new thing feelsâ€¦
