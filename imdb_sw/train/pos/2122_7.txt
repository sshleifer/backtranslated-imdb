Back in the day of the great studio system, the decision to throw values ​​were made. All American elder James Stewart looked like a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. I would be giving a film, part of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. His error mixed with all European features was nothing. Stewart had the same problem in the storm of Mortal as well as Margaret Sullavan. Margaret Sullavan was a woman who regularly guided on the screen, made four films with her. But this is just where none of them die. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back when he was a fighter player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was a good friend of Stewart Henry Fonda at that time. <br /> <br /> I think Clark Gable just managed to carry that US in the cast of non-Americans in Mutiny to Bounty. Stewart in the Mortal Storm was Germany, but all the other players were American and so nothing went out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, than you will see a good film from Ernest Lubitsch. The program is very simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest is not available to anyone. But it seems that they are communicating with unknown strangers who turn to each other. Also employer Frank Morgan accuses Stewart of kanoodling and his wife. Though the guidelines are good and Frank Morgan is moving out of his normal self, two of the best players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite time in the film while removing after Morgan starts asking people for comments. He does so much. And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is as good as a little bug that kisses Frank Frank. In fact you hate such people, I know many like Schildkraut in real life who are a political office 24 hours a day. Unfortunately, it pays a good deal of time.
