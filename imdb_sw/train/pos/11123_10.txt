Greetings from the Portuguese boy: I believe Sopranos is one of the best producers, it has the truth and the fusion mixed in that way, it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits on paper as a glove! I would love Sopranos never ever finished. It's perfect! It should be a school lesson :) I saw Sopranos when I was a child, but I was too young to sleep until the end of the day, so now I bought all the programs on the DVD and I watched all the pieces at home and after dinner and I got addicted, as I did and broke Prison. In my opinion Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series ever for television. Both discussions are royal and administrators are perfect. Congratulations for the work. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my English. Thank you for reading.
