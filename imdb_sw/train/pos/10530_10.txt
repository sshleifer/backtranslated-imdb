It is a fun film ... It is / is it that it is connected to the Oscar-winning artist RACHEL PORTMAN's exciting, emotional and dreaming, this film is still a good pleasure to see once a year. <br /> <br>> thrown to the amazing ... Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's position. Toni Collette was as good as Harriett Smith. It is a MISS !!! He was trying to look, a man found himself on the edge of the seat just to rely on every word and laugh at him. One of the most interesting characters I have had for many years. From the opening events when thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending "the peak of a good quarter of pigs ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" he says in his daffy and open hearing mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Act) who seems to be lost and lost. Beautiful ways that Emma could avoid abortion Miss Bates builds herself on one real place to immerse on a picnic while Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her to the heart to dig her heart. So we see the poor Miss Bates screaming and close to tears and a person who has been very upset can not help but feel her heart has given her on her behalf. It is a common location, one of the review and play again and more ... <br /> <br /> The last is the same as "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of the most life lessons on how one should marry a friend good man ... <br /> <br /> I hope that this film enjoys you all like myself. <br /> <br /> I added it!
