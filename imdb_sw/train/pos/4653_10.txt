This is a gun gun of the British gun and which I can look again without increasing. Peter Ustinov has never done a bad job and this is not an exception, especially for his dry witch but a very clever scheme. Karl Malden has always been a mine style since he had a star in the 'Streets of San Francisco'. I believe that Maggie Smith is a real star of this film though, it seems to be very unclear in everything she is trying to do but she is actually open, especially at the end when she tells everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered when she dresses her clothes. One thing pertains to me, although someone can tell me why I can't buy this for any DVD or VHS in the UK, can it help someone?
