Do not listen to the prissy critics who may be attacking yet from the Silverman burners gave them in the Spike TV Awards a few months ago, "Sara Silverman" is very strange, surreal, stupid, ignorant and could be very good at adult swimming line. As the Silverman sounds under the joke of the young "doody" and emphasizes that the dark, the lowest sense of the show now appears only, we can have the largest comedies of worship since the cancellation of "Aliens and Candy". But just from looking at the quiz, it's just stable, it's not good, it causes comedy / dark music but with great power. Silverman has created a hilarious woman of character - very good, younger, the Hebrew version of the late Jerri Blank and the late shows one of the most unusual, non-traditional exhibitions. A gay couple I had ever seen on television. Early reviews provide a second two extra experimental trial so I can't wait to see how this is shown.
