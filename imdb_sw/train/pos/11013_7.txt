There were many films made by Hollywood during the war years that were planned to support our troops from the public. To see today, some people can dismiss them or view them as propaganda - which they are technically, but of good sort and means to integrate the nation. This film is a good example of the type of entertainment - you have a good script and good production standards. Pat O'Brien is very interested in the same behavior he did in many other films (you know, tough-talking, hard-driven "boy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, who is able and entertaining and all the others are better (look at Robert Ryan as one of the training bombs). While the story reminds a few other movies about the fighters and our staff, the film has been done well to make it attractive and not too far away. That, perhaps, except the end of the end - where the film is a little over-top but also fun. About the worst worst, and this is for the caterpillars of nitpickers, is that some stock photographs are somewhat badly connected to the film and "nuts" as I who are teachers of history and lovers of birds will probably see this - all the rest you will not see.
