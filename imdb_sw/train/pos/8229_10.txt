This is a slow-slow movie slow, creating a slow story of an old striker who starts a new family life with a complete visitor. The viewer feels slowly there is something wrong here. It is clever, very well and does well. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are in detail within their characters. Little "pierrot" also very touching. <br /> <br /> Fun that doesn't look like one. The most unusual movie, a particular atmosphere in the entire movie though you can feel extremely rare and several events. <br /> <br /> will give you 8/10!
