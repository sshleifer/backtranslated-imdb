For the first film in the proposed series achieves the right balance. It has been made in style and class to show the early days of forgetfulness as a refugee and the beginning of a strong increase in the world of crime. I think it is a picture of trust / truth of his character especially like the author Peter O'Donnell wanted. Alexandra Staden as Humility is very good with the best option. He does so much to lobby as a difficult and external advocate / intelligence / guilt. With a perfect score for Tarantino by selecting unknown celebrities for the role - more reliable to have a new face forms part. I expect the next film.
