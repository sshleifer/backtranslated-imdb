I have spent years seeking copies of this film (16mm, dvd, vhs), so I could show them to my children. The movie is funny, and Fortune and its members show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be good that demented play. I love and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The movie is about to turn to the fire of the century, with the staff of misfits which are firemen and department departments (when not fighting fire). There is usually a run, with the surprise of Spike Jones and its Orchestra. Also, the beautiful aid offered by the player Buddy Hackett and Hugh O'Brien.
