This is one of the best comedy / music videos "B" that I have seen (and since I am 40 years old and I only see now, not an expert but I've seen all the films out there). While there are tons of executives getting their leadership for a minute at a time, usually comedy interferes with music bits, and often the pieces of music eliminates the comedic flow. I call in a state of affairs but when I saw this in TCM Europe, I was laughing loudly and fun! So who gave me laughter? Of course Mischa Auer gave me some very laughter laughter, even stole the last, it was good! Referring to that, I think why this film works because though L & H is a point of selling (and why I've got to focus on this (they and Hal Roach), I love them in their original Ro Roach stuff, this continues to minimum and stay at a higher price at ADULT (by 1930 levels, and not far from today's standards if you read between lines). Jack Haley is also good to watch, I admit that I just know him from W O OZ and I love him there, and I also laughed a voice here to his bit servant at the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "worst" of women in 30 movies that are watching me (something tells me was a spitfire in real life); and the number of music has the quality of professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality, which hit me away from what I used in this type. I could continue, but make sure I enjoyed this film. 8 out of 10 I saw it in TCM Europe and I will look back at my wife at TCM USA. Good things!
