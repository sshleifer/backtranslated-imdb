Pakeezah has an interesting history (which is well written in the 'Trivia' section) about how it was. It seems that finally attempted to measure Kamal Amrohi (director) at the same time he wanted to see him finished his masterpiece. The result is the magnitude of which the sensation arises to the extent that it cannot be real but it is much better to stop the impact. Meena Kumari lives in Nargis and Sahib Jaan as his own. Other film stars, instead, are Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (back) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinema shows cause you to hit the links. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in the world cinema. It reveals to you new layers every time you look again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the poetry poetry songs and he left us every gift.
