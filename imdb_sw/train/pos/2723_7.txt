IN THE BATTLE OF THE BATTLE it is an instructional and used instruction by Richard Brooks. However, it also happens to be true, sometimes it is more clinical than entertainment. Describing the brutal murder of the Midwest family, author Truman Capote described the minutia, locking himself and the reader on subjects. Brooks leaves the wild from that way for something close to the docudrama. Although the film on the real places, it keeps away. The killers are shown as bad, which they were really. They do not look like an unconscious soul (as in the book of Capote) and their degradation is a terrible fear. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are as good as killers as they have been helped, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a writer (character of Capote?).
