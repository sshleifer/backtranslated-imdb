I love watching this film because of all the terrible events about raptors. I love raptors because they are afraid. My favorite places where the raptor looks behind the columns because it reminds me of a scene from Friday's 13th movie and a girl eating bananas. I want to look at this movie because computer graphics seem to be a bit fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you won't even see what's going on and I think it has a good end even though I don't know what's going on on my first comment The couple I saw for some time and that's the most important part. Another important part is how dinosaurs can be scary if you look at them for the first time. It's a MOVIE Good.
