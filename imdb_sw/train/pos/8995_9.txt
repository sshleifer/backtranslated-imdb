I couldn't find anyone looking at DiG! and me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the band. Usually everyone thinks you can just enjoy this film if you like Dandy Warhols music or the murder of Brian Jonestown, but this is far from reality. The only requirement is that you are interested in music and / or pop culture in general. The way the two groups are similar are the full representation of the way the band can take, and to watch the public eating and banning Dandy Warhols. I agree with another opinion that it says it would be nice to get the last word from Anton himself, since he has been exposed as his worst enemy and bulwark with the ability to continue to remain. Most interesting to me is the honor of Dandys for BJM (despite their absence or return) and to Anton (despite his unusual behavior). Dandy Warhols respects the art that the group produces even if the group hates everything that Dandy Warhols now stands (though it is unacceptable). The best line is when Dandy's player says "I won't have them anywhere again" and the guitar doesn't know "I will continue to buy their record anyway." For me, this only shows how good music can be. It is clear to see this film, even if you don't know anything of the band. It's more about rock music themes and how to develop which makes this film interesting. It is rare to follow the group very closely for a long time.
