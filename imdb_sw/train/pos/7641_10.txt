Everyone plays their very best part in this "movie". Belushi gets an opportunity to live a different way of life, but end up knowing that what he has will be good or perhaps even better. The movie shows us that we should use the opportunities we have, not that we cannot or cannot have. If U can get this film on video for around $ 10, it will be an investment!
