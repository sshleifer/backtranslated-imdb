I'm not sure if the word "big comedy" is used for this film, I don't even know if this can be used. In the last few years movies movies are filled with comedy movies which are a stupid way even to get us. So, I realized the non-fiction movies like "big comedies". Does the 40-year-old Virgin enter the party? That's up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very interesting movie. You are very excited, as well as providing social feedback through the characters and the most beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'm already there more than one hundred years old boy out there, and even people who are not equal to these instructions, can feel recognized by one of the characters in the film, especially men. The story, as the title says, is about Andy, the shy boy, silent, who collects step-by-step statistics, seeing the escapees and his octogenarian neighbors and whose band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is a Andy co-worker in SmartTech. He believes Andy that psychopath until Andy's secret will be opened. Kal is obviously cheating but still seems to find what he wants and different types. David is a passionate boy who still has love with his ex-boyfriend, who ran with someone else. And Jay, someone in the relationship who seems to be affected by cheating her to continue to get caught in action. I am sure most young people from 13 to 21 have already watched this film, but they really don't have the age limit to enjoy it. So if you don't see and enjoy a little laugh, and social clarity, rather than going to your video store and relaxing from these deep and independent films. It also includes DVD benefits that you will see from top to bottom.
