*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker. Directed by Richard Shepard. Well-organized stories and films together, Brosnan has never been better off on the film's "Bond" film. After 2004 "After the sun" its new role creates a laugh and a good time. The academic suspect, by saying, Julian Noble working in Mexico City regions gathers against himself and the businessman of the top Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best duties) also in the business there. Two doses on the screen produce the defendant, stimulating laughter and failure to release. Davis in one of its best duties since the "Splendor of America" ​​offers another interesting and amazing performance. One of the most enjoyable years with the best film. My last rating 9/10
