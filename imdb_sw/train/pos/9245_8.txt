Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were great on the screen team and this could be their best film together. Yes, Actor Your person can be happy and predictable, but that's not what I like about the film. I love seeing Harlow and Gable as well as in this film is very amazing. It is obvious that they were happy to work together and that is a part of what makes this film wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk of magic, the great script and the attention to detail are other things that make it so very good movie. I liked this film for the first time I saw it and every time I watched I always reported at least one new one. For me, that's a good film. <br /> <br /> Talk with the script is better than more movies from this time (early 30 years). I love old movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes they don't have my interests. Holding Your Person is one off. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Holding Your Person is 'pre-code' movie. (Hays code was not implemented until the year after Holding Your Person.) This video could not be made under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank you for the good code is not up to 1934. Otherwise, we would lose this gem.
