Who could imagine - Hal Hartley creates a corollary film for Syriana while saving his signature idiosyncratic style. Fusion is very entertaining. After seeing Hal Hartley's film for ten years, I addressed this matter with caution. Its nine-year brilliant production had the feelings of critics and listeners in their style and their unique dialogue. The preliminary director's films showed the color characters and gave a closer look at life - often in Long Island, New York or New York City itself - which had been well-known. My first warning is given by this film as "spy style". For my good surprise, Hartley can create its stylish style and focus on producing the original game of international controversy. It works much more than someone can think of. Hartley's film holds talks with the attitude of behavior which is its trademark, as well as a unique movie style. It is also very accurate due to the current world situation and the war situation that has been emphasized by the dark elements around. Hartley has brought all his knowledge to something new - a political film should be mentioned in one breath like Syriana. Surely he comes in himself. The mission has a good job of translating the vision and style of Hartley. Fans of Parker Posey will see him in full bloom here, still with us and more mature and more beautiful than ever.
