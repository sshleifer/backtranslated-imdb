"Holly" is a film based on the issue, but not the management is not available. In his heart is a character-driven film, which can not be very successful without Patrick's exhibition (Ron Livingston), a lost soul and a sense of raising gradually, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), power-willed but ultimately on-matched Vietnamese girl. From vibrant locations to photography editing, everything is clear and fully. Modern modern elements can be put off at first, but it is the top composition and enhancing the so-called visible barrier. This film, which raises many issues but provides a few clear answers, ultimately succeeds in promoting awareness and compassion for Holly and many who share its problem. Kudos for those who could do it.
