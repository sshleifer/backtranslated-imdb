Animation always appears to be fringe. Japan, this may not be, but in Europe and much more in the US animation has a large tag of "KIDS" on it. France is one of the most comic-liberal countries, the old house of the Tin-Tin, Asterix, Luke Lucky, Valereon and so on (if you have never read this, not too late. ) It looks like a natural film like this comes in France. It is suitable for my French discrimination as film lovers, web-based and talented American talent. Luckily there is also a "dark scanner" out there to prevent the same view - looks art is very beautiful internationally. <br /> <br /> However, if you can be assembled Renaissance is very much with French. If you are an ordinary person you will be afraid of this. No need of that however! Under the cold, the appearance of shades of cell shade is good thriller and the whole film as a whole. It was one of my fears about this film. It is very easy to turn an attractive animation to the gimmick, such as Sony & C: o are doing with Pixar off-offs offs. I was expecting confusion, sometimes fascinating, not very interesting, but by chance I was wrong. I would enjoy it even with neo-noir items, but it was good that it was valuable on that level as well. NOTE: I found a French dub which was exactly the same as I could see. English can be more interesting to Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> Last name of the attribute for animation. It was amazing. Modern view, beauty, beauty of the camera, intelligent solution (Eyes for example looks very well, which is difficult to do) and so very surprisingly I felt like bursting out "This is very amazing!" Then again, I love the animation and I enjoy the studio efforts installed, so my decision is limited. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie however, definitely lives more than "gimmick".
