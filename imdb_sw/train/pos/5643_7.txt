Mary Pickford ("born on the fourth of July" as Angela Moore) is "Little American" (of French heritage); he loves Jack Jackt (like Karl Von Austreim), who has moved to America with his German mother and American mother. French and American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin's "Fighting Destruction") has fallen by love with Mrs Pickford. Love trieled triome finally wind in France, and the Great War (World War, in the background) to strengthen their lives significantly. A great film of entertainment, as destructive, the film Cecil B. DeMille. Walking, and sinking, the ship carrying the Pickford is a "Titanic" - similar. The battle of the war gets very fast as Pickford becomes slow to spy on France, when the Germans take over his father's house. Of course, German Holt's partner is coming. It was hard to believe they took a long time to realize if he moved to rape, but it was dark; and, earlier events made them believe in the dead. The film goes on top of the model. Pickford was, by the way, Canada, though, a few can deny that it is not "Little of America", for all purposes and purposes. <br /> <br /> FUN to see "extra" which later became a great star including Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore, and Ramon Novarro - in particular, see Mr. Novarro showing the quality of "star" during the most memorable process of The film: Pickford and wounded soldiers greet them for being taken to the fabric. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write her a letter; In fact, he has a future opportunity in the picture. Also, Alexander Ben, who plays the boy "Bobby"; it becomes human reliance, and grow up to become a partner of Jack Webb on "Dragnet". Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Mary Pickford, Jack Holt, Raymond Hatton
