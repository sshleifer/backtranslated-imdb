As one of the original speakers said, this was based on a great movie but something happened on the delivery method. The demolition because Collette's performance was normal and Williams was honest. I kept waiting to be better. I don't think it was a bad editing or you need another director, it could be just a film. It came as a Canadian film, something like the first X-Files season. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needs to emphasize a little more. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The movie reached at that time then faded away; the kind of falsehood. I can see how much pressure would take away the "truth" of the story but I thought that part of it was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for a boy. This movie needs to have a Ward Director who tries to fix these problems.
