While in the airplane, playing through a great movie trailer, I found Live! almost accident. oh boy! what option. <br /> <br /> I remembered of course seeing a trailer over a year ago and quite forgot about it expecting no more than another eye-off movie to show a stupid reality. Now I can easily say this has been a trip to the trip. I don't remember the last time I was so excited, I was scared. I don't know if it was about playing with my feelings, but the doubts slow down through the movie until you reach the point where you can't turn from the screens, actually sitting beside your seat and swallowing the remaining nails you've got. You are going to go through a self-assessment of the values ​​where you stand about the right to show. You will depart from thinking "how man can be so bad" to "why not after all?" Ask yourself if you will. Then learn about the fighters, their intentions and start counting. So you will look at the competitor smashing directly and getting excited even though you know the first candidate is safe. Good acting, good leadership, and filming experience that reminds you of the old movies where you knew what would happen in the next area but were still more eager. * * / * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * + I've been moved to the farmer and we should have a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich author who wants to be popular is a little stupid, it feels like you don't care about some opponents. Although this may have been done for the purpose, I think the listeners should be able to join many of the fighters. - The rules of the game, a great glitch: <br /> <br /> happens if the 5 competitors do not die when trigger trigger. What? you think a lot of the last person will take away the trigger and implement yourself! should give them an opportunity for all opponents to live, namely: if 5 is empty too, then no one dies. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It is amazing that I have never had a lot of trouble with these bad points causing me to really have a good time. just want to like to popcorn with me!
