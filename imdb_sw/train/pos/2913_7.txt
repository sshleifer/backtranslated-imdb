"Navy Man's" is, as some comments have said, look for a rare and good on the Navy lighter than the air (LTA). The LTA traders were so proud of their meeting that they never missed the ship for a submarine attack. And photographs of various NAS sites offer valuable comments in the flight type of airplane that has passed. However, the first half of the movies are about Beery, his relationship with his pals service, and he will meet Tom Drake character with his mother, and get Drake foot fixed. Then the second film will begin. The second film is more than the LTAs in action, taking less down, boys are killed and the greater damage caused. The view is gentle and true, I think. Then we move to South-East Asia. Does the Navy order with LTA there? Never worry, this part is wild, and the blimp is used to eliminate the birds from the bottom of the jungle. And Japs are shot as mad. The shadows of Vietnam, unless the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is the blimp we are talking about. At the end, the WWII's feel of the most beautiful part of the war.
