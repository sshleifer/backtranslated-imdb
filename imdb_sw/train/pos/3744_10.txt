This is a possible criminal crime game I have ever seen. Acting is much better Amanda Burton whose character goes horrible to sweet to disrupt and sad and then some ... He does an amazing job to balance the feelings of Rachels / Carlas and make the pain of someone lost a child, and so it is believed that it feels more like story real life then sports game. Other characters are also great which is usually in the UK / Film. Finally, which I can give, it's very strange because you can't find one ... (you will find what I mean after seeing it) This is worth buying and seeing more and longer and if you don't react to this you are one cool heart.
