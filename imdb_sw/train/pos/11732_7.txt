Okay, I found this in the movies when it came out and I don't know why. I haven't seen it since, but I shared this page because I found myself thinking about this film - again I don't know why. But the fact that I remember speaks much. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard - much harder than any game. Doing so fairly makes it easier to do, but doing something wrong ... is there anything worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, caution, falls into this group again for some reason. Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done so right for me to remember this fondly movie. The fastest, and language in the cheek and know it is not the Story of Philedelphia, it enters from beginning to end. Participants of the brain are another ideal in this category (without more than a free boob joke). <br /> <br /> One of the friction - the end. It seems the authors / director did not have the idea of ​​finishing comedy. Finally it tries to be a story of love, somehow undermining rapid speeds up to that point. Then there is a "tassle" area. Although this should be seen (male views), it is up to the top and out of place is as shock. More rewriting for expiration was required. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or Manufacturers or Holy Grail. But if you try to wipe it and let the fun and taste experience come to you, you will laugh, I assure you.
