I was hit by the renamed Battlestar Galactica, showing that it has always made me think and bring me to tears more than one event. A fierce sci-fi fan, I would think I can pick up good things from BS, and this was a good thing. So, when I first heard about the succession of the prequel series Several months ago I got a feeling of illness in my stomach. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar succeeded will be used again in Caprica, which cannot work at all. BSG's story, of the mourners' band, were beaten into the star wars and led by the vision of prophecy and the sequence of pseudo miracles, it was fully proposed by unfamiliar music and better characters. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. The BSG organization takes place after the collapse of a great civilization, Caprica shows that civilization is cool and fragrant heyday. The total vouchers given to me from Caprica were similar to those of the small, non-overview. In the true form of BSG, Caprica has a few hours of the first program to deal with religious issues, religious discrimination, the moral values ​​of God and the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Providing Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from an entrepreneur-emerging entrepreneur, and to his daughter's concern and intention, every actor and actor resigns from their roles. <br /> <br /> Music, used so strongly in BSG, also plays a major role in Caprica. Battlestar's power-filled power and sad duduks were well organized. Caprica uses more orchestral sounds, which gives the display a feeling itself completely from the original predecessors. <br /> <br /> New Caprica is definitely a show for yourself, connecting from the Battlestar's only franchise if it needs. I look forward to the full range.
