Seven young people go to the forest seeking to carry. So they are all beaten and killed by Vietnam's Vietnam veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a good Mexican entertainment that reminds me of a lot "Zero Boys". faster and there are some good events of death like a throat or neck around the neck. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of years, so grand-guignol fans will lose heart. The Mexican is quite clear (I have just seen "Alucarda" and "Do not be afraid"), so this should be another reason to see this slasher of enjoyable.My rating: 7 out of 10. It was highly recommended.
