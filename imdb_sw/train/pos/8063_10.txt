This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first John Ford graduate, is just scoring for the scoring mark by Max Steiner. It was called the Art Gallery, because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and reward, and greed and ignorance. But what makes this movie unusual, is a trend with a wonderful picture and use of mist and lighting, which was completely different from the usual American film, and more in the traditional German expression. And the performance of Oscar winning by Victor McLaglen as Gypo drink is just amazing. Basically the movie takes place in Ireland, and Gypo returns to a friend in the pursuit of the rebel in English to collect 20 pounds to give his girlfriend. But with all these money, he starts to beat all night and drink, while the leaders of the movement are trying to monitor the information. The whole movie is one night in Ireland's dark and foggy, and thrown to the characters who are not remembered but all over, the whole world of Gypo closes in it, psychologically. If I chose you probably the three directors to have all their movies on an island left forever, and no one, John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a wonderful movie ...
