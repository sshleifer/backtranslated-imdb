Most American people will say ... What? in my opening comments. Yes I know that my comparison is no doubt being insulting to the fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but analyzing this film, my opinion is the same. We have a farmer who goes to the city to seek help from fake insects who want to steal the village harvest. The main difference is the way the story takes. Our samurai, the circus artists as it was originally is a very good combination of creation but at the end it is the needs of the village, HEROES. Please see this amazing film (seven Samurai, open) and find other movies that are stolen from the story and try to get the same effect of magic than Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. The arrow is the Warrior 13 and Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton borrowed the story of his best player, but he did not get the third leg of the cat.
