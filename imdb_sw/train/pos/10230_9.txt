People forget that there are a few of the King Kong-Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all love each other, but YETI stands alone. It is only one borrower from King Kong and that is the attraction of the animal and one woman. YETI's story depends on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archeologists are attracted, while one of them was there, but no scientific data to prove. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it is worth looking at it. The first time I looked at was "Mr. Elvira's Giza Exhibition" in the early 1980s. It brought down my spine as a child, especially when YETI loved it. I saw it again, about 1:00 am on ABC about 2 to 3y ago ago. Seeing again makes me more aware, there are serious side effects (in time) and the story involves a young boy with his dog, and a good businessman who wants to kill YET for his own purpose. Also music is pretty cool, Its very much like. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians builds a big monster as a sky. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half out of 10.
