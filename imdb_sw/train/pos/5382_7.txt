After watching the TV series Next Action Star, I was delighted to see the winners' film once. I had a picture of a new talent, but I was surprised and happy. Billy Zane, of course, was his most common man, but Corinne and Sean took part in it. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from competition) in their duties to come. Characteristics of Sean, not Billy's, is hunting, and his confusion in discovering new rules in the game is well played. Corinne walks well between her love and Sean and just being in it for money. I loved how the game played until the end of the second. And then more! Not a great movie, but it's a way to entertain all the way and show the best for two people at first out of the gate.
