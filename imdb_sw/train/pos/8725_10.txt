I liked Antz, but I liked "Bug Life". Animated set in this paid. I will definitely get this on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a clear version of this movie on the tape. (I heard the talk of running all characters on the screen in the normal video format). Many will be forced to admit that the last credit was funniest! I just saw two sets, but I can't see another one!
