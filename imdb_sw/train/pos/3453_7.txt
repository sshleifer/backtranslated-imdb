Although this film has the first list of good actors, special effects that are excellent, and the line of the story of surprise, was not taken for the distribution of the label and went straight to the DVD. Perhaps it contains a lot of 'anti-police' information, or maybe it is one juts of many of the opening works during glut, but whatever the reason for large screens does not exist, fortunately the new concept of giving directly to the DVD allows us to enjoy. The theme is old: the rookie author reveals the inner circle of fighters who are bribes - in this case FRAT (the first attacking team and the wise), a police force who learned well formed a city cleaning The history of Edison from its downward crime, drugs, prostitution etc.. Working under an attempt to lose money and finances show a lot of opportunities and now, 15 years after its creation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, trafficking innocent people, leading dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a gangster terrible!) and her boyfriend Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more than usual to prove she can be a sensitive actor). The author Pollack (Justin Timberlake) takes the wind of 'wrong error' and explains his theory of fraud and corruption to his master Ashford paperman (who was very good with Morgan Freeman). Slowly Polack persuades Ashford and future Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a good character of the character) and helps Pollack in this survey report. Pollack almost gets the most amazing surprise and bad events happens and the story runs pall mall towards a series of unexpected results. Timberlake has no charisma to lead, especially in the company of seasoned executives. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the boiling machine of boiling movie to the end. No, it's not a great film, but it's one that makes for the edge of the flick seat and message. Grady Harp
