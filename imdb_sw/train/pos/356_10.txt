It turned out to be classy production and what should be a low budget. The types of characters are amazing, from young people dedicated to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between direction, not very interesting but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed a mixture of humor (which might be very easy to get bad, too / not enough) which means that it is not found in the dark, nor is it worth it. It was a great step from other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, according to the story and production. They have the best website that should look at. Can't wait Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be extraordinary.
