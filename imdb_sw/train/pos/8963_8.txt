John Van Druten Broadway hit brings to the screen with the maximum power of the stars in this romantic fantastic about a modern-day witch who cheats the Manhattan preacher who succeeded. James Stewart can get a high bill, but it's Kim Novak who stole the show as one of the most beautiful witches who have ever hit spell on the movie screen. Connecting to the lead is true, one of the least weaknesses of the film: Stewart's gray head seems to be old for the role, and when it is easy to see why it falls hard for Novak, it is very difficult to understand what he finds interesting on it, because they seem that it is not available for weather and perspective. (It is one of the most exciting stories of the story that witches and war are spoken as the villages of Greenwich and the villages of bohemians.) Sadly, the pairing of Stewart-Novak will generate more heat in "Vertigo", released the same year as this film, but then "Vertigo" had an amazing story of surprise, and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. When the comic of the film is presented by the stellar cast cast, including the young Jack Lemmon (as the divine brother of Kim), Elsa Lanchester (Aunt's science), and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a beaten writer. Hermione Gingold even shows on the coming of hilarious as a kind of Grand Witch. There is a lot to love in this film - namely, romance, and good cast - that is, if you can take your eyes away from Miss Novak sand. I have seen a half movie several times, and I can never.
