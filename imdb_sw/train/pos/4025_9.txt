Good. I had thought that giving the Communist Communist Amrita Pritam and the film of the national heritage would be more obvious than the novel but when I read the novel I was surprised to see that it was the opposite. Kudos for Marita Pritam because it is not confidential and Dr Dwivedi is a goal. This movie touches sensitive topics in sensitive ways. The injuries of any war are women like a poet said and this film makes it. It is also a sad definition of Hindu psyche if they can not stand against the babies of their girls or Hindu brothers who can only burn the fields of his torturer. On the other hand also shows the economic corners behind the group or in fact why girls were kidnapped at first place. I think investigators thought that to grab the girls will become the legal owners of the house and so go new. they will not be able to ask them to return home. This man alone should greet the courage of the Puro and its Heroes are two girls of the unhappy village of the outside world and risk everyone to try to come back after being tortured. Because there are many cases that have been confirmed when such women were not accepted by their families in India. Unfortunately she did not need a woman to understand the pain of other women.
