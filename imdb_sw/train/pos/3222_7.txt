The first two sequences of this movie set up two conflicts: the crisis -thematic- central Todd soldiers and its humanity, and the conflict -physical-between Todd and bio-engineered its rather. Both procedures are completely gripping in different ways. <br /> <br /> screenplay People falters somewhat and solve the first of these semi-arcs through the movie, which means the second period is a little more straightforward action romp. <br /> <br /> nevertheless, kudos for makers create a genre action piece with the heart and even a little of the soul and especially for Kurt Russell who presents much and much less. <br /> <br /> Not a great film, but one worth seeing.
