Every now it is released this film no one has ever heard and shot for a very short time with very little money and resources but everyone is going on things and turns out to be a great surprise. This also occurred in 50 years and very small movies, not many people who have ever heard. There are some of the strangest strange instruments from '50 which should dig out. "Fear in Settings" is another similar movie that comes to mind. They are all movies that are not like the usual type of flicks from their time and are also made by small resources. I was amazed at how much I did in this movie. It was a better and better movie as it continued. If all 'old' movies are starting to start a slow type but once you get into the story and it's the characters you have for real treatment with this film. <br /> <br /> Movie has a very good story that involves spying, although the film doesn't start like that. It starts like this amazing crime by touching the film-black. But "South Street Pickup" just isn't the real movie and the number begins to take its own recipes soon soon. It ensures that the film is still amazing but also above all too interesting to watch. I also liked the characters in this film. None of them are good and they are their mistakes and weaknesses. Really gentle. It also has a good performance from Thelma Ritter, who even earned the eligibility of Oscar. It has actually been one of the most important roles I have seen. Even though its low-budget budget is just one of the biggest, original, unique films that should be seen for more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
