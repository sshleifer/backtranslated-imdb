I remember watching this film on Saturday afternoon TV in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented but I remember there was a message of hope of hope from migrants hidden in coverings in one of the last cautious killings for the liberation. I don't know that the square has the truth. The film is still well done. Germany's main message reports for wryly without feeling "Russians continue under The Fredrich Strasse" if they all went according to the plan. It was my feeling that this film and America's future for TV hit was the foundation of the history of England History Trevor-Roper and the same title of Hitler's last. I was surprised to see no loan for Trevor-Roper. I accept a new German film on DOWNFALL's subject was also made as a classic. The American Wave was a little flat. Small statistics have been very interesting from movies like Adolph. However, I find it amazing that no films and books have come to talk to Hitler's double story by passing a historic piece of John Toland. <br /> <br /> Was it gibs?
