I lost this (Law-I) and the luck of the clean and this was more than ten years ago. This was even the label on the mentioned tape. It surprised me. It scared me. It shocked me.

My only complaint is that when the Tank Police continues to continue with war and crime, documentation and heavy weapons, it will appear as they have a hard time with criminals. That is never shown or just lies if they seem to be making it easier at that time.

But with regard to the story, there are certainly some of the correct details selected in the translation but can be released.
