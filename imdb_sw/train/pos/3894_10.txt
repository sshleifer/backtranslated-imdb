I would like to laugh again as I saw this show for the first time. I haven't done that since then. It's amazing, I find myself laughing almost as hard after looking at the show again, and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is an agricultural, it's a poignant, it's a man of the world. He says talking about politics and still feels no need to "participate" in political debate. He is over it. I would like to compare him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his thoughts, and it doesn't seem to enjoy the fact that he tries to entertain. The most beautiful person in the world
