I got this film a month ago and is now a fan of Drew Barrymore's fan. I would like to end up happy with this film gives you the brilliance and the truth of Red Sox planned inside! It is about a mathematics teacher who takes the children promising on a journey to a company where the successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it's not so easy when he confesses he is a great fan of the Sofi Market. First of all items are good but then his baseball gets the way of Lindseys's life. It's all good at the end and it took one shot to get Drew running around the field! I got two by Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like these films I give you more to see Drew's work as the Angel of Charlie and the first 50 or even his new movie with Hugh Grant called Music and Lyrics.
