They often laugh loudly, sometimes the sadness of the two boys suffering from work - Lemmon fresh "husband of the house" and Matthau style of slob games - who decide to live together to reduce costs. <br /> <br /> It is a hit and directed image. Script is very barbed - that is, there is always more than one side around each line. The most amazing area involves two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to be interested in everything that someone says, but when Lemmon photographs her children and, yes, wife-to-be, communicating with girls before Matthau can show you with lots of drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
