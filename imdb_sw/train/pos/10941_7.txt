Sarah Silverman's idea with her own show was the first time she was involved with me. Movies that have arisen were not very funny and his humor is far away. However, I was very surprised to see his true color shining in this Comedy Out. I was able to accommodate Amy Sedaris's proposal for visitors and Pipi's behavior - Sarah is a true community, very similar to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> One deficit of this show is his help to cast. Her sister's behavior is good; Funny occasionally, but eventually meant not to steal Sarah's show. However, all others were beaten with a very small comparison. <br /> <br /> I am happy, though, Comedy Central has given Sarah an opportunity to show her a unique and intelligent mind and humor.
