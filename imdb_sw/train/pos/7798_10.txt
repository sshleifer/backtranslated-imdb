I can't start explaining how amazing this film is. It should say, whenever I am worried about how improper or trivial things appear, this is the movie I am missing to make me in the right mental image. Music music lets you identify the availability of existence and how simplicity provides greater joy. An Indian girl is a typical example of a character in this film who is not trying hard, and is happy as a result. Persifina, Ruby's co-worker (Ashley Judd) is another = - her eyes and smile can make the day of the most difficult person. I watch this film and I dreamed the best day or for good conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone - Ruby is alone often - it's not the same as being alone. It is recommended for anyone who enjoys thinking film.
