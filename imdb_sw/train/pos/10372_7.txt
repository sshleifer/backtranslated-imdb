ROLL is a small fine film. Toby Malone has a 18-year-old child (very well done, by the way) who is in football. Malone's brother takes him out the night before his great game on adventure and losing many and turning to two bags of gym, master of drugs, some hard bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie makes us The guessing as to which Anime is part of the law, what is in the gym package, and even how important a key is. Its pieces reminded us of LOCK STOCK and two laughs. To me, ROLL strengthened three views that I have already made before seeing ROLL. These comments are: 1. I want to visit Australia one day. Countries and cities are beautiful and looks like a good holiday opportunity. Some of the best artists in Australia are. The ROLL movie was especially amazing. I loved colors decorated with lights in many cases. Australian women are HOT!
