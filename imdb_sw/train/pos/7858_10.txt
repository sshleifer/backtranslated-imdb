TESS of the STORM country is likely to be the best film of all Mary Pickford's films. For two hours, it was too long for the 1922 silent film still continues to hold your interest 80 years after being closed. Mary offers her beautiful performances while the role looks like a "greater" performance and bits of Mary who is innocent, Mary little devil, Mary mother, Mary spitfire, Mary romantic heroine, etc. often the qualities that are often used in one film in in the past. The movie is amazingly credible on one child of the legitimate illegal behavior by 1922 and one time our little Mary is thought to a mother who has no issue in question! As the Academy awards were about 1922, the course of course Oscar's best course for the year would be Maria.
