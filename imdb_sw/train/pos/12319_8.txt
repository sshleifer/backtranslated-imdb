First things first, female leadership is very good to lose. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the movie, is 42 years old and good old. It is best to pass these moments of glory when seeing the production of the old HongKong school like this. It is one of the most influential names made in the 1980s. The art of art art and other interesting features is good. More than fantastically the movie had a low voice of humorous black in it. It feels like a horrible movie but eventually it is not good, but it's just fun. I had the experience of translating the second script of "Chinese Ghotst Story", and I thought that the script was a decent writing. However, when I saw the film, I began to despair to see the movie compared to the script, as to a lesser extent and involve more comic tasks. However, it was best delivered for having entertainment. If you have seen the Lord of the Rings, you will see the similarity of this film to LOTR. This period is like Miranda Otto's mirror fighting with the Gonga Magician. It's definitely laughter-sound. Bravo!
