I love the Horror of Magic, and the famous Studios of England, who gave one of the largest films and "Devil Come Out" (1968), have been seen more in this field of Horror. This tenth of the magic of the series of "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "The Guardian of the Abyss", is actually entering the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously supervised the work of Hammer and "Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Monk Madness" (1966) and more than two film "Fu Machu" and star Christopher Lee, of course are one of the most popular names among HHH directors, and also provides here. Certification items Michael (Ray Lonnen) falls on the old amazing glasses of mystery. The mirror mirror becomes the object of cult worship of Satan, who want to use it for their devotions of the devil. While she was sleeping a beautiful girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who will be given a sacrifice and worship, Michael goes to the biggest problem and worship with their sinful leader (John Carson) ... This time is not one of the most favorite events of "House of Hammer" “The best” (the best is the brilliant part of the seventh, “Silent Voice”), is very strange and atmosphere. The program has several exciting attempts, and it remains suspenseful and uncanny in all films. Ray Lonnen is a good guide, little Rosalyin Landor is persuading as innocent, and John Carson is really as attractive as the leader of Satan. In general, the "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and fascinating feature of HHH, and my fellow colleagues should not lose.
