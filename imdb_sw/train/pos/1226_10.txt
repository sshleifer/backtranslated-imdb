They made this film on a big island, where I grew up. My brother and his partner were extra in this film. There seems to be a party to the party where all drink beer, (which they told me is the color of the color, the tragedy, and it was very difficult to swallow regularly, especially on the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the film released everywhere in any way. It has never occurred to the movie (as clearly) and, as I know, has never been released on the video, and I am sure it was not released on the DVD. Yet it seems like it was seen by other people, though perhaps very few. So there must be something. I would like to buy this for my brother, but there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about time / where / how this film can be purchased? And what kind will it be?
