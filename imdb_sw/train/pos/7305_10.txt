In 1978, the phenomenon began. Removal of the "Halloween" of John Carpenter gave people close followers to block the evil block which is Michael Meyers. Critics liked it, the world loved it, followed, and came down as one of the greatest movies in the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot: 15 years after the murder, four friends (both women) are babies (and have their boys) on Halloween night. After escaping from hospital last night, Michael myers Returns to his home home to beat these people. He kills 3 of them quietly and cunning. He does not talk. He walks slowly. Hiding behind ... Easily. We don't know where Michael, we don't know why he kills, and he is afraid of us. They are the only reason we fear. Writer John wrote the film, and led it. He creates an uncomfortable tension in the story, and scary to that level, that sometimes we can't look. And the peak is amazing. <br /> <br /> As a fear, this is important. It's awesome and well done. It is also wonderful. Michael is strong, not man. Power that cannot be denied. The series focused on Michael and his "history". This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this is a jewel.
