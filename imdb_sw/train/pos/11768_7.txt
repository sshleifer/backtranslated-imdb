This movie impressed me in a good way. From the box I felt that it was exciting but it was so amazing that it was exciting, even though it was exciting. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of one tap with a good movie this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, does a good job. Some of the cast are not half bad or especially Timothy Dalton is treating. <br /> <br /> Stories can get a good mixture as often as new characters show during the film. Things become more difficult if no one tells the truth about things. If you do not have the priorities it can get the last mess but I loved it very much. Louis Morneau is not all known but has done a very good job with this and I have never endured during watching the movie. Men should look at.
