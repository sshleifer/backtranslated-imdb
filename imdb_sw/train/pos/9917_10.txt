This is the most resistant document that I have ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a good idea. According to the scenarios of the closure of factories that are close to the modern industrialization of China, Edward Burtynsky brings a life that is faced with issues that we chose to easily ignore. It does not take political parties, this movie is not available to promote the image of realities that our western communities choose to give us a knowledge about - products of economic growth, outside the country paid by citizens of small communities developed, the source of our comfort and waste of our use of life. <br /> <br /> Amazing, heartbreaking, it is impossible to ignore. This is a complicated journey but one of the worth to take - please have been sitting without ignorance and at least see these realistic images without any feeling of standing for these issues. 10/10 definitely!
