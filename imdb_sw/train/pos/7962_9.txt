Very few who are called "remakes" can be as good as nature. Cross this one that border with the color of the jump. Just remake, I don't think so! I saw it as modern at the age of nine, and it was completely closed and infected with the film. Certainly the film welcomes comparable to its 1963 colleague. The original movie is also a fun and enjoyable movie, but it certainly seems to feel more like a natural document than a film. This update is epic and more movies. However, I strongly recommend all the films. <br /> <br /> This film is a must-look for animal lovers. We have a wise age of Golden Retriever, Shadow; bright cats, surprise of Himalaya, Sassy; and young people, who love the American Bulldog, Chance. Animals are clearly displayed by Don Ameche, Sally Field, and Michael J. Fox, respectively. Nothing is wrong in this film. There is a bit of a scatological humor, but no mild. There is no complicated abuse, forget a few events involving waterfall, anger bottle, and a dark road. Hilarious, scary, moving, and above all, was surprised to see that this film did not win any prize, not one. However, I will have to say this is as good as some of the Best Photos Workers today.
