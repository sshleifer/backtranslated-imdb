This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany and their families are very good! It was not a moral movie, I would say it shows life as it was or was 60 and 70 when the main story happens. The characters are very good but they also have "dark" sides, what makes you believe that these are real people. Great movie and great actors show that life is not funny at all, but that you can find happiness and "hot and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
