When I started watching the show I said "Oh, no! It's like corny like Elfen Lied and even that blood!" And in fact, the setup is almost the same, with just one young man living in a big house himself alone, then suddenly interfering in an amazing adventure when young sexy girls come with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where it resembles. The story of love is almost like the trick and sharp like that of the Inuiyasha, when the baby's conversation and behavior are very few. Magical setting is a little corny, because it is about seven people, and seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all the servants being the most popular, half of all the masters from the same school, the law of cooperation, etc. However, this recently dies and defined by the beauty of the drawing and the script. I looked at all 24 pieces a day and, without comparing the creatures that I liked the most, but it's from other types, I say that I was very happy.
