I saw this in the movies and I liked it very much. The Rush for Geoffery has provided excellent performance as a beautiful woman who has ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a girl in heaven. This film also sent me to William H. Macy, who is now one of the best partners. Hank was good as Blue Raja, and I especially liked that the character was not really UK. Place with him and tell his mother that he was superhero around and bring tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest elements involved Stiller and Mr. Furious's behavior of false fury, and the fact that his threats and all its ingredients were gibberish, and that they had no meaning. I could restrain the mourning when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss," he said. But one of the most enjoyable things is that Captain Amazing really died in the movie. I highly recommend this film for any occasion, and I give my personal two-fingers-up.
