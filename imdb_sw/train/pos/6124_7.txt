This movie is goofy like hell! I think it was written as a great film, but when it came to the time of the film, Michael Cooney said, "Let's, let's lose with humor and fruit!" Anime is actually a little progress, too. O, and the order of death is better. One thing I hate, however, was the hair of the hair. What was it about all?
