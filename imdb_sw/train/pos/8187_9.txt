Anyone sees it interesting that Ood seems to be the same as 'Great Cthulhu' of H P Lovecraft Harvest? hmmm? Two big events (not mentioning Billie Piper as many seem!) on an impossible planet with the devil's hole. <br /> <br /> Also a link to 'Legion' I think also used to whom before and also referring to Satan in various novels after the era of the darkness ... <br /> <br /> Great incidents of misuse things to fear and faith. A new team for these 'who are doing great magic for TV. This really creates new fears and 'hiding behind the sofa' feelings that do not appear for many years, many in the continuous series of the BBC (compassion has been confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper stops - maybe not permanently - after the end of series 2): O (((
