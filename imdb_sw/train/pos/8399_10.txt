The Trap of Love is not short, it is definitely a perfect film of a long-term and a good time of 105 minutes. When I write this, I might talk more about the Love Trap. I am often asked what makes Love The different trap ... this is what I answer the question: 1) It precedes the characters - one exactly - which has never been seen before the film, when. It reveals the most truth about love, and describes in more detail the concept of love, than any American made film, in my opinion of humility. <br /> 3) For format, as the story is told, it is different from any story of love that you have ever seen. It provides a very good understanding on various cultural issues, both inside and outside the Black community. <br /> <Over time, people will come to see the Trap of Love as about the original work as possible in this era, with fun, fun and honest. It is a rare morality that is full of thoughtful food. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for full and accurate information about this film.
