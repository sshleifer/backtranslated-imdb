I declined on this film on the cable and I walked completely. The story of a group of travelers who climb large waves, the waves that are monstrously large, waves that will make any intelligent person run in fear are one that can be surprising and make you understand why people use their lives to revive the waves. There is nothing special about the film, except it brings together very interesting people who are in love and what they do and enable them to talk. Certainly there are cases of play, but what makes this film unique is people. Here is a group of boys who are passionate about what they are doing that crosses to people watching. Half go to this film you want to go away and learn to use surf too. Few documents have ever made the enthusiasm that these people have and their ability to film make us feel that it makes this beautiful film. See.
