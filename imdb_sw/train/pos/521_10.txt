This is one of the original love stories I have seen for many years, especially for the film (briefly) film. Basically it is a two-story story, one is definitely real, another fiction but filmmakers say at the outset that it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. However, Peter Carter (David Niven head) was losing a plane, spoke to June (Apes' Kim Hunter) before he was arrested and said he loved him. He meant to die from flying without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves June in the body. This other part, like heaven, is unacceptable because he survived and was willing to come to the world, so they sent French Conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but it is obvious in love. Peter tells him that he should appeal his life to another world court, given this. The apparent love takes place when two lovers declare that they will die for each other, June even offers to take its place! Also star Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, short (unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English writer and Abraham Sofaer as Judge / Doctor. David Niven was the 36th number of the Greatest British Artists, the film was 86 on Tearjerkers of the greatest 100 for the fun, it was 47th in 100 Great Films, was 46th in the Greatest British Movies, was the number 59 in the 100 Top 100 Films. Better!
