Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but I know one for 25 years. He said that Scott Wilson showed social (no conscience) very well. I agree! He also said that Robert Blake showed a man of anger and control of the inspiration that he had a conscience but he could not control himself. I agree! What's a stimulating and great film. I have seen more than 2000 films and I will place this title over 100. My long-term friend deals with customers like these regularly. My only quarrel was the story of preaching at the end of the film. Many people grow under good conditions but only one million will do as those lost 2 did.
