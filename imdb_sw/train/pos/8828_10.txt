I was so excited to see this short film. I have always been so encouraged that a short film is hard to come, so when I saw this and saw that it was selected for Live Live Live Movie on the Academy Awards, I was so happy that I had a movie I had to root for. <br /> <br /> The program is very simple, director, author, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come and because people would suddenly enter into the song and dance numbers as they do in film music. The result is very entertaining and the song is really interesting. <br /> <br /> It is a well-made film, well-adjusted and all actors are doing a good job. And the last shot of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this film.
