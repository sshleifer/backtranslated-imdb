The mother is one of these films you know is good, maybe even bigger, but it's like eating vegetables or working on ethnic tasks is a child - a lot of work and a lot of pain to get investment. It can be bad in many ways: death of behavior within the first half, romance in December-May, the idea of ​​man deceiving his wife and then cheating on her boyfriend and her mother, a collection of The unwilling and unhappy thirty characters and something, the obvious difference for adults in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it is returning to the UK film (usually provided for TV) since the late 1980s - it has a degree of morality that has never stopped, which provides at least a strict Mom, but that's the problem part; if the films related to many sensitive issues have certain errors - varying from the script, other minor actors - it takes off, but if the film is very good, the experience of watching is sharp and bitter. Even technical characteristics - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer; London in this movie is bright and clear, full of hard, cutting light. If you are as hard as nails, or are one of the most powerful people who like to suffer themselves with trembling movies or novels, then you will be happy Mama. Anyone in the middle, give it to you, or be ready to join. And warn: if hard as the movie comes from beginning to end, the worst will come. At the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter to do to do (for she is sleeping with her boyfriend), and the girl has said quietly that she thought about it and would like to beat her. The mother agrees with this, both stand, and - instead of hanging well - the daughter closes her fist and gives the blow to the striker. Argh !!!
