This is a better book than with Paltrow (though I liked it, too). Not so much that Beckinsale is the best - all is very good - but that screenplay is excellent. Davies is a master in fixing Austen by photography, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not so simple as the treatment of Hollywood, but it's close, and I think that places and clothing made it better.
