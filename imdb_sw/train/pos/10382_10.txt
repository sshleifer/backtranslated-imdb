Like all other managers, this film has been repeated in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library to explore all I could in this story. I even wrote the PBS center for more information. Despite all of this, all I knew was the story published in the newspaper at the beginning of the 1900s. of the movie. There was one more effort but I decided to win this film. The lost assistant wrote me for a copy I gave him. In spite of owning a copy, I still searched and finally found a website that produced a copy of the DVD movie.
