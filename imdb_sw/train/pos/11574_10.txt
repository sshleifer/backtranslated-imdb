This movie is a memory of half ... and it's amazing .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... according to the true story of how a group of norwegian saboturs has been able to stop heavy production in Rukjan, Norway with all the water supply in Germany. This movie is not perfect and can be better ... The best part of the movie is that some saboturs play with themselves! If you are interested in WWII history and this film is a suitable movie to watch!
