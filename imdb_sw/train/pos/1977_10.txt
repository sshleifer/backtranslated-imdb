I love this movie. I remember one time when I was in Grade 2, a grade, my teacher showed us on a 16mm film film. This film, however, may be awesome for the second farmers as the area where Bill kills Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my brothers is sick to see this film because he read about it in a class of music. If I am a teacher and I can count people who produced this beautiful film, I would give them A +.
