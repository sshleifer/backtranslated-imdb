Of course I could not enter 'This is not the Love Words', his brilliant film and there is a great line of story, I found myself looking at the time on my phone every two months to see how much the remaining film. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Pastor and Heaton, there is almost dependent on each other to get together in life. At the same time I would like that relationship was more than it was. Heaton likes to steal, but Pastor Ibsen't likes Heaton, or doesn't know how to love him. The acts of betrayal, in both cases, have a major impact on two men. Both of them have been destroyed by the fact that one fled and left them, when they really needed each other for survival.
