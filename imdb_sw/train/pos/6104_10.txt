I must accept, outside of COLLECTION of EROS MOVIE, this must be one that I like most and the other that I have reviewed. The story is something that continues to look at you. Most of the EROS films have a plot that looks like a hammer that breaks into pieces before you look at it. All those who have sex, and who can find and how many people have reached the end of the film. And oh god god, never look at one of these films when someone pulls out the gun. It does not work to be delicious, but you do not want to lose energy to do so. "Loss Control" is similar to its starting name. The protagonist, the leading character (a wonderful and beautiful reference to Kira Reed). Control is the control person has on their feelings, their body and emotions. And one man changes everything for him, makes him a different woman around. But the glass bursts at once. This makes a good film that I want to come with first !! <br /> 10/10
