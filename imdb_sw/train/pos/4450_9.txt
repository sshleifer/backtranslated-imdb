An old man who lives in the mountains rises one morning and loses his cat. He looks for trees to witness the murder but he saw murder or lost his mind? Does he just start? The movie is great because the viewer must make their minds on what's going on. There is a very short discussion on this film but it does not say words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> Another place I liked was the forest shots during the fall and winter. That was good but the only thing I didn't like is the attitude of an old man in his underwear. He would bind a little cluster but not more than that, it was a very good movie.
