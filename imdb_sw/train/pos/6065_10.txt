This film is awesome - in the worst way of 'very bad'. The story of the story is facing many other films of this kind, that I can't bother to describe. It is a picture of a sword, a child with the hope of recognizing the importance of this world, who is struggling to "rotate", a helper / wizard, leader, hair ... .... <br /> <br /> At first I found this movie was very cold. I don't know why I decided to keep looking for five more minutes before turning the center, but when I got the Gulfax website, I decided to stay and watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white creature, and furry similar to Chewbacca, but not nearly as important or entertaining watch. He looks like a man who deals with a white shag clapping together and forced an actress to wear. There are instances where it seems like an actor cannot enter inside, or that he falls near. Although he is not on the film, a few stations appreciate me! Check if he tries to talk to Bo Svenson, taking a comparison with Solo-Chewbacca to the highest level! I bought this film just because of it, and I'm still somewhere! Gulfax can be seen as sh, t, but made this film !!! The only reason I have never seen, or even sought, was because of his absence! Probably should have the last film, complete the trilogy, Gulfax will make a very return expectation!
