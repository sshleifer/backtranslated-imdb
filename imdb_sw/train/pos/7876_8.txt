I did not like Chandni Bar from the director. I don't see his other movies. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page 3 is done well. It seems real. If Satya from RGV made. The most common mental illness is a summary of the film. In the midst of all diseases, it is difficult to lead a normal life that the main character, Konkana Sen, does. Great movie, not being watched by children or expecting it. Page 3 of newspapers is a common part of the reporting of developing activities in rich and academic associations who enter into more dirt and then what is reported. How this Page 3 is also the business prospects shown in the film. Event management companies are paid to arrange parties and make rich but unknown people immediately by clicking on photos and celebrations invited to the party. Western culture has entered into a high-level Arabian society. The movie shows with confidence, nobody is blocked. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
