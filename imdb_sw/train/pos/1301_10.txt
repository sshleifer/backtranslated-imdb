I have loved all the work of Cream, even if there is a small list of the value of the work to hold. Even when they go for as long as twenty minutes and some of their songs (Spoonful and Taken by Fire Wheels are the first models) they still beat off more than half of any rock action that works today. This power of the gel on the stage is given to one of the ports of rock forever which shows the Royal Hall Hall last year. They may be old, if they have their fans, but the energy is still in place, and the new layouts of blues are common and also. The White Room, Badge, Politician, Assistant, Your Day of Love, not one seems to miss. Solos of Clapton has formation which sometimes do not have time to action with his solo band. The Ginger Baker, said enough. Jack Bruce is sturdy enough for his voice still with a variety of power that Clapton could not find alone. Below, if you want to see what is the best that shows you want to see last year (well, others can see them), it's all on this DVD, with special cool features.
