This series was cut off by a series of television television days but somehow did not get the audience. The concept of blind blinding cannot be quite new but it has greatly increased the story. And who can forget Pax, a good dog guide in the series! <br /> <br /> While the stories themselves were no better than usual series, settings, New Orleans, acting and music (I remember comments about music symbols in other comments ... The best television even better! <br /> <br /> Tent does not know ... one day Paramount can only dig into his memory and open it on DVD!
