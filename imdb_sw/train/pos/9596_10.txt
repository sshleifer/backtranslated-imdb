This film covers the changing experience of a group of young people, and the experience of looking at it itself changes to the viewer. A small movie even looks at this level of shortage, and I can't imagine no other movie - document or drama - which succeeds. There is no other movie that I have cut so much and much noise. Yes, it is about DMD transport and access; on these matters alone, it is a value project, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about living every day that you are alive. And it's a great, fun, fun story. That's why God created movies! Check out this movie !!!
