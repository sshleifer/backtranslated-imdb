This film is almost a piece of celluloid. There's really not much need or want to say here. Unless "Look at this film" and "Enjoy the good work of Daniel and Pascal", who carries you through the good, pleasant and breathing stories about 'spending your eight days' - your own day! Seeing this film makes me think deeply about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems, that some of us are wasting valuable time to do things we think we need to do. Maybe if it works fine or just shows TV-shows and ballgames. What we lack is satisfaction to be something to someone else - to make a difference. About taking place and time to isolate and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least what I got from 'the eighth day'.
