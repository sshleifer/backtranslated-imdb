I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and he was very happy. Work work with Derek Luke was good and the story line was excellent. Of course Denzel Washington did her regular work together with the lead. It lets you realize that people with dementia can be helped by this movie is a perfect example of this. Don't miss this.
