"The Purple Rain" has never been a lover of comma but it is a classic ritual - and deserves it. If you are a fan of this Prince it is for you. <br /> <br /> The main park is Prince sees his parents defending himself in him and he likes for a girl. Believe or not this movie is not just singing and playing. There are many extreme events and it is the heart of the heart. Sometimes it comes out funny but when it works it really works. Hit so much and miss. No one can work in the film. Everyone comes from one side of the Prince acting like "Time" and "Discrimination 6". However, it adds charm to the movie. Every time the Prince is on the screen he shines it and it is fun to see him at his peak of business. Finally, go see this if you love Prince like me. If you are not a fan it will make you one.
