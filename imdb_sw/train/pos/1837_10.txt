There is no great film about it. Great stories and good performances, are Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Indian film industry is not recommended by Mallika and Co, this film is completely destructive and is therefore closed to the failure of the fraud of our Indian society. But the message and this movie's idea carries it quite superb. Your Malik (copy-boring-cat) could be avoided by Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should give a little Gujarati touch especially in music too. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he thinks himself is coming out but this is not a movie where the presence is needed - He looks very well with the Govinda style. I felt good music and good people of Ghazals or sad songs can make this movie more memorable.
