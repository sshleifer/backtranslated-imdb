In my opinion, this is quite prestigious of Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the mother of you (the voice of Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You will need to see the film if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that made many homes, Cinderella (the voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the environment was good, cast to the well selected, and the writing was solid. Before closing this, I would say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this romantic Disney Sex for all of you who have not seen. You have entered a good time, so go to a video shop, rent it or buy it, call back with a friend, and watch.
