It has never looked at this 1971 film and was very happy with this huge production created by Walt Disney Studios and the great creation of animation. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played a major role as a woman who had taken a course in magic crafts and was a student who was starting to jump on the broomstick and had a few problems. Eglantine discovered many techniques and was able to make a bed to travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine has missed his final exams to become a magician. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the man who bought the Eglantine course in magic and tries to help him every possible way to get his solution. Eglantine has a purpose for his madness and that is to stop the Nazi to deport Britain. Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.
