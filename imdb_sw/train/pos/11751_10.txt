Kurt Russell is very good as a man who lives away from his former glory, Reno Power. Robin Williams is the opposite of polar in low performance as Jack Dundee. He left the Great Passover more than one. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most popular events implemented on one film, such as Jack says on the mouse, Reno is happening, and caribou calls come out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic which does not show the football in the mud as it should be played.
