I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I grew up in Scottsdale and went to Arizona State and I enjoyed seeing the places that I spent so much time. I remember that time thinking that Barbara's project in the voice of the rock (actually R and B-in my ears) was successful. I was not a fan of singing to Kris until his last effort to New West. As a songwriter and actor, though, has many obstacles, IMHO. I think it's a good romance. I love it more than the version of Judy Garland and I have never seen Selznick's origin of Janet Gaynor. I believe that they made a change in the release of DVD for a long time. Among other things, I remember a helicopter bullet depicting the long Sun and Field. I wish they had done a good job of writing music for Kris or God did not allow it, putting some of its original songs there. With those lines I have information from a basic source that says music was a problem for Kris and Barbara. During an interview with my new music document, Rocking Boat: Music and Safari Conversation, interviewed Stephen Bruton, a good musician / musician / guitar and close professional and personal relationship with Kris, Bonnie Raitt, and Delbert McClinton , among many others. Stephen was in "Speedway," the character of John Norman. Kris had a very difficult time turning to what was essentially a pop-up in something that could go through a rock. Stephen had a friend of Kris and a member of a long band. There was a tension on the set and when one band was moving forward to Kris in Barbara. He said in effect that the band should not talk to him like that. Kris came back to the effect that were his friends and were rock and roll! Finally, Barbara came and decided to use the Kris's exhibition in the movie and especially shared the role of Stephen in doing things work. I got the greatest respect for him as an artist on hearing this story. Much is done by him as a diva. What she is a pro. And it's not gay. Not that there is nothing wrong with that.
