There are positive comments and views on this film. I was surprised to find out the comparison of Fritz Lang (forgetting remake of 50 abortion and dull David Wayne). The real villain is not a victim of torture (a wonderful performance by Jeffery DeMunn), giving his sexual anger over his victims - especially children. He is the target. The real villain is the political system of the Soviet Union, which emerges in its improper. The frustration of a non-volunteer (Refer to its best role since "Right Voice"), a simple professional who wants to use the system for its benefit (Sutherland has always succeeded in this kind of role), who is scared, afraid but determined by a psychiatrist (Max Sydow) who cannot succeed, the prosecutor's prosecutor's prosecutor (good author John Wood) and calm, who supported the wife of a runaway investigator (good assistant, Imelda Staunton). This is one very good film. Darkness and its evilness are used to be shown by a poor, unsatisfactory system that works against success. That's not the need to sink into a piece of a piece of piece that has announced many recent films. Gore nipo - it's a ghastly story - but it adds to the show of human pathologically ongoing. The success of the story is the same: these were man-made works, man like you or me. Where do you and I choose to cancel the frustration in a good way, Chikatilo was very angry with the unjust and concerned with us, our children. The good foundation of this story is made clear by the best performer of the best actors. - in fact, I see that our Australian friend did not like the speech and would certainly like to hear them speaking in the Aussie language. Well, very bad. This beautiful film ensures the work with me and everyone else I spoke to and who saw it.
