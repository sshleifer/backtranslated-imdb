I have never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I've never seen movies with Mary Pickford in it. I have seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I have found the end of Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) being hypnotic, so consider the source when you read this. I began to look at the Tess of the Storm in TCM to see who Maria Pickford was, who has been invited by many to introduce Hollywood. I didn't know what I had. Two hours later, I left, and realized that I would like to look at one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, with the role of her best. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, who has never seen anyone who is good and speaking. You need to see him again and again. The order was perfect for the girl who speaks. He was a poor shepherd, he could not speak King's English, but he had to praise him. What's the movie ... when you start my collection of Mary Pickford!
