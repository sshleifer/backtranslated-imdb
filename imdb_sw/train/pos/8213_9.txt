Anyone who witnessed our justice system - or lack of it will find this satisfactory film. There were not too many gray shades related to characters or plot. Almost every character in this film created what is better and worse for our society. The glory of this film probably due to the fact that many of us at one time or another have been dealing with scumbags along with namby-paw, living-net-mouthed, who enable them in the name of "political correct". <br /> <br /> Displays on board were forcing. I was fascinated by rape survivors - at the same time, I was thrilled to see him wiping a smug, a great pride from the faces of his former attackers. In particular, I found dyke one of the worst characters in all the movies I saw, so it was good to see her former victim closed her mouth for good. The leading offender and psychopath was very bad, so it was only appropriate that Dirty Harry himself made him a great style at the end of the end. This is the only one in the rose saga of Harry which was the same as the first.
