Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has been thrown by his wife, because he is one of the sad, ignorant people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he can't seem to work, so he leads to his friends' home. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also a divorce soon and lives in heaven. Smoking, gambling, biting, eating out and never cleaning is a paradise for him. Indeed, suicide attempts to Oscar decides to allow Felix to enter. At first, it is a match in heaven, Felix cooks and purifies and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but recently Oscar is jonesing to women and Felix (who in today's world may be gay) is not ready to continue. They invite several British aircraft and get Felix so tender that they recently have Felix crying and talking about his family's life, leaving Oscar denied. This is, it turns out and throws him out, but Felix is ​​not helpless as it seems, and soon he has a hand. My love quote "You leave me a few details on my river." I told you 158 times I couldn't stand a little bit on my river. "We are all out of cornflakes. F.U." He sent me three hours to know F.U. He was Felix Ungar! "According to Neil Simon's (who also wrote screenshots), this has some exhibition displays. Put it with the player and it seems to feel quite good to play (for better or worse) Lemmon and Tails have a good comedic chemistry. have been seen in the movies of Old Men movie and out of the sea, reprising the same finicky / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalties, I am sure). <br /> This brick is like strawberries put in chocolate Chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, strawberry is tart, juicy and red (unless you find the most beautiful green). They are almost resistant polar, but together, the differences show each other and makes a beautiful dessert. > http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
