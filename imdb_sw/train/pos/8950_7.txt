For those who do not know and Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "small" films since later in his career. And, while it's not a good film compared to many other pictures, it's not bad and it's a good time â€” but not more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some of the most insignificant reasons, she decides to spell on the poor Jimmy to make her love. For a long time, Mrs Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and obviously in the book of the magician's rule, this is NO, NO! The video is a very unusual one in his concern about witches. They are a child-sacrifice and not all forms of power. Many of their magic are very limited and useless (such as Jack Lemmon using its power to turn off the street lights). And, very unusual, all witches seem to be bohemians who depend on hip bars where you can find people wearing berets and jazz jazz listening. Considering what I think of jazz, it must smell to be a witch in this film world! However, the film is good romantic and gentle, but it is not something that I would rush to look for. Acting is very good, but the script does not give enough money to make this film unique - in fact, almost closed the 6th film - it was very close.
