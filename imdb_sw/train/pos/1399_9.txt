This is one of the most unknown periods because the plot seemed to be just for fun. But, I appreciated this lighting technique and this is one of the most beautiful events to see on a fun level. Think about it - the crew members meet with white rabbits and Alice from Wonderland, the tiger of Bengal, the hero of Samurai, the knight on the horse who kills McCoy, and other incredible events that does not make any sense even to the very end. Despite all the risks, you can not just take everything for very weight - it's just fun and the whole section looks very much on. Therefore, on a non-aesthetic level, it is great things.
