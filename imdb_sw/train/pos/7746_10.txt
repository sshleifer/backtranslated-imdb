Those who know the DEUS group, know the first singer Tom Barman. He led this little movie as he builds music, it's a combination of everything. This is a comedy, though most of the ignorant and stupid, sporting games, no main characters have a happy life to say at least, and it has no real purpose. The movie begins on the morning of the morning in Antwerp, Belgium, and several incidents, some of them have nothing the same but they will contact them during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books no one reads, a young researcher of death and his sister, a homeowner, two young people always communicating with law, a person working in movies and two young women. In the movie there is a person who deals with the wind. All parties have their problems, with their family or friends or just with life itself. <br /> <br /> The movie installed Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and port. The events of the day were not explained easily, I just advise to watch the movie, there is just too much to tell. But I can say this, Barman has the best use of cameras and uses a lot of music (especially dance music, not rock) to impress, especially the party is filled with the best music. This film is the only experience, it will never leave any wisdom about life, just that you should live and not lose, or have any moral truth. <br /> <br /> In short, see, it's definitely worth it!
