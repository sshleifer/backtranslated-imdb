No meaning hub, and far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to go for it. Places with beautiful movies of technicolor, brought us again for a long time since the past. Errol Flynn shows at the time of his former glory, and it is similar to Jim Brennan, the pilot who has gone back to him. The picture is really a remake of "Singapore" of 1947, and the story seems to have a great destruction and cliche 'with today's standards. Also many of the cast help seem to be just "through the way" in this picture. Many people have also compared it to one of the greats at all, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I was able to see a lot of similarities, but hey, Casablanca has led an unqualified actors, so do so for what is worth. In the closure, if it's a fan of Flynn, or old love stories, you might want to give this film. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or Falcon of the Maltese, as a good introduction to some of the classic Hollywood ....
