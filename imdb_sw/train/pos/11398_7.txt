I enjoyed this film. It was lighter, colorful, and very beautiful. You can see that MGM showed Technicolor. There is hardly any color that does not appear on this film. Each area is full. Choreography was good. Gene Kelly is amazing. He is very talented. The dance numbers in this film are fully treated, and are fully developed. He understands that the dance can tell a story like anything else. The last part of the film, a series of great drums, is very amazing. What makes this film very special is Gershwin music. A few American writers have had the most beautiful songs of the songs. I really enjoy Gershwin's music. It's enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of many lyric writers. He is a witch and fascinating. This was a very entertaining film.
