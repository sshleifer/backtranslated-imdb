Yes, this is one of the great music movies I grew up with the musicians such as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention a small and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. Music and play is very good. I understand Frank got lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly playing with Jerry Mouse, which is special at that time. Betty Garrett who looks at the waitress who likes Sinatra. He is one of the lowest Indian stars. I witnessed again on A&E TV as well as the old VCR zones. Don't be tired of this old music. Whatever happened Hollywood?
