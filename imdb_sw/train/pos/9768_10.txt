This is the best piece of film that has been a piece of piece that brought tears to my eye. Disease never forget my experience to look at it. I don't understand why people don't think if I do dinosaur returns in performance recall De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface, and Crowe in Gladiator together. This should be given on the DVD in the Superbit format so that I can enjoy it fully as it meant to enjoy when they gave and copied it. Whoppi Goldberg returns true in the performance of life as tough, the guilty who is against him will cooperate with the dinosaur of fire as his girlfriend then hi-jinx continues to say at least. The way I say the very opposite to what is actually this movie is garbage.
