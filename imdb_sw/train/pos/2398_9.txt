I enjoyed this film. It took a beautiful story of that of Shakespeare's Macbeth- and put it in a quirky yarn, often beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Kudos through the film manufacturer brought a very different world of NYC and Macbeth's modern Scotland together under one roof. The opposing nations are doing something that makes it difficult to play and you like Harold Perrineau as Chorus, a place that doesn't exist in play but it helps very much jazz things. The end comes out of the small indies I have seen with the closure and nature.
