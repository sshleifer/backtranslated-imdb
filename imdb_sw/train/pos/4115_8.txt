This is one of the most amazing movies I've watched recently. That's because it seems to be not like a film and more like a pilot film. The pages of the pages were to pick up a variety of people who live on the rubbish waste and wear their experience on a string that gives an exhibition of their harshness. Not every period of time is positive and negative, but in general this is obvious. Let's see, ... we have a case of rape / rape, attempting to kill, a wife, a drunken, trust, a young boy's death after eating fish that he felt, a person with a severe depression (not talking during the movie and looks very scary), A dreamer who cannot expect to be recognized by schizophrenia, a mentally ill young man who thinks he is a car driver and spends all his time to wake up “driving” his road car through a road between trash piles, a married man and shrew The total (I think I loved his behavior even under the oppressive opponent!), etc., etc. In fact, it faces enough that it seemed almost like the movie of Ingmar Bergman set in Japan, as Bergman made many movies tried to deal with mental illnesses of life. Is it any wonder that after making this film Pageswa attempted suicide? So, did I like it? No. It's not a fun experience. But, it was a very well-made movie that had my thoughts and results, I wanted to see what happened to these people. It was like looking at the train problem - you don't want to see all the killings but you can't help but look! Of all the vignettes, I think that an old man who was trying to look for everyone and who was not really suitable (had been well done with the wise to live in a garbage waste) he probably meant to represent himself. Maybe. I dunno. If you have seen various pages of the pages of the pages and you have the highest tolerance for amazing art movies, do this to watch. However, do not do this your first experience to watch his movies - it's certainly scared to many viewers!
