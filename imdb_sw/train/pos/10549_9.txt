I just saw the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it gets released because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven film, and Andrew and David are more than a job. Any discussion of the plot could be worth it, so I will only say that the story is clever, acting is good, and the effects are wonderful. Well done and fun too. One of the best films that I have seen for many years, and is very happy in the summer of dreary. It had the audience laughing all the time. See if you can. (I loved very much "Candy bar!"! Candy area! ")
