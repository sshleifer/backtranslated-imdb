I saw this movie as a young man and immediately recognized by Reese Witherspoon's Dani Trant, 14-year-old 14-year-old in Louisiana in 1957. He feels he can't be as good as his older sister, Maureen saw Emily Warfield and feeling out of place for the question of conservation of conservative Baptist. Then the Foster Court of seventeen (Jason London), a close friend of his mother (Gail Strickland) enters the second door, Dani feels his first loss, when the Court benefits her company, and the spirit of love. Dan gets his first kiss from him, but as soon as he saw Maureen, he falls head on the heels, and allows Dan back. The sister's close bond has been broken down by the competition, which only grows when the Court dies in a serious accident. Girls are then made to realize how much they need. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as parents of love, trying to balance their personalities, while trying to keep the family together. A beautiful movie, with an amazing voice shared with Elvis Presley, Platters and many more contributes to the amazing atmosphere of a simple movie. <br /> <br /> Images coming to touch of age with timeless messages.
