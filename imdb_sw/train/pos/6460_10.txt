If the film writer and director wanted to open hearts and movie as a musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded me. The natural human nature was natural, personal and fast so that I personally felt touched by every situation. I believe I will give you a strong music loan with a view of someone writing a movie. Without being damaged, I can say that I moved very much through live movies. What? Not really crying-what-happy? mercy? just a deep feeling? for a very long time. I would like to find a way to show others. See it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
