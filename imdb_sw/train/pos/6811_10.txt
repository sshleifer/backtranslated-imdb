Although I usually do not like remakes believe that remakes are wasting time; This film is an exception. I don't really know so far read original comments which this was remake, so my opinion is really on the real film and not compare. The story and how it is written is no question: it is Capote. No need for more words. Anthony Edwards's player and Eric Roberts are good. I've seen some movies with them, each one one or the other. I was sure they were good actors and if Eric always wondered why his sister is a famous star 1 and not his brother. At this point this fact has been raised in fact, there is no question. His play, as well as play for Mr. Edwards is clear on all their profession. I recommend this movie to your top 50 movies to see and continue on your DVDs.
