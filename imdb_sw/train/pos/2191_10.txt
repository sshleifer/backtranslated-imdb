Shakespeare said that we are executives put into action. But when this action is Israel work that we translate to more than ten and all the actions we do is full of hard style. Dan Katzir can make a fascinating picture of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but moreover, Katzir can penetrate into the heart of the people of Israel and, these people, far from being a common figure, tell us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from a crux black report that they live, and this wonderful country happens as light as a beautiful bird that is born with its ashes. It is very good to me because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans only know about news or newspapers, looks like a real and realistic reality, the fact of a million people who are looking for its place, to explore all situations, all cultures and goals only to feel part of it. Katzir builds an extraordinary document and shows that when a film person with a deep emotional feeling is strongly proposed, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you Dan for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful pictures of the wonderful countries in the world.
