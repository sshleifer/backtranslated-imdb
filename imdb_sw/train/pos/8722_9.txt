In the beginning, it is a very exciting movie and a few of the surrounding things that they have to do to laugh (see two Russian bugs). Bug Bug Bug has a classic story of Disney, but that's one of the best things about the movie. Family values ​​are honored by the main characters of the film find certain reforms to stand against the final insect. And it also has many resources for Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), ... But really, the most amazing thing about this film is animation. It's very strange. All details, beautiful colors, all kinds look different, beautiful backgrounds ... And boys and girls in Pixar did all look like real. All in all, a very good piece of work. This is the best animation of Disney since Aladdin.
