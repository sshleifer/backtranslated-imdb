If only ALL animation was this great. This film is classic because solid is two simple things: Myths and Characters. The characters in this film are human beauty. I felt for all the characters, and the animal's animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. Good animation and 3-D animation did not work best in any movie. This is a good movie for children, and for adults who want a trip to the classic hero. 8 out of 10.
