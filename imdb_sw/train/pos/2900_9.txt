This must be the American movie I would like to note 7: we have seen this before. Be this Argentine movie, and become a Argentine, I would like to give it 10, because it is the kind of quality I have been hoping - collecting rather than expecting it. It is an amazing quality you are wondering, compared to all the limitations set by the 3rd World ... I can't forget the event when Díaz defeats Silverstein's partner - you know what I'm saying when you see the movie. I think that's the most important moment of the film, not surprisingly, but first. That's when the real action begins. Before looking at the movie I always try to collect previous information. Since this is normal, divine, commercial, I show "Play" and make the suspension of truth and logic, I would say a better state of mind to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to talk about the possibility of the whole plot, but it is believed somehow. For my part, I could not stop laughing every soup with the definition - "sos place" ("you are meaning") ... put the mouth of Díaz, the largest. <br /> <br /> I have been exhausted to see movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is a good actor, but sometimes I feel his responsibilities freely, and Luis Luque's role in this case. I am very unhappy with Argentina, so I have not seen much work from Luque, but it is very clear that he is an excellent actor. His physical role, his attitude, his characteristic content in this film made me love for his love and performance. I think his role should require improvement, just letting us show how he can be better! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón has a plan to do good or not. I know he can't do that if you follow the principle that "the second part has never been good", so if he does it, I'm going to see it. And I hope that, in the future, concentrates on the possibility of giving their peers to Peretti the same opportunity to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, beautiful performances, and a lot of laugh!
