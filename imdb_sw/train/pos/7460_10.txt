I think most people just wrote this as one of Tom Cruise's amazing movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was weird; it was not. It was different and confused but not strange. Americans are Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. The difference is Show Truman. Combine is a Matrix or Game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything means - maybe not once, maybe not even today, but it will mean. Sky Vanilla combines because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the thing. That's where the so-called "weaknesses" that turned off critics came in. If they had trouble "opening their eyes" as the original Spanish movie of 1997, they could see it. And if that's not enough to see it, go see it for music. Cameron Crowe sounds good sound; he uses it to "feel" - this unknown feature that many movies do not exist. For songs like The Beach Boys 'Beautiful Vibrations' play at an amazing and emotional stage of the movie, he builds offbeat, but the wonderful "right" feel. Good films, in its script, music, acting, and images, Vanilla Sky is sad, the movie's top bandwagon that critics emerge to appear to be intelligent. Bora: A +
