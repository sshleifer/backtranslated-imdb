Well, so I don't see so many movies - and because it's films like 'Dark Gloves'. I got this on a (DVD-filled feature) and was scared of me. In fact, additional surplus I think the DVD wasn't available was a pair of new pants. However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realized I would just see about 10% of that. Sometimes I was looking at pizza on my coffee table - worrying that my girl would like to get me if I have my eyes closed. I rarely tried to look at the screen I gave so hard that I decided not to look at it again. <br /> <br /> The film's decision is strong and the characters' status was compelling. The simplicity of the film is something that has taken my jump - it's just wood, cabin and prison used - and a bed of darkness. Most surprising to me is the fact that when this was obviously not a million dollars production, the effects of reconstruction appear as it was! Also, this is obviously a film made by a man of great love of film making. Sound and music structure made use of my environment as many Hollywood movies that have never been done. I realized on the web that this film won the LA Shriekfest - a very successful achievement, and I think that the festival has seen open films - and perhaps more than this film than I could. <br /> <br /> Sound, turn off lights, and, if you want to put your partner - pizza.
