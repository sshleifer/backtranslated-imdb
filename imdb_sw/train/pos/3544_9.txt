Guys and Dolls must be one of my favorite music movies. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing else. shows what people have forgotten about music-music was made to enjoy, not to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago which are good music and good movies but they are unable to bring us unstable entertainment without a link. The only thing that scared me in the film was Marlon Brando, a man can not sing! It was very angry to hear him singing and talking when I couldn't hear him. If not Marlon I would have given these 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offer an old entertainment that we can't find these days. See having a good time!
