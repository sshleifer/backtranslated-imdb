Star Carell stars as a person who can be linked to (type) in Dan in real life, a film that I expected not to like but stopped to love it. It is not that the movie is a big shout is that it just has a great heart. We all like Steve Carell, this is not the fans of the Office expect to see from him, but you know what, I loved this film. Carell's stars like Dan Burns, a widow who a daughter is not like him. One weekend, she and her daughters are traveling to see her family. While there, it goes to a bookstore and falls to a woman. When she comes to her home, she finds that her brother Mitch (Playing with Dane Cook) is busy with this woman (Playing with Juliette Binoche). Dan in real life, sometimes, I've got a little impossible. What? The Burn family is really a type of people who practice with playing board games as well as making a group of other family matters? I would certainly doubt that. I don't know any family that is like that. What? That is standing up from thumbs up labeling? No. Dan in real life: *** / ****
