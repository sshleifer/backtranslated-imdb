This is a comedy derived from national discrimination, of course. If you stop pretending to know or care about communism and what the real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not injured by assemblies, you can enjoy this film. Nicole Kidman is the best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being out of the shadow by Nicole, and all others are doing well too. The latter is moving, and the logic of logic, of course. The value of watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
