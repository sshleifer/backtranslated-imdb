I didn't know what Jane Eyre was before seeing these services. I had read and watched many classics before, and I believed that many classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with an average interesting squares at best. Jane Eyre's ministry has completely changed my mind. Zelah Clarke is a wonderful actor, and gives a beautiful picture of Jane Eyre. His feelings are pleasant and calm, but a stable condition resembles the youth's behavior. Timothy Dalton is an awesome Rochester. His stress and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the pastor of Thornfield Hall. I couldn't sleep all night after seeing these services. The program is haunting and inspiring. The characters take place well, and the story is wonderful. This is the best version of Jane Eyre seen on the film. I read the book later and I was surprised at how close these services were to write to Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now a film and my book. If you want to see a jewel that will change your life, see the 1983 edition of the BBC's Jane Eyre.
