"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (named "Esta" after a famous American movie star), and four young people, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all 15 year olds 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five have made friends with things about jazz, blue jeans, or anything in the United States appears. The close relationship of young people is poignant, and ultimately the sacrifice is made voluntarily to try one of the group that has fallen to unexpected problems. After the change of communist politics, their different ways and reunions in 1985 (the year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed films and reservations. One item was difficult. Particularly at first, there were several discussions that had no heads at all. Perhaps the pace of speaking was needed, but I could not read every scripture and strengthen the area, which caused me not to know everyone involved. I watched the film (video from our public library) and a friend, and none of us understood the story of the story about getting streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This comes the age of Yugoslavia film effectively released the feelings of young people of destruction, idealism, and solid and honest bonds with each other. There is a great flashforward, and it was exciting, making me think until the end as those characters were whistling in 1953, and what happened really. I would like to measure 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
