I was 5 years old when I saw this music movie when I was on vacation with my family at St. Petersburg. Thomas in 1977 and immediately I liked it. 27 years later, it is still the original inspiration to achieve my goals that I have set up since then! This sad story of the complicated "back to" events of the entertainment industry at the end of 50 years, "Sparkle" successfully shows the struggle of three sisters looking for a sunny place. This story can only be a biblical story of many artists who are very interested in what can happen when things seem to happen very quickly and the models are not available to provide credit for help. The wonderful music is written and included with Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the sound of the music is associated with each song. Given the circumstances that do not leave a strong choice for long-term decisions, in order to make the final sacrifice to continue, three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent different ways that one can take when you come out to achieve your best opportunities as your contribution for the community. <br /> <br /> This movie could possibly give thought to building "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's "Glitter," 25 years later. As a preliminary member of the two producers of both, I have seen a lot of similarity in both stories to "Sparkle," and "Saturday Saturday," "Fame," "Flashdance," and off the Broadway attacking "Mama, I want sing. "
