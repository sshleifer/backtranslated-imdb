In the hands of the most experienced director, this film would be considered to be the center of the hub. Despite Michael "Death of Death" The winner is the only direction that turns, the film is interesting, original and more awesome. Script takes over one of the fears to explore behind it (several cannot shake) including Chris Sarandon as a heroine girlfriend who really listens to her if she insists that eerie items are descending. Meredith Burgess are happy as a neighbor lovably insane. Eva Gardner hates Beverly D'Angelo a little dumb and disheartened a lover of lesbians. John Carradine does a lot of work-sitting seat. And look for a moment from an indefinite time of Chris Walken! This movie is wonderful and creative. The plot of the plot is good, if the tad is predictable. The time, which I will not give more information, is disturbing and quite interesting. Again a good director can do more with it, however it is quite satisfying - at least for those with seven years of fear. If you like the fantasy of the body's torture of the modern body, you have won 's like this. There is almost no year. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are fewer, although there are some of the most beautiful decorations close to the end - which in particular is not available ... but maybe I have already said so much. I have been tested this much higher than its quality can justify, but I enjoyed it as any "8" film I saw.
