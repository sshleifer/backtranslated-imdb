Tony and Alex Delon, a young man with head and death, wants to stop the murder business, but the risk groups they use will not allow him. After his wife and son were killed, Arzenta announced the open season for everyone involved with their deaths. Director Duccio Tessari tells a fascinating story at a constant pace, it continues to be very bad and irrelevant, everywhere to stimulate and stimulate a moving car with big guns, and explores the story with a blast of gun violence. Delon and charismatic definitions enhance the additional class in already completed cases. This film benefits the sterling work of bang-up, as well as the contributions of Richard Conte's reputation as the wise Mafia leading Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as a friend of Arzenta friends Sandra, Marc Porel as a servant of Arzenta Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as angry , counting Capo Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as a gangster of poison Rocco Cutitta. The Silvano Style Ippoliti's glossy joins with several beautiful pots. The funky mark of Gianni Ferrio faces a low-groovy area. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in small nifty parts. Better yet, there is no filling chat with us even getting a good dab of attractive tasty freeous female. The surprising conclusion puts a layer of meaning and a decrease in gut. A strong and satisfying winner.
