I think that the creators of this concept of the film deserves much more accolades than they probably got. Not a Oscar film of caliber of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the playground). <br /> <br /> I don't think this is (and hope not) spoiler, but: consider acting on your influences. Making the first thought that happens to your head, saying the first words on your lips ... No hindrance, no awareness, nothing stopping you from saying or doing things that, like intelligent adults, we know we shouldn't tell the truth or do it. If anything, this film just covers the face - It doesn't go as far as possible. When Hollywood appears to look and fix the classics of "classics" to try and earn money today, it's not good to see them taking an old movie of the usual success, for making it to the next level? A little more, or even explore what the original staff did not, without or can not cope with the last 20 years? <br /> <br /> That's my opinion however. : o)
