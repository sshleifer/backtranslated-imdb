I look at the romantic comedies and reluctance to some, for romantic comedies has age clich√©s age which make the movie uninteresting. Usually in Romantic Love, there is a girl and there is a boy, they all fall in love, then they have trouble, and then win over marriage problems or anything. But, this film is a different story, it is very different from the Sexual Plots I have seen recently. There is a widow (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a book book and talks for some time, after a while Marie must leave. Dan develops something for him, and when this thing begins to change, we lose. Marie is the sister of her brother. Hearing of the situation, Dan is concerned with Marie and knows that he loves her, and even Marie loves her, but their love is not only possible. How it is done form possible all the story. Steve Carell does well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And all other things have been done well. It's a good movie, see.
