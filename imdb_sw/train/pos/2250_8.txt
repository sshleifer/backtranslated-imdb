This is a good movie about the struggle of the Mormons and their last settlements in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are very powerful, and the message is one we should all be reminded of - God does not speak, but communicates, if only we listen. Since I am writing this in the midst of developing New Orleans and surrounding area from Katrina, I was particularly encouraged by the Mormons to leave everything behind and continue after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution, and yet they could not. The Mormons' struggle to cross the country, the cost in life, the trouble they had was really amazing, showing their great power. In addition to the true Mormon faith, this did not come in too much, and polygamy was mentioned but not a completely film center. It is sent by a high score, though some have a better idea about real characters and can talk about how true the picture was. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all performs well for the given script. Though the film could stand up simply (and it doesn't really have today) Tyrone Force and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to get the crowd on movie movies to see the film about the Mormons. Power is as good as a little saint, and Darnell, like Zina, not a Mormon but continues with the family after his father was killed. Power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when it has a large area, and Darnell (still a young man to hide the picture) has even a little, though it makes a couple couples. Their fate is not clear about its conversion, and someone is wondering about the streets in their case. You can't beat one with eye candy, however.
