Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a high rate of hit as their TV work is involved. However, their film work was taken more (2008 Job's Bank was good, the past year of the World decided the weak, for example) <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, fortunately, is a good success. It has beautiful stories, good performances, lots of humor, amazing music and, more than everything else, real heart. I love the “time”, and this film has one - only when everything goes pear-shaped in corporate corporate functionality.
