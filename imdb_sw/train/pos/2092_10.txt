I watched this film with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I came from the film to think it was! After seeing Muni in just one film where he was quite hammy, I expected that kind of performance here. I was happy to be verified. Although some may accuse him of being a very young child and easily in the Hollywood idea of ​​the Asians, I thought he was just right in that role. Luke, if he was given the opportunity to play the lead role, might have played with him in the same way. I was especially impressed with the function of camera and use of people, especially when renting a house where O-Lan was once a slave. The worst and worst of the squad and droughts made this epic totally different from others at the same time when it was all glitz and glitter. I watched this film from beginning to end. I can't say the same for today's epics.
