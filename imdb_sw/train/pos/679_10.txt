This wonderful Weir Peter Weir is one of the most popular and most popular movies. Richard Chamberlain is doing his best performance here as an Australian lawyer who advocates a group of young Aborigines sentenced to murder. Approaching the case, he gets more about the chief defendant, Chris, and not the least on his own. Chris tells him that it is Mulkurul, which seems to be a race of ordinary creatures that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the rains of rainfall seem to confirm the prophecy of Aboriginal about the coming of the last year, which will strengthen the world. The pattern of dreams and the effects of commonly enhance this film and make it an amazing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are strong in support tasks, along with the chap and the strong name that plays Charlie, the former Aborigin who can turn into the gun. The time and the end do not break down, as opposed to many other wonderful ones that fall down after the promised hour or more. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spiritual and spiritual identity in the modern world. Good work with Peter Weir, master of interesting dramas.
