I was hit by this film when I had things on eBay'ing Caesars Palace, as I enjoy the rich history of Vegas as the end of the original luxury stations is still standing in good condition (unless you count Bally's, MGM Grand's original). With this respect, this film gives full strength. You have been given a great tour of Caesar's wealth, which in spite of the restructuring and additions that have done more than 40 years have been opened, it looks very similar. As a general film, the plot is difficult to follow, thanks to the great part for bad editing. And when I say bad, I don't use that word lightly. There are a lot of long-term snippets, second of Vegas traffic, casino groups, and even the area where character Robert Drivas is having a conversation with his father on how much he is grown, and without explanation, he (Drivas) may (in those bad snippets) from being himself, to a child, to a little boy, and then returning to him talking and returning with his father. (That does not provide any details of the plot, if it is something, one can prepare it and maybe not be the same as I had editing.) The film has been well, and has a good message about the difference between father and son that most people can think of some way or fashion. .
