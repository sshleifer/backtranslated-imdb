Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our ears, our punishment, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends as we all have life through growing problems in a small town in one of the most important decades in the last century. The movie does not take pleasure or sadness techniques on things, only tells us the story, one of which we all have experience. One of the fun and excitement, sad and sad. The power of this story is because we love the characters, it is one of these movies you will watch from time to time, hearing around the small town in Emilia Romagna where it is taking place. Hope one day to finally walk his street near Freccia and his friends, listen to music that changed the world through the lost voice of the old radio play Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, will make you cry sometimes, will surprise and comfort you, will give you and take you. Of course I believe it is an important part of my life, and of my friends, and I tell you all to look at and let it be your part.
