10/10 for this film. <br /> <br /> I am a Indian doctor of India, currently in India. Beckham puts me away, 'cos I am the worst of Liverpool fan, and I think that Owen is very cold. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are opponents, I was DEAD sure that I can't watch the film. But then I was in delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early morning trip, so they thought, "what he is stirring, let's close the time by watching this movie", 'cos was a night show. It was the evening. I had to see this film on the day it was released. I think the use of Beckham's name was to draw the attention of the audience (which was an attack on my case !!!), but I can't really reflect the quality of the film. And / or Nagra, Knightley (lump dead), and Rhys-Myers did a very good job. If you hate football, does not like Manchester United (or England for it), then this describes the film. In fact, I am only 29 years of age, an intellectual and professional specialist, but a hearty child. This film has deleted "Star Wars" in my position number. Not surprisingly, they do not have too many views on this film for human writing like me. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this film.
