This is actually the "80 movie": Afterwards they performed more than 100 times more movies than these days, and that makes many of them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which no longer exists. Nowadays perhaps it is the same kind of people that would have made the cheap "direct-video" -when in eight years, it is making porn cheap. Porn seems to sell. However, this is on the level of the garbage movie: It has a beautiful and interesting story, and has been made well think. In one area you can even see a microphone playing on the top edge of the image. Of course there is also a little bit of Ozzy and Gene Simmons cameos, but they do not contribute much to the "success" film, although they are good in their small responsibilities. The animal, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", looks very awesome, especially when he is singing. One of the scariest monsters I have seen in horror flicks. I might have nightclubs next night. It is not recommended for intellectual film lovers.
