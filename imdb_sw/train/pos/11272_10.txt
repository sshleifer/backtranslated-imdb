IMPORTANT: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After disappointment with the 'Tarzan Ape Man,' we found among his colleagues and historians that the second film, 'Tarzan and his Mate,' was the best in the series. It's true. I've had a great kick out of this film. Johnny Weismuller returns as the vine of the vine of the vine, the beast that fought with wild warriors, and Maureen O'Sullivan includes his role as his most beautiful wife, Jane who loves first games for the first and last time. In my opinion of 'Man Ape,' I beat Jane very well by ignoring her with the clothes and shouting to him, but she herself separated for me here. Do not make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most powerful character in the whole cast. He acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, he can work perfectly in the jungle and deal with the animals, and knows how to hold the pride of the lion when he is out of bullets. He even had his own jungle shouting now. Chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is inevitable. He has found the very best. Cheeta is also very interesting, taking cigarettes away from Martin's cigarette. The program is an excuse of Tarzan to fight with more violent animals than the jungle, especially the lion, crocodiles, and pigs. The effect, though always visible, is more powerful and effective and can work well. Oh, and you can't talk about this film without talking about the nude swimming area. All I can say is: yes, he's naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Tu wow. When it comes to a low-and-dirty stage before the code / adventure, nothing holds the light for 'Tarzan and His Wife.' The inevitable motion of Tarzan Ape Man is the donkey ass, violent and dangerous jungle. I am sure there will be another movie of Tarzan in the future that will not take prisoners as this method does. You would like to be diligent to find the perfect location in this film that can be passed on to the Code, or the adoption of Animal Rights for that. Violent violence does not even wait a beautiful couple of jungle to show before pushing even the limits of today's movies of adventure. And after T & J enter the picture, there are many early morning walks and the ducks of the donkeys swimming in the morning. See yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film. In the first film, Jane appeared as a controversial walk, as the authors back then did not know how to show such a character. But here he is a good forerunner of future women camps. Although he still needs the help of Tarzan to take him out of many jams, he does much more than wait around to be saved. His humanity is completely trusted by the woman who lived in (the volume) easily in the jungle for the year. I looked at this with my mother, and I loved to tell her how Jane has been taught, "as Jeff Foxworthy said. He totally has someone to give him at every beck and call. Although there is an army of eye effects on the film, there is still a lot of Tarzan hair-raising against the enemy war that happens (especially). That and people-dressed-like apes are much more convincing this time around. ** SPOILER ** The film grows like a jungle coming out with a terrible passion for animal farming that leaves Tarzan and Jane only two people breathing. Although couples are standing in the sun reunited and winning, I can't help but imagine how this story will appear for the next trip who will hear about an old group of people who went to seek Tarzan and Jane and did not hear it again. ** PRESIDENT PROTECTION ** One of the things that still bother me is Johnny Weissmuller's soft, hairy hair and coif more styled. Other than this, this is the pre-Code of adventure that is never recommended. The last film: It took place one night (1934). Next film: the twentieth century (1934).
