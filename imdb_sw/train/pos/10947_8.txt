Sarah's Silverman app is very similar to Sarah's stand; It is up to the hatred that you cannot take it with your heart. The fact is, though many people will “find it,” it does not mean that they will all appreciate it. It's a polarizing display with one direction, so if you do not like after 10 minutes, you can also give there. If you do this after 10 minutes, look, because every part so far has been as good as the last. <br /> <br /> As shown, however, it is not perfect. Personally I love the app, but there are many errors with that. Citizens' songs are amazing, but they are much faster than Silverman who tries to identify - a problem that I had "Jesus is magic" too. It seems like Silverman offered a preference for songs for a period that does not need to exist. Not to mention that when the sounds of songs that he writes are beautiful, music, well, not. Another thing to remember is that this time show for some reason appealing to fans of Monty Python, Brigade of Men, etc., not as it shows. I can look at Monty Python all day, but, as I like to show this, I can't look more than half an hour at a time. It gets flat very quickly. The repeat value for this show is too low - the second time next to the part is amazing, and for the third time, in my opinion, it is boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time around is very, very interesting. Give a shot.
