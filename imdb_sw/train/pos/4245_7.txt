If the girl's theme from Missouri is well known it should be. That's because Anita Loos who wrote the screen here also wrote the common gentlemen prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in the film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from people of the way. <br /> <br /> And it's a sense of people that Jean Harlow is after. She comes from the road to a run away with her mother and father because she has decided that the best way to get a simple life is to get married.

He still admits a few baubles from him that his fellow Lionel Barrymore advertising. Lionel was interested in this until Jean put good things on her child playing, Franchot Tone. After that she has not been disturbed and seems to shake Jean from the family plant. <br /> <br /> The girl from Missouri went to the effective production of the same Code went under specific control. I feel that we could see the most dangerous film. Yet Jean Harlow as a small and regular version of Mae West is always recommended. What a beautiful talent of the comic which the woman had, see the Girl from Missouri is a sad reminder of losing the great world of film going and passed her three years later. Not surprisingly enough to be healed of Patsy Kelly and Harlow did not have the shortest brief short of Kelly made with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have a very simple chemistry that Patsy had Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in an accident / suicide / suicide accident that no satisfactory explanation was found. Do not miss a girl from Missouri, it's bright and sassy, ​​you must be from all the interesting products.
