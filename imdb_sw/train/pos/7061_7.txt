Of course, the original is better, but this is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it is designed in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was very good to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she loved it, it shows the love you can do. Stories were not even worse. <br /> <br /> I liked the sound of the best Cinderella in this too. I have nothing against its sound in nature, but I think it just looks good here, more nicer. I also loved his personality in this too, he had more spine, but he was still kind. So, I will give Cinderella II: A Dream Come True 7/10.
