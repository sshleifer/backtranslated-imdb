After reading the original play I thought it would be very difficult to deal with the screen than it was. Donal McCann puts a good performance once as Public Gar, a defended defendant who is clearly exposed to the screen for his proposed (but unknown to others) alt-gar Gar. Eamonn Kelly also scores the best "screwballs" that are impossible to communicate with his feelings like Gar. It is worth the rental if you can get it. (Maybe not available outside Ireland and UK)
