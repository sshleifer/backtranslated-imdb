I remember that I was a child when I saw this film first, it was my first movie of fear (maybe that's why I can remember some of its parts). I do not remember much about acting, nude events or other things but I remember a man with a grenade head, a man cracked on a tree and a man runs down with a truck and hit his head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last place when Jennifer McAllister dug into the stomach to kill the keys to the truck. It's a movie that gives you goes and has a look at the look. But where do I get it? How can I download it?
