Yes, Shakespeare was undoubtedly proud. Laurence Fishburne did not have her ability but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His arrangement was wonderful if he was with the audience. Very good work. There was sometimes a very young player where more would be expected. The assassination of Cassio, for example, was slightly closed and happens very far, causing the player to move his head to understand all. Did I mention Michael Maloney? Her spirituality was hard on Roderigo; even anger. If you haven't seen Othello before, check out this. If you haven't read Othello, check out this. If you have not heard Othello, see this. You do, on the other hand, make yourself a permit to read it, seeing it took action and heard it also sang.
