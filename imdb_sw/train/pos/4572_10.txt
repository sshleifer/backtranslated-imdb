As a person who has lived with the brain palsey for more than forty years, I see this film to be interesting. If a bad person like a CP like Christie Brown can do that, then there is no reason why I couldn't reach my dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both offer amazing displays. <br /> <br />
