I am a great fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this special Christmas when it was original on the TV and loved it. I have an original vinyl album with a CD. I have an original CD and a future. Release later there are several songs though. I see that it was released this year with all previous songs. To my surprise I've got an original CD to sell at $ 75.00. WOW - to think that Cd's Christmas would be very valuable. I have no value to sell this treasure. It's a favorite CD of Christmas. I've never found it on VHS or DVD. I'd like to have any version. If someone who is available please please let me know. Thank you
