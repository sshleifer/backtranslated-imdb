"GEORGE LOPEZ," in my opinion, is quite a classic ABC! I haven't seen every part, but I'm still enjoying it. There are many cases that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) walked on a moving machine. If you want to know why, you will have seen it yourself. Before we close this, I would like to say that everyone gave good performance, the production structure was wonderful, the clothes were well-designed, and the text was very strong. In conclusion, although new events can be seen now, I strongly recommend doing it if it comes to the air for beauty.
