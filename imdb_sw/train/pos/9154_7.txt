Very good but at the end that was a great desire. <br /> <br /> Script was very good as it was acting. The exhibitions were often very big but this was the way it was added to the film if the elements of the snow were good that helped to create feelings towards the film. This affects was damaged by an unreliable end. I will give you this 8 film out of ten but last hit it down to the 7th point because it seemed to leave largely from the first minute of the movie and it seemed to be complete at the end of making film makers be clever. This video though it was much better than films with a very big budget and seemed to have been done as a home movie and additional equipment. Not so much in the way of special effects as these go but by insisting it was very good.
