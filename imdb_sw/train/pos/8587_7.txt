Take me: Makes use of its known conspiracy and good performances and real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is normal. The innocent person is put in a conspiracy to kill the US President, the first traitor in the American secret service. If his secret agents follow up, he tries to prove he is innocent. Of course we know the innocent, and the real anger is around the corner, but I was still accepted by the SENTINEL. At the moment when stimulation decreases to be very cautious and most of the series of operating, SENTINEL is a good position for all the good old political crimes. The best way has been uplifted with an exciting and dynamic exhibition. Michael Douglas, a perfect man for work, is a secret member of the secret service Pete Garrison, who has been written as part of the plot to kill the President. Former employees in secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) follow Harrison while trying to find out who is finishing the possible death by a traitor in the secret service. This leads to many incidents of expulsion that, surprisingly (and with gratitude), they have never trusted. Screenplay also offers subplot involving Garrison to be connected with First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). This thanks was not needed as part of the film is these types of films. The film director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who can make the film beautiful. Although many criticized as "must be a television movie", I must not agree. It was accepted, this is not a perfect film, and much of it has been influenced by other acts of action and political deception as on the line of fire or series from a 24-series TV series (which this film is very similar to the style and star Sutherland), yet , this film takes its plot at high levels and does not provide its small details. Exhibitions are large (highly cast at the top, which should be, even with the script of the number. <br /> <br /> All-all-the-way, it's a 1/2, not full, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Testing: *** 1/2 out of 5.
