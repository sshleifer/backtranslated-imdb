In the UK in 1940. Three children (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want but takes them to the shepherd. It seems he learns to be a wizard through the course of communication with the college of magic. (OK - I realize this is a family film but - a magic college ??? And she and the children move around in bed with the help of a magical bed. I saw this first when I was 9 years old and of course remember to love you. It is certainly not worth as an adult! Stories are silly (even for fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is very strange. Also Roddy McDowall is billed three and looks just in two short scenes! There is also a Naboombu Isle journey that is run by live animals. I thought that could be fun but animation is poor (for Disney) and has a very bright and very long game of football among animals. There are few save here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just the best; these songs (while reserved) are beautiful; The long series of drums on Portobello Road is a beautiful color and full of energy and special effects of winning Oscar still very interesting at the end. But the story of the weak story, poor animation and invisible children pull this truth. I heard the extended version is worse! I can only give this 7.
