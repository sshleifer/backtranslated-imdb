It said Deanna Durbin bought the youth. This first film was one of the best. The beautiful story presented 14-year-old Deanna, a little beauty and a beautiful voice, like "Miss Fixit" in a divided family. In summary of the compound, see other IMD modes, but soon Deanna and her two older sisters are scheduled to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father remarry. With the best help used by Barbara Read and Nan Gray as a sister, a good direction and editing, the film succeeds in one attraction even to the following comments. In three of Deanna's songs, only "Il Bacio" is from a classical repertoire, but while singing in the area of ​​the police station, the role of the film in history is sure. At least for the 15-year-old viewer was beaten with life by Deanna and traditional music. One of the most beautiful touchings that occur in GIRLS THREE SMART'S SMALL is a small view of a drunk who puts his neck to see the end of Deanna as the fighters do! One reason for the success of this film is that the future writers of Durbin cars were locked on the "Miss Fixit" theme, which was fast. Deanna never did. His level as an actor is more likely than his charisma, which he certainly had. It seems to me that, like another film of the film, he caused the "nature" of the ability of history which he lost. That way made it better for 21 film films.
