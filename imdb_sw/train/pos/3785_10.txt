This film has been hit very low. It is highly creative, creative and clever. It's just fun and in my opinion this film is approaching first. But the film had forgotten when it happened first, and it became even more neglected as the years passed. "Bill & Ted's journey to Bogus" also hit a bomb at the box office, where the first was a very good hit and very well known. <br /> <br /> I think the problem could be that this film was released a few years. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "so" 80s. Although 'only 80 years was a few years ago back then, the music and fashion environment for children changed dramatically by gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted and Ozzy Osbourne of them, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses' music with their '80 style' seemed to be out of place and at a time '91, and I think that's one BIG because the film was bombed at box. No one but the invaders continued to say things like "best!" and "bogus!" In 1991. "2" Gremlins, which also came out of the early 90s, found a similar film that hit a box at the box office because it was associated with '80s. The transition from '80 to' years of 90 was the most significant change now for '90s and' 00. 1991 was not as 1988 or 1989, where right now, in 2002 and last year 2001 still appears / looks like 1995 or 1996. br> If only "Azuri Adventure" that was made in 1988, it was released that year instead of 1989, and "The Bogus Journey" was released quickly and released in 1989, then it would also have been as it was first received.
