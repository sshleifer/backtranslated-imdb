Will Smith is one of the best-time actors. I don't know how he does it. Read the books regularly but if there is a movie and Will Smith will look at them. He has a common gift to connect you to the film and put it there. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen yet. I watched it on Saturday and still can't remove my head. AMAZING and sad all at the same time. Thank you again. You must watch this film from beginning to end to understand each part of the film. You can't miss anything. Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex and your woman / woman sitting next to you so you can pull. WELL Value money you have paid to look at. Don't wait to come on television.
