I liked this much. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan) I'll just love it. I will encourage other consultants to say that this film is growing up to you as you look. It starts slowly but the freezing method is very common and has its own feelings. You get into it. I liked the enjoyment of the movie and I think the movie was very touching in general. Participants have a great feature of origin and the movie slows down and gently spell when you are involved in a wide range of partnerships and you want to know how it will eventually change and how the characters will choose to take. I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - there are no television movies that have more comments then Rich In Love. One thing that I would like to say is the end that you are doing things and I must look again to see it. This is a film that may not be for everyone but I feel a deep down (even some of my many buffs friends who have seen almost every movie have not seen this) and even seem to have a lot of message board but I liked it very much and for those all who are like family drama that have heat, environment and unhurried speed should look at this. Especially noteworthy is that it is happening in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love south, and movies that are being held there, this is a gem. I will add my vote to a few awesome comments and suggest this unknown flick.
