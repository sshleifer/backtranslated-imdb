Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. As I watched this film, which was held in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was looking at the builder. Simpson debacle (although I have a very good opinion on the lack of individuals in each situation). Australian media, if this film is believed, destroyed the infanticide case and the possible fact was left as after cancellation. It was horrible to see incidents of anxiety, media news concerns, half-truths of half-truths and fiction and debate about appropriate cases of cases for people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> sign of the media as different and misunderstanding technical information in the case. I want more to do with the issue of religious hatred in the case (suspects are Seventh Day Adventists). The best way is normal, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents get a bit sometimes but not understandable.
