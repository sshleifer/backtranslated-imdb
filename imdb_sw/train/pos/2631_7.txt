If the King of the Lion is a bad story about a young lion with revenge for the death of his father, the Lion King 1 and half is the opposite, with joy and happiness. The Lion of the Lion told the story from the Lion's lion, 1 and a half is from the view of Timone and Pumbaa, a less full duo made by meercat who came home because he could not dig the halls without burying friends and neighbors with warthog who The question of smell. The movie is a little short on substances, but Disney does a good job of filling time with various star Timone and Pumbaa animations as they “watch” the movie with us. I have loved it very much to sing it in half through the movie, make sure you watch the bouncing bug! Disney has announced 1 and a half as "all the stories," though it's not true. It is a different view of the King of the Lion, without all the great things that happened over the second half of the classic Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their voice work, without their efforts, movies may not work. Singing, enjoys, and makes us laugh. It also gives us the reason to avoid the warthog fire.
