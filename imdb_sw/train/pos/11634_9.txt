I've also got from the top of Redeye's investigation and I must say that I wasn't very happy on the movie for a long time. WESA CRAVEN is best for him. He brings us to the wonderful end of the summer thriller I had a great desire. This is a fun year. Of course. <br /> <br /> All artists are amazing and action is realistic and fun. F / X was good. It is fast to build up. I was on the edge of my seat over the movie. It has been time since I heard the relaxing audience and clapping and getting excited in the theater. If you are looking for an exciting, practical and good plot in this summer, REDEYE offers. Go see!
