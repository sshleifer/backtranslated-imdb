I liked the best version of Emma's best. Kate beckinsale was as strange as Emma and the power symbol was very good as knightly. The only complaints that I had on Mr. Woodhouse. can not believe that one can burn too much or be so selfish and life of his daughter ... was a smart girl at the end though. as always, I would like the place where these Jane Austin movies were shot. The settings are unique. makes me visit England very much 9 with Ireland and Scotland. I am glad that I should see this too.
