This is a good story and poetry. Beautiful scenery. Beautiful color symbols. I have twice a Japanese last year and the movie paid this common sense of Japanese. The camera movement is good, with actors. It goes into your emotions without a model. Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and very well brought to the screen here. The director plays superb with light light and shows listeners that it is also possible to give them enjoy the movie with trick and fine details. Once you see this film you will need to see more from the director. It's really a good movie and I can just recommend to everyone.
