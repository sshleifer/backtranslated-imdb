This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. At first I saw when I was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking at another time before the rape area. And when I saw that I was misunderstood to think "What is this kinda of this movie?". Today I have seen it from the beginning and I understand how well this movie really is. It is exciting, fearful, terrifying and in a distinct way. But the best thing about it is the end where the audience is shown that this experience will hate the characters for the rest of their lives. They will have to suffer their conscience and will struggle for their whole life about the bodies available in the river. And nothing they can do about it, is something they have to live with. This end is one of the most enjoyable breaks in the history of the film and is very smart, brilliant and awesome. Very good in this film. All, John Boorman has created one of the best movies in the movie history according to Dick Chaney's novel. You must see for all movie lovers
