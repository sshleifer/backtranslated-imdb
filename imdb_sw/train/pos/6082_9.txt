I have enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's classics of Shakespeare always, for he always works very well, but in this film, lifting the entire movie, not another except "always-good actress" Laurence Fishburne. Certainly he has made a good choice in the film, though he is a good actor, but in this one we are given real Othello: enthusiasm, the power of envy as it grows stronger with the Fishburne pole shown paranoia and, more than that, is finally given Othello black! I don't think they could choose Othello better. Who else could give him a mix of sympathy / protest, love / hatred and, not forget, those hot eyes ...? Branagh is as good as always, but not its peak, Desdemona's Ir√©ne Jacob is a good but very little, while Laurence Fishburne lifts the truth and makes it a very interesting and fun film. What?
