I can't see the status of hiding the movie like this in the fear of sulfuric, while there is no intention to be anything more than a car to entertain children and prepare them for a second product to ask wrong about. <Br /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly through something around and loved every minute. In fact, this man is so small with his evil clothes and a player of the show, but this is much easier to take than the dark, dull, and disgusting pokemon. they have been looking at Pokemon since the start and soon find years where they will "put the baby stuff" and move to others. I am glad that we should enjoy this together.
