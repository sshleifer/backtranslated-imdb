This film is very fun. I have no connection with the nature of the American Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another trial, but it's better than the band camping and naked miles, at least funnier. Just after the first five minutes I was laughing my ass, so I decided to call my friend and we would look at it together. We had a few beer and we were happy. You can't get any messages within this film, but it's worth watching. Then, put it back and be happy.
