John Garfield plays Marine who has been blinded by grenade while fighting Guadalcanal and who learns to live with his disability. He has all the views about blindness, and he is sure he will be a burden for everyone. The hospital staff and Marines fellow injured can not reach him. Neither his girl can return home played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, his own sympathy, and hatred. It is a great responsibility that Garfield takes away from the memory of good performance that continues to look at one another despite the current melodrama. The best scenarios are Guadalcanal, where he is in the gun of a gun machine trying to resist Japanese soldiers walking in the evening watch of the night, and later a nightmare in a hospital where he sees himself going under the train and white cane, dark glasses of darkness , and draw a cup of tin, while all his partner travels back from the camera.
