I've watched this film more than 100-200 times, and I love it every time I look at it. Yes, it can be corny but it is also pleasant and enjoyable. The campus displayed on the movie is a real camp that I attended for 7 years and is shown as a true camp, a good place to spend summer. Everyone who has ever gone to the camp, wants to go to the camp, or has sent a child campaign to see this film because it will bring good memories to you and your children.
