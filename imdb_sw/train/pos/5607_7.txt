I saw the Planner and translated as a terrible movie. It uses a lot of difficult type of apartment: a terrific apartment, offended neighbors, wonders, secrets, hall. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, appeared surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to evict him. <br /> <br /> Last time I watched I denied this original version. If this film is a horror movie, it is only frightened by the fact that Kafka's novel is afraid. In fact this film can be understood to the extent that it is the only person who loves slowly without any external influence. Polanski did his work in three related spiritual movies: Repulsion, which I do not exactly like because the development of madness in the heroine has never trusted me; Rosemary child, where the heroine is driven by evil forces; and Planner, which can be a better research of the paranoia developed in the movie. Trelkovsky is a young man who gives rent that a woman was killed. She is engaged with him and slowly begins to be: she dresses her, puts makeup, speaks like her. But is he who has the spirit, or does he just let his wild thoughts be better for him? This is a reluctance between what is real and imagined, and which Polanski does not disclose, that makes this movie interesting. Many events in the film can be associated with the most common things as they may have common reasons, and it is for the viewer to decide what to believe. Although this is not my favorite Polanski film, however, it is a good example of its ability to create doubts and show spirituality with very good words. And to say technical, it's amazing too. It is worth mentioning with the film singer Philippe Sarde and the director of Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) story in this film. Slowly and sometimes very uncomfortable can make this film difficult to enjoy, but it is still an experience.
