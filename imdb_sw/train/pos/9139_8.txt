The movie is the same, it has time is, the music scenes are the best of all! Sound sound is a real classic. It's a perfect album, begins with Let's Go Crazy (accurate to the beginning as a great party of the party and very-tempo), Take Me With U (the pop song of fun ...), Beautiful (happy Ballad, maybe it's something very close to the R&B in all this album, Computer Blue (some sound of anger towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, it is very clear laughing Appolonia), When Crying Cry (peak of this masterpiece ), I would like to die 4 U, Child I am a Star, and, of course, the Purple Rain (a true of course, the end of fitting for this old album) Movie and album are very good. I recommend so much!
