Tenshu is bound and sentenced to die. When he is electrocution, government officials give them the choice to be electrocute to a greater extent or to accept other trials. He chooses the experiments and is placed in a large cell of metal and the bad breaker of the ass who also survived electrocution. They can have anything needed in the room (inside the reason), but they can't leave. After a few days there is a food cut up to one day and temp room is also put to 100. After some alarms are beaten to intervals so they can't sleep. One day the 'witch' comes into the cell (if it is part of the mirror). What will happen next will leave you see. I can be in a few here but I wanted to be built, was thanking me. Now if the money was half as good as building I liked this more advanced. <br /> <br /> My Library: C + <br /> <br /> DVD Tools Media Blaster 2 Dimensions: Disc 1) Director's Director; Advertisements of "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack of the Gas Station", and "Rekka Dungeon" Disc 2) Theatrical County; Comments by Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview with delegates; Making; The original trailer; and Teasers Promo
