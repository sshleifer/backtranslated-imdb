Very powerful Movie. You are locked in a death obstacle as soon as you stop getting involved with the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), has been broken into a life-changing balance of his work with his family. He realizes his former colleague Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the foundation. He sees that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the US attack in the US 9-11, did not communicate with the truth ... choosing to share his ideas with his favorite music from old games and videos. Former members return their friendship and strengthen their old bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, trying to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but it is Alan who makes his friend get out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith has a wife of Johnson. The author and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer. Also in cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. The voice of the high voice associated with Bruce Springsteen's favorite, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and Composers. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a fan of Sandler; but I have seen him better in this role. In some cases, I thought loudly ... why it was never committed to playing the singer / author of songs Bob Dylan in biopic.
