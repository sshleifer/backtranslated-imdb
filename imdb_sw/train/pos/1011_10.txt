I love the joke of Jack as' Cliche is ... 'or' More than a man hit on, black skin, kinda oil, kinda spooky ... ". He is just cunning! Daniel begins to capture him! Good thing Jack is not on the team again (by the way) or maybe it would be an excited mania! I love all the plots (8th season, slightly, I must admit), the characters are the chief, the actors are the best, I start taking the face (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's just theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I'm going again! Sorry, I also begin to take praise from Carter, and all of these are running my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for three other seasons or so, especially if they continue to incorporate events for all this humor, sports game, and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
