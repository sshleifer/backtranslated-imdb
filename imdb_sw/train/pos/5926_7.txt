Sleepy sleep is a creature that runs away from the power of life from humans to live ... but they can only use widows (do not explain why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who need to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He goes after Tanya called (Madchen Amick). What? He will escape? <br /> <br /> On one side this is a great film of fear. Freezing speed, excessive blood and gore and good, a distorted sense of humor. There are a lot of joke references for the horrible dirt (Castle Rock mentioned immediately). Krause is also the best (who would think he would do after the "Return to Lagoon Blue") as Kirge and Amick. But I find this filthy film. It is written by screens by Stephen King and is very clear. Sleepwalkers are not fully explained. Where from? Why are they called? Why does the baby need to feed the mother? Why does the cat hate them and you can kill them? Their power after all (at one time Krause makes the car disappear and changing colors and fashion!)? Why do they need to feed the lives of people? Why should it be just widows? Why does the baby have sex with her mother? None of these explains the story of the confusion. It's very bad because, these questions aside, this is a very frightening film. Beauty of makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Install, gory and many fun. If the script was just the best. Also the open sex area between Krause and Krige was changed (you can tell them) to get the rate of R. I can only give this 7.
