I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I expected too much when it came. My worst fears are that it will be plodding, such as ... well, you know what all the girls shouted shouting about? GACKTnHYDE = their love hawt? That kind of thing? Blame. I was very, very surprised. The movie was amazingly searchable, even if the movies and music made it feel like someone had to escape a pair of nun-chucks two scenes, and acting on the Gackt section was quite good. Hyde, that, um, Hyde, acted as a friend of a group member / group member that anyone who saw in action cannot be surprised. He is one of my two major animals and the film itself. But all the other victims (including child actors in the opening area) were very good in doing what they did - which, in particular, were shot and right. But my second problem was very small, it relates to hospitality. It was also a tragic way for me - if every place where someone is shot, they are more likely to be dead, really dead, or sleep there for a long time. But Sho just ... it takes shots, regularly, nails up, blows LOT while speaking, and makes Hyde cried. All in all, if you are a fan of any actors or fan-film, it is definitely worth checking.
