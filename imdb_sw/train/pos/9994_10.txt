"The life of stinks" is a life-threatening illness, happiness and depression. Europeans and whites are always in our lives. The performance of Mel Brooks is as brilliant as always, and other actors do well as well. This film has a taste of Capra, that's why it's good. There are some unthinkable compounds such as Brooks trying to get money to play on the street, and all the passers just ignore it, or when they meet a wonderful person who believes it is Paul Getty and then starts discussing and being beaten. If you haven't seen, you don't know what you're 'missed. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. The only difference between this film and the fact is that this film has an end to happiness, and the reality does not. It is true, Life Life.
