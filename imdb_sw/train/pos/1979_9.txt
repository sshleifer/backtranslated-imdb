My partner, Annette, we looked at this together and we'll be commenting. We were all excited to see this although it took the freedom and work of Dicken. Most Dicken jobs are dark and dreary (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all of that. It was fun, colorful (all visible and music), and the characters were more of the heart. TRAVIS: Normally, I don't care too much for movies and music, but this production songs were interesting and exciting, and choreography was amazing. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: That's a lot from Travis. I can't stress how much it is for the dance numbers. You can say, for example, that the boys worked hard to find routines under perfection. TRAVIS: Three actors missed IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can actually make a good villain. One place where you see his eyes with a slot of mail has helped me to slow down ... AWESOME. And the baby Jack Wild was the Good Dodger of Art. And Nancy was amazing (someone, I felt bad when she was killed). He can also sing! Kudos to the department to throw on their choice there. I hated Oliver Twist kid tho. She was very white and wimpy to my taste. (I continued to ask Bill Sikes to throw him in the mud during the track.) And they should not sing him. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Working was quite realistic. Apart from the three Travis stars mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fagin) did a great job. He was very good, and at the same time he was also a sinner. Help participants were also. Harry Secombe took Mr. Bumble to his position very well. And he has a wonderful voice. I saw Mr. Secombe doing in another movie called "Davy" where he played the opera singer with good results. Those talented Harry Secombe should be in most movies. TRAVIS: As I said earlier the story is not quite true to the book, but IMO was more stable. This film was not boring either, as some music seems to be. And continuously allows you to move with the characters. Tunes did not prevent you from conspiracy or insomnia to be too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any music movie that Travis looks at should be normal. And this is actually getting a few times. It is a very simple production of watch that carries the viewer well and enjoyable to the end. On the day when all the movies appear to have a positive impact with the beautiful faces, this was breathing. Our sign of this was 8.5 of 10. (We will go up to 9 in this case.). TRAVIS: I scored this 7 especially because Oliver Twist's baby (Mark L.) was angry, and his songs were suffering with my harsh ears. Otherwise, it was the best movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. Movies are not available more than this. And you can tell everyone involved in this production worked hard to make it what ... a jewel. <br /> <br /> Please don't miss this ... even though you don't like music. In fact it's a few treatments.
