One and alone was a great film. I was finishing looking at the EncoreW on DirecTV. I am a professional self-wrestler, and I think this was good to show how life is like a professional wrestler. Now this film was made four years before birth, but I don't think that the rigors of professional travel wrestling have changed all that much. Offering, funny, and around GREAT !!! **** 10+
