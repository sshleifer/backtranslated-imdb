This small-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it regularly. Dreyfus and Braga are skilled, but Raul Julia steals the show! Language-in-cheek, with a good shock of Gomes Addams, and just the right tone of this inappropriate spoof of this told story. It is not always available and not appreciated, the Moon Over Parador allows you to look at the truth and join the fun on the screen. Body thumbs up!
