If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I suggest you look at this. Reflects on the side of Marc Bolan's scandal with Ringo Starr, it seems to have a good time to take pictures that are not part of the festival, but to enjoy, you have no sense of knowing them as mere people, and when the festival is shown by a talented musician, all with a professional who appear and seem to attract girls who cry. Watching him at the concert, you do not know that the rock star is working, but just have a good time playing songs with friends and other good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr who look at some of the live performances. Actually, there are short songs that you didn't like to see there, but if any album can't have everything. I had bought this in 2006, but if I knew it happened in 1972, I would like to buy some years ago. Sadly and incredible that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, can not learn to drive and die in a car accident!
