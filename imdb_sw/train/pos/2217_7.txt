I am usually worried about watching a film or a mini series based on the novel because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! Screenplay was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and author, huh?) <br /> <br /> Posted by the best. I can't describe how I enjoyed seeing many characters (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee by Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). The location of the place ... I expected to see the houses and cottages I had thought of in my mind: what I saw on the screen was a little different. However, it was not enough to make me dislike the miniature series. I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be discouraged if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
