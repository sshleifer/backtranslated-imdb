Fay Grim is a continuous story that began ten years earlier by Henry Fool's Hartley. I haven't seen the original movie, and I don't know if that's a good thing or not. I can only focus on the current film for their own characteristics. For many people, the Hal Hartley style of film making is something you would like or not. The combination of action, concert, perversion and dry, strange humor is interesting to me, and Fay Grim is not discriminatory. It has an intellectual minded mind that was with me and many in the audience of the World's Melbourne Film Festival laughing loudly. For the first half of the film did not have a deficit and was given to the accuracy of the wind. It is a humorous style to sadly miss movies and an entertaining welcome to young people who have no idea that Hollywood crosses out like pancakes. In the second half of the film, humor begins to be thin as a film film in international advocacy / commitment of conspiracy. If this was the intention of Hartley or if he lost an unknown thought, but I think a bit of editing or rewriting to reduce fifteen minutes on the film would have taken the original film speed. The most common show was good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had more screenshots. The Burrows of Saffron, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all did a good job. The film exhibition was good (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and music (also with Hartley) was good without power. The movie is well written and I enjoyed this very much. If you like Hartley's original work, maybe you would like this.
