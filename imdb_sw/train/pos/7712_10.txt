Level One, Fear. When I saw this film for the first time at 10, I knew it would give me a night. It did. Surprised, if I remember, it sounded like seeing a monster that made them. Two ways, Psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the story of what it was: What?

This is a pure science fiction, not "cowboys in space" that passes to the kind of today. After 43 years, the World Planet remains the largest fake film. If you reset, SKG or Lucas, see!
