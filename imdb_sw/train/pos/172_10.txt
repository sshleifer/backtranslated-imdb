I saw this film on Comedy Central a few times. This movie was very good. It is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the United Nations can find the base of the army there for the equality of power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate." I just loved the last theme. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
