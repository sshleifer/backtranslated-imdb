In general, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to movie film lovers. However, I need to identify the similarity between the parts of this film and the "Closer" of Nichols. One particular area where the behavior of Adrian Grenier asks Rosario Dawson about his sex life when he was far away is the closest to the closest situation where Clive Owen's character interviews Julia Roberts, although it has been taken by violence and power in "Love. Also remember that "Anna" is the name of Dawson's character and Roberts. It cannot be unfortunate. Now Welcome is the basis for playing for Patrick Marber and it is alleged that this film is freely according to "Reigen" of Arthur Schnitzler so I don't know how this relationship was created. Anyone has any idea?
