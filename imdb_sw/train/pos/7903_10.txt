I saw this movie the first second voice of T.R. he sent me on a journey - well I did not like very well-developed fingers at the beginning, but a wonderful humor and an elegant show of all the sissy actors - I do not know who had played the boy - but he was so big and so was !!! - Two other people where in the movies went after half an hour, I had a friend - and it was always a look at the film I love very well with my friend one - and, we both enjoyed also delicacy - sadness on "real police-normos" ". we all fans of T.Robbins books ... I have seen it well - thought, that Robbins also adopt, though I have no idea if he likes film or not ... <br /> <br /> I would like to see things cut - I heard that sand of gus must come out of many images because of the first audience (or manufacturers ???) is still a artistic movie. it's too short even ... it's one of all my favorites - and I know that many people can't stand that kind of movie and think that people who love these films are whatever they think ... .... what pity. there will surely come a day when there will be a full-time DVD - expect to see more of the crispian, keanu - expect to see her child and all <br /> if you have a chance to see it, think twice, and enjoy if you have made a choice. look ... m
