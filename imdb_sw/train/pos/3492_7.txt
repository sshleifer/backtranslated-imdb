Not as bad films as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It has a nice casting.Nice to see Roger Moore back on the screen with the use of other British actors. I would like to see more than Olivia D`bo in future projects. For the star against her cousin Maryam D`Abo. It is also a good use of unseen places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> Hope we will see more production of UK-European cooperation like this.
