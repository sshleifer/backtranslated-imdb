What was so remarkable about this film is the most interesting audience. Similar films such as Anita and Me have never been caused by this film, although I think that maybe because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the head more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant film to put a great message - you can do anything if you decide enough, and keep your mind, which is a good message for anyone watching this film. I think this is one of the best films of Keira Knightley, and I think she is a brilliant actor, and was better for that role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Sadly, I can't say this to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I don't think he was a very good actor, and being honest, his eyes were terrible. <br /> <br /> All for all, brilliant films, and brilliant stories
