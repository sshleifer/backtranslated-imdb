I should say I loved the movie completely. It had a lovely time, a hearty place, just around the sides. I, personally, loved this movie because it is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. This movie, in my opinion, describes more for young gay people. It shows how a young boy can be treated while growing. Criticizing, name-calling, and ignorance is something that I, like other female female girls, always remember, and now finally a movie showing how hard it is actually growing gay. Therefore, I would like to see this film. Probably not to look up to an old man and mature enough to understand
