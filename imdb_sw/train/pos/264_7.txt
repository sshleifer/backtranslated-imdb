Hickory Dickory Dock was a good secret of Poirot. I confess that I have not read the book, despite being a fan of Agatha Christie sharp. Changes have not had its problems, there were times when humor, and there were attempts to get justice, there were no more, and events that led up to the final solution had run away. I also thought there was a short time to decrease so some secrets appeared. However, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was done, it had a picture of the same image as the skilled ABC killers, and actually put the atmosphere, what and the function of the dark camera and dark lights. Dark times were exciting, this was supported by one of the smell of music in the poirot comparison, perhaps not as distracting one of the One One Buckle My shoe, which gave me nightly pain. The plan is complicated, with all the necessary ingredients, though not like the Buckle My Shoe, and somehow it's a good thing. Acting was very good, David Suchet is good (I know I can't use this word forever but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in a series) like Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran doing justice to their important characters carefully. And the students had a good reputation and grew very well, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. All, the secret secret but does not rank together better. Bethany Cox 7.5 / 10
