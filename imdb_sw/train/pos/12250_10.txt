Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Very bad Knightly ins't as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a very good job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas's father. I love the last place (which is an increase in novel-but well written) when the harvest has existed and for the Knightly religion and its staff and community friends. Emma must show that she accepts now. She is a changed woman. That's very fast, but it's okay. I can buy it in it. Samantha Bond is a former Emma and a brave man. He is wonderful. as I could imagine him. I believe that when the UK makes Jane Austen better. English versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. Check out this!
