His despair and marriage and lack of love, make Eve return to her father's house in the field, leaving her husband. One day, bathed in the lake, his horse crosses with his clothes and a young employee finds and gives to Eve. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to return Eve back home. Eva refuses, and luckily leads trio to the same place, ending the thing in a terrible way. I just watched "Expanding" for the first time, and my first comment is about the awesome quality of VHS released in Brazil and Video Brazilian Video Video: The movie has only 75 minutes, and it seems that it used a different film reels. . There are some parts that have been completely destroyed, and some parts have been seriously damaged. Therefore, the beauty of images that are not available by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the opportunity to get this odd VHS in rent or sale. The film is a silent attraction, the story is dated and has only a few lines. Therefore, characters are badly made. However, this movie is also very strict, with the appointment of Hedy Lamarr the best milk and honey oil to the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetry and metaphoric used of flowers, indicating sex between Eva and her partner. The method of the director performs displays to show the needs and preferences of Eva is very clear. The incomplete end is also common for the 1933 movie. I loved this film, but I hope one day have a chance to see 87 minutes to be restored. My vote is eight. Headline (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
