One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles can finish without interference with the studio! This film is Welles, but it's worth every minute because someone can see the beauty of perhaps the best American photo director at all times! We can see the money that took Orson Welles to photograph this film. The story has many holes in it, perhaps because of the claims of the laborers who did not believe the director. It suggests to read some comments submitted to the IMDB which compares Orson Welles to the brothers of Coen, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when they must be all directors who should appear to be supporters of the master himself. No one had the most natural and creative in the history of the American movie than Mr. Welles. Lucky we still have his legacy either in retrospective looks like one Film Forum in New York just ended, or his film either on tape or DVD form. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth did not love more pictures than here. If she was beauty and her red hair, like a blonde, she is just stunning with words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie. The only thing that could make this film a hub to be added to the work of Orson Welles, was to be seen in it. If he was insisting on leading and had another actor to translate Michael O'Hara, a different film might have been quite successful. Orson Welles should be counted as maybe a pioneer in taking a camera off and a lot of label on the road. The exhibition in this film is so amazing that we come out of the theater after seeing this film very interesting work, vision and talent.
