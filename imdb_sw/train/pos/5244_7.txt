"Ladies Man" faces a common problem between movies according to skits "Saturday Night Live". And that, the sketch that happens for five minutes will not do well for ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laugh, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, maniac's sex directly out of the 70's, and Will Ferrell as a man who fights with the defendant beaten by Leon. So this film is enough, but not "World of Wayne"!
