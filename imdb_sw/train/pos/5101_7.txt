John Travolta, the world's largest honkeytonk, and the mechanical beef ... what more can you apply! Yes, maybe you may not find many surprises or great meaning in this. However, I've always got it enjoy enjoying this romnick of romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet Gilley and fall in love. They have all the problems you can expect a couple of hardcore living. The honkeytonk events are interesting and play, cows, and - of course - the heroes required. It has a beautiful, country of 1980 soundtrack, featuring "Watching Love in All Unworthy", "Devil went to Georgia", and "Hello Texas" and Jimmy Buffett I loved. Shoot your cowboy boats and have boot-scootin 'boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (Out of 4)
