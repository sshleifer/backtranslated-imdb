This film is a hilarious! I watched it with my friend and we had to see it again. This film is not for you-film actors who will watch only the selected movie awards (you know who you are). The "strangled" is a strong comedy that I was laughing around. It does not take too much of it and should be observed by your friends, not your girlfriend. It will not win any prize, but it has to be viewed to be counted. True, some joke is a toilet humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of them sometimes. Some people need to reinforce and see "why they are", not what they are. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 out of *****.
