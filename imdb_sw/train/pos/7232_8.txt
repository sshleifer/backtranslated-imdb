After the usual track, Jerry accidentally wind into a bottle of invisible ink, which was part of the chemistry. He realizes that it does not appear ... so the result of predicting what is happening, means he uses his new secret to torture Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often he is very sad in it that reveals the cat at any time, even when it is not. Here, Tom thinks his eyes deceive him when cheese from the mouse disappears before his eyes, or milk from the plate. Tom can no longer take so he tries to sleep this dream away, but Jerry sets fire to his paw! Man, I hope little children did not think to watch these cartoons back in '40s and' 50s! I've always seen Jerry, a little mouse, worse than good. Thank you, in cartoons, in general, anything that affects the behavior occurs within seconds and returns to normal. The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom defines the story with Jerry, and tries to explore different ways to find out where the mouse is located (such as paste on the floor to see his foot).
