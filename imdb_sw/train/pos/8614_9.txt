The movie made my interest, especially because Dianne Keaton is a favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other publications because the plot has not been undo. I had no trouble following (maybe some people had a very yainog the night before). The movie was very sad and touching too. What do you want more? Alexa Davalos is a beautiful talent (good too), and Tom Everett Scott is doing a good job with her part too. Mother and daughter's relationship may not be true, but the behavior of young people in the movie was not. It was sad but sad. It is true to beat other exhibitions that were on the New Morning Day afternoon
