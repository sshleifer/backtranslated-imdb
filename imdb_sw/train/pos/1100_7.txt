- After being triggered by the rat race and the bad living conditions of New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) acquires property in his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But, building a house shows that it's simple but simple. If headaches and bills begin to talk, so they laugh. Will Mr. Blanding find his dream house? What makes this movie unique is the three main actors - Grants, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Any of the three is able to carry the film alone, so when you combine its talents, almost every area is unique. Grant has always been my favorite in this kind of role. She is very good at playing husband. Loy is always happy to watch. The film of the Holy Man who made by William Powell is almost entirely. And Douglas has been my favorite over two or three years ago. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, my favorite favorite. <br /> - Movie is definitely the product of its time. I get a kick out of thinking when you can create two stories, three bedroom, four bathroom house over $ 15,000 income per year. Throw to the fact that your two children attend a private school and you have a servant to live and it becomes almost fanciful. However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many situations and events that Blanding finds are easily available today. And that's where the comedy comes in. How many people have done some stupid things that a couple doing in this movie just ended up more money than expected? - The great complaints that I have about Mr. Blandings are "a wife of love and a good partner". It is not necessary for a plot and it feels a place away from it and it is not as disturbed as it is presented.
