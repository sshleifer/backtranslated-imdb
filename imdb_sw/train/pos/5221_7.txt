I had no intention of looking at the Group. Andrew Lau co-described the trilogy hub of Infernal Issues but was expelled from The Flock and was replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller.I had the impression that Lau had made a good film but did not satisfy the research, therefore dismissed and recruited This is usually not working properly (let's remember the invasion). But suddenly it was better than I expected. It is not a good film but it's exciting and exciting. Developing character is very good and I would know the characters very well. For, the relationship between the two main characters is both natural and reliable. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring capable performances. , let us go to the wrong points. This is a very shocking thing (there was a time when it was offensive) was a lot of tricks of the version to give the movie more "view" and style. These feel out of place d their existence is arbitrary.Plus, I think The film should be more ambitious. Despite this, I recommend Group as a good thriller. It is not quite memorable, but it's entertaining.
