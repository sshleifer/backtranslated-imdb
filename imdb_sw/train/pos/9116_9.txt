The idea is the name of a very smart film that has a great language in the cheek to feel. But it is a trick that he does not know how to read it! Do these make a full comedy of a blow or there is something else going on. The short discussion of the film is not very delicate and this adds the film's capabilities. If all the sound was turned off from the film it is not worth anything from the film. Physical or art acts of display are very strong that takes the life of the story. I am a blessing and a blessing blessing is followed by shame. I first say this film as part of the "black" festival of the film. After watching the film I was attracted to the work. But I wondered what was coming? Where can someone else see this work? The most common organization of the art is not available here. You can see the motives in design from beginning to end. The use of African music style of everything seems to be planned and because. Character development is amazing. Finding it is the most powerful frame of the film; The characters are easily explained within 2 minutes of 6 minutes of the actual film. We need to see more of these types of films, in fact they need more help for the development of short film on board.
