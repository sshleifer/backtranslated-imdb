Halloween is the story of a young man who was not understood as a child. She takes her problems with her older sister, who kills her at the beginning of the film. This is the beginning of things that will come from Michael Myers. Donald Pleasance plays a doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different from him, a horrible thing. This evil cannot have content, and cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> After getting away from the institution, Myers follows her little sister. If he is killing him, there may be an end to this unintelligent boy. But he seems to have trouble completing his sister away if other people find a way. He can drive them while he is still looking for the girl he needs. There have been many awesome movies that involve young people being smitten by a fatal or horrible killer. But this has started all, sort of. If you think about it, many of these terrible movies we all remember are those who Freddy Kruger or Jason hunt around half of the girls. In fact, if it is not for Halloween, the characters did not want our dreams when we were children. The director of Halloween, John Carpenter, got a lot from the '50s' movies and unite everything he knew in one film that feared hell from many back in the late 70s. These films strengthened him as the director of watch and also jump to work on Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being beaten by a wounded killer. <br /> <br /> This film can be seen clich√© today, but back there there was not out there like this. Published from and rejected, but Halloween will always remain a terrible movie of the quintessential boy. It still gives them an opportunity to listen to music artist's music while we see another victim being expelled by this shade Michael Myers.
