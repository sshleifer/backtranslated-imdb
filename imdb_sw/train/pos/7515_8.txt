I know about Bettie Page for many for a year now. Special images of porn videos from him in the 1950s have become an iconic and still have an even layer. "Bettie Page" appears also well known in the world of hetero and remains very different today as it was then. So I watched this film with the skills to start with. These results were not broken. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was a great entertainment to see the entertainment of the movie's real figure like Irving Klaw, John Willie, and Bunny Yeager ?? they all think trailblazers today. Mary Harron did a great job to create an enabling environment for gender-based violence and hypocrisy in the 1950s as well as sexuality which, at today's standards, was not guilty of extreme violence. I especially liked the use of monochrome against color as a shorthand sight of emotional and spiritual condition Bettie found herself. <br /> <br /> I think that Gretchen Mol did a good job of presenting Bettie's behavior in all his innocence and all its naiveté. Bettie liked to look good, loved attention, did not see anything wrong with fraud, and enjoyed wearing "secret dress" for the camera. Physical sex and deep desires of all fetish infections were completely lost. To this day she still does not know "what was being discussed" on her pictures or the content of S & M. <br /> <br /> This is not to say she has not been dedicated or very easy to understand is that she cannot "get" about fetishism and never . No harm there. Bettie Page is just who he is. The film was very well done. The social status of the 1950s shown by Mrs Harron and written by him and Guinevere Turner makes me really happy the day and age I do. Hypocrisy and oppression with great ignorance about our sexuality as well as the terrible world. The film catches this and brings it joyfully as Bettie endures all of her infallible faith with her unchangeable naiveté. <br /> <br /> This film was slow but often hit all the points Mrs. Harron tried and hit them well. I would like to recommend this film even to those people who do not know who Bettie Page had and what effect had American culture. For those who have this interest, then this film must see it.
