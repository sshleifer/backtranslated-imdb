What is it with all of Europe (especially UK) comments here? All I need to say is that when I saw this film for the first time I was as 13 I thought it was good. Of course it is stupid. That's sure. You should see the movie Dr Strangelove and the Black Men to get all the jokes behind this film, but to come to the people, what would you expect to see? I can think of many films that are worse than this, and they were expensive for Hollwood films and real actors in them. Why it is important, Men in White are a very stupid shock of funny. And for all the stupid things that Britain has made for the last century, I have feared all negative views. We Americans ignorant as our stupid humor. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' for some of the true laughs that Europeans would like. HA!
