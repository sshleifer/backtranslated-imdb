The fey story of the Martian quest to destroy the world. (Things should be very serious on Mars.) Three troopers of the government examined the location of the UFO accident crash. Anything that comes in is buried under the ice on the Tracy Pond but there is a foot in the snow leading to a nearby dinner. <br /> <br /> Diner did not have customers since eleven o'clock that morning. Now there are a few bus passengers sitting around allowing permission to cross the bridge of weak structures. The bus driver insists that six passengers were in the bus, though he did not realize who it was. The problem is that there are SEVEN people now waiting for a return trip again. One of them is a stranger, but who? Both are suspected. There is an old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to do a small exercise. There is a sleeping businessman who must go to Boston (John Hoyt). Young couples in their honey days. (Implementation of husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, no one has seen anyone else. And even a couple accused. Married to a new minted husband: "I would swear to have a mole on your chin." The story continues through the dirt but very little - the phone ring for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns out - and nothing is taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a fun and fun game with a powerful revelation is very important. No "deep" is understandable. It is not a moral message about powders who pretend to be ordinary citizens. It's not any kind of warning, just a story of a story that blows and kisses. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the time it goes. It is amazing to see John Hoyt as a angry and patient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman Senator who made the assassination of Julius Caesar in the MGM version of Shakespeare. And here he is - with three weapons. Oops.
