Why do manufacturers not give you the opportunity to show all the junk on TV, why do not manufacturers give six positions of Degrees? Will you go to the video? I would like to see how it ends. Place one season on the video and sell it. I was a fan of Six Sixth and I was waiting to come back. I have set my record to delete all of the displays. Thank God for that reason. I only found that the show was removed and I was disappointed. I would have realized it would have been canceled, why not tell us? I thought the show was just to develop some detail in the characters. Writing was also good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite all the time. I am so sorry to see me going!
