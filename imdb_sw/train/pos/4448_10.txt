He saw this film yesterday for the first time and enjoyed it. I am a student writing screen and I like how these small characters intervened only when something important / weather happened in the area. I thought the discussion was very sharp and the basis of the story is rather surprising - for some time Barbara Stanwyck is engaged in friendship with his daughter's daughter; And to restore the passion to her husband who has not seen ten years; AND with a gun 'two shots and then one' she hook with his old Dutch shag Dutch (because she came out of the city first place!) ALL IN SAME! Most of the values ​​should be very angry when they see this flick behind 50. <br /> <br /> Love dress and movies and directly from the hip talk - just watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co make 'Bunny Hug' is the reason good to rent this film on DVD. One of the best films from that period I have seen for a long time.
