When I was a child, I loved the movie with Bill Ted. One night, Bogus's journey had grown and since it was at least 5 years since I saw it, I decided to enter. AND I HAVE ALL EVERYTHING! This film is still amazing after all ages. 'Wonderful wonder' is the best, but this begins the same. Indeed, some success is a little cheesy, but hey, this film is all cheesy in a cool way. Plus has the most cool features of Death ever in the movie! Conclude: Absolutely like an unfamiliar movie movie! The Best Way! STATION !!!
