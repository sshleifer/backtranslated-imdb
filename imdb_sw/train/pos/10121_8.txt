While it is not wild and out as some of the future films of Takashi Miike is a very good drama crime. The basic story is the story of the Japanese soldiers and the Chinese parents are trying to take down and come to the Chinese stick. The concerns are that his younger brother works as a lawyer for man and his group. The film is much more complicated than that with many problems that keep things interesting and distract from things from the central story. It's this problem and lose a way about an hour in a film that makes this under a good film. (It's very good) This is definitely seen especially if you don't mind no faster speed. The word of warning, violence when it happens is explosive and rough. There is also a picture of half of the sex image. If not your cup of tea, beware. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
