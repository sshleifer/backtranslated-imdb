He was delighted to watch this film on TCM and look at William Powell's little, (Philo Vance) playing the detective as he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". After 1930's William Powell played at the Philo Vance Festival and in this picture, the famous former actor Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) has one of the suspects in the case of murder / suicide where someone named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) found dead and Archer was in a room that was covered from inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) gave great responsibility and was a brother of Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt Heath) appeared in a very few of these Philo these Vance films and also gave good performance in "Robin Hood" and Errol Flynn. Remember every time, the little actor is likely to be a murderer. Enjoy the beautiful classic from the past.
