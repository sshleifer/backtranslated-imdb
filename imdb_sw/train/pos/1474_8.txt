I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival. Not as salacious as shown, this is a three-part document (each section is 50 minutes) in conjunction with a scientific Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zombi leads us on a journey through many ancient films, examining sexual themes, fantasy, values ​​and deaths. It was led by Sophie Fiennes, a descendant of many of the Fiennes (she is a sister to Ralph and Joseph actors). was beaten. Freudian and Lacani surveys can be very difficult to see the whole series at once you are distressed by the end of two and a half hours. It does not help to be helped with coffee and a bladder that has caused a discomfort for the last hour or more. My only true fact and this is that Zriers took films that were clearly filled with Freudian themes. He spends little time on Hitchcock movies by David Lynch, not the master of the trick. I would like to see him trying to support his theories by using various films, although that is just what I say I would like to see four and five parts and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor he had seen presenting the contents of the speech while engaging in real events from some films he discusses. So, for example, we see him on a motorboat towards Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock aircraft) or sitting under Bates Motel (from Psycho). That is not to say that his theories are no longer stirring. Even when I found myself agreeing with him, it obviously made me think more deeply about the film. What exactly is trying to accomplish.
