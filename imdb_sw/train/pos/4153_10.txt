this was a wonderful part. I saw an item from YouTube, and I vowed that you should show it on the TV, I would join and put it in order to watch. I looked at the look with my friend, who happens to be gay, and we both cried last. this was a true part of the well-written, of the heart of the banned love between two soldiers who, I felt, were actually (in the words of Coop) "Europeans". it is such a phenomenon that actually makes a Cold Survey of one of the most exciting and most exciting of the TV's livelihoods in CBS. I am trying to wait more events, and a new run of "Forever Blue" because I always look at it regularly.
