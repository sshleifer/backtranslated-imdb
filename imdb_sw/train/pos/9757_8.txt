Richard Willaims is the god of animation. He prevented leading the film to the producer. The final product is a very different film with a very sad story, but at some amazing time of animation (like Emery Hawkins' "Mjanja"). Joe Raposo's recurring song does not accept either. It was done with great screens so that VHS should show in all glory, let us hope for one day of a written DVD. It is still worth watching eye animation.
