To "Moving as Beckham" may not mean much to Americans who do not know much about other soccer (football), but for fans of English games, it is similar to "Hit it like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan." Any soccer player is dreaming of a soccer ball next to one player and inside the net for a goal, such as a star player David Beckham, such as a little Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), doing in Bend It film Like Beckham. Jess loves to play soccer games, a kind that is blocked by her traditional mother. However, during a play one day, a friend who was named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and asks her to try to travel, all girls' soccer teams. After satisfying the manager Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), he does a team, something he knows his mother will not accept. The movie is not about disobedience to parents, but rather the girl does what she wants to do, even if it faces a culture, not just parents. There is a sense of humor in all movies, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a girl. The movie takes a little time to clich√©, as a great soccer game is the same day as a sister Sister 'sister, but it does not come cheesy, but rather fun and light. Soccer work looks good, so sports fans will enjoy, and stories about girls growing up in a young world, a soccer world will encourage some viewers. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl tries to find herself and ask her parents at the same time, something that seems to be difficult.
