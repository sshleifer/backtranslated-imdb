Other viewers here seem to think this is a bad film. That's not true and just a little. It is a good quality and the trend goes on with the cleanliness of respect. I don't think there is something wrong with the Tarantino-esquire method of interactive stories. Perhaps it is my only tool of directors to try. I thought it had made the film more interesting. Maybe a few of the script needs to be enhanced, but that's about the only mistake I can get. Nestor Cantillana offers good performance like Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is stunning and the price of entry is the only one.
