A delightful, delightful piece, a little miniature that emerges in a fantastic human sequence that goes beyond just a screenshots. This small story of stability will hold you - if you do not have too much difficulty with various Spanish approaches starting from Mexico to Peruvian, and the use of the peninsular of more than Iberia's Marisa Paredes! Garcíadiego has completed a perfect achievement from the novel: even the great pastor García Márquez should be proud of his excellent work. And it hates Arturo Ripstein who has endeavored all the efforts in gem, ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so to touch ...... El Coronel - Fernando Luján - waiting to get his pension, while continuing to live in his own timber The sheep that live in the Colombia jungle (however, have been done elsewhere, SI in Colombia) and its cock crack with his wife (in the same order). And that's all. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more .... This movie is rhapsody. I must see this little piece of poetry again as soon as possible. It is worth about 8 out of 10, which is very high to my level. <br /> <br /> This is not a small business of Hollywood.
