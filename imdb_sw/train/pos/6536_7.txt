Let's say; Nancy Drew did not have too many books. It is in the same society as a babysitter club, a house of magic tree, Goosebumps, Secrets of ABC. In fact, it was one of the original stories of the form. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thinks, "good", has no internal conflict ever! and never change. Ned is very similar. Movie was realistic in that style and I must say, I loved it. It will never be a great movie, but it had the same nostalgic taste which books were made. It had only the right of my children (8 and 10.) There was no language near hate. I liked to push for the most conservative dress. Corky was a bit of anger. He was a little out of place at high school. I never knew why she was there first place.
