Damn, I have seen this film for at least 4 times right now and I haven't looked at it yet. These are beautiful and well with music that is both perfect and perfect. This movie is mind-blowing to me. <br /> <br /> CGIs are the worst IMHO, but all the pictures and the black and white feeling on it and the inside inside were just ... Only a perfect perfect mix of the film. The whole feeling about an unknown feeling, the plot is very good. However, the movie had little weakness, like.m. sometimes I thought the movie was a little too "slow", but not meant to interesting places for it, I really liked those. I have also been disappointed many times with a very complicated story, as when underground bunker as something of digicorps, where all their data is stored, and has these conversations with someone down there ... but that may also be me: D And the last may have been shown somehow more stressed, they should have made part of the memory-of-the-long-term memory of "sound" but again again without all these emotional feelings would have been good I have never stood looking at again and again. .
