The movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish society has been. It has a large number of characters and each character and each type represents a different category of person. No character is 100% good with different values ​​and heroes of all Indian movies and no character is 100% worse than all of them are just different. Movie is a perfect combination of emotions, game and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that produced some social questions. I would recommend all to see the film. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who closes the Hip-shaking parties to the newspaper but this is a story of how she becomes the journalist of the newspaper. But this is not all, then it shows how he could not live there and when he helped to save innocent children, how his voice was cruelly taken. He has even been fired. Then he could not find the work of a criminal author and he must do it again. Not only but a very large number of characters interact with the film and all give a different impression when watching the film. I would like to thank the director for making this beautiful film. Please do not lose.
