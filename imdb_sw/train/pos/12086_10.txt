The amazing thing of the family / comedy star MacClaine and Garr that enters the heart heart every time I see. It is highly recommended for all ages from children aged 9 to grannies. A favorite piece of the 1962 piece of touch. The story involves Garr who strives, his two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) are trying to reach the end without someone like the head of the household. "Families" leads west to take the legacy of a long forgotten family that has stopped Garr run down, ramshackle road side cafe out of the late 1940s. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is an executive of the old circus and card tricks, magic powder and jesters sense of humor ...... she likes to get children with her in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... What happens next is a good combination of "Projects for Lords" thrown along with the Cuban missile conflicts (with real TV news from the real event) and "spiritual" prank. This film includes, filofophones, religious questions, and gives a non-threatening view of the tragedy of October 1962 of Cuban missile conflicts. One end is left to the wonder of faith, family and found love. Oh, and music from the early 60's is very good! Suggested for FILM EXAMPLE 10 out of 10
