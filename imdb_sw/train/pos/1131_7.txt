This is a very fun movie. One of those you can sit and watch without checking if the plot gets more and more; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (his day hey), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All well-known, quality actors are doing as a sample of opera stars / producers. If you have ever looked at the soap opera and think, "Did the world come with this idea?", You will love this movie. I've seen it many times; and whenever I look at it, the more I love it, the more I realize how it worked well. Don't expect Oscar quality. This is a fun movie to please, not another attempt of art in search of "local man", etc.. Call, relax, and laugh.
