This is a good DVD to stand up! Eddie Izzard is a funniest man who I have seen in years. His system is hilarious and makes good discussions with others who have seen it. I strongly recommend this. Part about the history of Europe is slow, but the last joke in French is very good, because you don't say French to get it (though you do it, it's still hilarious). Also, parts that transvestite are quite good. The first event (about San Francisco) is not great, but it is the first time. Skip over those as you can. It's almost not worth checking. However, this is true, funny stand-up show that everyone must see. "I died then!"
