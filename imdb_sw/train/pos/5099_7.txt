The only reason I got this movie is that it is on the MISSER MISSER DVD and I recommend it to look at it even though you don't like it as the most popular film. We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as husband and friend. The film begins to light up completely, but it becomes more like Coop's first plans to use his daughter to expand the huge amount of money from his father-in-law but when meeting a girl and seeing the discipline she will be under her brother -in-law chooses to protect her. However, he has trouble sitting on the straight and narrow path and so this game grows. Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley can still steal the events they have. There is a little music here, and Shirley has only one song. However this is a fun and worth looking with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
