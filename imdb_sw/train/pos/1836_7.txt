Time To Hit! Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have! Yes, women and gentlemen? In Vipul Shah 'Waqt', perhaps we have seen the first hit this year. To enjoy all the important commercial sounds, 'Waqt' has all that takes for the movie to click with the Indian audience. It's a kinda film which makes the distributor feel happy and reflect his next visit to the phoren! In this Indian feeling, then we have a happy family (not always?). Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), a member-turn-milionaire (don't ask how! ... there is something about selling sports centers when delivering letters and all-powerful items - that give damn!), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a father doting to Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar needs to make a big decision about the human perspective on the roles of life. His love for Aditya though, leads to a moratorium on the big issue. However, during a period that will test his race over time, Ishwar has no alternative but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that a new problem may make him more confident about his life. But this assumption is only a problem, as the father-child victory increases and the flower continues to grow. You cannot be a scientist-rock to realize that such a story provides many interesting comedy opportunities and similar game. Therefore, before long it had a preliminary system of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and after a while it's going to your time of kerchief between Aby and Akki! Author Aatish Kapadia (also wrote Gujarati 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' which the film is based on) is doing a good job of keeping water stories. Discussions tend to vary frequently. It doesn't help that songs are seen as acne on the face of the youth and prosecuting. Obviously, several numbers can be completed. On the front of the direction, Vipul shows that he has a natural opportunity to tell the story. 'Waqt', with its initial 'Aankhen' efforts, can keep you interested in the end. For a personal note - the story of feeling is tad jerky for me. But testing from the impact of the audience, it was working for the hilt. Finally, 'Waqt' is about its exhibition that reaches the same level at the overall rate! Amitabh Bachchan is as loyal as always. Its energy looks and so is its age! Shefali holes in good performance efficiency and match stars in every step. Boman and Rajpal bring the house down to their history. Priyanka has little to do than fulfilling the role of the heroine revelation. At all times it decreases however, 'Waqt' is a Akshay car. I've kept Akki as good as the role is good. Give in 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and he is wonderful, but in 'Bewafaa' he is very bad. Here, Akki probably is good. If it is his comic or emotional time, he is almost perfect. There is also a stage for his fans! Interestingly, his initial efforts were in 'Aankhen'- and the director with Big B on his side! 'Waqt' is not available for a memorable movie. It's not one that will appear in the best films of our industry. But it is one for people. And when the industry is waiting for the fastest, 'Waqt' can only make a trick! Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia- This is the second of Akshay Kumar film series after 'Bewafaa', which he makes on stage at peak! <br /> <br /> Rating - *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Good April 22, 2005
