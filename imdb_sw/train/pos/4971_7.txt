This is a comedy absurdist dark from Belgium. Shot perfectly in white and white colors, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Dog's Man) is in good form as Roger, angry, father obsessive of a family in a small, rich mining town of Belgium. Roger is a photographer who, with his little daughter Luise, visits road accidents to take pictures. He is also involved in winning the car by entering the contest where the candidate needs to break the record - and decides that his son, Michel, should try to break the record of the walk through the door - even employing more coach to teach him. Michel is dressed as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'Cinema Lies', where she tells mistakes in the film. Luise is friendly and close to the Felix neighbor, a fan of pigeons. Roger is a bad figure if he pushed Michel right on the limit during a record attempt, which almost results in his death. Interspersed in the film is Magritte-like surreal pictures. It is unpleasant to be alive and fits your time.
