Andy Goldsworthy is the master of taoist of the first order, describing the Way through its modern ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change are his primary work. I bought his first book several years ago and my family has been shocked many times. It was a treat to know the individual artist through this film, he is like a patient and gentle as you would expect, and he has amazing things to say about the natural world, which is more commonly described by his ability to constantly speak in words. . He is like many children who play in big outdoors only (if they don't do it again), doing things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before removing them. Mr. Goldsworthy was given a gift and a message to expand that kind of play in order to create a beautiful natural vision, and open our eyes regularly regularly with new ways. And always with great respect, thanks and humor to walk, and wondering the monk.
