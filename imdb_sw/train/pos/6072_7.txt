Branagh and Fishburne provides the best displays in this version of the classic Shakespeare. Branagh has Iago better than I saw a character playing on the film or on stage. Others may say this film is more than Iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, Othello's first black in the history of the film with amazing, provides powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Moor's Venice can be one of its best. The one problem I have with this film, is the easiest to remove important events. Desdemona's character is given much less than he plays. In this film, he can also be completely added. One of the worst cuts in Branagh in this film, was the removal of talks between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona cannot be an innocent child shown as in this film. There were a number of withdrawal that harms the trust of this film. However, if you haven't read playing, or seen the Othello movie version before, I recommend this movie. Stories, cut or not, are still very amazing. Acting, as mentioned earlier, is very good. If some of the most important events were added, and Desdemona's behavior has become more important, this will be a great movie. As it stands, it is still a preliminary version of the original. I give the recommendations below.
