Sopranos was perhaps the end of the show for the air in the 90s. Her sadness was her on, it was the best show on HBO if not on TV, not everything was interpreted for you in you had to think, it was brilliant. The cast was better. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a good actor and played his good character, as well as others. Each character had a mistake that made them real and allowed viewers to connect with them and that's one reason it lasted for a long time. The last period was good, I do not know how to take many different things can be mentioned by the last id if you think that the tony did not die but the meadow came in and stayed with them and that the blackout was just for doubt. Tony should go to the attempt to deal with that hope is not dead how I feel ... Long live Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
