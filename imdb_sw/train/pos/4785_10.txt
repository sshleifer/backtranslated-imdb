[No observers] <br /> <br /> Become a film of David Lynch, someone may have an idea that it shows that the enigmatic mind of it as many of its featured films. But it is a straightforward story as a fascinating head. It is not the exception of Lynchian's common misunderstanding that happens after watching i.e. Lost Highway. It's a simple film but it's really good film. That's from a creative and entertaining feature. It's creative because it is not Lynch. But maybe that's Lynch. He likes to mislead our ideas and therefore puts together a film that may seem very common and far from Lynch himself. Being a very good director, he can just make a film like this to beat his ordinary listeners because he knows what they expect but they don't get. That would be a fraud. <br /> <br /> The film's speed is slow. I would like to say the speed of rainy rice ... Do not expect orgy of action, but the film is realistic for those who go with the flow of the film. Look carefully at these small details that Lynch plot in the movies for our entertainment. Check out the great movies that make this film live. And listen to the logo of the Artists and the main theme that enhances the Iowa and Wisconsin themes displayed on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth puts in one of his best shows in this film, making him one of the most popular men who have been shown on the film. They don't say anything to express their feelings and thoughts. His courage only shines through him and his acting made him a Oscar. Do I need to be weak in this film? He was diagnosed with cancer and found himself after this film was completed. Such knowledge puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more than a cult to Farnsworth. All of the above creates a very good image for all kinds of people who like the film should be done. One can ask for meetings that are not obvious and are a bit but does not destroy the overall picture, that is a memorable image of motion. 9/10.
