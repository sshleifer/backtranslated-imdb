I do not give a movie or show ten very often but this show touched the confidence in no way another show has. I saw the whole series on mysoju.com and I think the premise looks so interesting so I saw a look. I had no desire in what I saw; I was transferred. This story sits on the side of the tender as the main characters take us to events. Sumire No, played carefully with Koyuki, shows us the human condition if he wants to put problems from being displayed. No one likes to put their soul out in front of a partner. So instead it causes man, played with the fruits of Matsumoto June, as a pet. The second is like any other creature we think about the animal. Differences; he can take revenge in the same way, after Momo is a person, not a dog. When used as an animal, it is affected by how the dog can respond. He spends time with his new partner, Momo gets jealous. It is when he knows that his animal is not just an animal that the sexual tension between two begins to be thick - Momo is a prodigy of dance. His perspective is slightly modified when we begin to get a glimpse into his own ideas. Matsumoto motivates us to see a character that is very thin at first, in two directions we see him as a player, with three dimensions of direction when we see him begin to fall to his master as a man, not like a dog. In my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop. Plus Matsumoto has Momo and the same pity you are about to start to want to be too. Nor do they want to reflect on the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name she gives if one would call their new puppy name) says? we all know this could not last. See this show with a clear mind, it is worth it.
