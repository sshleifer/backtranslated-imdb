This is a good music and non-timely and one of my beloved singers (Gershwin) and a beautiful atmosphere of 'Parisien' which offers many movie charms, but with the story of stories .. well not really there. Or at least, it is not very active. Acting is not too soft and Caron. But I liked some discussion, I liked the Seine area, I liked the character played by Levant, color; and play really, which is very good. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 looks on the dot.
