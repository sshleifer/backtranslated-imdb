That beauty film is hard to describe. Perhaps it is a lack of an improper discussion, or maybe it's just a stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's fun to watch this film again and again. I've never seen another Indian movie that is approaching, and a few from any country oppose its entirety.
