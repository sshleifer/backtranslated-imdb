"Fear" is a form of criminal act by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in leading roles. Alex (played with Macy) is someone who kills people for survival. But now he suffers from depression and that's why he sees a specialist. That's where you meet Sarah (Neve Campbell) and fall in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to stop the family business (murder), but they do not have now how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a boy when a midlife crisis, facing constant problems: fall in love with a beautiful girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Good performances of stripes. Macy is better as Alex sad. I had great prospects for this and it was a good movie but it doesn't give up. The story was rather flat and beaten. <br /> <br /> 7/10
