Interestingly, amazing, hitting riveting like Flamenco itself, the film is just amazing. Installed to the music of Bizet. The original music is written and used by one of the tribal class members, the leading member of the modern Flamenco style, Paco de Lucia who plays the singer with the same name. Artist Flamenco and player choreographer Antonio Gades co / wrote script with choreographed this fabulous version of the celebration Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. He has a protagonist Antonio, a well-known choreographer who works to restore Carmen's story in Flamenco's dance style and singing with a hand-blowing sound and has a very high rate of interest in an interesting audience. <Br /> <br /> Cristina Hoyos a talented and gracious person whose technical skills resemble the prestigious skill of his play shines in the role of helping. Hoyos was the first player of the Gades company for twenty years (1968-1988) and was the main character of three films that Carlos Saura made of three Gades exhibitions: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985). The famous player Laura del Sol is a young player named Carmen who Antony sees from first to see another Carmen, who had no damage to two Frenchmen, author Prosper Mérimée in her very famous novella written in 1846 which urged Opera-Comique's famous George Bizet version from 1875. <br /> <br /> Like in opera and in the novel, Carmen in the Saura film is important and deadly, the end of fatale women who should be free on anything else. He could not tolerate the human love of man and would prefer to die by submission. There are 50 films of the story and opera on the screen, and as much as they are, they all have a horrible end. The Saura / Gades film is unique as the most physical and realistic Spanish. I loved it and the first time I saw it more than twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back. It is highly recommended.
