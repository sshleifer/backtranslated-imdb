This movie is probably very bad, but it's very fun. Bad patterns and poor patterns strengthen the hystericalness of the film. Twins are very funny in their duties of Conanesque. If you go to this film you expect the first Conan or Excalibur, than you would like. If you look at a good time and accept it as good, dumb happiness will have a good time. Look at the place where they are trying to embed the brothers, its funniest area in the film. I would like the Mystery of Secret 3000 Science would do this!
