In this small film we have some wonderful characters but a very unknown plot. It is really good to watch because Singleton does a great job in presenting esoteric conflicts and personal relationships. This leads the viewer to forget the originality that has never been considered. In fact what we have here is just a few of the possibilities and discrimination placed on cellulodi at a much higher level than the soap. Certainly not a comprehensive movie (even if it wants to be), but it's better than an average college movie.
