If anyone is old enough to know, South Africa has long suffered under brutal, discrimination discrimination, which has defeated a few people. One of the anti-apartheid activists was famous Steve Biko, who was killed in prison. Following the murder, journalist Donald Woods wanted to get Biko's message in the world. <br /> In "Freedom of Crying", Woods (Kevin Kline) are Biko's friends (Denzel Washington) before being arrested for prosecution. When Woods are trying to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin to live under threat of assault, and eventually they are forced to flee the country. The last part of the stomach-wrenchingly shows the police firing over the protesters. <br /> <br /> As one of the two movies (with "World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" looks out as perhaps the best work ever for all involved.
