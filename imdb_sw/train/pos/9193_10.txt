It holds the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in U.S) but it can still be found even if you haven't read the manga. It is a different kind of tail, showing a strong and free woman who hurts like everyone else. However, because of its external forces, she is afraid to express her inner feelings and so let those around her hurt her for their good opinion. The only person who speaks the truth and who can be easily and is his new animal ... man ... Momo. If you want something different from the typical things that make up and the wonderful things of J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) characters / resses then this is definitely a series of watch ...
