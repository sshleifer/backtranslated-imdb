I loved this movie I remember there was one very well done on this film where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lying on his cigarette smoker and then begins to watch that Ramones is in the room and he sings "I Want You" ... A lot of very cool. It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes I will agree that the end is a way-way up and very high fetched ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun this is a very fun movie. It is sex, the Pot and Rock n Rocll forever! I read that the cheapest price was a band that had previously had a star in this. But I don't know if this is true or not
