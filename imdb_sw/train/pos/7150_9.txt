What a great movie! This is so remember the beautiful movies of the Disney family of the 60's and 70s. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite fun. Children's stars were only; professionals, quality of executives. I am very impressed with the quality of this film. Sigourney Weaver was a total of purity * sounded here * running a prison camp for boys walking. Siobhan Fallon was as wonderful as the mother of the stars. I have not explained the story here because there is no small step to do it again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was wonderful and the quality of acting was very good! This work reminds you of what it is like to be a child, without going to any sugar or worse. The deleted events set in the DVD version were better off deleted. They were very harsh for this film and they could be taken very much from them. When misuse proven in the finished product, it was not more clearly shown at a certain level. It was best that way. This was the most interesting movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Get 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
