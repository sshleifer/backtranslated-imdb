Sandra is trying to appeal to the world of independence and sometimes with a strong search for the American pop culture for those who do not see at all. , trying to express his thoughts when all these people seem to want to be "Shashonna," the same Madonna striker, and yet, with Shashonna playing dance dances that resemble those from "like the Virgin," there is nothing to say about enjoying it. The situation in the club in the movie is more dry than the bone.The wonderful place of capture is the person of the rotund from the audience to help Shashonna out of his pants.

REALITY." <br /> <br /> Finally, he cries for a change in the development of the American Community by opening the discs of the disco Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and announcing, "Finally everyone will be happy!"

Before you know, two of you will have a Sandra barbs business and combine the spirit out of everyone else.
