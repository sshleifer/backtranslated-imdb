I'm from Romania I'll try to speak in English. All I want to say about this movie is that it will have to be my number all the time. See above 30 times and you will see it for many years now. It has a lot of things that I like in the film, it really touches me. It shows a lot of things that love love and questions about love and truth, and true things that are relevant to different people. So it happens that for me this is more important, the love, the human soul, he is in, and this I see in this film. Perhaps for me it is more than a motion picture, it is evidence in my mind that it can exist and that you do better at all you live with your soul. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi, but .. what if it is. What if all the crime was lost and the economy would fall, would you fall? We could be concerned about other issues and my mind is that, in your death bed, the biggest thing you remember, not wealth, not adventure, not the countries you visit and people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and hope that after death, all will be a perfect god and people will be better and more worthy. WATCH this MOVIE and maybe it will lead you into your life as it was to me :) Jump from Romania
