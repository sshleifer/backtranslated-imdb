In the west of Hollywood those hands that were bad when they arrived in the city, they had a great deal. After driving all the way was a private business back the day before the road reached all parts of the United States. <br /> <br /> The attackers who worked with the boss boss Gil Favor as played by Eric Fleming were not different. But Fleming was a man of all business, had a job to do and employ top employees to do so. The long time of Rawhide and the fact that they often stayed with them for the most part, we should know all the wounds at some point. A particular story of the story took into account all, though the bulk had characteristic of Fleming and Clint Eastwood character of Rowdy Yates, boy number 2 and cow. Clint Eastwood picture west was created by Rawhide, It is a shame that these are not displayed more often. Probably because they were done in black and white. If this was a reflection of NBC, this would have been made in color like Bonanza and have been running as often as it shows. We would see a lot more of the person who was the story of the argument. Surprisingly it is Eric Fleming who came out of the show before being closed to make the film. He made a few of them and he hoped the show would give him the name of an amazing movie. Unfortunately he was killed in the filming film film, stepped into the river. If he lived he could be named as Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took as the election boss in the last season and then the show completed its run. And she actually became the icon she is today and not just in the western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it. No frills in this, these were doing only cowboys to work and fight things and any situations were beaten in each year. <br /> <br /> They don't make a television series like this again. What a pity.
