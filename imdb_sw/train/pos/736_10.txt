For any punk rocker, this is a movie that made Ramones the home name back in early 1980s (when it was first seen at the premium cable centers). This was one of the first and most beautiful American movies of the Punk Rock, and the ethnic state of worship there on top with Rocky Horror Picture Show. At first the manufacturers wanted Trick Cheap as a star, but the release of "Live in Budakon" album had just made them superstars and also fire something that was in the budget under the movie. Very good luck for Ramones who were looking to get rid of the ground under the rock of the punk and on the common market (which sadly did not happen until after the bombs were destroyed). Band, Dee Dee especially, did not like the film for 80 years but fans liked it every time and could read many movies while waiting for Ramones to show. This film, like many religious people, is a fun and stupid widgets of classic Ramones in their heyday. Don't expect more, you won't get it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. Another of Allan Arkush's modern line is getting Crazy, featuring Lee Ving from the hard band of hardk hardcore Panic.
