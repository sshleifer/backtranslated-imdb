GOJOE takes a little to be used for the first time, but the final result is very satisfying. The story, about a murdered samurai who wants to free himself by resisting the powerful samurai, but dangerous, is more valuable than the hour. There is a lot of dangers here, from the physical life to the salvation of the soul. The movie can be seen similar to the other of the anime-inspired film Samurai first time, but finally opening up in a more mature / adult area soon. Do not miss. GOJOE is one of Samurai movies coming soon after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for more detailed reviews of movies and films of other foreign films)
