This is very serious, hitting hard, even a cruel film about the rest of the death line that goes awry. It's a black and white photography making it not being dated. Mickey Rooney is as good as a trend, but not surprising. One of the first movies shows the psychological destruction of the death line. It is also quite poignant.
