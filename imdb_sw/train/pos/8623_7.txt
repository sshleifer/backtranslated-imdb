DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - but it is still an interesting film that deals with suicide and is the cause and values. Those looking for fashion, or exploitation in NEKROMANTIK film or SCHRAMM may be disappointed. DER TODESKING is certainly a film "house art", so those who need stories to describe, do not need to pray ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is a "part" of every week that refers to an amazing letter that causes people suicide, and instant deaths of slow deaths ... There are some very beautiful scenes and stimulating ideas, including someone who talks about "problems" with his wife, and concert killings (which unfortunately lost some the "authority" to me, because I was very busy laughing at the check port of SCORPIONS on stage ...). But significantly - this is another good time (the area that shows the different angles of the great bridge is particularly good - especially if you understand the importance of the area, and that the names shown are for people who have committed suicide by jumping from the bridge ...) , sometimes confused, sometimes miserable (SHE WOLF's SS rose is pretty amusing), sometimes smoked (I saw the scene of a guy talking to a girl in the garden about his wife particularly effective) film that is more than "experience" then just entertainment, as many of these films "art" mean that. Still, I did not find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and it would put it to the lowest and NEKROMANTIK 2 on the side of my “fun” personal level. Certainly worth checking for any of Buttgereit or “art” fan fan. If you give this type of film - look at the GROUP CLUB - in my opinion The best / awesome gallery I have seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
