I think every time I see one of these old movies from the 80s they put me on a simple time, no matter how they look today. This movie is good. I remember seeing as a little child and I think it's the biggest movie ever. It has all the brave characters who the little cowboy wants to be. Now as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I know what's going on. I got one thing. How many people can move to Houston and talk to Sissy, get married, get into the trailer, and fall out, cheat, and have a dead uncle, then go back together, for a month? Only in America.
