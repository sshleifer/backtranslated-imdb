Okay, so the plot is on the ground. Yes, alike, so there is a song that was randomly and / or dance (for example, Adam's Festival and the action of Henri's action). And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know ... act. But somehow, 'An American In Paris' can come all the way as a testing music, largely on the basis of the amazing talent of playing for Gene Kelly and choreography, and trucks The trucks seem to be inserting into each area with Caron. (He needs, because he seems to have a problem ... and photographing.) <br /> <br /> The number made by a technically frightened music in this music is a 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film. It's done with beauty, with Kelly and Caron's dance for beauty. But my favorite number should be the character of Kelly's singing 'I Got Rhythm' and a group of French school children, then broke into a form of American dance. It comes out only to verify how you don't need special effects when you have found a real talent *. It is not at the 'classics' and' Singin 'level in the rain', but it's good on top yet. Value check!
