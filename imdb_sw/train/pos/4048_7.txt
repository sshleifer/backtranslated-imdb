Rohmer emerges from his typical French middle class describing this game of costume about the problems of the aristocrat woman during the French revolution. What's more interesting about "La Anglaise ..." (far from the story itself) is a fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has succeeded. Images are decorated with numbers also make them look like baroque pictures. At some point you cannot tell the truth if you watch a film or a series of pictures in Louvre Musseum. Each shot is like a piece of art. <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> ---- br> <br /> <br /> -------------- - <br> /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - ------------------
