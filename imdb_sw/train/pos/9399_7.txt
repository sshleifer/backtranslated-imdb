This is the film I saw when it happened first, and which I have seen a few times over the years. It always enjoys. One thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it skewers work with the same capitalists. Sid just appears out of the classic struggle, although he is responsible for it. Display infections: do not read more if you haven't seen films <br /> <br /> This is fantasy, though it is presented correctly. Ask yourself: Is it? Can someone help her more weight in one string of fabric? It could reduce almost any help. <br /> <br /> Also, during the horn, Sid uses garbage can cover as a knight shield. A wonderful example. One day, I will get this on DVD.
