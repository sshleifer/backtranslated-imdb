I lost this film for the first time many years ago, and I really enjoyed it. Recently, hearing the incredible need of retrieving some films-way that I have enjoyed so much in my life, I have decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I am glad I did, as I found out that even during the time it does not shine the film. The story is about a young girl (Erendira, played with surprise and Claudia O'hana - somehow she resembles Winona Ryder!) Who accidentally burned her grandmother's house after the grandmother, played for fraud with Irene Papas, giving her a girl's life of adultery on the road to pay damages. <br /> <br /> Watch it immediately interesting and compelling - though, to encourage the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is not easily available for free sex free content. This story deals with more of a partnership between a girl and her grandmother, and other characters of different colors who are communicating with them on their journey - which, by the way, is located in a rough and unstable area of ​​Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The film is very atmosphere, designed with the power and the expected quality of dreams. Sometimes bordering with wonder, but not for sure, say, the film of David Lynch. It is also important to mention that the film is very common in nature, read comments from past viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Many times back to hear the sound of the only accordion, silence and pride, and just add a voice right of music to show the Mexican environment. Exhibits in rural areas, most of them are in the desert, are very strange. <br /> <br /> The film goes at a good speed, not too fast and not too slow, and after every situation I felt I had it back to the tape and play again, just because it makes you want to do it. For me, it's really a compelling thing. <br /> <br /> Hope you will see the film in the Spanish language version, and the subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school with the university, and I was glad to be able to understand a lot of conversations. For example: "El mans are no big tan like pensaba." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is, a small world.) This video somehow reminds me of an obstacle on an old vintage wine bottle, which, on the drink, is even satisfactory, however, is left with some sadness to realize that there is no more bottle like this.
