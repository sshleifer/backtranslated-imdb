This film has an open story, which is unusual for music music. "Pati", "Phantom of Opera", and other songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber may be considered to be romantic, using the works of Scripture as their system. The character of the story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) affects the basis of human relations, especially the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was the basis of the "fairytale", it is really fantasy of 'baby' for Indonesian adults. The dance system is not perfect, but the songs represent how the Indians show themselves. I see that the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of playing, without the fact that the development of the dance of Indonesia tends to more west. The dance process is seen in a way that does not relate to songs and / or music. However, I still like this film and look at it as a new wave of Indonesian film that I hope to improve in the future.
