A good and compelling player about the hunting of the ruthless Russian killer Andrea Chikatilo. The good performance from Stephen Rea as an investigator for observation surveys, who finds a major obstacle to its development is the Russian government, particularly the Communist party members who want to maintain a closed community. The film has a basic headline on the decline of the Communist community, and the progress in the hunt for the killer has emerged and developed in social and political change in Russia, which is used below. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by two views of Rea's head (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are polarized first, and Sutherland 'high' in the system look down, and Rea 'down' down, look up. However, do they have a common reason? catch the usual killer. In the film the relationship between the two continues, and the tension reduces the stage to the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland are mutual, the assassin is taken, and Glasnost comes for instance. Excellent features. More credit goes to Sutherland's performance, which is good and compassionate, Jeffrey DeMunn as a killer who we despise but cannot hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is quite persuasive as a psychologist who threatens his reputation to help .
