I know I like this film, and I do it in many places, but as others said, it's a little tooth. I have also got a strong hormone of all male workers to be something that is offensive. It is no wonder they started to scream and wail during the months too. I also must say that in general, the movie leaves me cold. It is a very destructive situation that drives the film. On the side side effects are substantial (rather than monster's cartoon), whether it is harmful, money, clothing and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this film, I don't think it would be popular if it was / it. The second half of the movie takes a steam as soon as we start exploring the "Krell" memory. As often as I have seen this movie, Krell still leaves me to stretch my head like who exactly or who. According to what was produced then, instead of "This Island of the Island," a non-stop planet is more than the Sci-Fi movie of the time. The color printing also adds to its happiness. Certainly classic for its own right, wrong with all, and deservedly so.
