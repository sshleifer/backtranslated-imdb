When I think of the return of Jedi I think epic. Yeah Ewoks were there and what? They are interesting to add film (not to mention it is similar to Vietcong who were also able to take down army advanced technology and primitive actions). Jedi is more obvious and then all the movies. King Palpatine (depicted by the Ian McDiarmid actress) was the best part of the movie. Palpatine is bad and bad, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking about Darth Vader, an amazing end to this romantic character. Vader is a modern day of the Greek catastrophe and I think people can now understand and appreciate this after Sith's revenge. His redemption at the end was moving and bringing your joy and happiness. The best part is really special effects. It's amazing how the film from the early eight years can still stand the test of time and its graphics. Jabba's exhibition (Leia looks amazing at the same iron pottery) and of course the three epic battles battle at the end are still wondering. In every comprehensive plot of Jedi and emotional time (especially between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) with a special impressive effect is the end of fitting for one of the beloved franchise in the history of the cinema.
