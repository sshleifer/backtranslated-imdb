Red Rain ... what else can I say, the head says itself. But I think all participants took well. Movie had a good story. I liked it! Since I watched the film, I have been stuck in eight years, and I have only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and was taking all his music songs, and Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his hand. Critics say it is a drama but I think it's more love. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, actually acted like himself. I am so happy to see this movie. The Purple Rain song, the beauty of beauty, had a heart of heart. I cried more than once.
