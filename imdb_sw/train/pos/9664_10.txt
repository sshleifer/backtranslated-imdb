Bette Midler reflects her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am so surprised that I hit and saw whenever I wanted. He has what it takes to keep the audience in prison. His voice is as good as it was and it will be interesting to you. The brightness of the show was singing to her "Stay With Me" from her movie 1979 "The Rose". You can feel the feeling in the song and you will have to have a gun. The show will leave you and ask you to go out and rent a movie Bette Midler or go around the music store and buy one of Bette Midler's album.
