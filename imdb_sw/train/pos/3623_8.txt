Disney can only have something here. First, they had "Remember Titans" by Denzel, a story about reality involving sports and a small town in the middle of America. Now, for Quaid and The Rookie ... yet another story of games derived from reality. All these movies are going to cause tears, and both are smiling and feeling warm after seeing. My wife and I found The Rookie and we expected to be good to feel the kind of film. We were not allowed, when asked if we would like to buy this on DVD when it comes out, it had no brainer. Exactly quite.
