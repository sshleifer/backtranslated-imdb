Amazing documents. See it on the original air and DVD rarely in the last few years. I was surprised that it was not even selected for Best Oscar Documentary for 2002, that year was released. No other document even approaches. It was on TV recently for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the "where now" end, unless I have taken the tony now it works for the hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism on films made from a few on this list. I can't see how this can be done each different. They had less than 6 months to meet this and get air. The DVD has more material and background. <br /> <br /> I wonder that according to IMDb.com, the brothers had no projects in four years since. What have they done?
