I just got the IMDb and I searched for this film and I was moved around with tears in the opinion of all the people who saw this film as I did during 6 or 1967 years. I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was a Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for next year. I burst into tears when the boy turned to Eagle and always wanted to see the film again. When we got home we had chicken lunch and I got the bone I wanted and I think who I wanted to be? My father said 'I want you to want to be Eagle' and in fact we all know that wishes are being broken if someone thinks more tears and a little hate until today because he can't fly away ...
