Kurosawa, clean in color, losses see its unusual landscapes of reality and view of reality and provide you with trouble to take into Tokyo. Allergy puts in a style which, in my opinion, its antithesis - that is, I feel like Kurosawa wanted to make an image of Ozu. You were very low, unable to be born, this movie is a rare dud in this body of the best working writers. When Ikiru, when it was common and humble, was still interesting and very interesting, and when the Lost Dog showed the homosexual and the social poverty of Japan without too much burden or humiliation, making desu ka den has all the trouble that one can expect and content, without any features of the original image of Kurosawa. Show, this is not a film that Kurosawa should be judged by.
