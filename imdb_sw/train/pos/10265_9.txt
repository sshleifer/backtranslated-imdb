A special moment about a woman who is confused (Lindsay Crouse) who is responsible for men with strong men. Joe Mantegna gives the performance of Oscar-caliber as a group player. Surprisingly at first time, as Mantegna shows touch "string" of its con games. The text of the story reveals the future later, but it still looks like a unique image of the innocent found in the dark world. Certainly worth the shot.
