This is the second movie of life and times of ultra hung stars, John Curtis Estes, known as John Holmes. Boogie's light also depends on her life. Maybe one day someone will make movies on Tommy Byron's life instead. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story has not been told properly. There are many tips and rules that are more flexible and more flexible than Wonderland, and the director is not available to criminal cases to go with any kind of gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is (and there is no prosthesis this time around, unlike Boogie Nights), and he is much better than Holmes monster. The administrator does not identify one suitable person in the cast. The President, the lowest percentage, and his wife, and the police do not have much in the way of praise. The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton "lose". Having said all of this, anyone interested in the side of the sleaziest business of porn in the 1980s or real crime should not lose.
