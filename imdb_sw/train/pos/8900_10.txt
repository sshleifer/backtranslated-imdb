This is the amazing monster's ethnic flick from 50 years! I just love the look of 50 as a whole as cars and music. Otherwise, I like how blob is shown. I love when everyone is in fear of the night of fear, and the blob comes and destroys the party. Another thing I like about it is that it all happens in one night, like Halloween II. When Steve and Jane do, they see meteor falling from space. Inside the meteor is blob. Every time a blob uses someone, it grows big and big. They try to convince people of the city about a blobby monster, but nobody believes until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
