This movie ran quite close to the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a great movie ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know it! LOL) I agree that I have killed my first video tape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version as much as possible! This movie has many interesting lines are sad! I am ashamed to say that I know the song of the background and forward! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch to die, and he should win the best award for a supportive agent, but Oscars was not ready for this! This is a random film that includes cooked Cops, Breast, Chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (It is 70 and I can say everyone knows some kind of military art). I think this movie should be restored and displayed one night in the middle of the marathon in local movies!
