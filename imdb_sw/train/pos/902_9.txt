I thought this movie was really true because, in India's movies today, all you see is skin, music, and doing bad ... in this film, you can see some traditional, tribal, and at least some beauty ... though part some were too small, what do I think? that's what the Indian movie is about! after watching this film, at least you can't get a headache from all the music that has been featured on, or any violence, it's just true, it teaches about love, and of course to take care of someone you love in all life ... Imagine it is an amazing movie. .. Children can look at it, and adults will enjoy the humility that was well known to India ... until all these rapes, basketball and leather services have become part of it.
