wow! this is a good movie! Acting was not quite good, but if you look at some time in the film, rewind, and look again, it's a skill! The person at the beginning of the film walks with his suit against three. WOW! I've never expected that. Then sets the coke in the suit and comes off. I bet that a man smoking against those three was one of his men who sold drugs later. And a professional says: '' A good shade, I need your pair '' '' 'if you think you can pick them up ..' 'just a brilliant! And fighting is the best I saw in time. Check out the second boy takes down after the head of the first boy against the table. WHAT HIT! And in the middle of the film, one man in the car was shot once, then 3 boys fell, he is very good for the goal. It takes a lot of money to hire these people like him. The last was brilliant, it was very exciting that the cahill james goes 5 minutes down and down the stairs and hit jason peters after his move. Jason Peters falls down, and comes back when he is dead! I can't say in more words how this movie is beautiful!
