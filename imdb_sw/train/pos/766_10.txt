This started to be a film about Bronx's street culture in New York. What has been accomplished is to produce a new culture and a way of life, for the American youth. What other movie has made this except rebellion without reason? One of the most important movies at all times. Things are simple yet interesting. Stories are not available, young people try to succeed against all obstacles. However the story is reliable and never available. The characters are true, the city host, would know them as neighbors. The story is entertaining, and comes a satisfactory end. Buy this for your permanent collection. It is a piece of American history.
