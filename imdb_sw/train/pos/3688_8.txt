A fun film headed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also gives us some of the chief executives of our time, not only from France but from anywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite groups: <br /> <br /> The 14th carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also feel his life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: probably was not the best way to start this movie than this part in a romantic Paris. <br>> <br /> Loin du 16ème: Paris photo that we are well known for the protests in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends a lot of time caring for someone else's baby (she is a nanny) than herself. The Latin text: very happy to see Gérard Depardieu as "tenancier de bar" and Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara to discuss their divorce. <br /> <br /> Eiffel visits: don't tell you you didn't like those mimes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: treat such see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who makes high contact (no) with a girl in Metro. Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is good. Sagnier of Ludivine also. <br /> <br /> I have spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me return! <br /> <br /> Appear in Barcelona (another city), at Verdi, March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> 84/100 (* **)
