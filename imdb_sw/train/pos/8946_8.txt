This story is impossible for the female witch to seek man, in the world of death. Its "society" is clear among its members, but it conceals its magic from mankind. Hmmmm ... this begins to hear. LOL. It's not your usual movie. The greatest exhibition of "campy" by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs causes things to be avoided. Kim Novak is always pleased on the screen, but I've got his pairing with James Stewart odd (but not bad for the story). <br /> <br /> With a renewed preference in all magic and dark things, this film deserves to be found and re-discovered by old and new audiences ... IT'S A HOOT!
