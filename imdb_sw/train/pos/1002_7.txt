Only two words .... seven years are different? It is not possible to force the power of connecting non-dynamic films! As mentioned, telemovie's low status of the 13th GANTRY ROW budget is a factor to reduce in its small appeal. Having said that even though this is not worthy - either as entertainment or as fear comes from the se. True, the plot on its basis is to work again of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - just not very frightening. More biased cases! Gibney may have a more valuable feeling if he had said Halifax - to investigate several seemingly unrelated killings with "house" as the main suspect. Script is better than average and the maximum production level. It just fails to share the viewer especially in critical time. When you choose the DVD to $ 3.95 last week in my favorite video shop, I can't be afraid of use. $ 10.95 will be the best price of the film. Just not expect fireworks!
