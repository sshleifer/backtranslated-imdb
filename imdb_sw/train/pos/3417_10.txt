Before seeing this, I was removed by this issue, but this is not your usual victory over the story of trouble. Although this is technically on children of Tibetan blind children going to Mt. Everest, there is much more. This movie shows the most powerful features, which often conflict with two blind adults leading children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is a American player who is blind and Sabriye is a blind German professional who started school in Lhasa Tibet. Both are unique in their own way, but they disagree on what will build faith in children. Erik wants them to attend the meeting when Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a good and happy time. Light is hard and one goes away without ensuring who or if their plant was a mistake or a great idea. The most important features include Tibet's own children and the difficulties they faced before finding their way to school. Moving forward to me is the story of Tashi, a young boy who grew up in the street after his parents left him. I could watch the entire movie in her life and I was glad to learn that thanks to the school, now runs a small business with other classmates. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you would like this.
