This is a good film. I agreed to view a flick of chick and some of this ended. I have never heard or anyone in it (except Mike from friends). But it's good! Eve, Lake and Paul provide amazing exhibitions. Humor becomes dry and beautifully. Paul Rudd strikes a mike character from Friends (which works fine). Other characters are exhibitions and conspiracy is a formulaic (I mean we're not talking about 'Apocalypse Now' here) But the characters are interested, stories are involved, sound, production and direction all work well. <br /> <br /> In a good film to feel good that is very worth loan than it gets. Everyone has its own taste but I don't really know one star of this star.
