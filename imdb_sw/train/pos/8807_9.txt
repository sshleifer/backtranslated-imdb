This is a collection of documents that have passed 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 chapter from artists around the world. These documents are different and are relevant to all kinds of concepts, the only thing involved is 9/11 as the head (very little in some cases). Some segements are weak when others are very powerful; some are political, some are not; some are just about 9/11, some just use 9/11 as a touch theme on human feelings, emotions and disasters that are all; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been recognized in any way with anyone so the ideas you see are raw and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think the two groups can get rid of the fingers of the right (one from Egypt where the US soldiers who died and the Palestinian dead striker are returning as a soul; another from the UK who explains the United Nations UN United Nations United Nations, September 11 , 1973, in 50,000 deaths and evil evil). The part of Mexico was more powerful, says the collapse of towers and death caused by a clear (you should see it believe). Even though the final product is not suitable, and some groups are almost "useless", I still recommend this. It is very difficult for the title of this film because groups are different everywhere (some weak, some very strong;). I give this rating of 9 out of 10 only because some groups were better with the covered issues which usually find censored (part of Mexico, part of the UK, part of Japan, part of Egypt).
