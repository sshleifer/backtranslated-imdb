I watched the movie today and took my mind off. It is a real art of art and I do not understand why many people think it is garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - make your ego and then you will have real power! This was a great war at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a very good way. "The great enemy will hide the last place you will see" - you remember this from the film? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, which tells us tiredness, but just take, which creates our excitement, that wants to have control, which builds all feelings and thoughts. GR explained this idea in an amazing way and has shown that the only way to get true control is when you remove control and allow you to migrate your personal importance. Good movie!
