George Raft as Steve Brodie, a skilled player, a gambler who can never refuse to dare, has refused to scream, hate, Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). By touching each panhandler, Connors love to easily waifs and strays, especially the orphaned lost "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, full with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, out of town guilty and the wishes of being a writer. In this male-dominated culture, communication takes place mainly in a form of violence (someone sees why BOWERY is a favorite of Scorsese of Martin). Detecting smoking provides a gag running. "Recipes" enjoy throwing stones through windows in Chinatown, sometimes putting on a laundry. (Arrive at one of Brodie's and Beery Volunteers results in decisiveness, while the building burns down.) Beery reduces a tough girl, and tells anyone who does not agree with him, including Brodie, who defeats him, in the fighting The night fortress on the gun, to get control of its saloon, to lose to the bet that Brodie can not have the courage to fly Bridge Bridge. (Brodie makes a leap, but just because of the separation and dummy fails at the end.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the detail in detail, expressing joy to the daily tender life; the refugees of the singing, the defendants, who are involved in the execution of the Women of the Black Women, the older women locking the wrongs on the road and encouraging them to buy the suits they don't want. A small but interesting movie.
