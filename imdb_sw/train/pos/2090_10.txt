This is where the word "classic film" comes from. This is a wonderful story of the woman's courage, courage and great trust. Poor Olan was sold to her negligent husband, who for years she learned to love him. (Certainly, AI!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was a good star who won the best Oscar player a year before his small role (and what was lost). It was a talent, it was more beautiful than its foreign beauty. But in the "Good World" it shows that she can do the truth! Its beauty was removed and she did not have a lot of clothes. Olan is a shy and fearful woman, who has an inner power. She is quiet during the parts of the film and her eyes and her body only to convey her feelings. you say it doesn't work well in this film, you don't look at it! ‚ÄùPaul Muni shows that he can do it too. His character is not visible to me. you have a volunteer, with its special beauty. Absolutely, beauty from inside, like pearl. When you have the opportunity to see this film, see. You will see one of the best films that the Hollywood gold age was created.
