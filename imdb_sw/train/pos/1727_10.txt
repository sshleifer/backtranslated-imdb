The Wooden Horse is a very sophisticated movie on a very careful and successful plan by the UK POW during World War II. It deals with a sense of humor, especially the lines given by acid-language Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as two heroes. The direction is taut and fast-moving each. Highly recommended.
