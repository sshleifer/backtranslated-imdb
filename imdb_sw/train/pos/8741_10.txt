“Bug's life” is like a favorite candy bar - it's a chock-full of big bit bits which add up to something really tasty. <br /> <br /> Stories would not be better; is clever, has "heart" (emotions), and each character has a good "arc" (growth or change). In contrast, the only characters in the "Toy Story" have "arc" is Buzz, who learns to love to be a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his Buzz hatred. There are tons of laugh and good time in "Bug Life". All characters turn to a great job of sound, and animation, both motion and description, are very good. <br /> <br /> This great buff movie does not give us "10" s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves "10" I gave.
