It is always a good challenge when the film released for TV becomes entertaining such as Little Richard. This is a very popular film about the story of Rock and Roller, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon who I have never seen before but does a very good job. Like many TV films, this is a little tamer than if it's made to Cinema which is embarrassed because I'm sure there's a lot we've seen on Little Richard which was controversial. Instead we see a lot of waste that is the only thing that destroys the film and ultimately destroys a very promising job. All in this film is both good and acting it on the average fot film TV. 7 out of 10.
