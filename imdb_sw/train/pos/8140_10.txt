I saw this film first in the film center (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and I saw CB4 in the movie. However, the promo therefore got my eye, and I wanted to see what it was. Well, apart from the bat I knew it would be good (WARNING!) And I was right. Animation songs only make this movie look and watch regularly (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and filing was good. You should love the satire of rap groups (open NWA), some voters (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and three members of the NWH. Who can forget to see the Deaf climbing with his ass? It is very bad this film is not available credit, as it was closed by CB4 during release, but in my opinion it is the best film. If you know and like a 'gangster' rap, you will watch and laugh with this film for a long time. If you do not like or dislike 'rap', you will enjoy jokes at the cost of the type.
