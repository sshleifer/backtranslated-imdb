I found this a few weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light but full of life's difficulties. It's questions and answers, as well as other movies of Eytan Fox. This is my favorite, with Jossi & Jagger. This has more pictures, everywhere, than just bubbles we can live. You don't need to be Jews or homosexuals enjoying this - I don't, but the movie goes straight to my top ten movies. At first it looks like fresh entertainment but it makes you think more. The relationships we live with are high, meaningful, deep, deadly, calling it. You don't know what is coming, and you really don't know what this story is about when you look at it for the first time. It is important to see several times. Fox movies include additional equipment - here is a great music video and "decision" (including the title of the head, interview with Lior Ashknenazi who engages himself in films with the Arabs in doubt about the styles of Israel).
