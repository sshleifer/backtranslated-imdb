I really liked this film! I am not all related to all the other comments I have read about it. I WAS EVERYTHING TO EVERYTHING! <br /> <br /> I have found the story of promotion, acting acting, and leadership direction. I would fly every time the phone would close to the end of the movie. Although nothing "terrible" on the story itself, I was bright through the whole movie - and for all my evening. I found out that there was a very good choice made ... forming, script, bit bits of humor made in it. There were many points where the film could go unhappy, but it has never done it, and that's for me to put this film on many of the most recent attractions ... and for the last number of years.
