When Rome goes mad to celebrate Hitler's visit - uniform, band, demonstration - outdoor two sit at home, in a large building, and a wind conference. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal civil servant and mother of six. He is Mastroianni, a radio spokesman who has been expelled because of his homosexuality. Both need a company with understanding, both of them find it in each other. The movie needs a few hours. The color has grown and everything is done by the sound of the military forces and the hysterical radio advertisers. Surprisingly, the Nazi song - Horst-Wessel-False - ends with a romantic romantic theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film, good entertainment of the special era in Italy's history and touch, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect with Sofia Loren doing a very good job, far away from its usual truck driver, a Neapolitan fish. Don't miss it.
