I know I know it was a good end but it was really amazing. I like when the movie is approaching the worst of dark but this time I was fascinated by Darth Vader protesting against the King I was really surprised. The sequence of pain in the film is when Luke was persecuted and defeated by King / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, King of Sith, will finish his black master. Good sacrifice. The film of this film is amazing. I was surprised by all the ships of the Rebel War and all the ships of the Imperial War and the Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race that brought the screen of Mon Calomari, ewoks, sullesteian (co-lando operator) and much more ... Most of my favorite events are in the film: 1-When Vader destroys the King and injured. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the largest area in Star Wars) 3- When LEIA kills Jabba beat the master of Hutt crime. <br /> <br /> I personally like the script and the Battle of Endor to present the fight with the ground and space with the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader vs Luke Skywalker on Star Star. Post-script: Featured with Leia in bikini of a slave is memorable. 9/10.
