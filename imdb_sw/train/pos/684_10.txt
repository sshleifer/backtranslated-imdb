I was looking at this series. I was seven / eight years old when you were. I remember part 1 which was called "New House." It is afraid of ll ll from me! I can almost hear the image, laughing too much. And finally, oh my God! Spirit of hoor comes into the room for the child: Yikes! This was a common TV and was one of the series of forms. I've got a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 really. My question for any readers: Has anyone bought this set? Bootleg it. All suppliers claim to have a very good copy. I have screens and poor DVD's "New House" section, and a few other events that are better, however, if someone knows if these are more obvious it will be worth me to buy and cooperate with my kids. Great series, clever, awesome and unusual. Thanks in advance to any fans who have decreased under any thing- In fact, I would like to talk. Chris Walker
