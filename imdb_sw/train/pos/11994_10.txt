Like many people here I can't help but praise Cast and Crew who formed Talespin and others who did during My Youth, I like all who have said here have been very happy with the quality of not only animation but the quality of the story lines and characters. <br /> <br /> To create this work of art as "Cartoon" can never make it right, In fact it's hate to class as "Cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, It's definitely the most intellectual work of the The release of Disney so far, when Disney "was hit" from a little air they did not understand what they did and I'm sure their souls have been troubled by the pain since then. I'll take the time to explain, From the first that is the ducktales to the end that I think is Darkwing Buck, Disney has been bothered by failure due to political accuracy and has taken back to Quantum Leap since, prefer a quantity on Quality now not mentioning a room full of Monkey for stories , I can't have my kids looking at the "cartoons" of mind that they give us now for fear that all will turn to homer Simpson sometimes and 50% of the blame will be on me by letting them look, I couldn't let that happen, that's why I have all the shows from at the end of the 80's to mid 90 on Harddrive so one day my children could not be misled by today's "Cartoon Crap" and privately the last piece of childhood I had and hold and give them everything to Talespin. Witnessing me undoubtedly the best animation produced in the world because of It is deep, Lover, Witch, sympathy, emotional and lack of good quality and stories that many people have today, Do you see any of those content by saying "Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else You can think?, the litter produced today can be compared to the 3-year-old Hyroglyph depicting Picasso. Sometimes when you look at the episod of Talespin, see wood wood on any wooden or The building as well as the Recruitment and Setting on the quality of work and effort put in this animation, even the same nature of the shooting was done as though it would take over and over again, The Real Estate look true to the Deco's Art movement which was popular for the period of time shown, Even cars are real to life, OK not all of Episodes were amazing in animation but low-grade events were covered by top events for each The place caused it all out of the end of the period and You will never never know unless you are focused and looking at the details. One thing that I like about this is what I like to hit "Errors Errors" or "Expected Errors" in each section and the other two, for example in the depth of the sheep where rebecca says "You have over the Baloo thing and Baloo's response "Who, I! is not guilty as a school student" look at the rebecca's eyes, I've won 't kidnap some of the Baloopers but just keep an eye out next time. <br /> <br /> Each of the elses of the elses is equal to 100% correct, I have nothing to add that others have not told you already here, Disney, WAKE UP and the smell of coffee, Sleep for more than a decade, Leave to produce garbage and restore Quality in Examples and Preparation of "Cartoons", we have seen proof of what you can do and we want as soon as possible.
