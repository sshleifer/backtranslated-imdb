The Titanic of the film makes it just more "night of remembrance." Writes a wonderful history of history that will be discussed regularly and has never been forgotten. Why were they criticized? I don't know. Will they be able to make a film like Titanic which encourages and touches every time you look at it. What? They could take the role of the epic like this epic. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director of course had a great impact on the film. A simple movie of the disaster (boring look) replaced by fantastic romance. Yes, I am not a kind of Romance either, but that should not be disturbed, because you don't see romance like this. Verified! Everything for amazing effects, for music, for small statements. <br /> <br /> The movie creates a wonderful visual and good feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The story itself "TITANIC" is carefully displayed in all classes, it also appears, too. Acting was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are the only best in playing tasks. No one could do well. They are part of the reason why the film is too big. I think it's not too much to talk. The plan is simple, Acting is a talent, according to a true story, maybe more than half of the watch-ups will share the tears, because of the possible end that you will never forget. Well if you haven't seen this film is not in Hesterical, and a Hollywood film. Could it be better? No. The most moving movie of all time, listen to the people, see for yourself then you will understand. Summary. (don't be surprised if you are too)
