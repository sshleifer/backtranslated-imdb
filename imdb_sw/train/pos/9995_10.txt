This is the type of film you want to see with a glass of wine, hot, and on your feet up. It doesn't want to have a lot of brain power to follow, so it's very good after a long day. I would say it's not true - if you expect anything big, then don't worry, but it's very funny. Just assume that the trader would go until now agree to live in a slum for a while, then get to enjoy ... I would definitely recommend it.
