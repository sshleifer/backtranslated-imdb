The film was very good despite the NC-17 marks and damages. In fact things like this happen and that's why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in good performance) who recently started attending college with everything that is right for her. He meets Jared (Chad Faust in sharp performance) in a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites him to dinner. They look at the stars from the bridge and go to his house. They say and take him to the apartment while they liked it. He tries to finish, but he builds him. This event tells him. He goes to the club meets with the bartender / DJ Adrian (played by Marcus Patrick) who feels he has a drink and helps before going away. They beat friendships. He makes drugs with Maya begins to use too. In other words it precedes it to a different world. He begins to return to school and work as TA (Assistant Assistant) and Yarered ads as one of the students. When students take Midterm, it takes Jared's certificate. Jared tries to talk to Maya, but he still has a high hand he chooses to welcome him into his place. What? History will repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You are watching the film. Better A. Rosario Dawson shows the role for purpose and perseverance. Chad Faust does not like to be an opponent, but he works as hard as Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very talented person who saves the Maya and teaches him in the new world. This film deserves a prize.
