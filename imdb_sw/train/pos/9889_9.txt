Read Eric's review again. He fully explained my own feelings to this film more skillfully than I could. I'm just writing here to encourage you more to find and see it. I have seen many years ago on TV, IFC I think. It's a special film that I am trying to compare. It was done in northern Mexico, somewhere in the islands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Durango-like Durango, Mexico (the film John Wayne) but the real and wild area. I should get a novel now to look at the original story of the story. As a place, this film is wonderful and wild and wonderful and wonderful and not for everyone. It is a kind of production that encourages you to learn the film. <br /> <br /> I have never forgotten this film, it is clear. However, for many years, I had forgotten its existence. I don't know anyone who has seen, never read, nor see any records. Erendira is an unusual name, I would even forget the head. Yes, I will look to buy a copy now. I've been since the above publications have been a great fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so I feel that you haven't read. <br /> Related to MsMyth's comments below; The film had been made in Mexico but the author is Colombia and had no views on Mexico or Mexican history in any way, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is normal. I'm still trying to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the film? You have to read the story and then everything Garcia Marangano wrote. And, by the way, the original part in the story was Colombia.
