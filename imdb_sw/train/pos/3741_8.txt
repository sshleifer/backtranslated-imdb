The war in Louisiana in 1971. Following a group of employers through basic training and then Tigerland - a real picture of Vietnam on American soil, before being sent. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, be friends and deal with the squad of Clifton Collins Jr. </> <br /> The amazing non-commercial film led by Joel Schumacher. She uses a hand-operated camera every time the film and uses digital video for anti-combat. It works very well - the film seems to have a sense (as it should) and is not really good. Farrell wins the success of his Irish pig and takes a good accent to the south. His performance is best - he is a very talented boy. Davis, unfortunately, is not good. He is tall, nerves, very good - and it is very common. Some of the cast however are just better. This movie was thrown to his studio. It had no stars in it, the story of the family and it was considered "another film of war". Just played a week in Boston! It is good to be infected on a video or DVD. Also, Farrell and Davis have a long-term nude area.
