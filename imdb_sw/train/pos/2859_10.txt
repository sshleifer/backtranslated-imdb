I know this seemingly odd come from someone born about 15 years after the show stopped airing, but I would like to show this. I don't know why, but I'm happy to look at it. I love Adam better. Unfortunately, the only place I found to buy a season on DVD was Germany, and that was just the first season. That's desire, but that's okay. I'll keep looking online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy a second through 14 seasons, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I am already the first. Just below are the DVDs from Germany, just playing on my DVD player and my phone. Oh well. I still own it!
