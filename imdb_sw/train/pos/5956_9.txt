Yes, this is a movie under the budget movie. So acting is not winning the material and sometimes the action is slow because the filmmakers are acting long and not millions of hours that are converted to the film. This film makes for the best script that takes vampirism for weight, spells and promotes a full program. In addition to the story of the vampire, we have a detailed description of the generation, legal rules and law enforcement, military action, philosophical organs, and some metal music. Kudos go Dylan O'Leary, director / author / actress main. It's beyond me how this man could fulfill all these tasks and make them very well. I think you appreciate this film, you should be more aware in various themes to see that the author did a good research and knows about all these things. There are some good cameras, also, interesting camera angles and underwater vampire-attack attacks that I have not seen before, but honors zombie attack on zombie in Fulci Application. Compose is good, for now as a female woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim appears to be dangerous. My only complaint is that with the flick of the under-budget, it should be more dirty. If you want to see the original movie of the vampire and good story, this flick is for you. I hope to see future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
