Oh, sixty years. There were interesting films. I was more than a movie goer then. Now I enjoy renting movies and enjoying my home instead of going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "Legend of Boy and Eagle". I have been looking for this film for years. It was really inspiring. Surprised, I was able to gather more information from your website. Thank you ........ I also did not remember the Disney film. I did not even remember that it was the opening film of Disney. In fact I would like to show this on the TV sometimes. I wonder if Disey has the rights to this film? What? Available on DVD? This must be seen for all generations !!!
