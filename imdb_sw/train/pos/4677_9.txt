I understand this film to be the first and the same thing, it's very amazing. It feels and strengthens the "indie of the truth", but the director Todd Yellin has a clear picture with the editing of vision, command and judgment of a mature and timely specialist. Shots are well organized and considered and cause moving stories forward. He, and the image writer Ivan Solomon offers a story that has more detailed and festive than the usual "color and number" type scripts. It is a story that requires the talent of Judd Hirsch's character to be shot while working. Judd is amazing as usual; as is Scott Cohen and good Susan Floyd. The real surprise though it is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was well enough outside the actor in a role that could easily be done by the discrimination or overthrow. Anyway, I have seen the film returning and entertaining.
