I love only Malle's documents. They are very difficult and simple but still amazing. I don't care why this document works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, in fact. But Malle can still make it attractive and interesting. His love for mankind, even people of color or race, is so great that you can not only help but also love them as well. Malle was published more in 1979. She returned 6 years later to see what had changed. This would be a good film without 6 years later but this small addition makes it beautiful. It would seem that Malle was only doing what was done in the series of Up but actually not. The Up Series is about people. Malle's emphasis is not so much about what happened to everyone but what happened to this society. And the change is huge. 1985 is the Reagan era and the farmers suffer. Once the arrogant community, now no one sees the future very much and parents expect their children to teach themselves and do something other than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This document is very suitable today. Our financial crisis today began because of what is happening at the time. Just look at these last words on the film, sent by an older lawyer from the city (1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I am very optimistic for this country because things that are happening now can only be characterized by My mind as a burden and greed. And the nation does not hold for a long time with that problem. And especially democracy that ... There is good - there is good - much good in this country and a lot of good people can not - can not register for this philosophy It is terrible. "Unfortunately it took more than 20 years to hell the head before it happened.
