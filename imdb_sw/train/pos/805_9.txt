"The return of the Jedi" often remembers what was wrong rather than what it did, and that's a shame, because the last line of the series in the Star Wars saga is a good example of the epic story. It can connect all the lines of previous story stories into one big finale, and it does so with a very persuasive influence. Yes, there are vines of Ewoks - beautiful and cuddly which certainly served to expand the population of Star Wars - and the middle movie tends to decrease slightly. But the last hour is a doubt of the best piece of whole saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most well-known villain in film history. The return of the Jedi made a lot of things that people do not forget: you have brought a wonderful conclusion to the story of Darth Vader (which came from a little bit in "Empire Strikes Back" very interesting here), an exciting opening at the Palace of Jabba, the good performance of Ian McDiarmid as King, Luke finally comes to himself, the resolution of Solo and Leia's love, and at the end of the last powerful end of Endor. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are little annoyances. But they are annoyances of the generation of moviegoers who have had time to nitpick every single area. It is still a magical and exciting piece that is also used as the last last frame. It's not 'good' movie - it's amazing!
