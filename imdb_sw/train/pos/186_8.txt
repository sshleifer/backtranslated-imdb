There are some good things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right property; he is wonderful in the comedic roles. William Haines could do, and you can see why he was one of the most popular screenshots. (Until the scam is possible to evict him from business) <br /> <br /> The story is a bit, but it is well-done without realizing it. King Vidor's direction is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Young man, Irving Thalberg. It is about making movies, and you see the process as was done in 1928, camera, sets, directors and directors to implement. You see (briefly) some of the great stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin turns like himself, looking for a autograph. You also get an explanation of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who are otherwise just names and old pictures. Please, even if you're not a fan of silents, do when you capture this film when you can. It is really a very tough journey time.
