I was very excited about this part, which was a great surprise for the bad reputation that it seems to have found. From a purely written writing, '16mm' ceremony is a completely treating, with wonderful dialogue and character analysis, eg Sterling. Especially I enjoyed very much the philosophy of this period, dealing with the reality of existence, while making it to a more psychological topic such as refusal, pride, and lust. 'The sixteenth millimeter house' is a part of how these basic ideas of not accepting change can be seen as a conflict with a person from all the world that is changing. It is also a wonderful example of Twilight's brain area; which explores the ideas rather than the outside world. All of these things are together in order to create stimulating and interesting ideas of 25 minutes. It is not the fault of it yet, which is very common in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Surprisingly, I heard Lupino was not included in all, and the only events that could count it to remember. This is actually a shame to consider how well Sterling has written his character. In addition, Leisen was not found to know what to do with many of its characters, sometimes they have to stand next to do anything else - which explains why accepting the evil race from Lupino half time. Balsam's thanks makes a good job of covering many weak areas, helping to free the show from the least. As I said earlier, however, if it is a fan of a common film and brain of brain science, this should not be as bad as sometimes it has been. In addition to the text I mentioned above, the section also has some amazing pictures (it is still amazing that the show looks pretty about fifty years later!) And put a decent set. In general the “sixteen-millimeter temple” is a great place and above all is definitely one to make you think.
