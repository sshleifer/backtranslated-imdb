Many people (36) gave this film 10 and those who are not very important or maybe expect something else. This is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows to you, and it has all. I only got on the DVD and 20 years later it was still not enough, have many steps, celebrations, romance, and even comedy. Adding to that the big car is running, shooting the weapon directly with a lot of beatings and you are happy, the edge of your seat experience! You will even show him or call the main theme for the day after seeing this. You can watch this film with your wife / gf and you will all enjoy that vote. The premise is that of the hero of the paper book, like Doc. Savage, available to help people fight evil so that he can write a story is close to life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and writer of many films. In this film Jake Speed ​​(character) is Indiana Jones ignorant type, he usually uses his head to get out of the form of a stick but sometimes it looks for a hot mess (yay! And unfortunately dumb too!) Keeping an eye for his "James Bond" equipment of hi-tech, the last road warrior SUV from heaven. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very beautiful young love interest from early Jim Carey vampire movie "Once Bitten" and here she is younger and still knockout even compared to her little younger blonde sister. <br /> <br /> Bad people are "really bad" men and are the worst misconceptions of people you love to hate. The end is just complete and you can stand alone or invite a good, sadly never made - but you can imagine what will happen next! You should see this film because it will be interesting and frightening and it has a ticket value.
