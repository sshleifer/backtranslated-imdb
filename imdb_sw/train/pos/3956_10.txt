BEWARE WORKERS are a remake of the BRIDELESS group of sheep. The new film location at the beginning of the film is great. Stooges are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking videos, we take a preliminary picture of BRIDELESS. One thing I saw about these 1953 until 1956 remake is that they fit with new stories. They make a bullet slip if the old line of the story does not match. BUSBANDS BEWARE has a final end, but I will not give away those who want to be surprised. </> <br /> **** out of 4 stars.
