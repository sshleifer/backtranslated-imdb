This is a kind of film on Sunday Sunday snow when others around the world can go ahead with their own business as you go down to a big arm chair and mix for several hours. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) with gentle series plot together. There are no intervals, no dangerous water, just a warm and wonderful paddle through New York life for the best. Family films in each and every one that deserves the reputation received.
