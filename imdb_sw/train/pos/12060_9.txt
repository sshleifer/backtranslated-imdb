I miss the most of the old Spooky films. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory have been given the job of producing the film it may be this, except for the lack of a well-known international shop. This is one of those films that only look the dark evening and pizza with some popcorn, and you don't have trouble making the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the lid. Bravo for Herbert Wise Director, Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, the Best Production Structure and Jon Bunker, the Art Gallery and John Ralph and the best cast make me a hero and feel so alone though I live in one of the most populous cities in the world at the beginning 21st century. I paid "9" from "10" because of the restrictions on production and budget television, they are pulled well.
