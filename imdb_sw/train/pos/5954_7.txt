I see out there a mix of chaos and different degrees of personal taste in the effects of this film. Yes, there is a different vampire. Yes, there is a scientific architecture covered here. Even the military discrimination. All well and good, and indeed, not all done perfectly. However, I think one important thing about this film is ignored ... the importance of its local culture. Film installed Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying that. That is a bold argument in the world of the film today, and treat a few for film fans of indy. And in fact, it may be the last. Pensacola is world-famous as the city of Navy, the city of the sky, the city of wood, and sometimes even as hotbed for political controversy. It is often seen as the city of increasingly film. But that's all changing now. Other film companies come to shoot. And most of the indigenous people of Pensacolians are discovering the potential of movies for themselves. This film is part of an increasingly trendy film of the Pensacola film, and more is on the way. Pensacola makes a great noise in the international film community, and by and, the world takes more information. Look and listen, the world. Wapensacolians are coming. As a virus.
