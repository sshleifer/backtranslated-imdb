Wow. It's a very good film. Script is almost complete looks this is the only film written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. <br /> <br /> Acting is good. Zhou's fight as Doggie was amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was happy - very reliable as traditional traditional tradition. The voice sound was very effective, leading without power. If only some movies like this were made on Hollywood or Hong Kong - a friendly, well-written, well-written, well-directed, close to full gem.
