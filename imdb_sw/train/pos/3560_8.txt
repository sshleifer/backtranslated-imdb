Joseph L. Mankiewicz was not remembered by many today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that he is. Already achieved by making modern American games like Letters to Three Women and All About Eve and also achieving Shakespeare for life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a wonderful job of bringing this hit Broadway to play with the film and make in fashion. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if it can't sing very well. He is the only actor who could completely remove it with his transparency and transparency. Frank Sinatra is a good singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and its events with Brando sizzle and great chemistry. All support staff are doing their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry Horse for very little. However, Mankiewicz should be given more credit by bringing good music to himself on the screen in such a way that it sounds realistic in many pictures but it is still a story in his world. All for all, Guys and Dolls are a lot of music and works at many levels shouldn't have.
