I lost this several years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Directly the video hit the moment (you know, where the box covers the same font and color schemes for the successful film.) I had no more expectation than published. The first thing I thought of when I looked at what was "wrong" and the sound? "- Obviously there was no dialogue. The words emphasized, so I stopped concentrating on everything I had to pay attention to your attention no Shakespeare here! Easy talk. The story is simple, the boy meets the girl. The people in the movie were not seen as caricatures written in the story, but rather non-actors plug in time from their actual work (uniforms included). caused by their privacy, using this evil could not hurt the markets. There was something to be honest about it if they had a big budget then it would be better, which I am sure to be taken every day, but, they continued to do it. The independent decision of the film is about what. "Indy", is thrown around like it is kind.
