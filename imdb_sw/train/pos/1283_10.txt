The film refers to a person who believes that all types of media are outdated. The concept of his art project is to erase the culture of ignorance that we are brought to. Typically, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. Attacks the comics stand (caw, caw, caw), rock band, models, Hollywood movie movies, and touch many other mediums. Finally, he finds himself in the weapons he has put in motion. The film is five years old and says the truth every day. It is a good description of the anger after the punk I ever saw. It is also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
