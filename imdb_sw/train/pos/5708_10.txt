This is exciting! After seeing "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, lighter, good-looking movie, I see that this is a real cure! This is a great joy and one of the most loving pictures I saw this year. It is more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts a beautiful 30-year-old embarrassment for its use of sound creativity in movies. It's just filled with music and good feeling which is really upbeat and, down below, made me happy! In fact it would not be too hard to get a lottery ticket for men's leadership was looking for, but the speed is exciting and the movie is so amazing that I didn't think twice. Comedy often attracts a lot and I think it's even better than the Marx Brothers, perhaps the most powerful comedic of time. This is perfect.
