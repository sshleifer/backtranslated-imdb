Those of the "Gratification" films of the horrible films undoubtedly complain about the speed of this film and lack of free effects and body count. The fact is, "The Acre Acre" is a good example of how private private films should be made. Avoid the racks of indie because you are tired of angry or angry young people and twenty-killed and baddie whose story behind may be behind the Count Chocula box, "The Empty Acre" is a movie for you. Keeping in the rest of the decay of rural dreams in the United States, "The Acre empty" is the story of a young couple faced with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. Since the weak relationship of the couple falls, the big story looks back. At night, the dark mixture of the darkness comes from their dry acres in their sun and seems to eat anything in its path, without leaving the sign that it was ever there. <br /> <br /> The film is closed with enigmatic characters and signs of what is happening, and end up with the end of which ends up on questions to confirm the author's / director's trust for the mentor. It seems to be minimal - written on the death of a American dream, but I couldn't call it a hard film. Riveting, well-acting, and technically astute, "The Empty Acre" is a wonderful little indie that think horror fans should love it.
