My 2-year-old likes to show Doodlebops, it seems to put his thoughts for a while. The characters are interesting, powerful and basic colors and all. There is not much educational content that the audience can benefit from, but they seem to have each theme and try to teach children about participation and respect and other grounds, so I would like it. Produced well by high production standards. But it is only true to show whether the average shows on TV these days. We can't buy at the corners of the product and have our son wearing everything Dooblebop. I don't think we'll use money to go to a live show, if they've ever come to town. Going to the Zoo or Science Center is the best experience for everyone involved and in my opinion it is the best money.
