"COSBY," in my opinion, you must see-CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've never seen any part, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say who I love. Also, I liked the theme of the theme. If you ask me, although I loved everyone, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn had not gone through the run. Since that happened, I always wondered what the show would like. Everyone always gave good performance, the production structure was wonderful, the clothes were well organized, and the text was very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend doing it if it goes to air for beauty
