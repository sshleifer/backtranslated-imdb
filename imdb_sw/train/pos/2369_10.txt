This movie has stopped! Jeff Wincott is bright in the film! His fight is amazing! He is a quick artist of karate! Brigitte Nielsen & Matthias Hues was very good! The message of Justice is an incorporated movie that has never been boring! If you would like to fight movies and unusual action to stop then see the Mission of the Law today!
