This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choice was different. Participates in the "Multiple Universe" theory. The only thing that is not true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has a very difficult time to understand what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
