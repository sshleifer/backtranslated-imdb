I don't know why this flick gets such a bad rap for many IMD users (Some say it's 'the worst movie ever.' Doesn't one of you see Cradle 2 Graves?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is completely stupid, and The relief of relying on all the mechanisms of action. Duh! What did you expect from the Jet Li film? What? Do you honestly believe that someone thought the story, then put it into action? Of course no! Black mask is amazing, the wall moves up to the wall around and all the time to run. It is also a bad taste, and we have many feet, cuts, and creative ways to look at bad people (and very few innocent people, too!) They are killed. Many young American filmmakers are nursery schools when compared to Black Mask; no hold of freeous violence, blood, or order of any action! And that made me a happy girl. Again: if you are going to a pleasant discussion of Jet Li movies and an exciting plot, you are going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask may be loved by his movies (though, beware of dubbing of awesome).
