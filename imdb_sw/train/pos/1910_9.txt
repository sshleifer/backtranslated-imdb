Ya. That's what I think. Certainly it was still a good show with John in it but I personally think it is the best way without. <br /> <br /> I love having CJ and Grandpa living at home because they are very funny together. <Br /> <br /> While John was still around me I did not laugh at him as I am now. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that no more is being done. (I don't think ...) because I would like to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character should be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always left out. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT DOES RORY !!! ??? Surely this is a great show and for anyone who has never looked at it you must go and watch it. I almost confirm you laugh. well even stuck.
