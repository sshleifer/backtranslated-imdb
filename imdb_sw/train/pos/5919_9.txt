Fighting Street is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not just a fun-looking film. It's not a good experience, although it has a certain time of laughing. This is the film you look at when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> Removing this film as just a racist is not quite sure. This is not just a satire of Southern Words, it is also a definite definition on the violence that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group displayed in the film is available as an incredible caricatures of their discrimination, which is therefore a great caricatures of real people. Through the spread of this wildlife, the filmmaker shows how much less these beliefs are covered. If you are the kind of person who acknowledges the maladministration of the prevalence of American culture goes on, and if you're not afraid to look at your own hatred in the eye, this movie can be yours.
