One of several music about the sea at the time of departure, is an ordinary sea meets a girl, the expected problems, solved by a good kind of plot. It goes very well but does not drag in part as well. Talk not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott looks out of place. <br /> <br /> There is a compensation. It has some of the most interesting Irving Berlin songs including 'Let Us Keep', 'I Put My Milk On One' and 'Let's Say Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who are playing and they are taking any film at the levels of heaven and they have no desire here. They make a snappy dance, a comic drum of knockabout and an interesting dance with beauty, all in the same film! It is very useful with knowledge. It also has Harriet Hilliard who is very good in her role. He had a different job, being the most popular Harriet Nelson and Ozzie. Here he has a touch without having a feeling.The two songs are simple and effectively delivered. He makes a good difference with Ginger but you can believe it is a sister in the film. Strengthening has made the film better. Pretty beautiful though.
