I was very good when this happened in the United States, but I wrote it from the TV and watched it from time to time until I had anything hit. To this day I am still finding quotes. The show itself was hilarious and had the most famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. Sounds were great, and sounds like their characters display. The fabrics were well done, although they are very small. I was surprised to find out recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy very much. As someone else wrote in earlier comments, I was also stolen by this great show and "friend" paid and did not return. I am sure you would have enough of this show for a DVD release release, but I don't think enough people have felt. Oh well, maybe I'll try to e-bay ...
