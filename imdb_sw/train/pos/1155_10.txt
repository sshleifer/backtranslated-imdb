It's very funny. It has a very cast that everyone offers good performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It is a well-written screenplay by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like detergent operations, although I haven't looked at them. But I love this film because it is mad and far from the wall, that it blows out of any stupid detergent that has on the day's TV. In my opinion, it's the best film of 1991.
