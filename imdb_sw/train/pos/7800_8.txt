I first saw this film when I had about 13. It had hit me away then and in many ways it still does now. But I am not interested in seeing it as a historic piece right now. There are very little attempts to explore and interact with racism - and so it does not realize that the best weapon to fight apartheid is to understand its basis for those who do it. What we find instead is dichotomy - on the one hand, beko and wood in the vision of the rainbow rain - on the other hand, two dimensional characters are shown as unthinking evil. <br /> <br /> This all makes a great story of the film, but it is sad that people see it as 'signature'.
