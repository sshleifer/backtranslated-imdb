Well, it is. In fact, it is somewhere in my 20 most popular movies all the time. No. 15, I think. Anyway, I am not unusual for plots, but I think the plots work well in video games with RPG, (Final Fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. But this has all. A concrete diagram of the planet, star, very good screenplay. Although this is not for children, they can still look at it, it does not come with blood, guts and silicone. But I don't think they will understand.
