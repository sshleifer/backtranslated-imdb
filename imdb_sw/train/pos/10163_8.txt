This had a good story ... it had a good speed and all the characters were made well. I looked at a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this should have been the best I saw in two weeks. <br /> <br /> The character of Jason Bigg was even better though <br /> <br /> Even though it was small, it was a subtle trick from the beginning. <Br /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like many, but typing, manual, making, voice, design, generally in all the ability only was really thinking pretty cool. This film was very fast on all the films I saw recently - and others were a great budget or better to advertise. <br /> <br /> Good job for writing.
