I have never heard this book, nor do I care to read, but the movie will get it often. This video cannot be remembered by the richest photos I've ever seen on the film. It was like I was looking at the paintings many times, which I think is the idea. <br /> <br /> Bad movies, stories, actors, and movies. Full of great feeling from each angle. Although I am not very interested in romantic movies, I liked that and I was impressed by Winona Ryder's prayer for her father toward the end. Irons deserved a prize for its performance and almost was not much better. <br /> <br />
