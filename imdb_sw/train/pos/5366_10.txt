I am sitting here in November 2006 and still can't help cleaning this film. Arnold's best movies came within 4-5 years. Man Run, Predator, and Recall Recall (1990). All 3 is amazing. Arnold pieces made in this film will make you laugh more than one event. I see work in this amazing movie as well as it was in the Predator and Totall Note. They did a great job in trying to make futuristic as required to be done in 2017, but you can't help but a snicker in the style of 80 style of men and woman in the crowd and ordinary television monitors in the Man Run Studio which we all know here in 2006 is on the way the external and emergence of flat panel with HDTV's. Also the computer graphics of the "Running Man" of the intro of the game were not found like that in 2017. Yet the story of the story is quite amazing. Not once during this film I wanted to wake up and I don't care about the end that is something I do regularly with today's movies. In fact I think that Arnold's acting is much better than given credit to. Now I have not chosen a governor but that's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero is fantastic "stalkers" also and I see the manufacturers don't try to overthrow the fight scenes. When the stalker is dead ... she is dead. It does not do every 20 minutes each. The stalker events are fast and entertaining but they don't try to do it. I offer this 10/10 film and it comes from someone who doesn't enjoy many movies today. If you find the correct actors and accurate stories then the futuristic picture displays that you would like to see in 2006 are not important or important.
