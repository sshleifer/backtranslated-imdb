After seeing the moment of "Batman Dead End", I wasn't sure to expect quite from the World. Of course, Superman and Batman. All My World's Comic Books have had as a top team. When you see this 3-and-a-half-minute trailer, it made me like someone to make a serial fan for World Access, if not a full-length film. Of course, some of the Superman items were good, but the film trailers on the cinema are always teasers, just giving you some things of the whole product. This looks like it requires a complete product. Besides the director of Sandy Collera family members playing Perry White who was poor, many of the participants were not known. If a real movie was made, the actors will be hit by the bill to the film, although I believe Nina Kaczorowski would make a nice Lois Lane, especially if they are given close-to-the-way dialogue. <br /> <br /> Good to see Clark Bartram wearing a Batman Costume from the Last End, but it should be updated a little more and not as 40 Batman and 80s-90s cape leather and cows. Her character is Batman-like, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses rather than let her eyes show through the mask. I believe the goal was closer to the character of the comic than the movie persona. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can't play Superman, period. He stands near the face of the face that says only, "Let me hit." And the delivery of the line seems to be a problem with him. Overall, I would like to see the full story and films according to this masterpiece. There was speculation about the proposed film more of the World, and with the proper addition to the script, this could be that. More hope if this is done.
