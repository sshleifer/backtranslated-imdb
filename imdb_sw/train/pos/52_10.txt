This movie is wonderful. If you have a chance, see. Although, the warning, you just watch your eyes out. I, every time I see it, and I own it and look at it many times. Exhibitions are excellent. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This film has made me look at a different world: the wrong experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, see the impressive use of shades and light. The home room is a wonderful movie, and I am testing 10/10 - in fact - because of good acting, amazing plot, and heart discussion. Very long, very moving. It does not provide all the answers, but makes many good points about humanity
