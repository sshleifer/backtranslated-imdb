Added from previous view. The greatest and emerging Marion Davies shows his comedic things in this late comedy (1928) which also shows William Haines amazing. Davies plays a player from Georgia who hits Hollywood with help from Haines, a limited player in the wrong video. They seem together in cheap comedies until Marion "is discovered" and becomes a very big star. <br /> <br /> Great light on Hollywood and its preference. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and shots of visitors from the loved ones of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor , Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (see) are hoot. Must be for any buff of a great film or for anyone who is attracted to Marion Davies who is still despised! Dell Henderson has a father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a good man to lead. Show people who used Gloria Swanson's work as his example (I think Mae Murray is close). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film resembles the growing Swanson from one of Mack Sennett's players and Charlie Chaplin for STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the last-year and early 20 years. <br /> Davies and Haines were MGM great stars and friends. Of course that MGM has never been involved in talkie. They are good together! Romance sweet and good spoof of Hollywood in advance. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but are not visible.
