This movie is a beautiful movie of a man named Gray Owl in 1930 Canada. I saw that it was riveting similar to the heart like 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It takes at the end of Gray Owl's life and follows him through his horrible and large period of time. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a trader of India who finds himself growing up with Beaver's top problem. He also predicts the decline of natural land and the use of the world's resources. This is a very bad concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and people are willing to listen. Pierce Brosnan's design seems to be odd, but not too much. Anyone who wants to say this must first check the film to understand. Brosnan provides good performance as Annie Galipeau does. Galipeau is a powerful actor whose place next to Brosnan is an enjoyable nature compared to the compulsory pair in the recent Bond. I would recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to a good game, good environment, or environmental factors. It is a movie for the family also, however less than 10 children (depending on maturity) will have trouble following a plot.
