This has a joke of funnist out of all of Cheech & Chong flicks. It was the first time I saw these ones. I found it very good. My father recommended me to find it. WHAT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE, AND MY GRANDMA has bought me for me, knowing what it is. What family do I have? Well this movie is beautiful and beautiful tax when you want to see a beautiful classic. I must warn you, though this is not terrible. It has time but it's not as funny as There Is Something About Maria. Look again. I'm sure you will laugh. Except your activist to fight drugs or something.
