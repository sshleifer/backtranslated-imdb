And the unexpected plot of the time too - at the time: there is a Crisis in New Orleans-and just Richard Widmark can stop! Elie Kazan business questions: Water, men working, crowd, refugees, blue people, violence on the backstreet - all show here. Jack Palance is best suited as a cool-cold player comes out of a great score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise a certain amount that is used but actually looks like going. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as a good wife, good-thought I and Widmark were a faithful couple. He himself reminds me of everything of Sinatra-to-face and in a quiet manner â€” and that means to be praised as anything. I would like to hear this film, and yes, you should love the Widmark performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas-appeared to have this role many times, they make an impossible but effective team. The storm itself is McGuffin-and you know it's not what we've been in a real-life rather than a small scale? - but I found that it has made a plot for beauty. Try this out. It's good. *** outta ****
