This movie I have died. Certainly it took till now to determine the real lease. It was absolutely worth. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Chris Rock is funny no matter what movie he is. However, this should come quite close to its head. If you look for a family movie, ie before young and top then this is one you can not pass.
