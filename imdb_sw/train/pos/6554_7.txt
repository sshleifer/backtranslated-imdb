OK heres what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was the best. I am a big fan of Nancy and I have read all the previous books of 1-56 and I kept reading more. I am now 96 years old. Beware of criminals who give this film a lower grade than it is appropriate. All indications show a good movie! I liked the whole thing. So Nancy is when now. He is still an old fashion as he is in books! People who have not read more than 5 books are complaining about Nancy's views. I have read them all and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I have found the spiritual parts of the film. I loved an exciting car running and getting away. I liked the symptoms. I solved my own secret! It was quite strange. I advise you to go see since people who have been complaining do not know anything of what a good film and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. Oscar may not be eligible but it's a very good movie.
