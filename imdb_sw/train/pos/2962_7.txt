Parker and Stone transplant their pacy to stimulate-ridden humor from their animated hub to feature feature live action film and overall good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy boats. The plan is simple: two average boys build a new game, a basketball basketball and a baseball goal that becomes a national desire. On their way they meet many pictures of sports games and take them, along with any bit of popular culture that comes to their centers. It performs as part of the planned South Park, with regular-gun machine talks, toilet humor and hearts from the heart. If this film has weaknesses it is a partnership with a team that has given us "Birds" and a series of "Naked Guns". This influence is evident in the greater use of the limbs and the presence of glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the normal role given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn is doing better to play b ** tard's corporate which has been a piece of association since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine only succeeds as he can, but one must admit he is perfect for the position of the team's team. <Br /> <br /> For those who haven't seen yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as the rock stars than the people. This shows in the popularity given by the sound of almost every voice they create. As always, it provides a good selection here including the monitor must be with their ultra-non-PC DVDA drive. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The hard work of playing Stan for Parker and the interesting Stone of Cartmans. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is behind its full potential to rely heavily on "Guns Naked / Birds" formula. Parker and Stone can do something brilliant (or quite sad) if you are given full control over the future film. America, or imprison these people or put them in charge.
