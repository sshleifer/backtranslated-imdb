Most '60' classic classic films have not saved their ability to disrupt and respond to the audience. "In Blood Blood" has never lost its power. Its beauty is still encouraging the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but about the source of Truman Capote "is not false", that the central message does not know. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of controversy does not exclude the film altogether. It is interesting, especially in view of the modern and modern sports and watchdogs, to see a political sound film not afraid to push its listeners into consideration. Be honest, I do not know if I agree with the mid-movie message, but I enjoy its confidence however. Even if you disagree with the warrant against the capital, there is a lot to praise about the film. Acting from two guides is strict. Scott Wilson (still one of the many characters below) has been as hard as the leader of nihilistic, who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake also emerges as a more engraving for two and one with a conscience. His character has clearly has a voice of reason, but it is afraid to go against Wilson (this is a good amount of homoerotic subtext on the part of his character). The movie is very bad, very suitable but it gives an impression to the viewer looking at the document. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
