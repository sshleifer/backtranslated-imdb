This is my favorite third-party video producer. I loved all the songs. The main problem however, if most people said it was that this story contradicts nature. For those who saw the first movie to remember the bears met with their "cousins" who seem to never know. It was not true to the end that the cousins ​​received their maternal mark after confirming how much they cared. In this story however the cousins ​​grow up and give birth to the service and they have a round mark. That said this is not a bad movie for a long time put it compared to the first. I thought the dark character of evil is worse then Nicholas's first. But at the same time I felt it had increased the kind of equity for the beauty of the bear. I also liked that we care about the parts at the end, although I know other people had mixed feelings about the area. And of course I loved the songs. My recommendations are Growing and Ever Young. The filming of the cinema was always a good song. Ten stars for a very good movie.
