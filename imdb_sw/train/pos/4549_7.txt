"My Left leg" is a very interesting film that describes the story of Christy Brown, an artist who had a brain disability and learned to draw with his left foot, one of his body that had control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as the Best Actor of this film, which I am not worthy of, but is still important. Day-Lewis gives Brown the color of the touch of the truth and often around. Brenda Fricker, as a dedicated mother of Brown, also won Oscar for a reliable and touching role. My problem with this film is that it is very real time. When Brown loses and must help someone and do all with his left foot, the film can be hard to look at. This lets you feel often depressed which can extinguish the audience for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those with disabilities and other problems to overcome. Those who do not have disabilities and still feel that they have problems are guided by this film, because if something is worse than we can overcome their problems, we can do the same thing. Made well, occasionally enjoyable, but difficult to look. It can't be for everyone, but it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
