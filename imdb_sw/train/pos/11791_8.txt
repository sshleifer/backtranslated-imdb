This is a very exciting movie with David Lynch, and the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short. Blonde and brunette is in a dark room. The blonde has been crying, the brunette speaks through a horrible way to blonde, and that's about it. Over time for silence, but for angry music from Angelo Badges, there is a wonderful form of doubt. This short feeling feels like 'Mulholland Dr.', the movie I liked, and so I loved this too. Perhaps especially for Lynch fans but there is a chance you like.
