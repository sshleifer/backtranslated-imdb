I have not seen writing reviews on the IMD unless I was very surprised how good, or bad, is a movie. This movie is in the first category. Every year, I try to see all those who are chosen for the Best External Movies on Oscars, even those I know I will not like. "As in Heaven" seems to fit the bill. Color shows sugar and feeling and slowly .... For my taste, which runs mostly towards the original, dark and / or interesting movies (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, Modern Japanese / Korean Art) "As in Heaven" not particularly attractive .... It was not released in the United States, so I watched the VCD I found in Singapore, preparing "to cross the list". After a good start, “As in Heaven” it becomes an unfamiliar film where it is considered true and happens on the screen. Poor Pole: Participants in the film are "clean" shares - a injured baker, City Manager, beaten wife, a lost woman with Love, a minister who is a .... For thanks, they are an interesting group, well written and done well. Inger Olsson, as the wife of Inger's minister, would have been elected to Oscar and had his performance in English. What power: music is good, and the main song, singing with Gabriella, is very wonderful and memorable. And keep an eye on the 87-year-old actress who played with Olga, who continues to play with the young women! I can't discuss the end, but I will say it is important. They are a lot of emotional things happening at the end of the film, and you are not sure why they are happening. Although nothing is described in words, it is all important if the movie comes to the right crescendo. **** out of *****. Perhaps the most powerful Swedish movie I ever seen.
