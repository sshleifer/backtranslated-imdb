I enjoyed this film yet I loved it because I wanted to help this person! I am in fifty years and I have many friends in the music business ... who are now trying to become adults .... no fans, groupies, money etc. ... and they have a hard time fixing for normal life ... like they see a new band etc. get a watch ... it's almost like they should start again ... this film is a covenant why many old rocky rocks from 70 and 80's are now through .... and that's where I get a sad and trouble film .HAPA shows the life of the old rock and lost-reliable way. The little girl who comes to her home has reminded them of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is one woman in the film will be happy. This film should be made for people aged 50 who have seen an increase and the collapse of the band, people who knew members, and watching them hurt when the age comes in, and popularity fades. but in a good way .... because of the whale. YOU WANT TO GET!
