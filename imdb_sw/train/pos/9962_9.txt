I was afraid to watch this movie due to their standards. But living in Italy's names like this never comes and I love so much that I have decided to try it. And I was very surprised! The story is different from any movie that I have seen recently, with a deeper meaning than "win". It touches and is well written and is properly directed. Raya is a very strong character, I love the fact that she can never get involved with herself, she is mature and focusing on AWARE of her tALENT (and it's talented Rutina Wesley has, my jaw dropped into the last dance area). The way he makes his dream and refusing to let anything stop him is, honestly, motivating. Also, the fact that he is not a common chick of fire (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it attractive and real. Hardly, why is this film so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good job. Really really. I cried even at the end of the movie. And the order of play is just sick.
