I thought the whole movie played for the beauty and new pictures and movies that attracted the whole way that way. Participants were on their feet the character in a short time and looked great. Music was strong and thoughtful. It had even lost in the last honor. So what does everyone vote? The story was not quite clean (it seemed like a "Running Man" and a whole idea of ​​the television show), but the view of Christianity and Judaism about how the public takes the Messiah to them actually seems really enough. It was wise to follow a man placed in front of a modern crowd and put him into action because of his opportunity. It is possible that Christians or other religious people take this because the movie has the word "God" in it, but that shows what filmmakers tried to do is teach the possibilities for people who probably didn't see the world like this, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been accepted more and more and forget about others. <br /> <br /> I gave 7/10 stars here to IMD. I thought everything of the movie was entertaining and natural, for many parts. See if you miss too much to watch a leisure film from Madrid, Spain, about the possibility of a modern Messiah coming near the TV.
