I haven't seen this film, but it is necessary. After reading three books of Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) I am looking for a full copy of this film. The Peruvian which moved to the Polynesia alive and well. Considering that these workers did not have GPS, and only the old radio valve (tube) and the output of 6-watt, their trip was the hero to say the least. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of this video. I would like to be willing to sell it.
