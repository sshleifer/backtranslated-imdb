This is a great movie, shows what our government will go to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as that of Reagan and Bush of the same number that made South America, but the United States is still unsuitable to trade with other countries like this. These movies also prove that the US media is providing government propaganda. This is what they did in Aristide in Haiti. The reason for the fight against Chavez was not successful is Chavez elected for more than 90%. This movie is not just a political document, it would still be a great film if it would be a wonderful game, it's amazing that this is true. Another inspector is asleep when he says "Chavez holds airwaves", private media runs Chavez's propaganda at all times.
