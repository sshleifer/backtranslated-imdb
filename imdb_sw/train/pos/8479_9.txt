Look at this several times as a child had 15 years of experience, and now that I've again has a movie experience like a few others. If it is risky, it is a good demonstration of ethics and life lessons proposed by looking for families and young children. Although it remains to be an adult, I was lucky to learn from many times over the years. Trying to get today is hard enough. . . but I believe I am worth it no matter what age. Particular fans will actually get this great entry into the Masami Even film. For the work of amazing art and special designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a valuable experience. While some tracks are not very popular when they are written in English, the music logo is still interesting. But even the voice of acting is better than presented today. Unfortunately it has been published in the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video, and did not receive the release of a new format for my skills, at least US. Look hard and you will be quite satisfied! It's amazing, powerful, fun, and useful in Japanese animation.
