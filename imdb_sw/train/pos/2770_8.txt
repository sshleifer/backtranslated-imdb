Looking at David & Bathsheba is the best way to get your Bible study going to Sunday school. Besides the script which is often not recommended to stimulate the film is very entertaining. The label system had its own errors but it had no cost when the proper production was asked. Peck describes King David as an ambitious but hurtful poet who does what is similar to Bathsheba sexy murder, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as a prophet prophet gives his typical service and strict performance. Check out the star screen of silent Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and the boy Gwen Verdon as a player. Hooray for Old Testament and Hollywood.
