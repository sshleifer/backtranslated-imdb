Well, what can I say, this film has found me, not so bad, as many say, I liked it very much, though the idea seems to be so simple, and rather interesting, it isn't. First of all I enjoyed the sound of the sound (Bryan Adams), in fact it goes with the movie. Second story simple, and the game of the Spirit you find. One thing that I like most is that they did not give the human voice a voice to interact with other horses, it makes the movies real, not many drawings seem like real now, but ... I don't know, making animals talking is just so ... blind. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful drawings of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend to everyone, not just kids :), because it is very relaxing.
