I liked to show this growing and I still look at the DVD's first season at the age of 19 today. What can I say? I grew up in a house like a Full House. I had a father, two sisters, and a dog. I think the only difference is that I had no uncle and my best father. I also grew up with my mother at home. I don't know what I would do without a Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played with Kirk's sister Cameron Candace), and Michelle (Played with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can share it with each other because I am a child of my family like Steph, I am a little sister like Michelle, and I am a sister like D.J. I have loved how exhibitions always have ethical values ​​because I am not equal to any OC displays. like today. I would like the comedy of Full House, too. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier), and Danny (Bob Saget) are ignorant as the uncle of the girls, the father of the father, and the father, respectively. The story is going to be, after the mother of the dead die, a good friend of Danny Joey and her son-in-law, Jesse goes in to help children. Three men who try to add three little girls = few. Each character in the Full House is full of heart, funny, and really reliable. Joey is a passionate player with a heart and spirit. Jesse is swift, riding a motorcycle, a hard uncle who has been reduced by his three stars, and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show.
