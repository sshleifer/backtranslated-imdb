This movie (with any title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) has brought me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him, he seemed to be the best fighter. Practical features in this film are great! There's a lot of them too, by the way. The recruitment of the HQ in Peace Peace is very good. There is only about one person who cuts out of a group of people who is very happy. And for all others: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Such roles are suitable for him (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and attitude like the eyes, and was a good opponent for Wincott in this movie.
