I can't understand the negative comments about this film. Yes it's usually a boy-meets with romance but it is done by a flair with a police like that just when it jumps. Henstridge (talk about winning the gene! There is a chemistry between the two leads; This film is alive when they share the area - lots! It's done so well that you find yourself ready to be together. If you are already happy, then you will be female. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, Male, from UK and romantic love still looking for her Princess ...)
