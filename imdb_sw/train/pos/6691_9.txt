This movie is very fun. What makes it better is two things: one is a straightforward approach that deals with discrimination, and talk of clothing and their strength. There is a wonderful effort for the skill that is very interesting; The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani is worthy of note as something of Mr. Furious desires. There is a talented boat here. I realize some of the high expectations can be disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.
