I call me a boy but I really think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to get a few of the recent Star Trek series, you should look at this completely. Probably more than the Caretaker of Voyager, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, the adventures of Archer are quite different, but it's very amazing ... Music also attracts. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one part of Star Trek - and these installations are waiting for it.
