The red eye is not a type of film that will win Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been the same kind of director, however, and his score is a good indication of what the film style can expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is very tight, the undemanding package in 94 minutes is part of its charm and the craven clues of the craft in lightweight, but generally enjoyable, office box office. In fact, it is a perfect type of movie to show as a leisure entertainment, focus-keeping without putting any mental or emotional problems to the viewer. Overall there is a sense of cheesy for conspiracy, unknown small terrorist impulse and support characters, and the main part has to feel the TV movie. However, there are obvious elements of emphasis on Hitchcockian, and Schumacher's spellings of Phone Booth, which are finally more sophisticated (and engaging in playing) on ​​one idea of ​​the emotional crisis being played outside the public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airplane seats, lives or dies on characters and script. Cillian's ic but wise Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams wise Lisa is the main reason the film is being done. It is not only to make the conversation increase but also to give some type of Rib type of Adam into the 'logical logic' conflict against female understanding. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the film Craven drives a bit of shouting player like a striker-girl with a knife. The most amazing revelation here is what Brian Cox appears after the 'Just for Men' treatment, his appearance of ubiqutous in the film as different from Super Troopers, The Ring and this makes it a sexual version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short delay.
