Things that come are the Sci-Fi movie that shows the world you think, or “Everytown” for 100 years. You can break it up to 4 parts or different parts. The film is from 1940 to 2036 and refers to how this ruler or "Lord" wanted to be able to fly on the airplane again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out. <br /> <br /> This film only has about 3 errors: the sound is mud and the video has some quirks, the characters are not quite detailed, and the overall plot is not quite stable. The program does not exist which I cannot put my finger on ... it looks just a "little". But if you love sci-fi and you are interested in what H.G. Wells though it may happen in the next hundred years, this must be seen. It is important to see just what everyone was afraid: a long battle, offered, because they were almost just going to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. The things that come are a very good movie that most people need to see immediately.
