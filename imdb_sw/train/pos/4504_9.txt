Here I thought "Nanook to the north" was the last word in semi-doc 'eskimo' movies. Its okay! As a marine sea kayaker I stayed up to 330am to look at this view of the 'leather boats'. The movie did not leave me down. Any construction of kayak / umiak construction should have a look at here. (See for SKA's colleagues: they seem to be using the Norton Sound crack and one paddles of blade). Although there were others as they felt some back-shot-fakey-bits movie has very much they are a little annoyance. It was (from this romantic view of the man) probably the perfect time to make this film. Earlier thirty years: 'talkies' are new that (including Louie B. Mayer!). And there was a lot that was still, despite the imported, true melodrama. They are really whacking that bear polar, that whales and caribou. The fifty-year edition of this film would be very fun and 'stars', Technicolor, etc. to strengthen. Seven-year edition? What? The best friend of the best film is "the shadows in the southern sea" (1928) Geography mirror for "Eskimo" is also concerned with weather disruption and technology for people who have no views.
