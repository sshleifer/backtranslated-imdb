Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy art for some time now, and possessing some of his books, I had some expectations of what I saw. What I got is a perfect thing, and a little more than I expected. Being a own artist (I work in the soil), getting inspiration in our environment to make beautiful art is important, and it's something Andy Goldsworthy has learned. Following him over the year, the director takes energy, skill, and dedication to the relationship of artists and nature with a stimulating flair. The music posted on the film reminds you and irritates. If you are an artist who needs leadership, or anyone else who needs experience to strengthen, then look at MOVIE HILI. I am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Build, play, cope with natural forces to make our world very beautiful.
