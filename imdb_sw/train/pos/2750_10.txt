This is the kind of American movie that does not do. That's why people give foreign taxes. It is a good story about how one person, even if he lost can make a person get a reason in an unlimited life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with mental challenges face their lives and show them in a real way (I think). As its classic in this movie movie this movie has an end, but that makes it only the best movie.
