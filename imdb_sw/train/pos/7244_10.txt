This is the only film of the film feature of the world class. I got the first 10 minutes slowly, but after that, the movie is perfect in describing the professional grade players and how they get about living. <br /> <br /> Other displays are very funny. I don't think that a player who is not a bridge will find the charm of this film. <br /> <br /> Some of the clothes are very beautiful, sad movie that's black and white - I can just imagine what they would look like colors. Ways in which media are displayed are completely hilarious. No way on the world class will be like that. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible, and tell your friends about it.
