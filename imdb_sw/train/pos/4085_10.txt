If you were born all the time this movie was completed, and I had a free / open family that I had, I am sure during the early 80's you would like to enter first to your parents watching films or dirty movies. You know, not 100% of pornography but instead of the alchemical mix of the real game and pornography pictures, or that you would enter their collection and pop in the representation of the plastic line of the film in a big dookie machine called VHS. You were very calm with the ninja but you still have a small heart failure when loud pop sounds are made when you push the tablet buttons. In any case, these films have been sent back to your mind, waiting and waiting to be connected to the "art" to see. Needless to say, this film is similar to the preliminary information for "T". Many people will say about the sexuality of the film sex but perhaps because I am desensitized, I more distract from the trick. What? The Creator spoke to us about the depths of human life and what can be considered to be a truly disgusting, tribal relations, bed sex, voyeurism, or it may be a desperate state for the state of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or the sexuality of the female civil society in the 18th century France? Who can say, but in spite of Mr. Borowcyzk's taste clearly, sex is “normal” for his work, I would say that this video actually speaks to the viewer on a comprehensive level about the state of the brain. Once you learned this, the story was much more interesting than the giddiness of the value of shock and there before, it's good to explore out.
