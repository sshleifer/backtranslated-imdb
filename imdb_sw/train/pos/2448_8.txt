Yes, on top, yes it's a little clichéd and yes, Constance Marie is a whole child and deserves to see it again and again! Jokes and gags can get old and repeat over time but the show is still fun looking. Since the family demonstrates a humorous breakdown and the authors have incorporated family values ​​and interests between magags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously and win the show. I am sure he was not interested in his bad behavior or a paragon of kindness. His anger and the glee's voice are hilarious ... I must say that one big, dark, bitter is Benny. I hate the habit ... so much as he goes on for more than 30 seconds I just turn the TV so I don't have to listen to him. There is nothing interesting about his conversation or his joke. If the mother should be worse there and I am surprised and surprised that George, as a character, could stand up with someone for a long time. Even at any time when I get to see Benny I think myself: to see him better than to watch Bill Engvall Show. Now there is a bad sitcom ...
