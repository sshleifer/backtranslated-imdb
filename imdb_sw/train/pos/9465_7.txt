Steve Carell once again star in a small romantic film about choice, family and pressure. By judging on the art and plot of the film which I expected comedy-out-out, a lot of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Certainly the movie had a particular comedy, but I felt more Drama light for me and Steve Carell again made great performance. The movie itself is experiencing a real investigation and that was a feature of the power I got. But, the end was a little and predictable. Through-out, the movie was great, acting was good and the message given was obvious but still very important. Although, it happened in the past, the end of the flat and predictable. I would like to decide if a different choice was made at the end of the film (perhaps for bad, even) this film would have a much better broadcast. It's still an enjoyable movie.
