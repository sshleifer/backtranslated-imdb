In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the leading directors of the cinema and good founders, created a gem of a light comedy which with all its light is a wonderful and professional film that has made it possible for filmmakers such as Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. This way, the magic story of a poor artist who succeeds in a lottery jackpot, but needs to find a city seat everywhere for a lost ticket, essentially a tool to support a series of incredible comic events in the dream world of fantasy director. One of the most amazing things about this film is that, although it is installed in the center of Paris and it does not include anything impossible, it achieves a sustainable and consistent condition of fairy / fantasy, which seems to be natural that people sing like as they speak, or that the role of the prophetic jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable feature is that Le Million includes what can be a funniest opera performed on the film (O that soprano blonde! "I laugh, ha! Ha!") Also happy is throwing: Clair has gathered an amazing group, character characters The difference, each pointing to the accuracy of the accuracy of the French type "type", so that the film looks like a set of Daumier passages live. Hilarity takes a little time to get rolling, and I have seen characters not as emotionally involved as they can be even in the light comedy (as it is, for example, in many films of Lubitsch.) For these reasons I prevented giving The highest score. But these small cavils should not be misleading from the suggestions of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Should you see? By all means. It is highly recommended if you want to work on movies with a great influence or comedy just for fun.
