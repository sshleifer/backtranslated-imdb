Yes his art ... in order to succeed in making a slower puzzles. The stories are revealed in great detail when you don't even know what happens. <br /> <br /> Good performance with Robin Williams. Sex experience in the film can be considered inappropriate and may affect how you enjoy the film. However, the primary plot is very involved. The movie does not rush you and still embrace enough to ask you wondering. The direction is good. Use of lighting to achieve the required effects of waiting and unexpected is good. Very good time 1 see if you are looking to put back and hear a lively exciting story!
