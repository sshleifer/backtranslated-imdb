The idea of ​​making a film about Beatles seems to lose the sense of losing, since no production can get the idea of ​​a real historical Beatles. Then maybe it is better not to try to restore the past, but to produce a more suitable model with other available Beatles devices. This is what 'Beatles' birth gives us, a simple story known to us without extra. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here **** /> ​​<br /> Be warned that not everything is right as some of the Beatles fighters can expect. Beatles seem to create songs that are not included yet. Beatles makes "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and even "Don't Worry". The Beatles students should see that if the Beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did in Hamburg, the small audience could no longer recognize the Beatles they had learned to know. The original repertoire of Hamburg only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" of Stu Sutcliffe is considered. Boys playing Beatles in this production are seen as natural, but some films still look good as the film is more accurate. The boy who plays Lennon does well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is good and when he climbs the Best Pete from the group is perhaps the most memorable place in the entire film. Also as a bonus you can find the original club of the Cavern in the film.
