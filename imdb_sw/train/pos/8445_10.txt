Killed: This was a good session to a well-written, guided and well-conducted series. The end was closed that was not used well at the end of the last season. The whole series, and especially the movie, gave life as a life (and death) in Baltimore, a unique economic city with the highest rate of murder. My focus on the series began long before moving to Baltimore, but once I got life here for myself, I realized how true it was. And that movie has taken that spirit. I will surely lose new series of events, but I am very grateful for NBC and manufacturers and cast to give us one last glance at the dark side of the City of Charm.
