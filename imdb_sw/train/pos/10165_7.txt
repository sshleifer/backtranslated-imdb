In fact my vote is 7.5. However, the film was good, it has such wonderful places to see, don't understand it, not the funniest film of the world, and not the original because of the idea that we have seen before the other movies, but this has its own taste, my friend told me that this was a film for male lovers ... I think it's not exactly but who cares? There is also another movie showing around the same topic, Chris Rock looks into it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one of its most amazing movie, check all if you want and I know that you accept that Mr Rock won with his movie. I would like to be the main character of the main character given Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
