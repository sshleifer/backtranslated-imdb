Hilarious begins to begin to describe this true kind of tour-de-Star-Wars-force (Luke: what power? Vader: the power of a small pony), where, being master him, even even breaking the sweat, carefully restraining mascara. and it has almost 2 hours of ringing its way of history, its place of birth, Europe, and more. From the center of Heimlich-of-the-Night, "I've changed cunning!" for the British Empire. "Do you have a flag?" and the old gods of death, "Jeff! God of Biscuits!" and much more, this is a fish-flop-on-floor-to-jumpstart-lung funny. And I confess to having passed over this video several times over the years, seeing if the suspension of the UK, looking at the seat, is a long lease after all, especially back to 10 years now. However, the material is not only timeless but is very close, turning the present day into nothing more than a delightful version, the funnier / sad where we were in the last ten years, though coming to think about it, that can only be bad luck.
