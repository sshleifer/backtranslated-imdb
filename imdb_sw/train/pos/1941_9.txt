I really thought this is a comedy and stay watching it expect to laugh my ass away. soon it became clear this is not a comedy, or at least not 'Jim Carrey type' one. what we have looked at is the characters - the movie begins with some very good, worried people, gathered together to try and fight one of their core fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we begin to get a little in their lives, to witness their trouble, I think of their imagination. I really have made it more dark than it is, and instead of a series of events soon brings light and hope of their lives. I probably didn't look at the movie I knew not comedy but it was a drama, but I had a good time, I enjoyed the story and I didn't remember it spent about 90 minutes with it. Many films recognize the split between people in the western world, this film shows how people can get together and help each other / and â€œwith the light of the day of death you meet him, don't let him pass and leave, don't open, he's your gift from the sun ...
