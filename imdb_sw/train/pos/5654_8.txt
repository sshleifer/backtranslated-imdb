I looked at the past 10 years and liked it !!! Now I have taken a DVD and I was looking at a series, and waiting for the events I knew were in the show (when Lucas fights Gail at his home) and realizing it was missing - suddenly I was looking at fraud without leading up. Then I went to the line of exploring all the stars of the stars and getting views on the outdoor show. Thank you !!!!! But there seems to be a crisis. Other comments say "Alien 19th and Triangle 20, sometimes he made them another way. And also the 5 Potato Potatoes, and Dead to World 6, were also changed.
