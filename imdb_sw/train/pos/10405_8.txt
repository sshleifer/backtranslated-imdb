This film was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike other films that I liked at the time the Bagdad Thief has taken the same quality when I grew up. This is not just a fun film with children, it can look and enjoy with adults as well. Only from there, is that one can not see the harmful effects (compared to the effects today) if one can at one time be a child. I did not remember any of these effects, of course it was almost ten years since I had seen this film, when I was eleven years old. Who looks at the effects? One seeks good news and entertainment and this is exactly what this film offers. In my mind this movie is one of the first 20th century movies. Come to think I feel like Indiana Jones movies like this film. There is a comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mix that will catch you from the beginning to the end and though the film is old and music and the style of the film is clearly not modern, it succeeds without being dust and old. All of this is mainly due to great stories, good leadership and good performers. In the Sabu department (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) comes out, providing comedic and films for most parts. The great film and though 'oldie', obviously 'goldie'. I hope someone has a brain and guts to extract this one on a DVD day. About 8 out of 10
