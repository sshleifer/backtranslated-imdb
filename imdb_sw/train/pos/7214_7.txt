The Deathtrap of Ira Levin is one of these secret films in the traditional Sleuth which will be very easy to destroy any screening of the film. So I will be briefly saying that it relates to playing, one who is a famous secret writer, another person who is a trusted writer, a player's player who is very young and sexier than a mandatory role, and a German-minded The journey. Sidney Lumet director, no guest for the film, is very good for the most part in building the tension film requires motor. Talk is quick, clean, and beautiful. Michael Caine is growing in such roles. Christopher Reeve can be used and actually grows on you more than you see him doing. Worth Irene stands as a funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? How Lumet made it behind him in the very best pants and was wearing the toes around him, but he feels so much in this role - the role that should be given to an old actor and one really disliked. But why should you avoid the apparent attempts of corruption to his male audience when nothing will change it now? Death's death is exciting, modern, magic, and classy. The secret has some errors that hinder somewhat, and I was not quite satisfied with the end, but looking at Caine and Reeve under the leadership of Lumet and the Levin's raised versiage was enough to insert my interest and make it capture all the length of the film.
