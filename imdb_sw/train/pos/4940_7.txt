This movie is about human relationships. Attractive, beautiful, and well-written, and meaningful texts. It seems that Morgan Freeman is very happy. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I am very pleased with her performance. A woman if she is a good incentive to learn Spanish language. From the time Morgan Freeman meets Paz Vega's best, the view is taken on a nearby trip to two visitors who learn to care for their lives. 10 or Low items are on the zest of life. If you would like to enjoy this film also see the Pursuit of Happiness and Will Smith and his son. That's not an act of act or comedy nude. Its all about human relationships.
