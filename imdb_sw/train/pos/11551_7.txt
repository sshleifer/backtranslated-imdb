ODD COUPLE (3 + more than 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like many people I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the "Odd Couple" of the point. Their amazing work on the television series from the beginning to the mid-70s was the highest score of television at that timeâ€¦ more easily than the action versions and story screens. However, how can you go wrong with Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau connecting? Matthau is a very good type like Oscar, slob. Lemmon takes a bit of use as Felix, especially if you have seen the best performance of Tony Randall. Script is good ... definitely Neil Simon better. (I'm going to go to the record here as saying that Neil Simon is probably one of the biggest exhibitions of the American show series.) The story is simple: Felix, a good player who has separated from his wife goes with Oscar, a slope who needs help to save money for The payment of alimony. Their living arrangements are very similar to marriage as well, and some of the most beautiful tiffs and spats. Lots of fun with some great liners.
