Actually, the idea of ​​this television series may come from the great achievements that Ally McBeal enjoys all over the world, even here in Germany. However, this said, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> Two main characters work well together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played with the famous German actress, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, to get that ???), played with the most beautiful Rebecca Immanuel, regularly sharing romantic roof and continue investigating each other while working on criminal cases such as crime in Berlin and the environment. Additionally, they are assisted by the cast of co-stars, especially their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a natural gem with great capacity of comic. Also, the trader of the wheels, Otto, and the best of Felix's cradle, Frank, works well, not forgeting Sandra's best friend and partner of the room, Patricia, played with Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All in all fun enjoy Monday nites: it is not surprising that the series and his stars have received several awards. What? Felix get Sandra? I hope that we will wait for more events to know ......
