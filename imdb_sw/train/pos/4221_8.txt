I liked a piece but it seems to me there must be a quick reference to the secretary to be punished effectively that it is an accomplice after reality. When I like when Columbo has a predictable failure like this, his resolution should be part of the conclusion of the event, as well as the revealing of the killer. Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon are very valuable. At one time, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes a comment about Lt. The famous Columbo, urging them to translate in the shade language for the popularity of life as a crime solution. This is one of the many colonies of Columbo.
