The group is betrayed poorly as a "Se7en". Surely there is no reason to compare these two, except perhaps with such a situation in the final match. Now that doesn't exist I'll get in why Flock is very interesting for some things. Particularly a piece of drama rather than a full-time social worker who looks at sexual offenders. At the outset you can clearly see his work better for him. It appears in two instances where he first interviews the offender and beat him by the second when a woman tries to take him and all he can think of is his usual questions from his questionnaire. Gere is very good like Errol Babbage, a social worker who said earlier. His way of doing his work is not different from that of a police officer, carrying a gun and he always checks the newspapers and gives lawyers and explanations if some of his "group" can be responsible for sexual crimes. He is also a person who has lost all the joy of living with his help alone seems to be based on defending his own right to his flock. Twice he smiles a smile, once he apologizes for treating his partner carefully and another after being beaten by a member of his group. <br /> <br /> As flick suspended, The Flock is not successful. Somewhat confused with good holes of the plot but it has a number of amazing pieces. The Group is a strong drama about a person who is making a misleading job and eventually works hard to avoid swallowing and a hole around it. The world we live in is a good place for the sick and one more can separate yourself from the most happy person. The group gets that step in beauty.
