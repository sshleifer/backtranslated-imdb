That is in my opinion, better than one of the 1990s, but it's still not all good. It feels dated, perhaps because it is, but it stands well compared with other pieces of the BBC 1980s as well as Mansfield Park and Abbey Northanger. The length of these reforms allows for the better efficiency of the book than the version of the 90s, and St. John Rivers are at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but Jane's actress is very old. There is a range of variations for this TV length that you have over the user you used.
