This is one of the most beautiful parts of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has trouble with women ... He kills all, is often victims (Sulugu of Screwfly, Pro-life, Valerie on level, I don't remember the part of Argento in 1 season, etc., for sure Imprint. I think she enjoys watching women have wanted to be burned, tortured, destroyed and I don't know. Never downgrade "Right to death" is one of the most beautiful, with a good turn and graphic scenes and suspense (especially with images from the cell area, incredible). Acting as a whole series, I would often be as bad as "Pro-life" or "We shout for Ice Cream". Also I think the plot can be made for the film and not just for the period. The series of worship is horrible, killing and leaving women, strengthening animals and continuing ... The first season was better than the second and events like "Cigarrette burns" (Best of all), "Homecoming" (Funny more ), "Imprint" (amazing fact).
