At first I took this film for my daughter since she loved so much in soccer - and I have not been disappointed in this way (except the plot interfered with soccer competitions). As a father I think I was a little surprised at the introduction of a lesbianism topic - but we must admit that as a parent these issues are entirely available to children today (if worries if I feel the topic). In this sense this feeling was hard on the core of the film - that at some point you should believe your children make their own choice. This is brought up by a British-born young girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of the East-Indian heritage who has a dream of playing professional football. The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many opportunities for her to explore (in a good way) her hopes and fears for the future. Various cultural challenges were a very interesting approach to detect the confusion of Jess and his parents' expectations for him - no longer a difference in substances than many parent relationships. In SUMMARY, football events are huge (lots of learning in slowmo) and when I don't need a story - something needed to put the film.
