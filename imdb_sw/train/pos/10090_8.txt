I prepared a travelogue of turgid talky soap opera cum, but I enjoyed getting a quick script, a basic, beautiful performer from all actors, especially Peter Finch, special effects of surprising, insistence, and good performances - there was even a shot of Muslim stone stones recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor for a very beautiful and compassionate woman, before giving her to the gaspy organs that destroyed her future career. All players have helped to move around, and I wonder who taught them all. Speaking of a sequence of stone-Buddha, you can really realize that it is Vivien Leigh in long shots. Its structure and the way it goes are different from Taylor. The only thing that relates to the sequence is well-developed shots, where history goes very fast for horses during walking. If you want a film that stimulates ideas that are good to watch and never boring, spend a few hours and walk the elephant.
