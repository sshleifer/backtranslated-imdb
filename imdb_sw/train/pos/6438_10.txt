"Well he nimelen" as above below. This special point where God and Man meet. I ADORE this film! Gem. IT'S amazing grace! I was greatly transferred by its humanity quality. I laughed and cried through the entire record, in fact several octaves of feeling. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist Is BRILLIANT as Daniel, the first level of enthusiasm of performance, charismatic and strong. Its inner light and unique talent shines everywhere, every interaction, in every meeting. I had quite mesmerized, enchanted and took the story, which is our common story, the story of life itself. The film also included many archetypes, molecular, injured child, magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abuse, victim, abuser, the fool of God - all true and really for life - all awakened love and compassion in me. It is actually treated to see such a thought-provoking but fun, entertaining film. Oh .. do not forget the heavenly choir of angels and a beautiful voice. THANK YOU ALL - This Swedish film will certainly captivate people around the world. MONTH!
