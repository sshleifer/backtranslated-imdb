Movie's First Trier movie I saw was breaking the waves. Certainly a good movie but it is definitely located in the shade of europa. Europa says the story of German and American youth who wants to learn Germany only after the second world war. He takes the job his uncle has planned for him as a businessman on a good train. As a result of his work, he travels through almost completely damaged demolition, meeting traffickers, and hunting for former Nazi members. The community faces corruption. His uncle has reduced his confidence by considering his work as a train worker. Unfortunately the main character is involved in bombing and terrorism and a group called 'werewolves' encourage them to help to put bombs on the train. It's amazing. The viewer is taken from the location to the location where the person tries to put the viewer under hypnosis and then count it up in a new location. Only when you think you have seen a lot !!!!!!! europe!
