When I saw the Baby Girl I loved him so much I walked to see every film of Nicole Kidman I could, just get all to be disappointed with it. I have the theory that when the presence of a certain star assures a certain degree of quality because of their artistic control, and Nicole Kidman's influence makes it difficult to enjoy the film - IMHO. So for example, Dogville, even deprived the viewer of anything seen to prevent the awareness of his presence, or other films that promote gay and lesbians if they are eligible for anyone's attention, or other reasons for Kidman. He / she is a natural woman and does a very good job. I don't know how or who could stop him, but it seems to work. The film shows its opening despite its resistance to the heart of what makes the woman a woman. And so, what causes the hopes of a desperate person to reach a lot can reach. Of course, the reality of male leadership changes from the milquetoast clerk to the person in the role of one film looks like a fantasy of male extension, but its change is sufficiently reliable. It is not dirty made as it was in a film that was designed to strengthen male male. Rather it focuses on the importance of the growth of the unique nature of the film. It also does not change how criminals are shown as human beings, far from their crime messages. His group has a strong and cooperative relationship with the American culture. And when they are his enemies, not his enemy. In fact, they teach him to compete. I was amazed at the ability of Kidman to see Russian. I was wondering if his parents were Russian, but there were no pictures that I investigated. Maybe it's just a makeup but it was amazing. I can only hope that they hit him on the head again soon so he can return to another beautiful film. Despite my free digs for Mrs Kidman, the message is this excellent film in every way and maybe a chance of life.
