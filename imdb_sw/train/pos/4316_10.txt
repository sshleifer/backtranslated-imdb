I tell you Grand Canyon is one of the most relevant movies I have ever seen. I have looked at it now and still feel like I did the first time; that this film, itself, can create a whole curriculum for post-graduate course in the direction of the film. The long-time tricks of the tractors used, "It will make them laugh, will make them cry." That's a great and short way to describe what the Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in human experience and the second takes you to the gates of hell. Many movies are going to go back and forth among people that are almost happy and the same people have almost scared. It's always a short step, too. In order to simply manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or spread it is an expert figure. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (type) comes. Having found the audience making and returning through the emotional spectrum, the film gives us the corners of the sequence that does not move out of good and bad and instead increases from the common marital mate, through a self-wound self-wound that may or may not require sewing, for an earthquake that is involved in the house. During their aid, a forgotten point, cutting a finger forgotten, an earthquake was healed, a neighbor woman called for her elderly husband to drop. Couples run for his help. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw. I cry now. It's not the sadness that makes me this. It's not a sad chain. What my tears is that this few minutes of film was PERFECT. That's PERFECT! It's amazing. (The end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is a lot to say about Grand Canyon. It shows ordinary people who see epiphanies and enables the viewer to try them effectively. They have no surprise or eliminates with no long pause to explore when carefully. The film continues to speed up life. Even when participants are trying to understand what happened, they are not sure what comes from their experience. Grand Canyon is a very human film.
