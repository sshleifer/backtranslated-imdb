A close collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (without a few days Mann worked on Night Night before leaving the company with a star under favorable conditions), Far Country shows his usual look to give another photo of a man the offender was freed regardless of his own redemption, to fight every step of the way. At this time he is a cattle driver who responds to work problems - the challenge of the troubled cowhands for gunfight at the end of the election - the results of his cattle were taken by the judge of John McIntire of Roy Bean school and systematic. To change them again through the Canadian border, they soon find themselves uncomfortable in a growing dispute between the operators and the judge if they mislead or kill them because of their demands ... , he is a shocking defendant on the way, even using his desire to be left alone to excuse not a group of retired gunmen approaching when he has a chance because it is not his problem. For many films there is only a scope of hair between him and McIntire, something that the judge realizes at once, revealing in the company of a relative's spirit even though he plans for his lynch. In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in it are probably aware of it - in spite of their appeals for their deaths and burial, there is an unconscious understanding that the only person who can stand up to the judge is as bad as he is. As usual with Mann there is a unique use of the top country areas, although at the end the end is being done at a minimum, and the film is close to the greatest support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (although the romantic interest of Corinne Calvert) persuades them. With sad movies the Canadian Rockies has been made a few favor for the transfer of normal DVD, and only the trailer of the exhibition as an extra.
