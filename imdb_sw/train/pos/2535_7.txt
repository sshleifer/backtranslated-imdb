Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) finds Radi X - a great force used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh is affected by Radium and begins to darken - and his touch causes acute death. Dr Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) continues to fight - but Rukh begins to hell because of Radium and medicine and sets out to kill all he has done. <br /> <br /> The program is silent and "harmful" producing Karloff in the dark is laughable, but this is still a little fun of the chiller. It goes fast, it has at least a good (see "house" of Rukh and the movie begins at night of darkness and rain) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) provides good performances. There is also a good acting with Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's okay but not down below all other films of Karloff / Lugosi. The program is too far for me to swallow. I still liked this. I offer 7.
