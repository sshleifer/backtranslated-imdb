I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and I think it was strange, especially since it was the foundation of a real person. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the only English man who took a half-half-year-old Gray Owl. Photography was good. <br /> <br /> This movie made me do more research in this behavior Archie Belaney known as easy as Gray Owl. I want to read as I can about it. When I didn't know Richard Attenborough had led it. But I am not surprised. I like all movies if he does or leads. I gave the highest score. However, I'd like to see more on the film about WHY she took this persona as it showed only two aunt who raised her room at home. You can not go inappropriate with this film if you are like me and enjoy beautiful stories without hearing the wrong language and affecting specific effects every few minutes.
