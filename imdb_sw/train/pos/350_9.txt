I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they played on my movies that they liked. When I saw Valentine, I wondered how the story of the story was so great. Kill me by seeing that it has a minimum because it was not awesome. Few vendors and actors played partly by the way and the way it ended was brilliant and cunning. Some cases were abnormal and poor, and I admitted in small portions was just a little boring, but in general it was non-stop entertainment and suspenseful. It had a line of misunderstanding that made you think the whole way and deserved to lose everything. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially Valentine's Day because it certainly gives you a ton of crops. O, and don't worry even the trailer OR rating, please, don't know ...
