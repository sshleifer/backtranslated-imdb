I am a man to go on foot, and the lowest taste. However, I often try to add a bar to my cultural knowledge. This movie was one of my experiments. I was scared in the whole movie. I liked that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotional movie. I saw as a big question for the viewer: What? Is the sacrifice of sacrifice for the responsibility a person can accept, can be asked to accept, should he accept? As a military member, this is really an important question to me. This question is too much for the viewer of this film. It is recommended.
