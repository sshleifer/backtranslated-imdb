Hrm-I think that the line was from an old movie poster. This is a dumb movie that appears to have been translated from a language that was not known to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie starts with black screens and reading text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise should not be explained to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that, instead of fighting war, nations have boys growing into big robots and duke are out to decide, well, that never never clear, but maybe The most important thing. There are good people (actually builders, ie "we") and bad people (Commies!) And there are great robots to stop. Sadly, the effects of the effects were very good, t get to see many big robots. There are a lot of interior events cheaper, and then a great chance to fight near the end. Fighting space is very good, as it serves correctly without purpose except the remainder of the remainder of the budget effect. The money said now it is used, the decline of the decline is decreasing (and I have not done this over) two young people are fighting for sticks. I can always get laughter in the bar by enhancing the last location, complete with the last line guaranteed to leave the audience blowing their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said - it's dumb. That's why I bought a tape.
