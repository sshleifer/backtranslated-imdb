I was very happy to fight a girl. It's something that I could watch from time to time. Acting was amazing and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. I can say very much. The movie shows how women should stand for what they want to do in life. He was very sympathetic and still very hateful at the same time. Dealing with an unknown father did not help him a lot. Even though he loved him he was very hateful. Her mother died when she was young and also put her sadness in the role. The story of love was a place I enjoyed most in the film too. I felt a passion for someone else. Then another game puts and then as he chooses between his girlfriend and his long dream. I thought it was just perfect. It was the last type where you should decide what happened for the future for them. For all people who love the movie according to the game and the good plot I recommend you look at this one
