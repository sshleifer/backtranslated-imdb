The story of a thief of Bagdad (as he has been written) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who played Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, delivery of the "Thief of Bagdad," and less set, recent attempts. The best, however, still the 1940 version which in its time was amazing, the panoply magic of the only high impact. The same effect still works their charm <br /> <br /> No less than six directors are listed for the movie technicolor which dramatized Sabu as a thief boy, Abu, John Justin as King dreamily in love power, Ahmad and June Duprez. as a lovely princess is wanted by Ahmad and follow it to the evil minister, Jaffar, played by sinister Conrad Veidt. Great Genie is used by Rex Ingram. Ahmad has taken Jaffar to the trick and was later arrested by the snakes, he and the boy, Abu, are facing what is enough. Ahmad has been blinded by Abu becoming a popular mutt. Their adventures through gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but special effects make this film work. Two men were involved everything from a flying carpet to a big shipping genie who POP out of a bottle with a tornado like a black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, made a special impact for the 1961 edition of this film. Justin of Ahmad is engaged in romantic love but is a dream that has never had an erotic influence. Sabu is actually a central actor in many cases and he is very good. For a video of children and adults there is a fair amount of violence but of non-blood type. However, I don't think anyone under eight should see "Thief of Bagdad." <br /> <br /> This film makes it often appear on television but today my young son and I saw in the theater and quite a few young people now. It was good to see children living with computers in a profitable community responding to cheers and clapping with special effects that should appear to be the first to them. <br /> <br /> "The thief of Bagdad" is a classic pre-war of Hollywood from a time when the dynamics of power production were often positive and important results. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
