In 2000 it was a bad year for Indian films due to lack of quality and ideas from film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar alive nothing went out. The CCCC had a lot of illegally due to the filing of this film and not really know what the film is about producing good advertising and sales of high-ticket tickets near India and abroad. The only information presented is that it was the excitement of doubts. Now the film is released in 2001 and the film was quite amazing. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and it is well addressed. Salman and Preiti provides a good performance where Salman is not really good at all shirt ... even having special effects! Rani has a Salmans wife but it is the lowest job required to be compared to Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes a mother-in-law. Three major events confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have power over the screen and off the screen of the screen (apparently). The best Salman Khan plays a major role in the film as a successful businessman and is compassionate as a wannabe player in his other films as he has emerged in the film industry of Mumbai due to his film. Rani's character does not know Preiti is a prostitute to the end ... this has been taken from him and the rest of the family ... others should know if it will destroy the film if I tell you. All of these songs have been done well, especially by the head of the head. Other actors are doing less but better as Salmani's favorite families. Abbas Mastan has created a hit and handle the subject of the film wisely. I say to go and watch it or rent anything you prefer!
