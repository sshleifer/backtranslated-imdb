I thought "The River of Hearts" was a very beautiful Babylon 5 movie, and a unique exhibition from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was part of the series (without humor) it would probably be one of my special stand-alone stories. Personally, I have always loved Scoggins for a Christian, although it has been given to JMS not to write too many series and was forced to endure Byron / Telepath. If you take a smutty humor about publishers and actors "poor" in these events, then this movie is a strong thing. Probably my third favorite of four movies, but there is nothing wrong.
