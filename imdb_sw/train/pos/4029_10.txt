I have no words to describe how this movie is good. It is only professional as Amrita Pritam was able to write real-time exhibitions of the distribution days. The movie continued to make me many days. Urmila did his life's work in this film. He put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did not lower his position as Rashid. It is difficult to imagine anyone except these two working Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi dress was common in Urmila and Manoj looked like the typical Punjabi Musnalmaan. Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did a good job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the events that you can't just leave your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. The period is just a killer. I expected to expire in amazement but thanks, the end was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Not necessarily.
