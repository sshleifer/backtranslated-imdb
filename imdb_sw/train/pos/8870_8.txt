When John Singleton is present, he * * over *! And this is one of his best films. It's not as tight like Boyz-n-the-hood, but around it (and with a large amount of stellar cast). This film was written very well, very well put together, and beaten very well. There is too little to complain, and many of my complaints are high (for example: Where did Fudge earn money for 6 years of college and many expensive things? No mention of rich history ... And why Professor Phibbs have an office? its link * should * have oneâ€¦ And while we are, for a student of engineering, hick or not, Remy is a dumb character - I would like to think that she will have a little more through a basic mind - speaking and acting like buffoon total) <br /> <br /> But that far, the film was very bright. A good array of characters and comments views; and Singleton is not recommended sides in the story - many of the characters are not feeling, and he does a good job of intervening with Pantheracist scenes together to show folly to both sides. Most of the movies was better; I loved the area where Kirsty Swanson gets closer to Taryn and Wayne each was beaten together well. Malik / Deja's stories were also smoothly. The talk was much more sometimes; This film had a tendency to get * really sometimes, and also tends to hammer on your head when the points would be clear and out of transparency (we don't really need the American flag and 'UNLEARN' installed on it, giving a loan, we don't know ...) . And at the top, though * most of the time Singleton uses quite well melodrama, sometimes gets * way too cheezy (like Deja death, which is good until she cried 'WHY !!!' which just destroys the entire effect and location). <br /> <br /> But acting, in general, was on the line. The best performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I have ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could do?), Michael Rapaport (surprised the hell to me ... after a true Romance and Good Girls When I was one), and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * excellent. Is it downside? Jennifer Connelly was flat; although it is not entirely his fault: his role was normal and one-dimensional. Generic for high degree. And Tyra Banks, who were responsible, was not very few. He shouted and straightened and straightened. But another in a long line of fashion-turn-operators who failed miserably (though there are few who show discrimination to this law). <br /> <br /> Finally, sound sounds! Wow! Amazing sounds (which are obvious to buy!) Which fits the film as a glove. Each region has a twin song (although Tori songs are beginning * really * bothers me ... it's not his best job). Liz Phair, Rage Against Machine, Ice Cube ... how can one go wrong? <br /> <br /> All in all: look very good, cast in fact, great script, good film. 8/10.
