True, I have never bought it in the metal was the furniture and items, but this kind of film to play on that idea. Although it is certainly not a movie taking emphasis or a very high level, it does not serve its purpose for it to include when it is playing. The story has a metal band prepared and die in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream of this effect and said the band begins to go on killing a spree from outside the grave. So yes, a little bit of "Dream on Elm Street" plot continues here. In fact Freddy never hated the girl in the car before. There was another film with a strong metal band in it, but it was so different from the way it was like the band of the city's children and mad. This has only one fan of band type to help the soul of the killer at first and then try to stop him. There is nothing horrible in it if I don't remember all that many people are killed. In fact, the place that I missed most is the scene of a girl wearing head heads and then suffering from the body of the band organ. No big thing, but a good time to fill.
