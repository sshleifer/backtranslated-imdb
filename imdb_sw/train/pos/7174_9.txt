I drove him from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this film - and I am very happy. As a great fan of film and long life in northern California, I was amazed at how many Oscar films have been held in the Bay area. As a fashion manufacturer who wants to stay in the Bay area instead of going to LA, George Lucas's views on the progress, the community have a real vision has been made by me. Hey, if he and other filmmakers can make SF, they can also be other artists. It can recommend this film
