The dream of fantasy was a beautiful movie. There were good buttons, but that could be expected in a similar film made in a very short time. I did not feel encouraged to move forward during the movie and I found good entertainment. It gets silly type at times, but I generally recommend it. Perhaps they used on all the ornament in the nearest stores, and some of the textile designs were very good.
