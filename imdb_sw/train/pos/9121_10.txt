SPOILERS IN EQUIPMENT TO DO. <br /> <br /> Twenty years since 1984, this film talks about the future of Prince in the music industry. There is an area that concludes the Prince of the 10-year music series, which is like the best songs from his last 10 albums you would like to have one of the best albums! <br /> <br /> Location plays like this. Prince goes to his closet after playing one song and the club owner enters the closet to give the Prince a fall from grace during the 90s and put out the albums that most of the hardest fans will be able to cope with the help of his skills. The club owner - "You can't order them as you used. The only person who hits your music is yourself!" Spooky huh! What about the emphasis on music that makes the Prince worse when he beat Apollonia down at two different events! It was showing that it is not just a women's event that is being diagnosed in this film. I have been all for running between Morris's Day and Jerome Benton if these two stole every area they had. But what was amazing about throwing a woman into the trash? That was so bad! Another thing was the summary of the Prince's chalk on the floor carefully given by the Minnieapolis police, which leads the Prince to get more interested! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Rain Rain is a recreational film in general, as is the sound of Prince songs that adds its value to 110%. But again the film gives us another theory on the Prince and his music, as the film tells us that the great song of the Prince of film is written by Wendy, lisa and Princes wife beating the father of music! <br /> <br /> What! and filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after he found his father's musical tracks? Maybe that's why Prince began to run steam during the 90s because he ran his father's mind .................. Hmmmm .....
