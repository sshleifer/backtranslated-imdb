I agree, the first time I watched even the Cowgirl Animals Get Blues, I didn't think it was a lot of memory in any matter. But now after watching it at the 7th, I agree that it has grown so much on me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean, and Countess have been very much loved. And the love between Sissy and Jellybean looks very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think the humor of satirical more than it makes for it. Then there is the sound of the donkey's voice that shows K.D. very talented. Lang (who reminds me of a little Patsy Cline) for his ability. I can't think of any films that "has grown on me" after the first sense of unuspicious, such as has Cowgirls.
