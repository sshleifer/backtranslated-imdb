Sitting at the front of his home in Burbank, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore the same size in everything of clothing except a hat. Ted, one of the many fighting men, said every time Zorro put his mask, he was the screens. It was a bit of widespread: there were times that Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we could be satisfied was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And how! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is, as to witness the comments here, one of the largest journals. It is exciting and generally done well. Reed Hadley was a good actor, and, like someone else said, made a very good fop <br /> <br /> But, of course, it is a step that makes this movie very good. And what else we can expect, for leadership and the best team, Witney and English, and good music from William Lava's wonderful (list here says he had no deficit, but not correct, those other writers listed here were of course, and I don't know if have written any music - it looks like Lava), and for other people, among others, Charles King great, and for several smaller parts? It is also the most important of the former actor Tarzan, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar's brother-in-law Burroughs. (I encourage you to read his mini-bio.) It is one chapter that eliminates bitter things, but, hack, just a few minutes long (maybe 20) and when you went through, well, you go back to excitement . <br /> <br /> The Classic Turner Movies deserves great thanks for this serial presentation, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. And we should thank everyone who is involved that we see as a play frame, or serial, and not as a cut-off element again.
