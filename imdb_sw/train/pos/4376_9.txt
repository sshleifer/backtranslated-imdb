Liam Neeson shows the legend of Scottish Robert Roy Macgregor since the 18th century. He is a real actress. He appeals to the audience and his charisma as he does all his work. Jessica Lange is better as his wife Mary. Mary is a very beautiful woman. It is his love that makes Rob Roy a story, but it is his passion that makes his love impossible. They need each other. Tim Roth as bad Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, on the look of the film, you will find a disgusting Cunningham. Scotland Scenery is good. The environment and time conditions are shown correctly. If you would like history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is impossible to tell this story if it should be told; there is no abuse. And you should listen carefully if used for Scotland's brilliance. One important thing that makes this film so beautiful is that no one actor or actor is interested in it; they get dirty and actually appear not attracted to various events. It is their skills as actors who do not attract, do not rely on the name of marquee, fame or sex of appeal. This is something special.
