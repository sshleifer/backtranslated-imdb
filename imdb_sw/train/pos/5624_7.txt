I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... So far. He was really amazing in this film. The feeling that he should have through the bullet pick again after taking again does not think about. This was the most difficult movie to watch, the frame is not very popular and you feel you are not able to sit and look at the woman with abuse for what it looks like forever. I really felt that anything was opened when his friends returned home and I did not see the conclusion at all. The director appeared interested in using the length of his shots and loved to use glass reflections, I believe he should pay more attention to the speed in the second half of this piece. I am sure this makes the player a powerful piece of games, this film to me, though it had a reputation, dropped.
