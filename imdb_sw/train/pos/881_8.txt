"Read My Lipu" describes the wonderful balance that emerges between an open, social and maladroit employee (Devos) and his workplace student, an unusual excon (Casel). Since the film spells out this impenetrable duo to their ids that include mental connections, everyone uses other reasons for selfishness and extraordinary results. Good things for anyone in the film-based and low-psychological psychology. In French and easy to translate headings and good translation. (B +)
