In this film in 2022 it looks like seven years. This is exciting for the first time, but soon the viewer knows how much different from this modern world is included in the exhibition, what things we take in large quantities will not be available. Friends often interact in a special way, without courage or behavior. I believe this is deliberately, not doing wrong. After all, who saw the social change in the 60's and 70's can assume that by 2022 more locals live like that. I did not like many actions, away from the death of the priest: even for seven years. The plan is not very effective. But great scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol, the way of warriors and corpses are addressed, "furniture" - most of the shortcomings of this film. About 8 out of 10.
