Before I watched this film I had heard a lot about it and some events in the film, but listening didn't do it so I planned to look at it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds makes a fascinating group of people who are Hell mounted to run under the Cahulawassee River and a rough series of events that gives them all. The development of behavior takes time to develop the viewer for better understanding of everyone, but eventually you know these people as they were your friends. Acting, talk is very real, as close to the fact that you can find for the work of Hollywood. Reynolds "Lewis" character was interesting as a boy who comes out very hard but under the manly veneer is a very quick and broken person (I was fascinated by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the most characteristic, the worst form that seems to find him every harder to make him a different person at the end (his behavior change was better). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox seem to be like the lunkheads that they like to scream and don't seem too bad unless they too, and they did ... I was so surprised by the vision of the Boorman Director of Dickey's novel, very surprising. You can't go all your life without watching this film. I give eight out of ten stars, I am very impressed.
