Certainly one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. Adequate and non-performing trends make this film of entertainment and often moving. Denzel Washington has one of its roles of responsibility to date, and all others have made it for good. Christopher Walken is really good in his part though he was not often seen as I would like. The story of the ultimate desire that anger is against the guilt of children and love. This is also a film of film actors like it has its right to shoot, rockets and revenge. The Mexico City area adds a sense of seed to corruption which itself is an eye opener. All in all, an interesting film from the beginning to the end. It is highly recommended!
