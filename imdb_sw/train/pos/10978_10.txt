A few years ago I looked at the first "Gray Gardens" I remember laughter and saw a hilarious camp. Years later I still laugh loudly when I look, but after a lot of comments I came to see the beauty in a wonderful relationship, emerged among the "Large" Edith "Edith" great and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. <br /> <br /> The mother and daughter living together in their home of the ruins of the East Hampton home of 28 adds new meaning to the word "Shabby Chic". For unused cats, raccoons and opossums as aunt's aunt and a fabric of Jackie O. authors of the film allowed by Albert and David Maysles in their home to make a film for everyday life. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of real love and chaos. The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a covenant for unbreakable bonds of love. And their life is like a car, a decision and a free will. This movie has more to recommend than I can put words. It is a common experience that you should see. <br /> <br />
