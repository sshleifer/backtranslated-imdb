I saw a big swimming pool at the Festival of Temecula 2006, and I was taken away from how much I was played with. <br /> <br /> The movie surrounds a group of people who use adult swimming pool for various reasons. The exciting idea for his right, the class is used as a catalyst for major changes in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the film was how they really felt. Frequent pieces are the characters treated well. I enjoyed the class shows, and the outdoor game was very good. There is nothing out of place or behavior, and finally has a very strong feeling, such as attending a school or summer camp - where you find immediate friends, make strong buttons, and make discoveries about yourself, but get away quickly My only complaint is that Paula's behavior had a great and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about him than was finally revealed. I think you can't meet everyone in the class, although ... <br /> <br /> Besides this, I have found the film very well and very interesting. See if you get a chance.
