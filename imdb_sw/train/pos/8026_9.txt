In this film, you can imagine this film is for children only. In fact, it spells out to them, but it is also a sufficient round and joke describing to adults in the audience. At this time, the Muppet group tries to go through Broadway, and severe problems prevent them from occurring, and lead them to split. But Kermit will not be held, and his decision goes with things going up until after getting a contract he gets hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> It's sending, in part, of old star cars from 40 years and real music as a music topic, just here there is a lot of common zaniness and a wonderful time thrown in a short pan beautiful (boomerang's Lou Zealand, show the Gonzo's water, a whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet authors are not ashamed of these gatherings, on the contrary, remind them to reach a point that is very comforting to see 'letting a story' where the thick and thoughtful actors will meet their dreams. Although it is not the original basis as the Muppet Movie, it has many interesting and unlikely songs, the most beautiful places on Manhattan, and even some of the corporate kind of performances (and marriage)! Kameo includes Liza Minneli ("frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a soldier), Brooke Shields (proposed by the mouse), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So be ready to sing, or be too busy with the romantic moments (one of the most romantic) and one of the best Muppet movies.
