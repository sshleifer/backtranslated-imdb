Okay, so FX is not a big budget. But this story depends on the actual events. It is not something that goes together to make the rich, even rich! Like many films that depend on books, there are things that are not recommended. Only a few people have said that this film was the basis of real events, not just as many people believe! This movie is not available in other ways too TWISTER! Other than both movies are about turukopi. <br /> <br /> For those who have trouble with a cyclone science and storm in the movie, there are several things you need to remember ... "A few nights" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after events real. Try to imagine how the storm survey was growing at that time. What happened in the big city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie calls the city something else, it says it is a small town.
