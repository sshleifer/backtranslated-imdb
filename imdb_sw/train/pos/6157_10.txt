This is a movie I have never thought of seeing my 3-year-old in a video store and found it after having a picture of an animal cover on Nabooboo Island. We got and we have watched it since; we have actually hired several times since. There are very few non-animation films that my child will watch and remember; it's a good change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. Acting is the best, the music is compelling, coming into your head and you can't help but sing together. Story story, especially about WW2 is not available in its own way and there is something new to watch every time you look. I heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think it's two different movies, both good, but somehow my child doesn't have any interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that children will need to watch regularly and one that parents will not take into account. There are days that we look at before and during bed and don't feel that sadness coming when he wants to repeat any movie.
