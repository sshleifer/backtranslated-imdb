My motive was revived as I passed through and saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia so I thought right, see what it is. I am very happy to stay at the station. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, others on acting on but a good time to be. I look at this and it makes me sad to drive all the movie industry provides out with these beautiful gems passing pass on. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy as I did. I have even found my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It takes a slower, however, this game creates and will be fascinated by stories. Watching this beautiful film makes me like to defend myself in the most Greek and pathos.
