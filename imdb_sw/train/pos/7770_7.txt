"Written on Wind" is the Dodlas Dodlas Sirk. Douglas Sirk had been found again by the "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder etc .. which he praised as the general director - I think it is because of its modern cinema - "Written in Wind" provides pictures of luscious colors and beautiful decorations. But I ask myself: Is this enough to carry the film? Acting in "Written on Wind" is among the weak and fair (except Robert Stack - who pretends to be a weak and damaged player). Lauren Bacall, usually a great presence in the screen, is sent to this film. Dorothy Malone as seductress, they do not care "fatale women" are the same, but they have no power for that role. The Hudson Rock is effective but evaporates. <br /> <br /> The program has very good links. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> The powerful Servant of the Son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the broken father) Marylee daughter of nymphomaniac (Dorothy Malone) Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman with a code, a former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought up with Kyle and loved by grandfather. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, love triangles, confusion, fistfights, laughter, death etc. - well, when I read a summary story on the back cover of the DVD I thought that I was to treat. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "It's written on the Wind" takes it seriously and tries to tell him a wonderful story. As I said before acting, in general, not enough - the size is missing. There are many powerful events in the story, but participants are doing a good job. I think maybe with Italian or Spanish characters these scenes would not be fully investigated - they would end up (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. Sirk. For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
