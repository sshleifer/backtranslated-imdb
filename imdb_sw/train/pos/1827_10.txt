All the dogs are going to heaven is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw the first time I was like 3. Now I have 12 and I used it, making me think of things and brings many memories, which were "days". I love music, I would like Charlie to get to Heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I would like how Charlie looked at her voice, Bert Reynolds could play only the sound of this great Charlie. I love this film, the first one is better because it's original and main. It's actually bringing memories that no one can describe, even I. If I can just return to those days. I love characters. If this is the way the memory returns when I'm 12 to think how I will feel when I am like 19, I hope I can look at this when I am old. When I saw him first I did not know that I'd look back and feel this way, I hope it will be available to watch. I am so happy that this film was made with a wonderful idea came to mind and heart. At a rate from 1-10 I could give the perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It is difficult to express feelings, when I grow up and if I have children, I hope they may have this feeling.
