I've never known who Robert Wuhl was before he saw this. But after seeing it I found someone who was interested. This special HBO includes him to teach "American history" to New York university students and that man was just amazing. He played almost every important historical event that did not just happen U.S. but other parts of the world. This document / comedy was a great satire that made me a question if I accept it as an incorrect history of truth is true. I was glad how Mr. Wuhl could mix the most important information by learning more and learning more exciting. I would like to recommend this to anyone who is interested in history and is ready to ask what his faith is.
