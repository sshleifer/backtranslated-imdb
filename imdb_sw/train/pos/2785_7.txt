"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of 80-year-old cinema-led movies by John Hughes. Everything is done in a hard-colored world where everyone is fascinating, there can be easily solved conflicts which often leave the most joyful events, and a large amount of conspiracy is summarized and sessions put on bouncy tunes. There is nothing wrong with this, however. "Bend It Like Beckham" is completely treating from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves overcoming them with the fun of the maize ball even though we were enjoying it, and finally, embarrassed like this is accepting, we thanked (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in the playground). Watch this film and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Bridge: B +
