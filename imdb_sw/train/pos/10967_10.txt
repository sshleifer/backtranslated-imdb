I saw this film first in my courses and playing games on Tulane. I was amazed at how good this text is and what is fresh. It is really looking at the unadulterated reality of the exclusion of life. The family is amazing and I thought it had shown a little Edie on its foundation. ** As my description of my Professor told me all the time of the movie, Little Edie was suggested by one of the camera people. ** Beauty, I see, comes from the nature of the family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that cannot work in the community alone and want to start with the rehabilitation of Little Edie for the community. For all, the film faces its quality testing and shows amazing beauty. Body thumbs up up!
