I was a teenager in 1979 when the Soviet Union came to Sofia Bulgaria and began the Siberiade of Konchalovsky; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Marathon of Autumn". I was surprised by the direction of the world of art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberiade" 4 and two hours of 2 hours and had no words. The best way to then "1900" of Bertolucci. By far! Andron Andron in some way to achieve the negative and make "full time director of restoration" one day! In the course of course! I also fought a lot to protect this Cinema against many of my colleagues who were similar to the Soviet film and bad taste! When you have my side.
