(You will know what I mean after seeing Red Eye ...) In general, the Red Eye was much more amazing than expected. It goes with a slow start, and it builds slowly. But when it passed, it's a thumper! It is difficult to define what makes this thriller like ... exciting if I got it. Unless, just put it, the director did work on a credit to stimulate you in what action would otherwise be running-a-mill-plot. I wanted to forget I was watching movies. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Another reason, I think, is "close" of someone affected by the bad ... and that over time, it begins to involve true and victim. Number 8 out of 10, more than 7.5 ... but that's very good!
