The castle of Blood is a good example of the best work in the kind of fear presented in Italy in 60 years. Film has all the right things - an old dark house, atmosphere, beautiful story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes any film to see. <br /> <br /> Story involves a haunted castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But, the night he visits is a special night. It is a night every year when the dead return to their deaths. The only thing I saw in the movie is the time you run. Approaching hearing. There is a great part of the first act where nothing happens. Our hero is caught in the dark looking for something of interest. But once he gets something, the movie begins and it's very fun. Castle of Blood is a must must for fans of Steele and fans of the Italian terror of the Gothic in general.
