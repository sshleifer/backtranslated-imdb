I love Monte Carlo and enjoy this film. I thought everyone was very good. I had no experience with Richard Lewis; Sean Young was very beautiful as a girl who was rejected by the heart of gold. George Hamilton was a beautiful and perfect Italian champion. John Pipi has a day of the field as good. James Belushi is a hysterical as a general jerk. Shepard's secrets gave a very good performance as a home-bound wife. Enjoy together cast. Many talent, clever script, developing lots and beautiful places. It's just nice to give me a dreary day. Especially during the winter when the trip to Europe is not anywhere on your scope.
