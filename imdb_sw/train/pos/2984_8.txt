David Zucker has pointed to one of the most fun of the year and this goofy farce. Yes, it is a matter of taste and depends on the wealth of sophomoric tiny, but it is often more funny than the latest comedic efforts. The film is closed with the joke of all forms that are very clear to the smallest forms that you should look at everything in the shape or you'll forget. As its initial effort that includes "Birds!", "The Secret of the Higher!", And "Guns of Naked," humor comes almost every second. There is a lot of time that works, it is easy to ignore a few who fall flat. What makes this film apart from other coloring in the type of spoof is that it has a real line of story. While others are standing on the noise of many popular events in the film near random (take "Mafia!", Please), this film sells new stories and interesting characters. It touches the films in general and also enhances the real sports industry instead of making any special film. Even for people who do not care "South Park," its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, makes a good pair of actors leading to natural chemistry. The film also makes the best use of athletes, athletes, and other celebrities, especially a little by Robert Stack's "Solutions for Solutions." By the way, continue through credit for the last joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All, Zucker has succeeded, with words perhaps using it for a mixture of sports, dunk home.
