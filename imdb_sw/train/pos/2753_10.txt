My movie of all time favorite! I've seen many movies, but this beat them all! Good work, wonderful story. You will be, like a "normal" person who cares about the love of George. Altough he is an actor, he is also a very popular person. And most importantly: you will learn to respect & look different from people with Down Syndrome.
