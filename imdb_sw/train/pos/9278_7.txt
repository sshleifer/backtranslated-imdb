In White Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films and Jafar Panahi which I have seen, the director reduces a large amount of depth in subjects that appear, on the surface, slightly. In the lowest seat, the Panahi's premiere taxi for Iranian women who stand for their rights, I don't think she has succeeded. It is not that he says it is not important, of course (and it is so bad that, like many Panahi films are very interesting, artists cannot see it). But, over time, the film feels a flat tad, and it feels long for even 90 minutes. Not to say I didn't like you, though. All actors are wonderful, and the ceremony at the end of the film is infectious. But it is not an important task, in my opinion.
