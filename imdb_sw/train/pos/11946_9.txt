*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Only after his work with Johansson on the "Match Match" return two to "Scoop" Corky, zany and fun trip to comic. When a journalist (Johansson) learns a new experience from a lost journalist (McShane) when he enters the blind (Allen). Plot to be a new killer of the Tarot Card in London who may already have before Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play detective Sondra falls in love for the good will be a murderer. Allen finally hit the mark, it's not as good as the "Match Point" but definitely more fun. I laughed more than I expected, one of the years must be seen
