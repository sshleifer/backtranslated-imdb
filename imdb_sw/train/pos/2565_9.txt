I enjoyed this film about the relationships that were sometimes made between American women and Japanese women in Japan after the war - with the worst sanctions they have found. Brando goes from having a contempt for the Japanese (which is natural to consider WW2) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry. Its performance is the same (not a big fan of its style) and the movie is very amazing. Red buttons received Oscar for its negative impact on another GI who loves in Japan (although Japanese women who play against him also did a wonderful job). I don't want to destroy it but the film is good looking and tissue box. <br /> <br /> This movie will be able to say SOMINI and be entertaining at the same time. Gem more low.
