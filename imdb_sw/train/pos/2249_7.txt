I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and noticed that a beautiful and realistic picture of LDS faith. I think that the remake of this epic journey in the valleys will be beneficial, as many people today have no knowledge and experimentation and suffering from the early Mormon church. It is a wonderful story of strong and dedicated people. As a member of the church, one of the most important features of the film (more than historical accuracy did not bother me) was to show Brigham Young as one who was "deceiving the members of the church" by believing he had been called a successor of Joseph as a prophet. Although I understand the main reasons for this verse, it creates a feeling that its doubts in this regard are historical facts, when in fact, both Brigham and the majority of church members understood and believed that he was called to lead the church. Brigham did not know to deceive the saints; but he led them by inspiration. This is important for the Mormons because on it it considers an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was a resurrected prophet of God. Do not believe these words or not, we know that the film is not suitable for what Brigham himself believed.
