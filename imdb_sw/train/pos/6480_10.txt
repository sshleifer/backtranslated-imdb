This was the best document of war. Beginning at the beginning of the first section when Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day the soldiers came'. During the last days of the war when the mushroom clouds were seen on Japan, I had never been reduced to the second of this tribal series and I remember well though it was being investigated again in 1974. Every part of this epidemic was covered in detail. All this series must be a mandatory responsibility for many children in the world as possible so that the World War I will not be repeated and that strife, hatred, greed and tolerance are not confused with religious or religious religion.
