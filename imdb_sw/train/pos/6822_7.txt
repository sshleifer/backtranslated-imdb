"Unlocking Night" released in 1977, tries to be human production. It only succeeds in the real performance of Gena Rowlands. His actor's sports actor Myrtle is not necessarily a person who likes it in real life. He engages himself, often feels, and makes life sad for those around him - in other words, not different from other actors! Myrtle is also a sharp woman's fall - we do not know if the demons she is fighting is real or imagine, though we are allowed in the early secrets. Rowlands are clearly directed to the love of her gifted husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film as well. This film is not evil - it's more than a long time, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage when drinking very much seems almost cruel. "Preference" in some negotiations - at least during the stage - goes for a very long time. Some of the support actors offer good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtle's producer. Joan Blondell's character has not been fully developed, and I never knew why he was in the film, except to keep Myrtle. Watch this film for Rowlands alone - it's very interesting - and it's hard to take your eyes, though you want it sometimes.
