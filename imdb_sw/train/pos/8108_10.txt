I have, "Things to Come," on D.V.D. and it is very clear compared to my version of VHS. The voice is right, but it can be hard to understand sometimes. I liked the film I wanted to copy the book and find it. It pays for the reasons why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little things I did not see before. Like, John Cabal is playing with a toy toy in the party of Kristomass, as it was a dive bomb, out of the sea power to declare war, "Dinosuar." The ship has been sent by air power, an unknown enemy to attack the airplane. Aircraft airplane appeared. Roll sharp for women through the entire movie. <br /> <br /> There is more, see the movie to enjoy them.
