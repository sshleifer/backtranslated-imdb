This movie has probably never done screens on the radar screen, but it has a little quality. It's similar to life, but you think "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close show ordinary people, and you can't even realize that it is now a great name actor. It seems that jerk in this story is too small to want the girl of Eugene, but I think it is possible. It seems impossible that a child could travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think it is possible. You may think that family problems in this movie can not happen in your own family, but I think it is possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "You think your work is the most difficult part of your life, but not."
