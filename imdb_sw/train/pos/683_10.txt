I love spiritual stories. Beautiful stories of the night terraces, voices that cannot be explained. Now I have seen many of them. If the special efx deals more with today's films, sometimes you get a real gem, you have gotta turn at the time when the authors and directors actually had to use their heads to create a beautiful spirit story. Now this, very rare, part of a series of Ghost Ghost TV series called "New House" was one of the most horrible films I saw. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but nothing has ever since been compared to it. Despite all reconstruction in Hollywood, one should do this "as much" without efx more than the original. This period was less attractive as hell. I am lucky to get finally on DVD today and very rare and difficult to find. The only other news of the Spirit's Spirit even to the near was the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". You want someone to make more stories of such spirits.
