This is a delightful movie that is over-the-top on which my wife, my daughter, and I found it impossible. The plan is only mad but "you love the truth" to the world of soap and insectable conditions. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Kevin Kline's performances and Sally Field. I am no better than Kline who plays TICKheaded. The character of the farm is the need for despair and assurance - and he is very familiar with the feeling of bipolar sensitivity - played well on the popular history of the field (he likes?) "You love me!" Oscar exciting. People who are able to separate from the large salt cereals are very rare in this world. I think this is the only movie I have not been patient with Whoopi Goldberg Character; I thought he was "spot on" in every note struck. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty, and Elizabeth Shue were also the first level too. Just a great movie if you're in a state of going for a trip to LAUGH!
