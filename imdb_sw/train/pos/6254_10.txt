I just saw this film at the Toronto film international in 2001. The name of the work was 'Dog Days'. The audience's ears were mixed. Some people have seen sexuality and real violence being too much for them. Others seemed to really learn that this film was good. This video is not a desperate heart. It is like 'Happy' with a clear sex with a low sense of humanity. There are poisoning of animals, shade-shade from senior citizens, orgy'esque 'to take them to the shopping center, penetration of candles, and damage to mental anxiety. If this looks too much to handle then this film is not for you. This film shows humanity in its desperate and terrible state. The cutting off of our existence is shoved in our face with a great glee. It does not interest in human liberation here. And why? This film has a good exhibition from all participants, it is always interesting, and perhaps it's the most sophisticated information of the film being done on a short film.
