**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> I've been a fan fan of the film now for decades. Just when I think I've seen all the other adults like to bother me. I have never seen this film before. It was a treat, apart from the beaten path too ... not just the way to the ferry port of the boat either. Here was a terrible film made in the 1940s that tried to try something different. The beautiful girl is (gulp) is not afraid of change and saves men, including the person they love, from the monster! What? That's how to lose. This girl was quite the opposite of many women in the films of the time, did not scream in her own shade, she was not afraid of fear, no walk on the leaf running. This Gal was not afraid to live alone in a hut away from all the villagers. Not only was the area on the fog rock shouting haunted. Heck he takes even on grass grass out ... as the usual version of the 1940 Ripley. No snake, generator or spirit player can dare to touch this gal. Women's film books must be sure to insert this uninformed work. Look at this if you are a fan, like me, of the amazing B / W of the most awesome modern atmosphere of the modern atmosphere that only made in 30 and 40s years. And make sure you wear your neck to give the iron for protection.
