"Midnight Cowboy" is one of the films that were advertised for a good reason - it's one of the best films made in the United States. Its all of its artists are still not available and commercial. It is not surprising that it was a great achievement in the first time released. But show it, it is also one of the most sad-hearted films. The characters are remembered, well developed, and ultimately depressed. Film workers should be grateful for not giving the end of Hollywood, which was essentially what was needed by the 80th century. Its well-developed, creative, and most of all available films can be made with big budgets that Hollywood can offer. All this was closed and when the "Star Wars" was released. John Schlesinger's leadership is doing the job. It combines simple style with experimental editing. Unlike many other films involving these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has an adult age. Its still as strong as it was before. Acting however it makes this a jewel. The nature of the characters is not fully explained, but the performances make them quite well. All Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are most memorable and compassionate (despite their otherwise unethical actions). Further, being a fan of vintage films, I liked the events put on the 42th road. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect with one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)
