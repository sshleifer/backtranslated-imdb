Bruce Power is a story of Bruce Nolan, a natural person who feels God gives his life. God leaves him and shows Bruce's wrong way. Of course, giving someone the power of God can turn to worse. Bruce Force is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, such as Morgan Freeman is always the first level and looks the same home as God and cast brings the plot together well. Jokes are almost always on the target, although sometimes they spend less on Carrey's face. I loved the fact that the movie actually showed God, not only but also as a black man. I thought this was a good thing, especially with a wise Freeman. There are some hilarious events, the opening area for instance, others lack a little goal but it's still a good film. 6/7 out of 10
