A very good flick of collaboration with the great, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on a trip to Africa trying to find the old meteorite. After getting it, Rukh is poisoned by its radiation. All that he touches dies and the dark side of the Rukh makes him a proud killer. His friend, Dr Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a small remedy for the problem and at the same time recognizes radiation can be used for the benefit of mankind by healing diseases. Two women will fight on the possibility of radiation. Better good special effects. Others beaten: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
