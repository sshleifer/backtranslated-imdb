I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and Jack Wild dashingly and now my daughters welcome the fans of the Wild Jack as well. This film is what movies really should be: fun and entertainment. This movie is not available for children or. Most conversations are directed to adults and Witchiepoo performance is something you don't want to miss. Music in this film fits Jack Wild and Mama Cass for beauty. And if the Jack Wild fan, I never miss a chance to see him dance or hear singing. Knowing the difficult life Jack had made this film even more remarkable when he sings the opening song "Preferred". It stops me by praising him for giving me a good childhood reference that I now give to my children. Let's go to Hai Island where there is friendship and happiness! And keep the records of the Wild Wild Jack by passing Pufnstuff to others.
