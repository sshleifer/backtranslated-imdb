Ah, true records. I lived in the Netherlands at the time and looked forward to Sunday evening and later on Tuesday. I saw it during 14-16 years. Very good for me (during school-) English, as Dutch TV offers language heads for other languages, except for kiddies shows today. So you would hear the voice and the original language. - The best series was the first three and then after the third series, good character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was a terrible enemy, disappeared from the series (I don't think they caught him, he escaped every time, leaving the opportunity to see him again in the next story) ) because obviously the series was also divided into Germany, and the Nazi enemy can not pass much better! Such a bad, because Geoffrey Toone did a very interesting job to show a wonderful man of Nazi, who had this ongoing obsession of revenge England. It was really fun to see this kind of high performance in a series of young people, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good partner and young people were normal. They were very trusting at me at that time and as a child I could think was part of these young people, who were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series to me, and stood out in my memory of those times as a special show and "Dungeon" too. I hope to publish a good DVD series, which will be wonderful. Even the worst copies are still interesting to look at. The future series was not good, watered and not very happy as the first three. We'd also find another series with Von Gelb placed on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
