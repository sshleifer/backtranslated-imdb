I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a wonderful film and should be seen by a broad audience. Ideas to display, visualization of the script, humor is always amazing. Two travels are huge and actually carries the film. My advice would not even look at the trailer, just renting the film and looking without expectation. I was lost from the blockbuster, so it is easily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy but I think most people will have a comment and that it's always good, unless 'that's stupid'. I loved this film, you can't get a gem like this every day. This should be a favorite ritual. Try it, you can just feel the same way about it as I do.
