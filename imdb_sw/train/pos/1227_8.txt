I got this movie on my movie station, and I'm glad to see the film. It has all the features of a good youth video, and more - this film, apart from dealing with boys-girls' relationships and sex and so on, also deals with the issue of steroid and youth use. The film has a real life of feeling - no loud sounds, no special effects and no bad scenes - which, for this film, was right. That feeling makes it easier to relate to characters in the film - some of which we can know from where we live. Overall, a good film, is good to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
