In this film Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr Teeth, Floyd, Animals, Janice, and Zoot are the graduates of the clan who decide to bring their university music, Manhattan Melodies to Broadway . Unfortunately, no producer will even meet Muppets. After the rejection of many manufacturers, Scooter shows that Muppets decides to migrate alone. However, Kermit still believes that he can get his show on Broadway, but after finally making and let everyone know that he sold the show, Kermit get amnesia and others don't know where. This has many positive events, including a series of live action that introduced the children of Muppet, a series of wedding weddings and Muppets, including Sesame Street cast and travel Matt (from Fraggle Rock) ), Scooter like usher of cinema movies, and location where Rizzo and other mice cook breakfast. My only complaint is that many characters are not more involved. Indeed, many of them appear on the wedding, but there may be important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Sweetum, and Lips must be part of the Electricity Crisis in this film as he was the last season of Muppet Show and Muppet Caper General, and The Miss Piggy Foo Foo must be with him too (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also made by Steve Whitmire, had a great place in this movie, and was very unknown at that time).
