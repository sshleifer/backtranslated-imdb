That is undoubtedly my popular novel Le Carre and is transformed into a monetary screen for love and all the services that can be desired. I read a review on this site which seems to find bad characters but I believe this lacks the point. All Le Carre's stories love story and this is not different. It is a proper reflection for the set time. Discrimination is the key to everyone for the benefit of anyone. The growth of Pym is close to myself that I see it seems to look. Peter Egan is his best role and late Ray McAnally lamented heavily. Even the smallest roles, such as Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis see. This is sent by the Impresario of the Theater. The story should not be destroyed with good information but it should say that it relates to the slow but infinite children and the inevitable destruction and the rise of wind and rebellion. All my love dwells with Magnus Pym and his special love (not sex) for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - it's amazing as always.
