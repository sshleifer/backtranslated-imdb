I need to agree to enjoy bad movies. I love them all. Fear exactly. My friends and I are gathering after a hard week at school and work, renting mad zones, making pizza and getting an explosion. He had a big box, so I expected less than usual. The story is about a house project being built on a nuclear facility that had high layers of land, and other underground layers are covered only. Residents of this neighborhood find a covered center when some children fall into a hole in the cave. This wakes some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's the city of chunk. The effect of emotions and actions does not stop even the last documents will continue. Well, it's not a good art, but this, as well as a shocking conversation and the top things happened is evening. Actually, it was one of the best "party zones" that I have been happy to watch. And you can say that it has been made without money, and a group of mad people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has come) and is just a wild trip.
