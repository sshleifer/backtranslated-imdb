Evil Evil: veronica code is a good video game, you have good graphics, very good controls, story of good and high story of fun. The story of the story is Claire Redfield is considered the island because of the crime of Umbrella's grounds, and reinforcing havoc for them is a great laboratory while looking for his brother. Displaying a picture of Veronica is very good, hot and rainy effects are excellent. , but the structure of the button does not match the Dreamcast controls, makes it hard to find for Keo still enjoying going around another hierarchical area, hitting guts out of zombies. Code: Veronica also has a bit of "Romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 Sounds in this game is much better than ever, for example, even though I hate the new feature, When big spiders they are ragging, they are the legs that make the sound of banning, and the gun blows a lot of sounds. The story, the beauty control, and the voice Sounds make the Wrong Code: Veronica is known to be loved. I offer 10 out of 10.
