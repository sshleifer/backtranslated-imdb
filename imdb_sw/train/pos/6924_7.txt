These hardest West were very important in the work of JAMES STEWART after returning from the war service, wishing to change his image to do the west, which is generally considered to be the reason for western penetration in 50 years since it was so remarkable. It's not bad not photographed in Technicolor. Stewart is winning first prize for the "winning gun", but it takes time for all films to try to recover when it is stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a gal of shade that is improper and STEPHEN McNALLY is a little village boy in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is a bad partner of Shelley. And he did not realize that, being a Universal-International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both unknown at that time) have little responsibilities. The most interesting sequence involves the first Indian attack, where CHARLES DRAKE identifies himself as a fool who runs, leaving Shelley alone in a horse car. Later he saves himself, but it is only one of the twists and turns that has guns passed from one side to the other to the other - but eventually ended up with the right owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have an absolute ultimate shootout which is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as a DUEL IN SUN OF THE SUNFLIGHT FINE. McNally makes a perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is similar to a lie in a kind of ethnic role played in '40s as a low gunslinger of life. The story was built by authors dominated by Anthony Mann, and is happy to see ROCK HUDSON (known as Bull Young) wearing the Indian warrior and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who draws a glance of the winner on small Winters. and interesting. <br /> <br /> It is good to look and definitely on the average story.
