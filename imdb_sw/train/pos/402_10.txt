I found Zu: Warriors from the Mount of Magic. In the film, the landscape takes place in the mountains of China, the legend of Zu looks like another dimension! Thank you for the great use of Tsui Hark's effects on CGI. He has the ability to show his vision of the mountains surrounding the clouds, the earth where the creatures flow freely, and the power from the bright wing of the wing, divide the swords, and the cold winter system. Even though there are many characters in this, the focus is mainly on the King of Sky and Enigma. The aspect of love is there, although the film seems to be blacker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is good and its presence on the screen makes this film fit to watch. At first, I like how he looks like the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and does well playing Enigma while working and coping with his old life. Oh, on the way, do I say that Cecilia is very interesting to the eye? Indeed, the Zu rebels had more comedy elements and its special effects were reduced because of its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes on a whole new level and sets a new level in the cinema.
