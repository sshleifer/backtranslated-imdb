Shirley MacLaine in another role played. As a aunt and a mother in Chicago's 1962 working class, an old character actress gets another job as a woman who cannot allow any failure to defeat her successful spirit. Children, boy and boy before youth, are attracted to their spiritual Aunt, although many magic and joke techniques learn from him, and serve in all unfavorable positions eventually expel them from school. The program is covered with cunning in the Cuban muscle crisis, with all social outcomes. Men are building a bomb shelter, people are watching news programs on what has just been seen as TV, in dinner, and a general mist of fear and air panic. When a "harmless" miracle is knocked out of numbers, the final conclusion makes the viewer feel better. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! To clear the low budget production, this is still a small sweet film, full of magic that the Sunday Matine was made. For a few "oldies" options that were cured in an effective voice list, the whole family is certainly enjoying this. ****
