Charlie Kauffman has developed a fantastic romantic character, but this Canadian gem makes it very bad. If most of the best attractions that didn't say a bit about the best plot but let's put the event, two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can't cope with the world and eventually this means no longer necessary. But that's where many problems begin. I loved this film, it has made me smile for a long time after the last credit and that's a rare experience and many pieces of "no" out there. Do not miss this / <br /> <br />
