I loved this film, for the first time the graphics were seen abnormal with sand pictures but I came quickly. There must be thousands of hours of shot and I am very happy with the cut-off work. If you tremble with drugs or violence it may not be a film for you but there are other characters here, and some real stops. Technically I liked it too, they should be able to use the new operating algorithm or perhaps it was just that the image was seen as dark but I was not angry with the usual artifacts found on the video for film transfer. (Key Water has sent me nuts, because because there are affordable cameras available now and I don't see excuses in one look if you are interested in watching the movie). Sorry that's my own rant. I certainly recommend this film if you have ever been associated with the music area, it has some time of horror but most of them are hilarious, I may be charged for laughing but unfortunately it's a classic piece.
