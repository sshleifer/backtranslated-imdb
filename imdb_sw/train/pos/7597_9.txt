The lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot of quantity has been said, so I can choose them again for you again. Just read the people they liked, and you'll know why you want to watch it. The best thing about this series is that it is completely new. There are not many movies-and even consistently consistent with the topic of waiting, but the lost live up to the head and pride. Its all about the unknown and if you are confusing with an unfamiliar area, losing a good plot, cast the best and good structure (existing and previous together at the same intervals) you will have a series where each part is a story on its own but part of telling more. You want to have all the knowledge of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you will need to know where the writers take. The result is that his series does not allow you to go. For more details of concern, the series went under the 2nd season, perhaps due to its own success. It is known that Lost was written only for one season at the beginning and when the effectiveness was followed, the authors were also confused. In my opinion they made a mistake to add more privacy and high speed in the 2nd season, then to resolve those (or at least part) those of the season 1. At the end of the season 2 ended with a big secret blurr, program efforts and unspecified events , but there is only a viewer who can take. The difference between the 2nd and 3rd season however was great. The 3rd season has given a lot of insight, to share the new section with questions. And that's exactly what they should write; you want to delete from the same plot unit to the next, not to find the secret tsunami spread everywhere and then take a few to describe to the audience. They found it in the 3rd season and brought us a series of sequence for the season 4. It is good to see that such a different kind of series, can be very popular.
