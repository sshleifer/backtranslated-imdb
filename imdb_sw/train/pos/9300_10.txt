I don't know a lot about Rat Packing, and Frank Sinatra always appeared to myself to feel myself to myself. So, when I call this all time, it's not something to do with fake ideas. If another inspector says, Mad Dog Time is about signals, it's not realistic. It's kafkaesque (sympathy Kyle MacLachlan is perhaps the most weakest of the great crowd, when it was as good as Josef K), it's stylish, knowing, sardonic and series.
