"Pecker" proves that Waters do not intend to change his ways in his age. Many things have changed since Waters began to make films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, Waters' films budget has grown so much. This is one of his recent products, but I was surprised to see that the water still has “touch” to touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child who has been considered by photography. He lives all in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts a talent of New York (Lili Taylor is always chosen), and her life changes more. Once again, Water laughs art, popularity and heroism. It is not among his best films, but there is a big stomach here ("Memama" contains the best lines in the film!). It is often clever and mysterious, and has the same "very" understanding that I have loved in the movies of Warters.
