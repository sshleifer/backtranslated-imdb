AG was the best presentation of drama, doubts and thriller which is common to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers willies. We rooted for Caleb as he struggled to resist Sheriff Lucas's bonds. We emerged and feared about learning the relationship between the two characters. The actions that each week gave cause for the fear that Lucas would make in the future was truly amazing. This period lived up to the "Gothic" moniker for American entertainment routes that are not tested regularly, much less. Suits made a big mistake by not participating in this show. This exhibition is embarrassing to the current "reality" exhibition which is less pleasant to see. This period is looking for quality for the market to identify hunger for quality. The community that is desperate to spread beyond the mind of mind will welcome this gem of real stories. Bring it to the DVD box set!
