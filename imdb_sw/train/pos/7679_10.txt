For my quarter-school project, I chose to do a human business. After some research on the web, I got this DVD and ordered it. I've finished checking and I keep thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow". It is a compelling story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and a American man named Patric who tries to save. The end stops you from breathing, and though it is not the end-of-life-enjoyment, it is very true. It's amazing and I recommend to anyone! You connect the truth with Holly and Patric and the rest of your heart for it and because of what happens to him. I loved him very much and now I want to know what happens next!
