GOD'S MOTHER was suggested to me by a boy who owns on two different DVD and VHS records. He claimed it was one of the lowest funniest budget and the most cool. I usually look at the movies to know that they will be bad, but I have been discriminating for this ... and I was so glad that I did. <br /> <br /> It's full of action (a lot of that awesome, graphically gory), sleaze (unique to weaknesses and important female characteristics, but there is a lot in the same area that becomes hilarious) with sudden sharp conversation, all that adds laughter - inducing tone of the film. Ginty, the most incredible starter (and other under-budget publications) are amusing in leading, and providing better performance can move. Williamson is much better than usual, clearly hits the glee with an unprecedented glee (and does not go to the middle). Some of the cast are also happy to watch, especially criminals, one of them is a sadistic sexistic who speaks with inspiration that seems to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. He is precious. <br /> <br /> Again, I can't stress enough how it was. It is not too much blood for nausea, but it is an unusual violence in parts and other meat groups that have left the shootout and has a series of tortures that no one will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is chased by a pack of bad guys, he easily finds a collection of chainsaw and when you follow the next splatter you will have any fans and all the characters who enjoy and destroy their beer. We don't miss MOTO NOW. It's rollicking - like mind-numbing stupid - a classic action.
