I was glad to see this beautiful picture last night, adding to the wonder of the question and the answer to the answer by the follow-up director. I suspect that the first advertiser has never lost a parent or someone close to them in death. I've had so many losses, and this movie has spoken to me. One of the main themes is how we can't deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones until it's too late - they also can't or die before they happen. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love, solve the difference. I liked the message that there was no mistake. I love the picture of the relationship of the two daughters - as one of the six brothers, it is clear to me that these relationships are difficult. Its history as cinema movies also comes in a loud and clear voice - it's a good movie! Give it the best - a film that should not be!
