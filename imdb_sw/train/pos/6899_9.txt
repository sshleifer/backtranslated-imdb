The quality of Gerard Philipe's star, who died in a very small way, rises from the screens on this wonderful, delightful comedy, with an intriguing sword sword and antics of knockabout. He loves easily in his' story, impossible to resist. Romantic comedy with Gina Lollobrigida very little as love interest. One movie will remember with great love.
