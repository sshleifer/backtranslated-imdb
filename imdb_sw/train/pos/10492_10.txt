I saw Saving Grace right after emerging on the video. Since then it is one of my favorites! The program is not very difficult but does not exclude entertainment. It's a perfect chuck of comedic time and has a very good quality. The characters are what makes the movie very good. Everyone has their own personal qualities that enhance humor, two women played with Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law of Fly. Good acting was done by all, especially Brenda Blythen. He and Craig Ferguson were older together when they canceled a certain time of funnier. If you are looking for a good comedy I would like to recommend this film!
