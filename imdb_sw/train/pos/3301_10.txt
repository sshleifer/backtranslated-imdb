Apart from the fact that it was one of the few movies I have ever cried (human life), this is one of the best Indian films made. From well-made sets, for those who get haunting seems Meena Kumari gives, no one can forget. Pakeeza's music is amazing, more like you can understand good poems, and it is definitely one of those "OMG, 5 minutes of another song". You get a sense of how Sahibjaan put the striker between all the wonderful jewelery that they wear and the yard of court court continues to walk. <br /> <br /> View all dreams you found ..... .....
