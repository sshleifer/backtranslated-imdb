He loved Joan. Great performance. What? Not very good. I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after ... she continues to be better. My heart was running. An old film. Just what I want from the classic movie. Facial expressions have the entire film value. I am happy to have a video. He does not know what you need more in the film. Beautiful woman ..... rich ..... lust ..... murder ... investigators ..... attempt ... It helps me wonder what the budget was for this movie? They still like to make a film like this. Whenever they try to seem to just make a cheesy film. Black and white color films hold certain secrets.
