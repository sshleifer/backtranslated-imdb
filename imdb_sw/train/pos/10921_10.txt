After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to use it for spin (I bought it on DVD, so "punta" pun ... I am a dork). The beginning is everything I expect, well set (with some quotes I've heard on other Wu-Tang Albums) for what is suitable for the movie. But the plot I heard was so great, it was predictable. Every time I saw the character (except for the lizard) I thought which was Venom. Further, the only cold character is killed off the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot was not very good but at least there was a good right of kung-fu? Not right. The struggle was very short and few and in the middle. In fact the different styles were very good but I would fight it was long. I continued to expect to see the runner to run and make a certain man on the walls but has never happened. I was hoping to see Centipede doing tight tight ish but it never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes but it never happened. In short, not many occur. All fighting is normal. Don't just show that this film has a plot, it doesn't mean it's good.
