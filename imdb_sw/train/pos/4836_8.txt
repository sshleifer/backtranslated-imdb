I saw a film a few days back on the video tape and though it was difficult to finish it by taking one (because of length and story), I loved it very much. I was first attracted to, and the script and then, to recognize this script. The movie takes you, but it's not easy, a fun journey; it goes with the different political governments and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. I liked it the logic of the inside film followed; The logic, which is as logical in life, was rather spiritual and combining time but last, when I thought about it, all the events and twists are wise. It doesn't matter though trying to try again the story as it spreads over 50 years of time. I loved the character of Nikita Mikhalkov Aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics saw it, and stopped stopping. What I did not like about it, is that I think later played the characters who reminded Aleksei in the film as "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "Curses and wounded" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" is shown, I think, is a good filmmaker and Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making films like "Tango and Money" and less forgiving as "Runaway Trains". I would "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
