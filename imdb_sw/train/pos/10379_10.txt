Plato operation is a movie of entertainment b and Gary Busey.it is a very unknown film so one I saw on the boot of the car I saw that this seems to be the entertainment I was right. Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough king who has been prepared for the murder of a strong crime in Cuba now by running Plato should live long enough to prove his lack of support with his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and star action Jeff Speaksman (expert) . what I liked about Plato's run is how the film did not influence the plot could have been made before but it was still good work was fun to watch and the action was quite fun and especially the peak what Gary Busey makes it a good hero usually plays with the evil and Steve's evil Bauer is as good as sidekick of Plato even Jeff Speaksman is doing a good job and does not even know how to properly finish the run of Plato is an enjoyable effort from photographic photos and I give 7 out of 10
