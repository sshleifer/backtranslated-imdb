Valentine is now one of my favorite films. Death events define and many works are good. Marley Shelton did a good job as a female leadership (better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the film "I Know ..."). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I saw this movie, had a very small role, but played well. In addition to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. He was awesome in this. The only event I was happy to see was in the * SPOILER * location of his death. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should look at this before you watch "Call" or "I know ..." again.
