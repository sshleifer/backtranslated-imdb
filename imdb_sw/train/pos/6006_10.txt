When I saw this as a child, I answered all my questions and avoided any fears or bad thoughts I had. It's easy to look for because it is animated, which makes it unthreatening. It does not have moral values ​​or "preaching" issues, so no one should have any objections. It is a lively film that gives only the menstrual reality in a sure way, "the real thing". I hope to show my daughter.
