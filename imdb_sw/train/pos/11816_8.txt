It was very fun! I've never read those Chester-Gould comics but you don't have to know them. Perhaps there was an inner joke that I did not know but what the eye does not see the heart cannot mourn. This is an amazing, colorful film and artists are very interested together. The settings are similar to the Batman` movies, but not as dark and gray. Well, the story is not original but there is a conspiracy (which is not obvious) and an amazing end. <br /> <br /> With this movie, you can play interesting game, if See with friends. Don't look at credit for the first and then see who is more responsive to who is the most popular actors under their design!
