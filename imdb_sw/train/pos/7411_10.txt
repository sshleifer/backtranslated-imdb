The joy and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is essentially what it is so we can not always fight against that one of the real impressions. By doing so, we gain peace. Elegant in its simplicity but it is very difficult for most of us to understand. In this film, the director shows us this fact but enables us to discover in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more fable, which is played very well. Watching executives is like being in a room with real people rather than just watching actors. I worked hard and how to write a review of this beautiful movie so that others would be encouraged to see it. I am losing. The story is about men in the bathroom. It looks like really shut down, right? But, nothing can be far from the truth. The US name of this film is The Shower but that is almost an antithesis to the key element in this film, which is bath. I'm still losing. Talking about stories or characters cannot make them right. So, I'll tell you how much I was happy to see this film and how to touch and move experience. I was also very happy. I cared so much for the characters and I was very concerned about what happened. For any story, that's the most advanced character form. <br /> <br /> If you have been moved by movies like King Of Masks or Not One One, then make sure you will see The Shower. Netflix has a DVD video and sound quality is the best. I looked at the original lanquage and well and well placed English subs. <br /> <br />
