For a small movie this budget was very good. I place this well on your average B-movie center. Sean and Corinne offered in this film, and were not found to have a shy camera. Look for the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think that producers would consider it, but refugees are very eligible. <br /> <br /> I will expect more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the film industry. Sean's behavior seemed to be very real, and Corinne's characteristic attitude was very difficult and for sure. He merged well with the process of action and implemented with courage. It was a great idea to dismiss Billy Zane as a wise woman and witch. Its charisma on the screen is always fun to enjoy. Chemistry between Zane and Sean's behavior was very good. The action process was not cheesy and it seemed to connect to the film. Of course there was a mistake, but it comes with the area. Overall, this was a good movie based on the budget and the fact that it was made on TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering that they are new in the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared, and the others of The Next Star Star used their opportunities to join their starring partners in the success of the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Final Judgment: *** / ****
