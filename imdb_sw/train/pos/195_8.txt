"Show People" is quietly directed by King Vidor and with the star Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What are the two jewels on this charming comedy about the little girl, Peggy Pepper, who does her work is a Savannah talk trying to make it a big screen. Although he is successful in the comedy, what he wants to do is make "art" so he moves to Studio Studio studio. Recently he becomes Patricia Pepoire and is very good to his friend Billy. Many stars of silent seasons have come into the "Show People," including Davies themselves without beautiful hair and makeup. I am sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone seen in the lunch area; sadly, these days, not the case, even with the film pipe. In one part of the film, however, he meets Charlie Chaplin; in another, the author Elinor Glyn has told him, and Vidor himself has come to the end of the film. Other stars that come in "Show People" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle, and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was beautiful and comedienne alive. It is a shame William Haines to stop the film - he was beautiful and powerful, worthy of a great star in the day. It is a simple story described through magic. It is also looking back at an exciting time in Hollywood history and has two performances with two amazing stars.
