Every country that has a film industry has a motion (and maybe some madness) that makes movies that you can fully understand when you're part of this country. I think Hundstage is a similar movie. You can see the lowest level of Austria, dirty, disrupted, disgusting, hateful. But they still have enough money to be able to afford the cars planned by the big house. And they are definitely doing a lot of wonderful things here that maybe seems to be 'normal' because they are doing it through all their lives. From a common human point of view you can now easily follow the film and ignore it or take a look at the beautiful piece of Austrian art movies. But if you live here and you know people you see characters in Hundstage as a community of tumor. The community that continues to be dirty day by day, creating their own rules that no one else can understand, cave social system from within. And you will see people. They sat in the garden, standing on the corner of the road, opposite in that line. Maybe you meet 'em on the bar or shop you can visit. Perhaps you will work with them in your work or live near your home. You begin to hate them without knowing why. You will try to leave - but you can't. Maybe you will live like them. But it seems to be 'normal' to you because you do it through all your life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not harsh though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has good people ... but others are also bad. There are many people who work hard to try the best ... but there are also some riding behind others and destroying everything that the Austrian people have built up so far. <br /> <br /> movie.
