From what I read many people were disappointed with this film, compared to Part 1. At first I could understand this but after a little thought I think they're wrong to be. Soderbergh goes on to say the basic truth of Che's life which began in Part 1. Part 1 told a revolutionary story from the beginning of the beginning to end. Section 2 describes the revolutionary story from the beginning of the beginning to stimulate the ultimate conclusion. It is not the fault of Soderbergh that these two aspects of Che's life had very different results. With courage he chooses to tell them all in the right way. The viewer can feel very good from the movie after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not my opinion of any director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw the differences of war as weed weeds. In Part 2 they cannot find rest and we see their numbers are reduced to death and capture. Che catch and die are addressed well. The film has been enhanced by the discussion in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is much better as a charismatic Argentinian. So if you have seen Section 1 you will see a similar understanding of the very different stories in Part 2.
