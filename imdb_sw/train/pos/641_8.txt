Show this has a few clich√©s and a few up, Dawson's Creek-like time (16 years old talking about returning when intelligent life), but generally looks like a good show. Many of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move well in the experiment - ending with a good lesson at the end. I hope every part is not available to change the life as the first, which would only be a very good game for this car. Jeremy Sumpter does a good job as a young man with a passion for baseball, I believe many of us can be afraid and sometimes a vision tunnel for a team that always wanted a part.
