In 1985 (my year of birth) Steven Spielberg described a strong and unacceptable story of a young African and American Celie (First Responsive Responsibility to Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed through bad times. The story begins since 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. He has two children for his father. Celie has a little sister Nettie who cannot be separated. The widow looks at Nettie's eyes but their father gives Celie. It is the beginning of the era of bad abuse and regular control. Women are inferior to men and especially to African women and America their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a true story of life. It 's color color "is a low piece of Spielberg. He should make the most concert which "color paint" and "Schindler list" is a good concept. <br /> <br /> Posted by amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is well known as the comedyenne ravingly funny but the role of establishing as Celie is a wonderful word that he really can pull of a great dance. Danny Glover was very awesome "Mr.". I have never seen him in such a bad role. Photo showcase Oprah Winfrey is a brilliant as Sofia very powerful. Get ready to have several tissues with you while watching this film. You can actually connect to a sister's powerful story. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers as I am with my sister. <br /> <br /> Great for Mr. Spielberg!
