# 3 in the young trilogy of John Travolta's blockbusters. He plays with disco, rock 'n' roll and land. He leads Houston to find work and love. Gilley is a hot spot, and it's time for a hedge. It is not necessary to get away, I beat a cow in Nashville. I recently saw this film almost close and forgotten the television and recall how good and how good in 1980 it was. Wearing a black hat cowboy that year as Travolta. Debra Winger was in his head. He looks wonderful in his red. There's a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be the best couple even if it is a garbage trailer. They were divided only because they feel very good to come together. In Cowboy Town has an amazing voice. We can hear Lyin 'Eyes and The Eagles and Lookin' With Love by Johnny Lee.
