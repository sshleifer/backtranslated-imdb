First, I would just say a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie and an amazing cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Dealing with the mother to raise the child alone, she goes through many things that do not happen to bring her daughter Jenny to play well with Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I advise you to take a copy to look at. Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 stars! And deserved 4! EXPERIENCE! I offer 4 out of 4!
