There are movies, and there is a film. The film is more often than not just the "candy" movies, where the film is a true art works. The Fraulein emperor is certainly well placed in the end. As many viewers, I was very impressed by the events of the war, but the courage to be displayed in the middle character is what I think is the best quality of the film. After doing everything possible to serve his country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the time in morphine, the death of Fraulein is stolen by the German command on all its efforts. The area where Doktor is deployed on the rear of the Mercedes Benz car, alone, desolate, and right is perhaps one of the most sad performances of the "spy" in life. Emotional pain caused by Richard Burton in the spy that came from winter comes close. Fraulein Doktor is a more comprehensive film than a person who can recognize on a common view. I just want that its producers will see the eligibility to redeem it on the DVD so that those who have never seen, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps regularly) enjoy this unique picture of motion.
