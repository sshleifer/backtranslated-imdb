The film led everyone on 20 October 1944 where we seemed to be part of Philip's 'I Return Return' part of the landing area? It was on the shore of Leyte where General MacArthur got its popularity? Best of all, Gregory Peck won in his superior chief executive? Is a line, a set of shoulders, standard? What all men have been equal: power, total skin, worship? For MacArthur it was for the military? And Peck was a challenge to act? Academy Prize winner of "Kill Mockinbird", designated Oscar for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman Agreement", and "Twelve O'Clock High"? He played everything with an amnesiac of the homicidal to the crusading journalist; from the defendant concerned to the prosecutor who loves; from David Bible to Captain Horatio Hornblower? He has brought them all his unique insight, his character, his loyalty, warmth and love, and in particular, his humor? There is an area where 'MacArthur' stands on the deck with the 'President of the Philippines.' We can hear the discussion: "In general, I hope the water is not too deep," says the president, "because my people will know that I can't swim." Then come the sound of the voice of Peck: "And my people will find that I can't walk on the water!" <br /> <br /> Like "MacArthur," Peck again confirmed its reputation as a major in the film industry? Through him we felt the emotions of MacArthur: we knew his anger, his joy and we understood the relationship with his whole family?
