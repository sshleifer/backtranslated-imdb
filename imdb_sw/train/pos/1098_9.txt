Modern viewers know this small film especially as an example of remake, "The Pit Pit." Former criminals today look at the moral degradation: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" at a simple time, less complicated. Or was it? The time, in fact, has a way to fix the attitudes, and for many films today today in fact sadness and social and political clarity, there is a common curiosity about the controversy in old films, which seem to be worse. In "Mr. Blandings Builds His House of Dream," there may be more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. There is a political opinion, however. Finding a house at the end of the 40th was a very bitter experience, gently delayed and coming to Levittowns and so on. Politics in the film? The children of Blandings always seem to be talking about the ideas of continuing to be taught in school (which in real life could have been criticized by communist teachers). In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a social activist, democracy, and woman. Melvyn Douglas was a small democratic democracy: she was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whose little Richard Nixon was charged with being gentle on communism (and destroyed). Jason Robards, sr., He has a small role in the film, but his political activism was very clear. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., It will be many years of very democratic democracy. Almost odd colleagues was Cary Grant, who stervent conservatism showed a lot of political impression in Hollywood which has already fallen. But this was 1948: The Communist was a real threat has been seen and a list of square people was around the corner. It would have been ten years before the political revolt would be found again in normal films, and then not too low.
