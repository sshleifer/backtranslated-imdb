The movie is exciting, confident and music is very good.The movie Moonwalker meant to adhere to the bad album (1987). I have a bad problem. The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing "Man In Glass" on stage. Here, it shows the history of Michael, from his early days in Jackson 5 to the worst. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a music video music video for Bad one). That shows the video speed of Demon.The song and video is very good, realistic. Also, let me alone, which looks later. Then shows the movie Moonwalker.after a few minutes, he does a violent crime in a club called 30 clubs as so when he does lean.anyway, nice to see you.bye bye.
