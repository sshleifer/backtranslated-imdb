This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 tips. Animal sounds are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are all brilliant as a feline sassy and a little inexperienced pooch, but a real standout is Don Ameche as an old retriever, loyal gold. This movie is a great movie of the family because it can be counted and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and reassured to make every lover animal right! (tears of joy!)
