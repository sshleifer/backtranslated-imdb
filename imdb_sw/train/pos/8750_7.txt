Brokedown Palace is a story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a trip to Thailand and enhanced jail after being executed with drugs in their luggage. In this way, the film was able to turn to a great and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the movie chose to focus on the little girl's situation and more about their friendship. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale all turn to the best performances, and the movie is much more about their cooperation - doubts, jealousy, questions and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This movie chooses not to learn much in politics or even in the complexity of prison life (which is a little over top), and focuses on these aspects of friendship. There were holes of conspiracy here, and parts that were not considered reliable or true. We were not afraid of the truth or the lack of desire for their situation as we would have. And we get a little sense of life outside the prison walls, and Bill Pullman calling for a sincere lawyer who has a heart of gold. In short, this should, for all rights, has become a bigger movie than it was. But in general, I enjoyed it. Acting was good, the sound of the voice was perfect, and the story had enough deficit to turn to remain attractive. Value to see.
