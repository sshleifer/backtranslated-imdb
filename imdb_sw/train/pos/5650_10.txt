"Someones in the Door". OHHH, I forgot how this show very bad .. but we are lucky now to have "invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. The American Gothic, had it all. If I had to take one thing that I liked well on the show, it has to be a "compound line" impossible. The famous actress was Lucas Black. I bought a asap DVD, and my kids are also fans. There are some pictures of hot n steamy. The rest of the devil also. So, if the kiddo will look you would like to edit (fast / jump). It has humor, at the level of Joss Wheedon, which many show lack. Adults and adults, which are run by finese. The DVD has extra, but I would have a lot more. If you want to cheer and enjoy a great show, see "American Gothic"!
