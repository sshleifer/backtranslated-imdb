I get tired of my 4 and 5-year-old girls always being under the watch Nickelodeon, Disney and so on. It all seems that old fatigue cartoons have been done again and again. When my daughters could not go by day because one of them was sick, I wanted them to rest and rest for a while. I hit the TV and was looking for something different, I hit the way. My finger left the playground when I heard Harvey's voice. I like everything that this person has done and when I saw that he was working on a voice for a little duck ... well, I couldn't change the channel! My daughters were stopped immediately with the cartoon and more we watched the show together, the more I grew up and loved it with the message displayed. It is not necessary to be a participant of "gay rights" but instead of anyone who has been canceled as a child for ALL. I had friends who were taken to one thing or another .... also fat, also skin, also female, to be abused, not having enough sense, to have one parent .... you call the name! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to someone else and so I was glad to see the cartoon of entertainment that actually presented the MESSAGE LIFE to its audience. My girls are already accepting others as they are and will not take others to be different. My older daughter comes out to her friends if they are chosen (one happens to have one mother and that a little girl is often taken - reduces my heart when Kassie stands for her!) <Br /> <br /> Therefore, those who judge the festival this because you feel that it is an advocate for "gay rights" or they are forced to "accept some comments", you have completely lost the point of this little cartoon of poignant And if you need to understand your ... well, you need more help than any television show can provide.
