One mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working on a job. When he runs, he finds that he cannot help his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), whose end has a respite. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Recently, it gets addicted to drugs that he is selling. His life comes down, especially when his children, his old son, know the truth and threaten to leave him. Then, he struggles to isolate himself with the help of his children but can protect his family from drug-makers who worked? Wow! This life film has some of the best acting I have seen! Diane Keaton is very victorious, and her character comes as things but had a great influence. She is better than an actor than playing. However, the best performance in the movie comes from Michael Seater, who plays his oldest son. He is perfect as a child who is still young but tries to be a grown-up in the family. His work was very great in cases where he tells his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who has a young son, also does a good job. The movie is worth viewing, especially because of acting from Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
