Moonwalker is a fantasy Music Drama that looks at Michael Jackson and different groups. I will exceed the section automatically. <br /> <br /> Part 1 opens the film and Music video. Music Video is Michael Jackson's music song "Man in the Mirror", a music video also shows pictures of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first part was a good choice to open the film I liked the song and also love the montage of historical statistics. I liked the message in the song. I offer the first part of 9/10. Part 2 shows the montage's start of Michael Jackson from Jackson's five to his career. Montage I thought it was well done, I liked the animation they put in it and I also liked their choice of songs like "I want you back, blow, Thriller, you can feel and how you feel." The only thing I would like to do better in one of the songs in the montage is "We are the world". The reason why you see it is the drops of rain and in the drops are pictures of Michael Jackson and chorus of renown, but it's a little hard to see chorus. Other than that part is still good. I give part 9/10 <br /> Part 3 is a bad song. You might think it's Michael Jackson's music bad, yes and no. This section is a Music video but it comes back with Children. The section was good but it was not as good as other groups. I offer a part of 6/10 <br /> Part 4 is a short Music Video player that takes place after a bad finger called "Speed ​​Demon". The shortest is about Michael Jackson expelled by his beloved fans and journalists and hides himself as a rabbit and climbs a motorcycle to try to separate them. Soil in the flight chain was good but some part of the film of Claymation characters seemed a little fake time to interact with real people. Also at the end of the photograph of Michael Jackson's rabbit dress comes alive and plays with it. I liked to play but that was like anywhere. I offer 8/10 Section 5 is the Grammy's winner of Michael Jackson's "Let me alone." Music Video is on the media that give their noses to Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feel they will not be alone alone regardless of how innocent they are. Music video speaks (but remember this has happened before all this child abuse is about the text of him in 80 years) but I don't feel this video should be in this Movie because it is a Movie for kids and i don't think the child understands what he is singing about. I offer this video of Music 8/10 Part 6 leads us to the main story of the entire movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson tries to use his star as a star to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from Mobster Mbaya named Mr Bigg (Played by Joe Pesci). The place I really thought has given the film especially when playing and singing "Smooth Criminal" and a group of criminals. I also thought special effects were good. The strange thing about that part is why children are living with an adult didn't explain why. Also Joe Pesci is talking about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why you can talk about drugs in children's film. Another wise was good. My rating for this section is part of 8/10 <br /> <br /> Section 7 is the last part of the entire movie. At the end of the film by Michael Jackson singing the Beatle's Song Cover "Come Together" and then during the loan we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good coverage of "coming together" and I think it was a good idea to put together a group of a good singer and a pregnant woman like him. My rating is 9/10 / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie I think it really brings children to Imagination. The film is close to the genius like Beatles's "Yellow Warriors" film if you would like Michael Jackson and you have come to a highly skilled film. My description of the total of this film is 8/10
