When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist too. There was something magical and useful in Science. I used a friend-girl with a second time. I don't think she had a feeling like I was! This film was interesting but ugly, when synthetic fibers were new. Lessons from this film can be used on issues related to GM testing of today.
