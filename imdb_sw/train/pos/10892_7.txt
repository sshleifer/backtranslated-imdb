What? What about this film? Every year you know that you will find one or two Christmas movies and many of them will be awesome. This movie is definitely a new idea that was pulled well. Take a very funny to a rich young man to pay a family in order to imitate a real Christmas for him. What? It is good to have the same money if you can't do fun things. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich person gets the experience of Christmas as he thought. If only. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was very difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctant to comply with its amazing needs. It was a fun and interesting movie.
