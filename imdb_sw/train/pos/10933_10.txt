Be careful with this. Once you get a yer's top on it, you'll have to change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will be interested in a plot from all the kung-fu films now, you will want a deep and progressive attitude, you will have a secret and unpredictable desire, you will need a powerful camera function and a wonderful back. Unfortunately, you can't find all these elements together in one of the kung-fu, because of the five death bonds! <br /> <br /> Easily the best movie of kung-fu of all time, Venoms combines a rich plot, full of loss and turn, with colorful characters (and development), with some good camera functions from for 70 years. The success of someone who loves the film depends on the ability of the audience to identify who the character is, and who is a professional toxic. One is Centipede, two are snakes, three are Scorpion, four are lizard, and five are Chura. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. There is a hook, we learn with the behavior of the student, to know who these different men were. We are in His shoes (by saying), and we have to choose whom we believe, and who we do not know, as He does. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> It's not just a plot, characters, and work of a good camera, it is also fun to enjoy, which in my book makes it more important than any film around that kind. It's worth seeing very few to take on everything going on. Venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can do ... not expecting many kung-fu films to live with that gauntlet.
