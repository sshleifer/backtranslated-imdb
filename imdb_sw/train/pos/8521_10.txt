I really liked this show. I watched it since the first time in the late 90's to the last part. In my opinion the honesty was a wonderful family game that is common these days. Certainly show you can watch with your friends or children. That's what has changed little since Jo we saw him in books, but still encourages them with good stories and good lessons. Migizaji who shows Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) is doing a good job as an actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). I recommend this show to anyone.
