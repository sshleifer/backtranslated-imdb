Here is the whole family will be happy ... even those who feel too old for story stories. Shelley Duvall has emerged himself with this unique, to consider taking almost all stories of childhood stories. The Scriptures present a new problem in the old stories that we grew up and show the small stars in each section. "Cinderella" is not different from Duvall's level and in my opinion is one of the series five series, shown by Jennifer Beals (note from "Flashdance" - and still in Hollywood today making a film here and there) in the role of head, Jean Stapleton as a godmother of fairy and southern inspiration and Eve Arden as an example of abortion. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Off Day") and Jane Alden makes duo hilarious as stepisters. Matthew Broderick is Mr. Prince Henry. You will continue to return to this!
