I saw this movie when I was 17 years old and on a common rock (still I'm) ... I have never loved opera before because I hate soprano sounds, but it changed all of that. He had a delightful in the film and had such an amazing voice. When I heard about CNN that he died tonight at home for pancreatitis, he would be missed, and he was indeed left a mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, see and enjoy. * smile * maybe I should go on Amazon.com and check before sold out.
