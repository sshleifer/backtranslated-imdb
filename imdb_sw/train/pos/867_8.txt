Like Amelie, recent French films appear to have had a male and female affinity, based on a woman to find her one true love. In this case, despair leads to a suspect, which leads to his evolution to be an example of people. Good and amazing stories in many ways, except that the woman is there to help the man. <br /> <br /> For those who do not speak French, headlines are very fast, but not meaning. br>> <br /> Sound sound, as it seems to be increasingly in European film cases, is good and has achieved balance and diversity of films. Nothing seems forced. Watch, remind me of various horror movies in the city. There is Craven Wes in Chicago to feel.
