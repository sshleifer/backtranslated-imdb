Selected by MGM on the same set as the English version, but in German, the second Garbo's "Anna Christie" benefited from the practice and its ease with the German dialogue. Garbo looks better with nature under the direction of Jacques Feyder than under Clarence Brown, and his silent films have been completely lost, which has made its voice change complete. The power he brought to character remains here, though reduced, and Garbo shows more of Anna's risk. The entire scope, except Garbo, is different from the original version of the film, and Garbo gets the benefit from lacking competition with Marie Dressler, who stole every area she had during the English version. In Feyder's film, Garbo insists in the middle, although three players, especially the father, gave the best performances. Feyder's direction was more reassured than Clarence Brown, and its use of cameras and editing techniques were not seen as a barrier to the new sound system as it was for Brown. The film is much more effective than English, and the stereotype of the first film is taken by the flow of interest and audience interest. Even William Daniels' s movie looks much better on his version of Brown's edition. He took the invention of Garbo and at least of docks in fashion. Also, the screenplay for the European audience made it clear to Anna's profession from the beginning, and this definition explains to the audience who did not know and play as described only on Brown's film. However, the film was made before the Production Code was established, which made an amazing blockage. Osbo's Oscar selection for "Anna Christie" was always fun, and I thought that the nod was given more to realize its positive changes to sound films than to its performance. However, some University voters could see the German version of the film, and felt like a modern viewer, that "Anna Christie" under the leadership of Feyder was obviously Oscar deserved.
