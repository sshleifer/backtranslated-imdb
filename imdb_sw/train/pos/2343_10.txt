Thank God ABC took this instead of Fox. Good info (for those you know) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. I do not know if the experience and death and early fate in life make me a fan of Brian Fuller but I certainly enjoy its production. I also enjoy the checkered floors, pies, talking toys, gravelings and other bad things :) While the little "Burtonesque", I certainly think this enjoys its own niche that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be an amazing play area. Here we can find joy and sadness of childhood and adults who enter each other and actually make sense and make us want to live life to the full!
