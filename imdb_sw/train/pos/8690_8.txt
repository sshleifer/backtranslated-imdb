Alain Resnais movies are romantic in a way that is not available for promotional, but instead of a shot it seems to end right where memory is edited. Love up to Death is sometimes a romantic game of romantic and romantic romantic film, and any way it takes viewers with a new feature of the relationship of Eros / Thanatos ... or perhaps creates a new relationship, Agape / Thanatos. Origin is like a wonderful surrealist movie of horror. A woman runs around the house when someone dies in her bed - killed, or happened? Recently the tension is canceled if the doctor arrives and announces he is dead, but from there is a new player, the visitor begins: the person wakes up, and after he is dead the woman and the man falls in love with the real effects. At the same time, their friends, who are priests, look at and present their own debate in the form of love, faith, and dedication. Resnais always seems to have a certain device to do these work stories, and what amazing about his films is that such devices always work. In this case, Resnais explores the events and stems of snow falling on the orchestral rear, which breaks into the next shots of the story. They were beaten alongside this face from time to time, the film has no distinction of the epic poem, and I found incredible obstacles to the Divine Comedy from this, with the lack of direct reference to the film. Resnais is known as a very popular film player but this continues to adopt the cinepoem structure for something that emphasizes the degree of self-awareness of the viewer, which has the potential to bring several odd memories. Stories of memory, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
