Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist a few minorities to dominate South Africa in the same way as Gandhi tried to resist British colonial rule in India. Richard Attenborough Cry Independence is not about Biko or racism such as Donald Woods, the chief editor of the autonomous newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. Film has a view to change the view after Biko died in prison due to bad behavior in the hands of South African police. Woods, played by Kevin Kline, should spark it to do something appropriate and run the country to publish books about Biko or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to put pressure on forget books. In that case, Biko dies free. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods barriers to the level and the escape numbers on the yard after the death of Biko. Oscar-elected Denzel Washington is only good in his fourth film just like Biko, but something wrong in the film that tries to describe the racist struggle based more on a white family experiment with more than half the film. Attenborough would have served its theme well based on the rise of Biko for popularity rather than where Biko loved Woods. Perhaps the black actor in the lead role in the 2/2 hour film was not very good for the big box office, but the film was a big office box decreased. Political films aside, the film still imports and sends a message or two, however, in PG-sanitary style. *** of 4 stars.
