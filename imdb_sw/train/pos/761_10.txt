I just want to say that among all the films called classic hiphop I saw as a Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Whenever I ask other people about their fave, then it seems that BEAT STREET comes out more. But still, it's the lowest chance of all. 4.3 is a punch "under the belt" (If you say, 5 points are zone). I like musical performances, breaking the soil makes me like to return, RAMO makes me to cut a piece ... c'mon, it's classic !!!
