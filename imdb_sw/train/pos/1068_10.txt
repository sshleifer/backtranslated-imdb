I think the Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent, and it was a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 creature, the creation of logic, trying to cope with normal life, but still "saving the world". And the siege and logic in the season that provides some series of additional ingredients. The second season though suddenly became odd compared to the first. The cluster of the conspiracy disappeared, and the series had lost a little of its charm, especially because of the "good" creation. Do not misuse the second season is good, but with very little "score". However, they were able to return to a new promising program during the closing season of the 2nd season, where I had much hope to see more. <br /> So I wish them to start making new sessions. And with James Cameron behind this can not go wrong. So if the conclusion I would say is a good series, I am still expecting the third season!
