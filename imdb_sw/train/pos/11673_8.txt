After seeing Charley Boorman in Long Way Round and Ewan McGregor, I longed to see how Charley would be in her own show. I thought Charley came as a good boy who is very basic and low on earth. Its good to see that the celebrities of celebrities and their weight and fitness, are just showing them human beings too! I don't know a lot about the bike, but this show happens I am sure from the beginning. Preparation and preparation of this event looks great. The event seems to be very dangerous and I am impressed to see what Charley and everyone else does and how it gets. I love the speed of the show and the fastest upbeat music. I can't believe that he broke his collar bone, I believe his hope is not the end, I would like to wait to see the next section ...
