Unlike other opinions, I have found this interesting film, even with all its errors and acting the zombie of some actors. <br /> <br /> Become a technology, I've found that interesting experiments and realistic equipment. Although reading people with ideas via computers is interesting, experiments are now done just to do this. I will see that these experiments are scheduled for the very first step, and the results so far are not recommended. The role of the film is well healed. The girl, though triumphant, seems to be stupid. The truck driver is a ring for real truck drivers. The prime minister presents the first question, (the chief researcher tells the minister that he (the minister), does not know if he believes that God created man or that man created God. The secrets they store are appropriate for their characters. In the face of death they act like real people can. It is a warning against the risk of unlimited monitoring by the government. For a scientific and literary exercise is amazing.
