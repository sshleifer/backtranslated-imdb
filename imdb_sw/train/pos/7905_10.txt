I feel very sorry for people who are going to the movies with a pencil and pencil to write errors and put a description about how bad movie. I feel the same disrespect for people who go to the movies and can't improve the reality and / or allow themselves to enjoy 90 minutes from their interesting or busy life! Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a highly entertaining movie. If you take the film seriously, this is not yours. If you expect the film will be like the book in any way, this is not for you. But if you have enjoyed the perfect hilarity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or "what hell I look at" of Moulin Rouge. Or the comedy out of "Sweetest Thing" Then let yourself run for Cowgirls. It has some very real parts. Hilarious truth. It also has real good music, kudos for kd.lang. I also told him that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... I need to say more?
