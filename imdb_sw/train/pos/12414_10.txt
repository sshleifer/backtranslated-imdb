The first American movie of Renny Harlin was one of the best of the horror of the horror ("House of Death" or "Chair") at the end of 80 years. Now, he is the new manager of the new prison reopened, and the man's spirit is behind revenge for the blood. This atmospheric and very proud film has a lot of gruesome gore and violence.Viggo Mortensen, Lister Tiny, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder is a note for leisure.
