I am a member of a marine club and I can tell you the fact that Redemption is a balanced and peaceful and quiet experience. When we put our boats into the water, the banjoes look behind the mind. This film is not available because it seeks a philosophy of humanity in nature and the impact of technology on a person's relationship with nature. We see it in bow fishing. We see it in a tent home. There is also the shame of the man of the city with a sense of superiority to the remote forest "cracker". The fact that the Client from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" means to point to the same level as the trees who also have bad teeth. Finally, the struggle for life and death stands for "human affairs" about "Law". This maritime trip is nearing to the viewer, but woe is not short for characters.
