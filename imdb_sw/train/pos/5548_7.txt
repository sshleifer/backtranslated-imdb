Star Pickford and director of Tourneur - with his two favorite cameramen and assistant Clarence Brown doing editing - bringing great beauty and great sense to this poor story, the Scottish district alone - one place that Michael Powell would spend twenty years later its first great achievement . The vision of the wind and waves, the delightful silhouettes of lovers are not only to strengthen the story, it is a story of struggle against trouble. Officials bring honor to the proud people on their roles and Pickford is brilliant as his character is faced with his roles as a family head, shaking between pleasing and thinking, here with cattle of his father who was going to church, sat with a walking stick with a guest in his hand as a stick, talking to his girlfriend, played with Matt Moore. See if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the set. I tried, but failed.
