This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as British king. "Young Victoria" has amazing production. Each area has been created and decorated in incorrect detail. Wonders, beautiful places and beautiful gardens of all gardeners make the "Victoria Young" very amazing. I was so surprised by a movie of meditation. How everyone is placed in relation to history or forward is well thought, each area is well-composed. The area that bothers me is when Victoria spoke to Melbourne. Melbourne was standing in the middle of the door from the angle of Victoria, while from Victoria's Victoria's angle was the center of the place where Melbourne held her hand over her sores. <br /> <br /> The story of wisdom, is very complicated and understandable by a person without the historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have been reviewed or not even mentioned. I expected a large crop of crops, and only for a few seconds. Overall, "Victoria Young" is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was a long time, so that events could be made well without running.
