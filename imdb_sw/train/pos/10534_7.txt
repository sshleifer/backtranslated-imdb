If it's a good movie or not, this kind of films should be made, I think. Recalls me "I love Huckabees", a very awesome movie with Isabelle Huppert interested in a young American boy in a muddy pond, through an amazing-eyeschist (?? !!!!). I hope the director will continue to cross the border, although I felt the choice of Vincenzo Natali conducted, did not have a trick at all times (some cases were kind of "tarte-à-la-crème", such as children's bottle), pointing to script and movies? The color of "Cube" was black, "No" is white, more fun, surprising, than the original Natali film.
