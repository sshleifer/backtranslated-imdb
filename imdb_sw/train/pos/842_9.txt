Matador is a wonderful, dark and dark melodrama that raises the way over thanks for the two and the most beautiful performances from Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and always trusted Greg Kinnear who has a role here since playing nearby neighbor of Jack Nicholson in As Good As It gets. Plus great goes to text too. Very poor and frequent conversation is given by Brosnan's gusto and a friendly relationship between these two different people convince them all the way. The story takes an unexpected unexpected turns and puts the viewer always guessing where it will go again. Good to touch the art from the director as good use of music, watchdog editorial and unorthodox movies at some point to keep a good voice for the film and for a long time you do not know how to beat the film. But it is also thanks to the highly written script which continues the viewer (I am however) on the edge of his seat.
