"All agreed" is one of the small movies that I always recommend to friends looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the political traditions of the old screwball, but it seems more modern. Even the early 80s condition is not very available. Bogdanovich carefully keeps the whole business to be lighter on his feet, the fact has never made it underground. But, that said, this kind of small movie depends on continuous actors, and "TAL" is blessed by dreamers who understand the needs of this kind of story. It is a movie that cannot go on for a long time in memory if it was not for a short time given by the best: Colleen Camp at the same time shouting for John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak shares all the hair under his hat; and especially when Dorothy Stratten falls to John Ritter and says, "How ... weird." It is this piece of person who does not want to put too much over it for fear of crushing, but it certainly leaves one with a soft heart and a smile on a person's face.
