I can agree with other comments that there was no large amount of history discussed in the film but not a document! It had interesting implications and I think it had a very good job there. I agree with the black family. Events with them seemed out of place. If suddenly it will be thrown but I used stories and connections between families later to get it well. Even though it was no longer effective in 60 years it resulted in a light of the most important ten-year periods. I saw it very entertaining and worth my time looking.
