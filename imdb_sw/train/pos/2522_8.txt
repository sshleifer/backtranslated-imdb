I must admit, for the first time I didn't expect anything good, at all. I was expecting a good movie to promote Gackt and Hyde, but I am glad to say it has much more to offer. Yes, acting is not good, but it doesn't matter either, it is all well planned and brings enough power for their characters. Effects are not available, but incidents are satisfactory. What happened to them is the essence of the story, although it combines extraordinary elements, it also shows incorrect facts. To continue with the characters, their concerns and feelings have come to me and I think that's the key to this film. Lets you think and makes it well to send all the angst. It fulfills any expectations for a good game. I would recommend to everyone.
