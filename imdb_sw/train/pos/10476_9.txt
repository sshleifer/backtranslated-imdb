My first publisher for "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought almost in 1993. I was reading the fabric notes and port said the album, which remains in the most popular part of my collection, was led by Canadian writer Paul Quarrington's . I took the book a few months later and destroyed it! Read awesome! I have read the book many times, every time looking for a new Desmond feature and its desire to complete the Whale Music. I have seen a film in 1996, on video. I have never had a good experience with a Canadian film, but this had worked for me. Claire's role may be different, but generally I think Paul Quarrington's vision was transferred well from the book to the screen. Maury Chaykin provides a moving function as a special focus. The movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. I would like to strongly recommend "Music Whale" for music fans only, but anyone who has ever lost anything or someone, and tried to find their way back to earth.
