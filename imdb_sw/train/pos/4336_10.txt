Something About My Followers is a good film about relationships - first of all an adult and his father, but also a child and his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser has written a biographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, poignant and thought-provoking. It helped me to re-examine my relationship with my father who has died with my old son. Peter Falk is the best as Paul's father - the role can not be cast better. I hope that Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for its performance and Reiser for its script.
