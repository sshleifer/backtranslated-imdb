I must start saying that it has been a long time since I saw it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; A little good romp which was clearly inspired by a pair of music / comedy of new stars or widespread and popular music groups. Kay Kyser's secrets will be a good example. Having a pastor Jones will be released is the best part of the show, if he and his band play many tunes and it is part of the act, doing a good job of help. Hugh O'Brien has a face, Buddy Hackett part of the rumor has this which was released to Lou Costello and therefore, Abbott and Costello take the lead position. I don't know if that was true. <br /> <br /> All inside, a good movie, but important to have a very Spike Jones with his band on the film for history. You want that to be released, because I haven't seen or heard now in two decades. Hope is not lost
