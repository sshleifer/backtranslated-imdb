The 2nd series has left for a good start! I don't think you need to look at the series 1 to understand what is happening but if any of its good ones feel the feelings of the characters and take care of what happens to them. And this show makes you think like that! 4 of the 30-women seem to lead a happy and exciting life but still the premise is reliable and true. Therefore, the changes and actions that take place thanks to their love and sex life are exciting to watch but you also know that these are the problems that occur in real women as well. Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are guided in some way in our lives rather than making these decisions carefully!
