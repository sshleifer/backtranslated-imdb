My family and I have watched this film many times over the years. It is clean, beautiful, heart-stirring and heartbroken. To show mercy to the two families of two countries thousands of miles away from many mysterious groups, it is almost as if God's hand should intervene. <br /> 5 Jodelle Mika Ferland who plays Desi's heartbeat with a little girl, does her best to do her part, and for me I had a Priam choice for leading role. All, 10 out of 10. There is no drop in this human story. Children of all ages will mourn, then enjoy this joy and will bring the family to look with and wait and feel good.
