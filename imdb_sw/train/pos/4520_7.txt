For a very long time to go up to the end, this comedy is quite happy, never diminishing or stretching to look into the "power man" problems, who likes to wear women's clothes in nite. <br /> Julie Walters is as good as always, but Adrian Pasdar is completely trusted to steal the film. He (he) is very good at the heels and silk.
