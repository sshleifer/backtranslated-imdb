This is a very good film and one that I enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine's amazing as always. Michael Caine has received a kind of reputation for taking any responsibility in any movie regardless of the quality or lack of the same but it does good to turn into the Sidney play. From the beginning it is very well written. Who would think that Ira Levin who wrote such things as Boys from Brazil and Baby Rosemary can write this thing. Let's say - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how will you go against this beautiful led by Sidney Lumet. I'm not ready to go because if anyone could give anything about this film it would be a crime. Just look and love it.
