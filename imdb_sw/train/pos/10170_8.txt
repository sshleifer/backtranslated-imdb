In comparison with other review reviews, this film was really amazing! I went to see it and I will try to leave for the clich√©s, the obvious joke and disgusting, all that the trailer was pledged. However, after 5 minutes I found myself laughing and enjoying relaxing acting. With just one body of a 'soft school', his old body can really come in with extraordinary events and, without destroying anything, some time involving animals is lazy. <br /> <br /> The main features of a good film are there; The script, director and executives and compared to other recent experiments in a romantic comedy, this film stands long. Of course, you can't learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with a clear mind as possible to have a good time!
