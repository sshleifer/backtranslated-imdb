This film is an amazing piece that will convince the observer even more that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film artists over the past 50 years. His performance shock, which includes, hate and support you while leaving the foam. The film was shot in the early days of its film work and is very raw, but still has the ability to show Depardieu's skills. Must-look for any fan of Depardieu and for its original work.
