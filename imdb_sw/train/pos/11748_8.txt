Reduced More. I must say the first time I had been a little disappointed at the first events, but having faith in the show, and Abe Forsythe talent of doubt, I kept looking. I can safely say that I have done it. The story grew very well, and all participants have a strong foundation, and many have no information available. The only thing I can miss in this production is the voice and the horrible sound of Lizzie's character. <br /> <br /> Some of the good acting with a stellar plot actually finds this show on the line. Here is hope for another season!
