A few years ago, I bought several DVD DVDs with two films each. One of them had three Three Girls (the second Greek name had a word for them) and this, Happy Go Lovely. It is essentially a comedy of a backstage music in Scotland and includes an improper identity involving one of the players riding from a million millionaire. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and-wow, what feet! Ceasar Romero is a producer who finds his opportunity after the leaves of the leading lady because he thinks she is dating a millionaires whose car just mentioned. And David Niven is a rich man who, while looking for Vera-Ellen, has made a mistake for a reporter who is eligible to interview him but is beaten by Romero. What I just mentioned may be worried but (largely) it is wise if you are interested in exploring your brain while looking at this charmingly screwball comedy and amazing music numbers by Bibi Vera-Ellen. Romero may be very little here but Niven becomes quite proud. Publishing what I saw was really good considering his age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen does well with her lines since she is not a real actress. So on that note, I strongly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs who love the old comedies of music.
