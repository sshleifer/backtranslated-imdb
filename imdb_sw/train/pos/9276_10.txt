The US Government Minister did not want us to see this film, because they have meat and meat in Iran. However, it shows us how Iranian civilization is true, despite the content of the film, which involves the women's struggle there with equal rights in simple words: the ability to watch a football game on the field, which is strictly valid for male viewers only. Film is hilariously funny, and in itself it is evidence of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this film carefully. Five girls are trying to penetrate the police border to the ticket gates for Iran and Bahrain. The next comedy is very amazing to describe, from the bus ride to the field, interfering with the police and the future barrier of girls, to the end. Do not miss this classic film. You must see. One of the best outdoor movies I have seen in years.
