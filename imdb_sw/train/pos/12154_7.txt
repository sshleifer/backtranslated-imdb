Yes, the tap blows scared ........ and Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is a demented and fun camp with a round of the guignol of 60s who entered into 70 years. Released as a double element with a Burt Reynolds FUZZ feature this mad scare is so bonkers as being entertaining. As a mixture of LOCUST DAY, Others and BABY JANE, I advise any observer who wants to take the idea that this means being skew-iff and staying with someone who can move around the village that way. True, drinking when you look ..... at the champagne cheap. Again, with a lot of 30 film movies is also about fraud; The struggle of the best life to get bitter and lose and emotional emotional fall into murder. But this is just plain things. It also reminds me of a lot of BLOODY MOTHER OF NI - Winters shlock fest which makes this film looks very glorious.
