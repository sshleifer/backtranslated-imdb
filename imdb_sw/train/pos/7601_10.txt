Lost is one of its kind ... its very amazing and full of doubts, fun and feeling at the same time. I've never seen any series of TV like this before. Filled with joy of the jungle and has a good screenplay. The actors have removed life on the island in a natural way that I feel lost on the island as I look at it. It is a piece of good work that is reported to a very intelligent form. The series is like a film depicting the lives of the lost survivors on an abandoned island. I am tempted to look at one part after another and I strongly recommend this series for all lovers of TV show. See to see the magic of the lost without anywhere.
