From the first place, I was very excited. "I can say this would be amazing!" I thought. Acting was very good, I felt like I was leaving the lives of these people. Music was also very restrictive. The plan started with a sudden event and then turned around (one can feel) towards an impossible destiny. The building was slow, but I personally like it, as long as the stability of the stability remains in surveillance and is not available before it is ready to pay. So everything goes well, and then the fire starts, and before you know it, the credit goes on. "WHAT?" it was me and my friend of the night-can play. If you understand the purpose of the director, the clarity of clarity means (for those who have seen movies already, see very interesting and hierarchical interviews with Larry Fessenden in filmcritic.com), but I can't help saying you are not completely searched. This may have been solved a little more than a minute before the peak. In any case, it is very serious. These ten minutes can make a difference in the world. (But for those who do not write or make a film, you should know that creating arc stories and accurate time is a great pain in the butt, and I certainly do not make this critique from any kind of pedestal!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo hears me as an interpreter released before the expiry. But the grass, I would like to take a mixture that is made daily on a piece of dog-poo more-compensated for a lot of digital effects (like many movies of fear these days). <br /> <br /> Other comments. Some monster events left me frustrated if I should be afraid or laugh. I don't know how to explain, but there was Monty Python different to feel on this monster in its kind of more obvious "monster". Although this may seem like a terrible rejection to a terrible movie - I do not know, it has still worked for me in another way. I can never look at the antlers of meat in the same way again! :)
