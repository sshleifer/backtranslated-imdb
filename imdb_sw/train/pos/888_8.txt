One of the best kung fu movies, but not as accurate as I expected to comment on. The movie will start well, and the joke will be visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you think at this time) and make non-fight negotiations sequences approved (for movie fu fu, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese films, which were fragments or (after Jackie Chan's police drives I), Pedicab Driver looks at us in modern China. Unfortunately, the end of 1/3 of the film takes a nosedive on the disaster of the dark melodrama which I thought was not needed. <br /> <br /> Steps are generally good, including duel between Sammo and 1/2 of Shaw Brothers only two stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then fighting the end with the tallest man who has a good man of Jet Li. There are only 20 minutes to fight here, which is normal, but what you hear is the speed of the right cameras speed. I find that they are running half-speed film to avoid hurting each other, but there is a good change and then there is this. It really takes away from the fight when this is clear that the footage was messed with. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung fu movies, my comments here will not stop you, and if you don't, you have lost 2 minutes of your life reading this.
