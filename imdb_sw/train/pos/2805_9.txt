Wow, I can't believe I waited too long to see this film. I've never been around to look at it. The plan has nothing to do with me. I don't know anything about soccer (football) I am one of the American fools who have no clue. I never seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz around this film when it was released in the United States. Enough about me. The truth is told, it was a mistake to ignore a small piece of heaven's decisions. It's a fun film. It's full of colors and excitement. I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is sweet and pleasant, you can not help but its roots. It is not surprising why the television show of E.R. she sucked him. I have a new thanks to the Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. The wedding park is very beautiful. The only problem I had was was to describe some of the UK slang and talks through accents. I have turned the English heads to make sure I have nothing. (This is not the opposition of the film!) I am sure viewers around the world have trouble understanding slang every time in American movies too. <br /> <br /> This is a full film date. It has a great deal of games like Rocky, and a strong feeling of women who are empowering women. I looked at my wife, and a sixteen-year-old girl, and we all liked it. I strongly recommend.
