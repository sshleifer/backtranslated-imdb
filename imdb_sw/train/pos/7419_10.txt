On the basis of the preview I saw, I went to "Shower" expecting a sweet little sweet; what I saw is a very touching drama of family life told in some of the lush pictures that I have had the opportunity to see. In addition, reflection later makes me aware of the sudden reduction of events from the past (in the dry land of China, and in the Tibet Sea): is not how the memory works? One time I have gone here, the next I am in an environment from the past, such as .... \ t br>> <br /> By the way, a few years ago "another Asian actress" was released in the United States as "Will We?" (Japanese). As with "Shower," the preview did not give you a bit of depth of the film, which happened to be a psychological study of the trick (though it was not full of funny). Is there a fear, for part of the supplier, to make the film appear also "useful" or "deep" appeal to the audience of U. S.?
