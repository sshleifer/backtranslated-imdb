From the beginning I was very excited to see this film. The post is probably the funniest I've ever seen on the movie. I once bought one for my dorm September. Every aspect gathered in this film for beauty. Not often do you see films of penis, homosexuals, and tribal colors to be recommended by critics. Carell and others sent out give each shock shock. Carell remains sweet in the entire movie where at the end of the movie is rooting so that it will be in its relationship more than you are for getting. The help that is used is brutal, each with some problems with women themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is a lot of memorable events we are given. This is what makes the film easy to remember with love. This film will often be raised when the words "chest" and "condoms" are mentioned in the conversation. Looking at the playground I was attracted to how many people were there to watch it. I saw a group of 60-year-old women coming in. With older audiences, this film has not yet filled the theater with laughter. I think the kind of people who will like this are Office fans and Steve Carell. Most of the jokes remind you of the kind of joke you can see in the Family Family, too. The film is not enough for young boys and it is still sweet and clever enough for middle women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend to go to this film if you have no fan of dirt or if it is easy to anger. However, when you are in the film, just remember all this film is very interesting. Jokes are not "gay jokes," they are just joke. And they are funny.
