I love this film. The songs and stories of stories are very interesting. and the song "say good" always make me. it is a great thing to do to bring puppets in life, through which you care mainly about these things made of clothing and fabric and nothing. great sounds and beautiful talents. why did you have other films that came after this one less interesting, moving and funny? it's that mr. henson is just missed so much?
