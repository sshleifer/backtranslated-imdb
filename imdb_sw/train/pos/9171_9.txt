I am a lover of Jane Eyre and purist, and this version includes almost all the details of the book, and the characters are shown as I have thought. Jane Eyre is a complicated story of great wealth and can not be delivered well in the structure of the length of the element, so it requires a series of mini-TV. Rochester's Timothy Dalton is probably better. There has been a lot of discussion about how she is attracted to her age. In the book, Jane (the author) explains that "about 35" and not the least, but still not middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was 38 years old when he did this, so it's okay. Also, we have just Jane's opinion that Rochester is good. He just met him and asks him clearly what he thinks. As an unskilled and humble girl, I can't think of saying she is good. Rochester who plays Rochester should show us the character of the person, and this is accomplished to the full. I love the relationship between the two guidelines, which is important about this story, and humor to meet them. Some versions have hit it, but this gets right. The 2006 edition of Toby Stephens (37 years old) continues on BBC1 and is really good, so I will decide if I like it when it is finished. When you look at this series again, after looking at the 2006 edition, I decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's negotiations are preserved and this is important for storytelling. Modern reproduction does not work - it is the story of the Muslims and that the poem's poem is appropriate for the characters. This version is smoothly - Zelah Clark is small and the difference between him and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an amazing actor. No additional transitions from the plot and screenplay include all important events, but exclude unnecessary information, making it to the point and intervention. I recommend to all true fans of Jane Eyre.
