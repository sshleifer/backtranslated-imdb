I watched the film once and I can look at it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good at the film, I feel they can use 'non-' character as Alvin Sanders. The Foxx exhibition in prison when he meets Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) is very funny. David Morse is also a good soldier. Its strong but quiet elements are perfect for its role. Sometimes Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) at the theater. Morse ends up fasting Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this situation in each film. I personally love the same quality in the film, where actors live in the same situation as the original film, as these two did in The Green Mile. In general it was a very good movie.
