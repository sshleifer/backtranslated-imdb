It seems to be a decoration of "Primary Foundation 2," to the point that the key part of the audience (including critics) found it was even worse before it was released. It looks even more fashionable for Sharon Stone trash who is like us all now more than fourteen years, and unlike most of us still still look amazing. The first comment on this film was so bad that I had to see myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not recommended as a natural film, but it's not as bad as many comments are making. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, nor Henry Bean and Leora Barish is Joe Eszterhas. "Instinct 2" is an entertaining, exciting average, and instead of adding original color to Jerry Goldsmith, it resembles a little identical to its predecessor. Even the stone provides its distinctive character, creating Catherine Trimell, a very powerful, who can rank a great deal among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. He is an intelligent actor who is not afraid to take risks and can play with camping in his leisure. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main goal for those who are happy to destroy this flick. He was very successful, very many icons, and as all the characters who have reached the same level, his time has come and now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood viewers. <br /> <br /> cast is the best, giving the performances that are better than the appropriate material. David Morrissey is a very good actor and more attractive than Michael Douglas: his acting is free, giving a dense direction, tough to other behavior patterns. Since he has more time on screen and is a film axis, he can keep your thoughts from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a good movie; I only show the difference with me and many comments on this site and my belief that the agenda except the movie itself creates views of many viewers.
