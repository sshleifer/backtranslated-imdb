All about Mitzi. I loved him in this. And did not look fantastic? I love these Sunday afternoon movies of popcorn. This is just like one of those who prove where they are going on a regular business time. Richard's attitude was very strict. I've had dated guys like that. Well, it's not quite like lol. I wish Zack has not been killed. He was cutie and very simple in the eyes. I AM these stories of stalker type. It always makes me wake up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband does not like these types of movies but he is actually sitting with the whole thing and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what Mitzi is following!
