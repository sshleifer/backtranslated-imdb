I just watched the Roll and what joy it was. Toby Malone's performance was seen out, I found myself concerned about what is happening to Matt in all the film, which itself is very happy, very confident and a good mix of rounded characters, quite effective considering run for a while. There are so many good things too, it will help you think to the end. Other observers are just a few bit with a spectacular shadow of Jesse. It may have a big blockbuster of Hollywood but don't let it keep you away, you can do worse than looking at this out, you can't regret it. Good fun. 7/10
