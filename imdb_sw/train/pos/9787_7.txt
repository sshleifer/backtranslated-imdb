This story has been done well. It is sad and exciting about a little girl's journey to discover where she comes from and where she is going. Stephanie was greeted by her mother's best friend after the mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since she was called the 'miracle', she is dyslexic and gets very hard. The result affects those around him. Her relationship with her caregiver and partner of her former caregiver is addressed very well and beautifully, and all of the support is true, third and honest. Arrange close to the village ivory factory in the small Australian town, this is a very hot, interesting film, and it leaves you with a good feeling when the credit is near. After reading some of the other non-detailed views on Hugo weaving, I would add that I think he had been beaten with a brilliant, and was very good. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean he doesn't like it.
