Being half-pregnant does not give me half blind (nor half of hate) when discussing films. Not that I get to do too many times. But this film was a rush to adrenaline! Yes, that's okay - it was more accurate because history went / went - but it did not draw barriers to operating more than the usual scene of the portuguese movie: things like using real places in Lisbon hit by tariffs and recruiting a true crowd for standing by The true crowd of almost 30 years ago. And for God they got justice! Well, in general: very emotionally if you have lived that way, but you will see little improvements that could be made with the needs of the plot. If you just look at randomly, you're in a good historical position, just the most recent kind of History and a little more than a thought-proving than usual. Even with European standards, yes.
