This film was made in 1943 when I think Judy was at its peak (it seems to be wise). In his original film For Me and My Gal people often say that he seems to be disappointed. Well in this film seems to be perfect. He is good and shows that he is very proud. <br /> <br /> I think this film is hilarious, especially at the beginning when he tries to arrange an inspection by John Thornway. One of the funniest areas is my opinion is the Judy's Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (Lol). One case I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily love with love. I mean one minute he despises him and the next comes from the date then the next time they meet after that date they like. Another thing I liked was not the night of opening. If I was Lily I would like to be angry with John but he is not ... it's not just meaningful. <br /> <br /> But all in all I should give this 10 film because it's just wonderful and almost entirely.
