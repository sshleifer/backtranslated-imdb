It all does not even come close to the total part. No problem. This film consists of a top line of some of our most creative creators and other popular names in cast. The groups are organized next to the same topic, "Love in Paris", but the similarities there end there. Actually, considering that the way the head from all these directors takes many forms, it's amazing that we can even feel we are still watching this film. No great effort was made to turn it into a whole. This buffet has many links, I'm glad no one has tried to put them all on one plate.
