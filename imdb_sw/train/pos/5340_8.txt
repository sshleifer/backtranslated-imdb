Clara Lago is amazing as the character of the film title, primarily film about the Spanish / American girl who goes to Spain with her mother during the Spanish civil war. It turns out, the mother goes home to die, and she is left with her grandfather. It also makes friends with more experience for a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) for the first time is a problem for him and it becomes close. The film is well shot, locked in a more narrow color. Carol craves his father, who is a pilot in battle, and you can feel the love of his sher. While the war itself is a kind of taken back seat in this film, it promotes a life of character. I think you'll love it. See especially for Clara Lago, who does a good job like Carol. He is definitely one look.
