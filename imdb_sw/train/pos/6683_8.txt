Forget the meaning of the key, hold your logic on the door, and have a good time with this romantic, incredible, rural-live cartoon. THE DAY OF THE DAY is to be sent to each of the keys of the superhero which you have ever seen, but his incredible super-deserved, deserved, and well-deserved, are well-known to be memorable for themselves. Dark humor, improper damage, appropriate action, and even when it affects or two, combine to make this fantastic comic on lovable lost winners. The comedic talent of actors playing Men's secret - including one secret wife - is a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can be described only as a low-business Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most-wall (and A delightful amazing) criminals ever walk away from the Dark Horse comic book pages and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, heart, and say "hu?" more than once .... enjoy!
