Well ... Vivah is very good, but it is an example of the movie Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc.. Movie is more beautiful, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie is the direction, music and Shahid and Amrita acting (especially the last area). Movie begins with a typical Indian movie --- Girl does not like her mother of action. The story is a movie is normal, but it's good, good enough to be a blockbuster film. A small way is a common story of the movie movie. In general I would say it should twice look at the film, if you want to see the common values ​​of the Indian family and love-of course!
