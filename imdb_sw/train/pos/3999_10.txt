I am ashamed to say that I lost "Mama" when it was on the show. I saw this evening on DVD. I gave 10 votes, one of the few that I gave here. This English freedom is confined to excellent service and quality. It softened me gently. The story, the low and the human, is the most reliable and completely exploited, due to the act of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The movie is awesome. Marks are hard-wired for plot. The storyline is an epic, carefully dressed by the author Hanif to live in everyone's life. This story deals with major issues and deception of painting paintings. And some of these major issues are controversial, which describes the lack of rewards, despite many appointments. It's just one of my favorite films.
