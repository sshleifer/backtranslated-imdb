I liked almost all the movies in the series of Dirty Harry except one that I think is the name of "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was very weak in places too, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorite series, if there is nothing else for the "Go ahead, make my day". This is also responsible for the interesting plot of the person who kills those who have done wrong. Think of the “Magnum Power” that is not hidden on who is behind the murder and you have your plot. In fact there is a little more than that if this shows a good match in the amusement garden. It also feels Dirty Harry to get a bulldog as a gift and comes to Sandra Locke in an amazing area. The only question that remains why Clint Eastwood had to have a good actor Sandra Locke in many of his movies. He brings the score down every time even when the whole movie enjoys me. Certainly he is not bad here, but his behavior would be much better with someone else. Another problem with this movie and other documents of Harry's dirt, sometimes it seems to be a gun advertising. I like guns as a second person, but do you? We really need the image of him describing all the different strengths of his new weapon and how many shot? Still, very good intervention in the films of filthy Harry.
