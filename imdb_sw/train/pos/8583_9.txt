The Korean War has been called the American War. Many unanswered questions were buried with 50 thousand people who died there. From time to time, we are being played on a play or a movie that deals with it, the cemetery stored. Here perhaps it's one of the most beautiful. It's called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is of American soldiers called Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who has been chosen for a secret secret message with his command officer. His work is a defect for North Koreans and provides its services against UN forces. So success is his lid, he shows that it is very important to the enemy and given the position of the Messenger. However, afterwards he was captured by Americans, judged as a traitor and spy. Saying that he was ordered to have a defect, he learns sadly his murdered officer has been killed and has no evidence or lack of proof. He is judged and judged according to. However, his inspiration is faced with Capt Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Interesting commands of Amos Baily, (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he has been given a new trial and if available an offense will be made. The court ceremony is the top line as a forest that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was very far but likely to accuse Communist and trust the hit very close to the house in the 1950s. Due to its excellent script and powerful message, this game has become a classic court room. Look good and accepted for all. ****
