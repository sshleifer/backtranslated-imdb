Although the word megalmania is widely used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes the play of it is also a hard way, you should accept the person who knows how to put on the show. In America In Paris, she choreographs the best number, some of which shop plot, but it's amazing surprising. (See Gene Kelly's "Getting Out Of Bed Routine" at the beginning) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly's star as GI who is out of Paris, he's staying there by drawing, soon she is a gigolo woman rich, but really likes someone else! The story of the hoary point, but the music numbers keep the show here! I loved the voice of Georges GuÂ¨ | tary in this one. 'Stairway to Paradiso' and its duet with Le Gene on 'S' Wonderful 'is amazing'. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. All in all, good, but not a dynamite movie.
