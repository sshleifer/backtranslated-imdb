I was treated with a view of Bag Cracker last night before a preview of the Disney Holes preview. I don't know who decided to show but I am so glad they did. Bag of Cracker is a completely gem, Australian image in the first 80 years as shown through the eye of the child. "Negotiations" between Eddie and his brother were hilarious and, as with all films, so it's true for life. Each shot brought a great sense of frustration as reminding me of my childhood (that age as a director probably helps a little bit) and the radio adds emotions. I only hope that I see again the Cracker Bag on a certain day.
