I learned the story of Charlotte Bronte in high school, and left me with a strange feeling. Here was a good novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and acceptance in the British dark times of Victoria. The little woman was Jane Eyre, a bad and clear attitude and a strong mind and her own will. His story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was sad and stirring. As part of our research, we looked at the change of the 1983 story, and it struck me off. The mini series did not only make the effort to stay true to the original text of Bronte and the essence of the story, but participants were shown the best. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (a lover of Jane, in Rochester's name) were captured in the very heart of their characters. I can't think of someone else in their roles. (Other Rochester exhibitions in other versions such as the 2006 version do not need, power, and compassion are needed to show Rochester accurately. , but she takes Jane's stability, but strong and keenly interested. She holds her feelings, such as Jane of the book, the best time in the story but allows her fire to leave Jane in favorable events. together they are also reliable and true for the volunteer relationship between Jane and Rochester.) Also, supportive participants are also doing their work perfectly, and sets the ideal of a Gothic story story. I highly recommend this version of Bronte's classic story. If you have not read the book before, then you can view this production as a reliable introduction to this beautiful story.
