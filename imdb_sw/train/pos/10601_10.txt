This amazing British comedy shows what can happen if part of London, in this case Pimlico, described itself free from the entire UK and its laws, taxes and post-war wars. The surprise of happiness is what will happen. The explosion at the time of the war raises the discovery of old documents that indicate that Pimlico was sent to the Duchy of Bourgogne centuries ago, a historic profile since they have forgotten. For new Burgundi people, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, without any intervention from Whitehall. Stanley Holloway is the best politician of a small town who suddenly finds himself leading one of the few countries in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is happy as a professor of history who is round with Pimlico. Others in cast out are Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford & Sir Michael Hordern. Welcome to Burgundy!
