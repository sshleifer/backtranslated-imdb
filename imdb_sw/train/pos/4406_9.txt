Surprisingly, this movie has never made a big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the release of the video. My expectations where up but where there is no way to despair. As always with Ang Lee there is an amazing act, an intellectual and exciting plot that you think right to the end and the effectiveness of call. With this Unforgiven this is one of the two western western 90s. The above mentioned features will have a good time. 9 out of 10.
