I found it completely in this and I couldn't wait for each section. Acting has given life how emotionally the lost person in the family should be with the effects that will be with those who are closest to. The only problem we as a family was how quickly 'described' at the end. We could not hear what was said and I don't know what Gary's part in any matter was? Why did Kyle call her and why did she go with her? After investing in the series for five hours we felt that the five minutes only was saved to the conclusion. I have asked them around and there is no friend of mine who has considered it to be any wisdom either. Very strange but perhaps we missed something important?
