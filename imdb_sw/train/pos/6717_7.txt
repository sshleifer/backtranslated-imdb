This document was very clear and causing, and at the same time enjoying, which I thought was amazing. I felt like they did a very good job to play the game from 'its nature until now, but even so, there is a reason I don't give a high score for this film. 'proper names' of games, to say: very on individual sites that are facing, and especially on personal surfers. I felt that the document was more related to sports, sports ideology, etc. would be better (although this was really covered, I don't think it had a lot of time as required). And for many people who are not nuts on using, they sometimes hear them on and on specific areas and special travelers can be boring. Although video videos and extensive research are well respected, it could be presented in such a way that it would be ideal for those who are not surfers powerful. Additionally, my biggest problem was in times that talked about how some amazing and amazing events in the history of surf still have no real picture of these events, and all the time you're waiting to see on this money is a wonderful, breathing event that men are talking about as a life change, and finally you find all men talking about it, and not a real picture. It was also a great concern to hear these stories, and then they could not see them. I understand the difficulty of getting pictures of everything, but please: don't brag about the event, and then don't show it. Overall, the cleanest document I enjoyed watching; not the best documentation for the above reasons, but to be very clean and to have the most exciting pictures and sound, it's a document that I will encourage everyone to watch.
