Every time, Eddie Murphy will hurt you. <br /> <br /> In the film as "Golden Child", especially. This is the film you realize would be the star perhaps Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really works; he is wise, wondering, having a hero, kind, respectful, happy, clean and everything else should be. After being selected to find a historic child who has the key to protect the world from evil (the best and Dance), Eddie goes from California, to Nepal and back, while Kee Nang (Lewis) ) Good is wondering if he is all saying he is a holy old man (Wong, perfect as always) knows that he is. <br /> <br /> It is exciting, breathing in advertising, awesome and, really, funny. Eddie is the only actress I know who can start the film by giving an improper comment after reading a one of the porno magazine and ending with smart-aleck words about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with "Baby" ": it's" Golden "to get. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
