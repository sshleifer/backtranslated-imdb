"Written in the Wind" is an incomplete film, a wonderful kinky, as just director Sirk could do. The movie has entered into a full bucket of Freudian logo, weird melodramatics and different colors. The relationship between financial success and moral degradation is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to show that sexual misconduct is one of the side effects of racketeering. However, I would like to see a movie as a great example of what Sirk can do with kitschy equipment. The color of the color is particularly amazing. Acting in the film is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are very attractive and give them a movie of beauty, but the movie is Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (deserving best Oscar), who can put the film on the boiling point. Kudos for the crash score for Frank Skinner, the work of Russell's Metty's brilliant camera (each single shot is a masterpiece itself), and the design department for production. Also, the tune of the head is beauty. It's a non-fiction movie.
