The film is the first split, Eddie just seems to bring it to the point and makes the most important thing to have ice cream as a child for the old family tradition to get together. The film is very rare in this country but it is unknown in other countries I have tracked through many web sites and yet there is no luck, phone companies that search for common videos and there are waiting lists for a year. SO SO IMPLEMENTED EFFECTS. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a player and sees the video gets, it's worth the money and can't go too bad.
