I loved this film. I first saw when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I was very excited, I brought my copy the next day. Comedy is well played by all involved. I have always had to go back and fix the area where Mr. Tsanders explains why he got water on a 6 ft area in one area with 227 feet in another area. Also see Jason Robards father who plays Mr. Retch. Talent running in the family.
