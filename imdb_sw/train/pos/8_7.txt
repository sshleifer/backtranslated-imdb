A very good player though it seems to have a few places that stop the audience to fill their own action. I can imagine life to be this way for someone who cannot read or write. This film has found the real world: a wife who suddenly is a helper, a relative living with a quarrel, a troubled child who gets immunity and then, usually, comes out of school, a husband of the jack who takes a thirsty kid and buys a beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
