One of them stands the best ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and probably look at least 100 more. My friends and family quotes from this DVD often, you would think we did nothing but look at it. The first part about Alcatraz is slow, but it passes through it or zip through the section Eddie is on stage. See the "Cakes or Death" section (Enjoy Church of England) and "Hitler / Pol Pot" section (Hard to explain, just look). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. In fact he can say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh?) Correct warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four letters.
