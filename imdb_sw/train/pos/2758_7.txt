This film is about the potential relationship between the trader and the person with Down Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Developing character in this film is best. We believe that Harry is a businessman who feeds his family, and Georges is a innocent person who wants love and service from a common "society". Working is best, and the best Cannes actor is well-deserved. The wonderful events in the film show the fact that Georges's bad condition towards her leaving her and her family, and her desire to be treated as a normal person. The song that is played frequently also enhances this message. The film shows that people with disabilities are good backgrounds. We have been treating them with discrimination and indifference, the fact is shown by the area where Georges gives now to the kitchen waitress. If we can understand and share the world of these people, we and the disabled people can be very happy. I was very impressed with the film and the experience of the characters. It is a fascinating film for the good nature of nature.
