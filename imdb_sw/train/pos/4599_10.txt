This is my favorite movie of Jackie Chan and in an interview, Jackie said it was also her loved one. It has amazing buttons and the jaws of jaws as well as some other exciting events as well. This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used part in Rapid Fire, and was also raised in Tango and Money, which used some scenes to open. <br /> <br /> Jackie has police Hong Kong. The story comes immediately to go through an amazing way through the city of shanty and continues as Jackie slides down the hill and jumps on a moving bus to catch evil Ku (who is one of the biggest villains in any movie Jackie Chan.) You can expect some scenes very funny as Jackie tries to balance her work as a policeman and her girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His task is to protect the Secretary General who has enough information to take him, but there are still many problems. Jackie is the best here. The last period of struggle in the mall is my favorite battle to fight anyone - period. It was a very intense fighting I had ever seen Jackie do and ended on a slide under the lights between the lights. All in all, one of his great stunts he ever made and washed him with the skin to wipe his hands. He was fortunate that he had no electricity if the person who had a detective charge used a high voltage instead of a low voltage. <br /> <br /> For all, another Chan is a classic and definitely one of its biggest movies. At the end of this movie, you can tell him he had nothing back and they were not stupid. Many of his employees were injured during this film that no one would assure them again - Jackie had a personal responsibility. No gimmicks, wires or stand - it's a realistic step of life that is treating a look. It is this kind of action that has made him a wonderful thing and he is a movie that will attract people 100 years from now. If you haven't seen this film and it is a fan of Jackie Chan or a general step, put yourself on treatment and watch this film. It's really interesting.
