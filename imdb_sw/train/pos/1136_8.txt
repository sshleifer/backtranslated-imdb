I don't know that these comments have a real spoiler, but I keep them safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the film. <br /> <br /> Wish this film, and so everyone I work with - and that's the point. I used a great part of my career in movies, without being an actor. Such people are the heroes of this film: gaffers, smokers, top-air directors, publishers and authors, people of clothes and etc. etc., and the whole thing is told from their perspective, at least for a great scale. Many executives are nuts and engaging because of ignorance, which is what modern films, but you should work with the executives to realize that this film is a real life game! Possible caution of damage: in one large area, two directions, all participants, it is_is learning_of how to_to inform something, anything 'out of the script', and another actor, and begin to start making lines, expressing it, and resisting each other's performance. Since this film was shown inside, what it was, '91, has become a style of doing it, especially on TV. But it's not difficult anyone has done it well.
