I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena, and after hearing about seven minutes in heaven, I saw it as soon as possible. The movie is not just a comedy if you think a lot of these many things went like children and now it's going to not just a movie movie directed by phenomenal jennifer connelly was captivated to my mind that this movie was strictly written and directed it was one good thing I liked and watched it times and for those who enjoy good laugh or love jennifer connelly you can't stop seeing this movie !!!!
