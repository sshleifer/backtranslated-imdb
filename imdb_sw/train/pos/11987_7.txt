Since it has been several years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to turn and look more at the dept, but the first details from the critic the critic <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with, has made me happy of childhood, made it surprising, lacking some of these things today that we certainly do not like what we did back in the day, well in the inspection ... animated, it's like chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of those old, so it has that weird feeling around, I can't remember this series as well as I would like to remember. But in my opinion it was so great, it came with some kind of message, not a wild message, yet it's one of the old messages to be forgiven. Now I don't want to talk past or anything but I feel like the time you got my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or whatever else like, we have these new or close presentations like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel like we do not have the same spirit in the cartoons or real performances as we did in the early days. Now maybe I am wrong but I feel like time has changed so much, I will be glad to see this series as Talespin reopened on the TV screen instead of the new. those, go back to my childhood cartoons, give the children a certain day, give them back ...
