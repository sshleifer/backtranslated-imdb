The Story of the Spirit, (The New House) is a bad story of fear. This comes from the cycle of fear and the series of Ghost's first seventy years. Beginning with the end of each story is told by Sebastian Cabot. Remember from the first family series, the Interior Family in the 1960s? This story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as chief actors, and as the main characters in the story. If you are alone, I would recommend that you look at this. is strict, no gore or curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the bride. David Birney played his husband. Both employees were very good at their place. I gave this high rating. I highly recommend this story.
