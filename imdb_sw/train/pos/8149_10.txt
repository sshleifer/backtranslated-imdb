I saw this film first when it came out in 1994 and just look at it soon and it's a funny STILL. I don't know if you should understand the hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 90s when NWA and Public Enemies were over, there was an internal clash between groups and members when their separate routes (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There was also the accessible to be found, which can be easily accessible that begins to make the area (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc.). This film is so interesting in a way that it looks like a real memory. Kasi Lemmons has an interviewer who spends a year in the name of rap rap rap... The members of this group are the Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Delicious Basty (Larry B Scott / Nerds Revenge, Defone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). It's a rap group that makes them compete. that is the most shocking in its exhibition of the hiphop industry of 80 years and in that way it enjoys. But, if you know the rap of the 90/90, you know how much of these things are true. without hip hop skills, it's still funny funny movie.And for all who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first movie spoof either. In my opinion it is similar to surprising and somehow, better than Gonga As the Spinal Pipe is for heavy metals, the Black Planet is Rap.And the songs are also released.DVD is a full additional chalk to add music videos to NWH as a group and solo artists. Good performances by Rusty Condieff by Larry B Scott.
