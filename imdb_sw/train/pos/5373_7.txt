The little boy and their daughter of the cherubs come in and begin to restore, but incredible events occur and particularly affect Sophie. Her favorite cat is killed even when her birthday is lost when one of the house pipes suddenly lose blood on the visitors (sequence, this!). What? The old house is really haunted? Or maybe the right neighbors cause all the fears?

The tension is built with knowledge and the house of the name is filled with beautiful surroundings, like a pair of landing stamps used by the husband to kill his wife.
