Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and has come to London to buy coal in "Agent Agent," film 1945 also for star Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His documents have been stolen, accused of murder but he has decided to get coal for his people so that they can fight Fascists. This film has its good and very bad points. It is high standards for the sky and for doubts, and is very entertaining. Bacall is very good, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is meaningless, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix accordingly pathetic, and Seymour very angry. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>. Certainly, no. Boyer is strong in his role even with a fatal concept, but Bacall is 100% of the US, not the UK's highest class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is different. His work is not about destruction; he is the best in another film. But she is a wonderful woman, and a lot can be forgiven. Paxinou is approaching high and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel visitor who learns human nature. It is a great place and its performance is perfect, while some of the direction of other actors is not good. This was definitely a case of small parts, only small executives. Seymour was not a small actor. Really worth seeing even for his mistakes.
