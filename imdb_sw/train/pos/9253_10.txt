Well, movies are not "awesome". Well, I agree, there are a few lines of HUMOROUS, but there is really nothing to laugh at. For example: Before the sex area of ​​steam between Eleniak and one of her male costars, sh is safe for bed and can not remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to find the key, he says, "Okay, don't go anywhere." <br /> <br /> See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> Plan and Acting is good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak will definitely steal the show. He is hot and sexy and there is a real steam area and he that one can not help but restore it again and look again. <br /> <br /> There are also some very sexy cases with him and he has some very stimulating lines. <br /> <br /> Overall, 5 stars. I just like to give three if not to Erika Eleniak.
