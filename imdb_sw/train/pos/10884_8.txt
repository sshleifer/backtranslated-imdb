for the flick of the film, this film is much better than the most in genre.yes is a wonderful job - the livelihood of energy continues to kill people, people die, yada yada yada. There are some positive positive effects on this film. The mask of the work of wore.it is definitely surprising to say at least and the unique possibilities (although I have never watched every film of slasher held) also, the genesis of the worst thing is something I have not seen before, and through it finally meets its end is a concept of the novel, as well as I know.i also loved the weapon of hired by Mr sicko, for many murderers. genre, but that is a small concern. The movie does not self-reliant, which is something more slashers faced with.oddly enough, when watching the movie, I was reminded of "early Friday film 13, which took themselves in large quantities. The killer suddenly bears as if it is one of our awesome icons. In this, I mean its movements and its effects on shooting, and also the way they have traveled. Crazy bears more than identical identities (actually completely cut) of other popular titles of fear.And in the last episodes, we have our scumbag, once again, looking exactly like 1 horror icon i mentioned.in the fact that the end end is almost perfect Travel from another icon in the type of slasher. These events were weak and non-standard (for clear) by the way, the movie installed in Australia, so if you're a sucker for chick and acce nt Aussie (like me) you'll be in heaven.if you don't, than it might be something big about you.one something big about this movie: beautiful Kylie Minogoue (just not getting too attached) there is one non-aussie accent, for The honor of Molly Ringwald.overall, there is more reason to look than I enjoyed it and I was happy.so, I must give it "Cut" 8/10, which can seem to be too high for other people.
