I remember seeing this movie when I was around 7; and at that time you screamed. I had seen a violent movie before, but I did not see the film and the result and the reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose the happiness. What this movie and accident failure to do was to be true. Crash tried to show how racism was rough (and Crash actually had an anti-Asian preference and came to them from a good moral position. Grand Canyon came objects from a sharp and realistic view that in fact you are approaching the ground rather than breaking. Especially when you compare the end. The end of this accident is the end that you think is the best that connects everything. While the Grand Canyon is only in a quiet script, where you do not know anything is changing in the behavior of behavior but that is because life is just going on, there is no proper end. Regardless of the good ... bad you. No end of the chapter to start another.
