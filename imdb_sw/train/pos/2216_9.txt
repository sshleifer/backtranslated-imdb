Historical stories have come to the story of old age involving free people in the civil war before New Orleans. It starts slowly but takes steam once you have learned about the main characters and the actual action can start. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. They may not have all the rights of whites but certainly they had more control over their expectations than their slave slaves. Men and women in this story must each make their choice on how to live their lives, to give in to the destruction of the system or to live positively and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella, and Marcel.
