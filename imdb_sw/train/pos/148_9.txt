Like its original film, "In Cage of Glass", Agust√≠ Villaronga reaches a sharp stream with poetry that is more visible than it was developed. This is one of the most visible and haunting images that one can see. An elevated actor, a high and low level of violence threatens the mlolramatic or farcical, but never comes into it. That way, it eliminates almost impossible: to be on-top and however with the pain of prevention, being so charged and still so understated, and even bombs finals are the feast of the eye recipe. Unabashed, gorgeous, and very ... this film is superb!
