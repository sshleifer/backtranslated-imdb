I don't see how you can say that the nightmares of Freddy are cheesy and burst. You don't really know good TV when you see it. Events are not full of matches and blood. Freddy is creative through killing people. I love the nightmares of Freddy and I hope to get all 44 pieces on DVD. Best events are: Special Saturday night, Daze School, and Love of Stinks. If you think this series has been spilled you have a right to your opinion but remember it's just your opinion and it doesn't mean anything. The Nightmares of Freddy always have one of the best ever ever and you come to accept the same truth soon. If you do not like it then don't look at it but be good.
