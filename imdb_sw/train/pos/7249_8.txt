It is difficult for me to give the number of "stars" to this film, but I have lived for 8 because of its high production standards and what, in 1968, the film's innovative films. Remember also that I have not seen since 1969. But it caused a strong feeling. Kill the Day of the Day should be one of the anti-war videos that have been done. This only achieves this by a very realistic expression of the actions of a few of the troops in North West 1944-45. No films before this showed the war in the level of infant squad and very brutal description, and all in a cold and merciless manner that allows works to speak for themselves. No sermons, no feelings, no comic aid, no hard events. Unfortunately, there is no trick either. Because of their condition - try to stay alive - the characters are considered as flat, known. As "entertainment," the film does not do it, though it was obviously not "interesting". It was aimed at giving you the head and trouble and fear of World War II and the general war. This was twenty years before Platoon and thirty before saving private Ryan, both of which are more than "watching" the film. Here the flat characters and generally are unacceptable, lack of concrete conspiracy, and inappropriate images (including what may be vomiting on the show screen) to make the film hard to stay, although it's only 95 minutes. So, 10 stars of production and originality, 4 stars for the feeling you will have at the end, the bonus star for having his heart right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl Foreman's underrated the "Victims," ​​the same as being beaten by the most interesting and stimulating film, the Day of the Day Discovery seems to be a DVD. Why not? These two films have been on the cable several times.
