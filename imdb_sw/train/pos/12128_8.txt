I only saw "the Human Bondage" for the first few days ago by WOW! What's a secret and close film. I liked how much music went to every step of Philip's feet. It gave you buttons for some reason ... One of the main features of this film is that you see Bette Davis coming into her own eyes before your eyes. He is good, not because this is his best job, but because it was not out of the ordinary to be very bad, angry, and freezing as a modern actress in 1934 ... Bette was a dangerous student, always wants to be different from this is correct when he began to realize that he could be evil and brave as he wanted and people would love him. If you are a true lover of film, it's amazing to see ... As a "quantity of music and fire .. Yes ... an old and some sparklers" or "But you are Blanche, you're in that seat!" or "TO ALL MY LIFE, I continue to love the person I killed!" ... That's from his few films, but you get my drift. He was very brave, sassy, ​​and foreign look with those very beautiful eyes. After seeing this, I can't believe it was a double remade. I thought he was good and couldn't understand how everyone was not falling for him, but again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... The only thing I didn't like was something that was normal and recorded in the original movies. They would behave that they hate so much that it is impossible for someone to fall to them first. The performances were good, but in real life, Philip had never been interested in Mildred. That's really easy ... Look!
