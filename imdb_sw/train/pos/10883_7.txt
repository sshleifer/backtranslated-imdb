This is amazing on the average slasher, that's fun and well done, and a year of honor! All characters are polite, and the story is very fun, with Molly Ringwald played a very angry bitch. I bought this at a pawn shop for $ 1, and it was of extraordinary value, and the special effects were very good for the budget, as well as I loved the killer was dressed as it was creepy. The latter was so cold, as I liked how they defeated the killer, and at the end of the prediction was also very interesting, with all the characters except for Ringwald they were so awesome! It is well organized and written, and I thought it was creativity and nature sometimes too, with some of the events of death were very surprising. The killer did not want to move around, and I liked, and the fans of Slasher (like myself) should enjoy this film, as well as the opening was also evil, and they are filing the film! This is an amazing slasher of the top, that's fun, and it's done well, and a decent year, and I say it's worth looking! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall does well! works here with a stable camera function, using the creepy environment, beautiful horn and put the film fast speed moving. Acting is firm! Molly Ringwald plays a bitch very well, and I had trouble feeling for him, after all he had to be a heroine, he turned better towards the end, but not so much, I was surprised he decided to make this film, however he worked good !. Frank Roberts is wonderful as a murderer, he is shocked, angry and had a hell one of the mask, and this man had no mess, he was wonderful! Kylie Minogue plays very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is good and does well as another heroine. Some of the cast are well. Generally well worth looking! *** among 5
