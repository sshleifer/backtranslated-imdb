Jon Voight is a brilliant in the midnight cowboy, but the performance of Hoffman, although recalling the future turning into Rainman, is a kind of performance that makes me watch movies. As a characteristic of New York's character, Daniel Day Lewis's event "Bill Butcher" in New York groups comes to mind as comparable, and the Day does not provide its emotional qualities that Hoffman gives Ratso. It is an example of Hoffman's way of acting that the more we know and Cowboy's Midnight is OK. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the film playing around people in a way that raises their performances beyond their normal levels. Buck Voight is so naive that he could walk out of the film altogether, except Rzo dismiss him down - dismiss him, but also teach him, much about how to live and, more importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie on the escape that turns into a movie about searching for yourself. I think that, like the most effective movies, it has a very good message, that no matter how much waste you may have (Ratso clarifies “lose”), if you can find a way of self-confidence, you have the secret to life, you can even have the same knowledge with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy and Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more than a film about finding that it turns into a film to escape.
