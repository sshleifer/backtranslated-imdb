I loved this show. That is why I was desperate to learn recently that George Lopez is a racist, and that he drove Masiela Lusha off the show, just because he discovered he was not a Latino migrant, but was a migrant from Albania. I learned this from people on the show. He was one of the best parts of the show, and so, learning that even among those you would think would be sensitive to racism, that they could also hate someone, just because of the country they were born, it is really desperate.
