Due to the different circumstances of 2009 where the fact is that we have a black president, this movie takes great historical importance. For the value of entertainment I have found this film to be engaging and interesting. I had been taken back by the apartheid discrimination, but I have also found music and playing it with wonder. It is also very cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young child actress. He plays Rufus Jones, a little boy who is comforted by his Mammy. He is told 'Why some day you can become President'. This was ridiculous in 1933 that was shocking and considered to be interesting, interesting and interesting. Most of the films are a series of fantasy of what the government would like would have been run by a black man. They show government seats such as the Baptist church. The truth is when I went to this film one day opened it. It is done well and very enjoyable. I believe if we can look beyond racism we can see this film for all it brings us. In fact you realize that it is not just to be ignorant to have a black president, but that it is normal, it only makes this movie that fits most. It shows clearly in time for our common understanding.
