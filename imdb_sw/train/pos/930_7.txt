I am sure that many people already know the story - Ebenezer Scrooge uses three ghosts of Past Christmas, Present and Yet to Come which shows the parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and changing his ways. The story of the classic Dickens in one form or another standing a test of time to be a favorite favorite holiday. I looked watching 1951 star Alastair Sims, and I believe that she is sure Scrooge, I am attracted to this edition, which was offered when I was in secondary school. George C. Scott has Ebenezer Scrooge who is influential and useful, and actors playing ghosts are terrified and scared. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit too. This version has been done well, and uses modern photography styles (for the 1980s) that make it much better for my kids than the 1951 black and white version. This is a fitting mix of stories and it's one that I watch almost every year at some time in the Christmas season.
