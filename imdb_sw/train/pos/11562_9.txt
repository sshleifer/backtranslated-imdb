I can just get on how interesting pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the film is not even suitable for extra characters because you can't be given a dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon has already been in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau had already won his Oscar for Fortune Cookie (another film of Billy Wilder also with Lemmon). That movie was not as good as this because the story could not develop during a very long time (I think it was about 2 hours). However, this goes at an hour and a half, although the introduction of events leading up to Lemmon ends in the floor of Matthau is a long tad (so it was this sentence). That's a small quibble though and all the right time you have a wonderful time. I have already written comments about how tracking this film is facing and I can't go further into it. The reason for this is that such a movie was made only if the American film was started to fall rapidly. There are gender references but they are dealt with in a fair way that you can't even get "Well, I never ..." from a wise person out there. It is a pleasure to see a movie from a long lost and that perhaps why this goodwill did not work because it had Matthau and Lemmon saying a few words of f and which are not suitable for them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, now all have gone and you can only be happy that you can still enjoy them in a fantastic film like this. I think the only male in this film that is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So there is that. Only one of the best comedies and films ever. Add: I just learned that John Fiedler has died so for all the fans of him I am very sorry. I had no sense of disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah sometimes.
