One of the most beautiful television sets of ten years ago. For five hours, thoughts and sympathy are always as they explore many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first he came across as a brazen copper in battle with the heroine, but then he showed that he was wise and caring, working with him in revealing the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe he comes out of the world of television soap. His work was very great, because he continues to be exciting and fun while trying to balance the case with the problem of caring for his mother. I would like to continue to talk about every member of the striker who contributes to this wonderful game, but their efforts would have little meaning without a delightful script which constantly affects your attention on any characters. It plans like this that returns a person's confidence in a television festival, at the same time making it impossible to stay for a lot of waste that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
