If this film is made a few years later, I would give a low score. However, for the year 1909, this was a small dandy movie and still stands well today. Do not try to compare this silent film to the future sores - the industry has changed significantly that the first decade of the 20th century does not appear as a movie in 1910 and more. This video is 11 minutes long (about the average film back at that time) and is a different story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. Many know the story, I can't define it more if I don't want to destroy the film. It is worth saying that it is very creepy!
