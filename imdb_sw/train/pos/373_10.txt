This movie is an exciting, amazing piece of work. I saw it at the playground when you came out, but I was only 13 and I wasn't "getting" ... I saw again when I was 20 years old (on a video of course and I currently own it) and just beaten off. Steven Spielberg created a good film that keeps you locked in it from beginning to end. I have also read the book, but there is only something about the movie that it does for life. draw, act, music, costly, environment, everything, it's very amazing. you laugh, you cry, you are happy ... it gives you every feeling that can be seen. it is one of its best working pieces and should not be missing!
