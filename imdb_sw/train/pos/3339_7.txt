Brother Farrelly, Bobby and Peter, come again. With the "Fever Blow" creators of other films that are concerned with many themes, leaving the same technique when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film on the screen, something that would be difficult to do. This book, which deals with the futility of man and soccer, has been installed in England, where the games use many of the fans of the UK games. It is a loan for Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, to change the book in a language that can appeal to many Americans, while they make their hero, a fan of Boston Red Sox. "Fever blow" is a film that shows a great fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life is in Sofi's summer season, and who is a eighth grade teacher and secret ways to involve his pupils in the issue. he tries to teach them. When Ben takes his four best students to visit a local company, meets, and falls in love with Brainy Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who is going to a place, but thirty hours, she does not have her own life. The following two lovers of worship through attending the red Sox, on home games, in Fenway Park. The team's fans are probably the most trustworthy people in the world, with a good team but up to 2004, did not win the World Series. In fact, in the end, from what we heard, was changed because it was the year that finally won the event that prevented them for thirty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the film. Mrs. Barrymore is the most commonly surprised at her appearance in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television actor, turned out to be an actor of the film, has a good opportunity here than his last appearance in "taxi", in our opinion of humility. Brother Farrelly's film will convince their fans as fans of baseball and this baseball story.
