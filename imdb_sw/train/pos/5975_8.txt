Every film leader and head of metal hated this film but I enjoyed it. I saw this as a child on TV somewhere and I was attracted to the place that Sammi comes to step and makes a trick or treat it quickly. The movie itself was typical of 80, the boy is hit close by the bully and helps them to help to beat the fighters but it goes away and is destroyed. Matt from Melrose Place picks on Skippy from Family Relationships so Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to console and break all of the hell loses, shows where Tony sings (oral tips) and playing for a metal song before shyt hit fan . There were many mistakes and things but music and the overall picture was enough to keep my fist pushing 8 out of 10
