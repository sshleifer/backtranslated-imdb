This comic book style of this book is amazing, it has a very good style and a good future style. Author Steven de Souza, who also wrote the Commando, gives Arnie a lot to cook out: "Send me a copy," after signing the contract and hitting a pen for the lawyers back; "What pain in the neck," after blowing under the subzero and copper wire; "He had to split," after blowing his body between his feet; and finally, as Killian is riding through a flag with his own face, Arnie concludes, "Now it is faced with the spot." Happy enough, bears to remember in general, similar to another Schwarzenegger.
