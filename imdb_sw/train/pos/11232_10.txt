Okay, so the first few season took time to affect a specific path, but from the beginning, Frontier Hidden has given them good lines and storytelling, and have always admitted their mistakes. They advise people to see the new sessions first, so they can see how well they show, and understand how much has changed since the first time. Sent there is wonderful cooperation and shows screens. The entry of visitors to markers on the show and for fans also shows for the show, as the lines of the story come powerfully. The show has emphasized the constraints and its multi-story lines - depression, drug abuse and common homosexuality - and these can be rubbed a few people a bad way, but that's what Star Trek is and all about. It shows the lines of these stories through smart and emotional, dealing with them gently and well. Yes, they have used other characters from the history of Trek, but they have made the right characters - Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who were widely used in the show, had a restoration in New Frontier books, but lost their sizzle over time, while Peter David more towards wild fantasy against sci-fi fierce, and HF shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and can know people involved. They provide a bloop for each section, so the fans can see the laughter they have, because it is people who make their extra time, by volunteering that will make many professional artists surprise! What this series, which is approaching nearly 7 years, has been completed with a small amount of resources not something amazing - bringing people together, motivating others to do so. HF will live a long time after the expiry, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
