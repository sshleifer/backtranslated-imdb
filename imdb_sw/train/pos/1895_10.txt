I watched this Christmas season, I don't know why but remind me of Christmas so I watched it, so there is us. Arthur is a film I watched through a huge dumb smile on my face and a mix of special performances, the beautiful jolly music and script to fight with wit and charm that causes it. Dudley Moore makes a behavior that can be easily hated (destructive, rich, drunk person who feels himself) but turns out to be the person you like. Liza Minelli is as good as Linda Morolla the pastor of a pastor who can pull hard / soft inside the woman Arthur into almost the world she gives to. John Gielgud gets all the lines of juicy and heal them with joy. I can look at Arthur again and again and always make me feel good, see if you need to lift his beautiful film.
