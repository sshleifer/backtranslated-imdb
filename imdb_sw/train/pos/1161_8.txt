It was a very small budget (it is some of the scenarios that seem to be written by the home video record). However it has a good line of plot, and it is easy to follow. 8 years after the shooting of his sexual step Amanda is given from the mental district, with the help of a doctor who she is confidential to have a relationship with. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the movie Amanda kills him and takes her back. Then he sees his neighbor Richard looking at him and stopping something until he is with him. He is guilty but after another neighbor Buzz finds that Amanda killed the doctor and tried to kill Laurie's wife Richards (this is after Amanda and found her on a hot tub). Then he stops doing Innocent and killing Buzz and later on an attempt to kill Richard who thinks he likes and cares. And you will have to rent a movie to find out if Amanda is dying or not. In general a good movie, reminding me of my many life you know the whole collapse of the neighbor and stand without nothing until you have a part.
