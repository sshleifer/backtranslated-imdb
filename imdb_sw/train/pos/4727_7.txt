I was so happy to love this movie. Authors' writing (some of the "nonsense" I found, some I did not - because of the actors talk about someone else), a good actor (especially John Cassini), great comeos, interesting and unique guides. I leased to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed he was in it a short time, blink and you miss him!) But he got a very enjoyable movie. I'll check it again before I turn on Netflix. I think executives and want to be executives will enjoy this film. The latter is somewhat expected but you want them to do something different (and more positive). The film has not received the best except for the "festival" market. I recommend to anyone who likes biz acting.
