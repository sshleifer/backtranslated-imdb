After seeing Dick Tracy in a $ 6.99 bottle at a future store, I decided to do it without previous knowledge and become a great fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was so surprised to see a very interesting, entertaining movie. The movie goes well, it has undoubtedly another stable performance from Warren Beatty, but the actual film standouts are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to know that Pacino was chosen for his performance as head of the top squad trying to get down to the city. Madonna was as good as a desperate girl, very interesting and added to her performance. If you enter the view of wanting to look at the fun, the most effective movie with a strong script then give Dick Tracy a quiz. I don't think you will be discouraged. And Look for cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
