I ran to this film on tv and couldn't turn it off. Peter Sellers plays with a non-collapsed counterpart who falls to Goldie Hawn who is very hot and good (who didn't?). The way Goldie's behavior holds from the beginning of the film to the end is unusual even today. This movie has given me different angles in human relationships and I found it very much. Peter Sellers's role was hard to sell, but I think he is doing well.
