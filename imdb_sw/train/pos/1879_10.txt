I was too sandy to remember when I saw this film first. But I saw it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family is welcomed. We push at least once a day. I love this film. I still laugh after all this time. Indeed, it is about a true victim, a drunkard who is innocent. The whole thing is that he still has lost humanity in others that we see in the film. And that he is ready to provide all for love. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh. Much to laugh. His judgment, sweet, and if your buff of the film, will help you change your idea of ​​"Funny". Look at your group of friends or family and I promise you, you will have nothing to talk again with the Authur lines on your head. It will make you laugh for years to come. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult, in my family, to find a film that everyone likes. But this film, I feel, has made us approach. And I know it will do the same to you !!
