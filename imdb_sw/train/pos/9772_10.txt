Theodore Rex is most likely to experience cinema at all times, and indeed it is an important step in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this intellectual work, Jonathan R. Betuel joins the creators of the famous 20th century film, such as Francis Ford Copola, the Scorcese of Martin, Orson Welles and the Roman Polanski. Specific effects are not subject to breathing, and doing any work with Spielberg looks and basic. During the release, Theodore Rex was a revolutionary gem that brought the film's decision to the standards never expected by the film makers. The concept of making not just a motion picture of dinosaur, but changing a full-scale, novels of an exciting detective, sharing with dinosaur "talking" and modern name such as "Theodore", and a female police officer who was human as we know. The world cannot be the same after gaining the greatest beauty. Watch Theodore Rex is the same as looking at God's face and hearing him say "you are my beloved creation." This is one of the few films that are NOT FORWARD !!!
