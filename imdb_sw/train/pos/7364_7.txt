It's not always easy to describe what the film looks like, but this time I think I've got it. It reminds me of two movies: Trainspotting (small criminals who took some medication and doing stupid things in Schotland) and Blair Witch Project (because of the style of imitation). two friends, one of them from prison, the other has not been treated yet. For a stolen car they drive through the Scottish country but rather than the run of gasoline. When they try to get fat, they find a field in the middle of anywhere. The farmer thinks they want to pick him up and say the gun on one of them. Most of all goes wrong. One of the friends defeats the daughter of the farmer and should run. What follows is a man looking through the fields and forestry of Schotland. Two friends should run their lives. It looks like this film was only hit for 12 days. Okay, it's not quite valid because most of the day is the same place: Scotland, but I still see it very strange. Especially because this is not really bad movie. It may not be the greatest movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they have. I had a good time to look at it and generally enjoyed the movie. I offer 7/10.
