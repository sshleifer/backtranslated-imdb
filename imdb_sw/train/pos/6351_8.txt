When Grinch came out I was excited though I thought it would be fun to go to the lucky film and it was. Although it had a little dream before touching Christmas. You know the kind of dark and spooky. I loved this film because it helped to fill people with the Christmas spirit. So more Grinch has saved Christmas. And what happened then in the Whoville say that the heart of Grinch grew three-day size. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
