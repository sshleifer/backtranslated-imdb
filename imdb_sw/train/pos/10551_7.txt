Sit, Write? Nothing recent "how like?" The Fest offered by Natali Vincenzio, and star David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two lost. One has problems with friendship, has got cans from his work (because of problems of relationship) and the police should find him (because of his work and his relationship problems). Another boy is agoraphobic who refuses to go out of his house, meets a desperate girl who asks his mother to claim that she has been upset when she does not buy a cookie. Oh, the police are after him too, after the girl's mother sends them to the capture. The man, what day. <br /> <br /> What if You Can Do All These Lost? That's the whole premise behind 'No'. Two fools know, fighters, girl's quotes, cars, lawn, roads, everything? disappear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I have thought of. I also looked at this time, 30 minutes went on the film, and I still had the remaining hour in the film. 2 actors can do this work and put us happy for 60 minutes? Although the characters are trying, 60 minutes are long and there is an air defined in this movie. But the two actors, who are the friends of each other's life and director, have a great repertoire for each other, that was fun looking at the discussion and improving the two goofing almost to do. There are many common things, but it is more than their answers to these things that eventually make this film appear.
