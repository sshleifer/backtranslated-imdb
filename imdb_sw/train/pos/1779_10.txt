I love this film! 10 out of 10 hands down! That's very good! I'm not a lot of fan of movies but I gotta tell you this opened my eyes. Wonderful colors and quick energy. I was fortunate to catch this in the screening time of Zoinks! The Film Festival in Boston, and the story was good for me from the beginning. It had a lot of adult and behavioral themes and when it ended I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem is that of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! He SUCKS! I have found that the wood restriction is looking for better performance. I'm not the director he was thinking when he gave her. But if you ignore it you can't help but give this ten great movie!
