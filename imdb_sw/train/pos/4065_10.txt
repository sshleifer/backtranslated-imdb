I've seen the original version of English on video. Disney's choice of voice actors is very visible. I can't believe I say that. The story is about a little boy who meets a girl with a history of his own. These two are thrown into one of the fun and exciting stories in any animation film. The quality of animation is the best! If you have seen Disney's service delivery to Kiki you can see the quality in their production. Approaching the rescue by stealing the story of the White Dog dog. (but not quite!) Finally the Miyazaki films are well presented! I can't wait to see the English version of Nausicaa.
