This is the difference of the Wax House, in both the plot and the role of the star of both movies, Vincent Price.In both photos it plays with an experienced artist who has been sent on the edge into destruction when his creation is used by others very talented and very few in this film. He makes a creative film for witches of action who wish to work on his own task only to be frustrated at another time of fraud, Rinaldo's Head (John Emery) insists that he honors his contract and gives him the first choice of any fraud he designs. already ill-built Rinaldi as his former wife is now the paramour of Rinaldi. He uses his talents as a man of deception and as an example of a brilliant retaliation on Rinaldi and others who prevents his plans to be recognized as an actor and manufacturer. <br /> <br /> Prices are very pretty show the whole here and gives a well-judged star turn like a crippled person who suffers sympathy for the audience. Some of the cast are capable if not the color and the weight of the whole project falls to the price that carries the load easily. Beautiful B Movie melodrama, this is a movie of crime instead of awesome pictures and it's fun to give you not expect a hub .hot in black and white is less than a year and looks better like melodrama and enjoy its presence stars give idiosyncratic performance
