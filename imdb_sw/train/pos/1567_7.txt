It is not a very bad film, and Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we can be with Charlie Chan, Fire, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Holy etc. In other words you get the opportunity to use at another time with other old friends, from open to urbane, kill and killed - always enjoy my book. Barrie is a hard-boiled blood for retaliation and clear his father imprisoned and dead, detective police for planning and making with his coterie string of tornado. Which would have different effects! Sanders join the fun just by playing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time and the right light dropped over him by the first killer (in good time!). > <br /> The story and acting is the same, the only one I have is near the end with the quick and lost discovery of who is the most stupid (Waldeman) - they were about to forget about its importance in the plot? That said, to enter into a series.
