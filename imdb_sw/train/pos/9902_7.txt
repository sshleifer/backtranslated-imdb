The assassination begins as any other day in Doddsville County High School where little Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) has accused Mr. Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) hosting a nerd into girls' locker rooms where she tells him to enter the swimming pool, while doing the Group Carol's friends come and give Marty now a great surprise if they are filing the film if they grab her head under the toilet of girls in the joke of April's stupid day. The school coach (Marc Smith) saves Marty and punishes the group that instead of sharply arguing with Marty, they decide to play with another trick on just the same time comes from & Marty is found in an explosion and has an acidic nitric acid on the face. Years later and the whole group has been invited to a class meeting now closed to school, they all come to discover that they are the only ones there. They all go into where they learn quickly not only where Marty is back and revenges in her mind ... <br /> <br /> It was shot down on April Fool's Day that they changed maybe because of other films The slasher called April Fool (1986) made the same year the United States of America is common in that it has three authors and directors, George Dugdale, Mark Ezra & Peter Litten (never seen three film titles Director I saw two for another week that Jean-Claude Van Damme Flick Kickboxer (1989) & I say I especially liked the Heavenly though it seems to have a bad reputation. One of the things I liked on the script is that it is pure non-embarrassing slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything & it's just accepting music rules, short coming & trappings & has playing on them. Basically provides what he promises, a homicidal killer, blood, boobs & infants. I thought that attitude was good, the story was the same though it is just forgiveness to get the burden of the young people in the only place so that another killer can drive one at a time & I really liked losing the end too which also something that High Slaughter gets lots of votes. The first half starts slowly but the second half goes to the tip of the tip if there is one of the gory killing after another. Some of the situations and feelings of behavior have little meaning but the same can be said about any film made so who complain? <br /> Despite the death of the Director of three attributes, I liked to watch a lot of films. A private school organized for the sky and looks good, the creators give us a very good thunderstorm and there is also a beautiful picture especially at the end where there is a lot of amazing stedicam tracking that follows Carol through various school rundown schools. While it is not particularly beautiful it looks very beautiful and is professionally made. There is a good money here including burnt bodies, people are melted by a mixture of acid, explosion, abdominal stomach, horn in faces and death and lawnmower as well as a runner on fecal run! Specific effects are also better than one could expect & I was interested in having a higher body weight than expected. In fact the film is much better than I expected & clap down below the low budget that is provided today, I would think it's a low budget itself though. It is known to put this America was definitely beaten in the UK. Harry Manfredini includes other symbols that look similar to all his music scores and are similar to the theme from Friday 13th (1980) and sequels. Anyone who lives here in the UK can recognize Billy Hartman who played Frank as usual at Emmerdale Farm (one of our top nations to measure the soap operation) which he plays Terry Woods! While most frightening fans will recognize sexy Caroline Munro in the role of a great rare. Dr Dick Randall's illusion producer did an act on the Top Slave and actually looked at the film as a porno film producer ... talk about the model! You can also see the poster for an incomprehensible understanding which was the pieces (1982) which also produced back in his office. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> Kill High is a slasher film that I liked so much, did you? ? I did not say it was best I said that I liked it on a personal level & I am sure a predictable plot and lack of stories may be too far away and I can't recommend it but I can say I liked it, do so what you want. Be sure to check out an unfamiliar version if you decide that you want to watch it. If not a fan of flick type of slasher then High Slaughter can't change your mind but if you are looking for a simple and effective slasher then you can do worse than this.
