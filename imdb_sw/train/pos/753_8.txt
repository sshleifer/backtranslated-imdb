Stories about four young girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) was the leader of the group - but wants to leave her home where she lives with her abandoned mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) suffers from drugs, alcohol and bad boys and has been beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has more parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than all others. This is not new from what we have seen many times before - but this has one big difference - it's right. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I saw the film first) and I wondered how it was true. They get conversations, clothes and attitudes at the bottom. Even the main song of the film ("In Radi" and Donna Summer) was a great hit before this happened. This film has hit me more hard than any boy video time because I could understand and deal with the characters. I knew girls in high school who were like this! The film is (of course) set but it takes time that we will never see. <br /> <br /> Acting is good for all errors and Foster will provide better performance. The relationship with Kellerman (who was better) was true and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a girlfriend) more or less played a little boy. The best movie - look important if you have come in 1980. The film has a suitable R (a lot of drugs and swearing) but it should be seen by all young people. I offer 8.
