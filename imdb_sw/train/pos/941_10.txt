I first saw this version of "Carol Christmas" when it appeared on the first television. In fact I expected to see the film when it was announced and it is more likely to live up to my expectations. Now I have bought a DVD and a watch program every year. With the exception of "It's a Wonderful Life" I've seen this "Carol Christmas" version of one of the best Christmas movies that have been done. George C. Scott is the best and beautiful forest led by Roger Rees around him! Scott reaffirms that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has an artistic talent and the ability to do any responsibility and put his character alone. How can one remember such as Patton and Scrooge? Scott does so easily. The trends are amazing and beautiful sets, clothes and music that give the movie a special sense of time, place and time shown. You will only love this film and will put it among your favorites to watch during holidays.
