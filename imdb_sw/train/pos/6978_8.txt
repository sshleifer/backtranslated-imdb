Well, let me say that I've tried to come. I do not try to destroy it and quite a few people have spoken with the experiment. On the other hand I do not really understand the opponents who claim to be the BSG fans and not as a pilot. What is their expectations? !! History places 50 years before BSG to help during the birth of Cylons, see the life of Adama family (which we have already known from BSG), find out more of the Caprican population and its view of other colonies, and the possibility of nature The belief of God of human and unique faith of God of Cylons. I don't expect the same identical effect or opera space as in the previous series, I make a difference between the two though I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is 1h30 of the start of promising, I also believe that this will put pressure on events to be as good as BSG. I expect more from the following but I have no reason to worry that we will read more. Looking at the deleted DVD area also provides more material for your brain chewing. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
