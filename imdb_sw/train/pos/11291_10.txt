Can anyone buy this film? My uncle "Hutch" was a Real Operator (not Reel) who appears to hit his wings in the air and then caught them with his fist as he was sold to his pilot wings. She is in seconds a few seconds but my family would like to have a film. He was killed in dogfight on Italy, he had only 24 at that time. Do we know the film studio that made it? <br /> Or has anyone seen you in the video store, like Blockbuster? I would like to make a list of all these old movies available if it is very cheap to make DVDs of these days. Please send me an email at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
