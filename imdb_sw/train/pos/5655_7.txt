I watched this show on the basis that I was told it was to remember the Twin Peaks of David Lynch - a show which I adore. The quick show start to bring us the main characters and instead of the usual experimental part is to me the best of the vote, its very amazing and actually comes from all the evil side of the show already developed at all times of the season. My one big case I feel a little allowed to show - maybe not by his own fault, if it was fired after only 1 season, it seemed to have a great ability to show and deserves better treatment than it was. Acting is the best, and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) in it I've ever seen that it is well developed in a short time. There is an abnormal impact of cheesy for 5 or ten exhibitions which are very large, but this is done as the season continued. Such value watch, definitely something out of ordinary!
