I'm not a big fan of Martial movies, but the video was empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when other films I would like to rent, or the way I rented. I loved him very much, my partner and myself (22-year-old Biochemistry and Accounting students) spent half an hour after film making amazing sounds of Kung Fu and giving us sharikens for each other. I can't explain (well perhaps a little tequila). I have never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a scooping club playing a big bloke, beating, hitting a big barrier etc. etc. The film is approaching. Imagine Jackie Chan and a little comedy with more action.
