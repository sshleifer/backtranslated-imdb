When I saw this film for the first time in the 1980s, I was in the middle of the early years and had been reluctant to see this since I considered myself whole and out of "Sesame Street / Muppets". I honestly remember if I liked that time or not. However, somewhere at the university I watched this film again, and it came out to go (and stay) in My All My Movies collection. This video is LOADED and humor that goes far beyond and beyond what would be expected from Muppets. I mean, obviously Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because there is a sense of humor based on both generations. But get to ... Janice has heard him telling someone "I don't take my clothes for anyone, even if they are modern" ... there is a dragon from a father to a child that if a child likes and Kermit Frog then the father doesn't want to hear ... Gonzo saves chickens and the resurrection of mouth-to-mouth (sp?) and later says "I think we're ready now" ... these and a lot of others While in the film was I rolling. Add to a very pleasant discussion, smart New York / Broadway "wink wink" humor, a large size of the celebrity attractions and some fun songs that don't think "finger cheesy" anything ... this film is a masterpiece! I will not give "10" on a regular basis ... but this is appropriate. More than 20 years later, this film completely holds, perhaps even more. Muppets had never again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. --- Q
