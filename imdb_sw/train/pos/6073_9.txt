My college professor says that Othello can be the most beautiful drama of Shakespeare. I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video video video. First I would like Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was very hard and worked well in this situation. Of course, he did not lead but made a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that US actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. not that there is a UK issue against America about it. In fact, if we all work together Shakespeare can reach a citizen that deserves to do. In addition to other Shakespeare disasters, this is considered by the race issue. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia would have been better and has shown the solidarity of their union together. When Othello likes Desdemona with all his heart, she is weakened by envy and fear of losing her to a non-Moorishi like Cassio. It is a very large area at the end of the film but I will not reveal the end. It's just worth looking. I think they edited multiple lines up to 2 hours but always Shakespeare editors.
