I don't know how I missed this when it first came out, but I'm happy to see it finally. This game is being done and around the 19th century of the Okabasho, Japan. It describes the story of adultery, abortions and women who are powerful in the society derived from the principle of Japanese samurai. <br /> <br /> It's unique Akira Kurosawa! Even though he died before leading this movie, its effectiveness of screen shows. His view of the Japanese system and caste is known and shows how these systems are linked. The characters may move around, but the caste system remains when every character returns to the world they enter. The Samurai striker who enters the beautiful heart of prostitutes returns to his life, when he starts another road with someone who is part of his lower system .... down below. Most of the world of Samurai's world over all others, but still, are the lowest locals who can support and who can love without hindrance. Samurai in this movie turns weak, when non-class lovers show that they are seniors. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves maximum. It is the story of women's life in Japan's feudal. During this time, men were thought to be victims of violence. This movie shows the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they were supposed to live, and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue as it is. I recommend "Sea is Looking" for anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they have no fan. It is a beautiful, quiet and up-to-date film, and one of the treasures of any film collection.
