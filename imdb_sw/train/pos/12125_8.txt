I saw this film again and I saw how close to the novel if we ignore a section about Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood. Considering that the amount of time you can be displayed in a timely manner can be shown on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] damage to character and Mildred [Bette Davis] is widely presented to viewers. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever fallen to another person and tried to use it. I have read that Maugham was asked to make a novel record, but when he started in the studio began to cry and could not finish over a few lines and the whole project was hit. One can say novel is written from the heart and the film is good <br /> <br /> to deal with its part.
