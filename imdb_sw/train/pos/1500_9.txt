Now the day, many people don't watch the usual movies, like this. Most of the friends view the film only from '90 years of presentation. That's kinda hard. Most old documents like this are the most important, in their own way. It is because, back when these movies were thought and done, that's when the thoughts were pure. Now people only cause new thinking. <br /> <br /> However, for the movie. For true fans of classic fear. This is for you. The movie is based on a screening from Scotland Yard exploring the disappearance of the film actor, and sits on other other incredible events with former residents of one house. I will say no more, for I will destroy the movie more than I have. But it's a very bad movie as it was in the past. And never would look look again!
