It includes difficult to live up to the original. This proves true in this case. However, if you're a big fan of nature than definitely give this watch. Although the camera function is missing, Brian Krause's behavior is sad, and the plot is clique, it's more funnier than the first and that's what I get about it. Do not see this movie expects similar performance in the first film. In fact it is quite different. Instead of sitting on his cabin screens, Stanley is far from Hollywood trying to direct his dream project, Cabin and Lake. This film feels very different but it's still nice to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give 6 out of 10.
