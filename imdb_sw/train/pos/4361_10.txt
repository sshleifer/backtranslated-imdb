This was one of the best films of 40 - Warner Bros. for the very length of their style. Photography by Sol Polito is a doubt of his success - good tracks and lights with shadow shade. Max Steiner contributes to one of the most difficult and beautiful symbols - a model of her interesting ethnic group. Music adds a great feeling and excitement to the plot and is good and does not remember. It is interesting to note that the production team that has made this film continue to do "Now, Voyager" later that year - a good film that won the prestige and awards and descended as a historic favorite, ciefly because it had a star Bette Davis. In my opinion, "Muslims of Gay" is the most beautiful film - the best in all departments, and more interesting, hard and pleasant. An unusual film that keeps those who do it, rather than their own creative design or their own high-quality and required completeness. Everything should be judged in its own time of memory and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Many of the complaints I have read in these instructions are infants and are not quite sure. If you are hungry for the full file filet, do not go to the bakery and start buying and complaining about the vegetable. The film's criticism of the film is actually lost to a large part of the population. Sorry people - maybe if this film was marked with Rolling Stones and the search for small and soul, you would like to be perfect. I will take an old movie without pretending to modernize the day of the week!
