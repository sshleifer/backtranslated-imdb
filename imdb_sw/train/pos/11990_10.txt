In 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was indeed great. Shows as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears was already popular, and now Disney made another great cartoon and cartoon that bring birth to Disney Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It is about the old character of the Jungle Book Baloo Bear if it gets a job in the airline business. In the series he meets the Kit Cloudkicker, the former Pirate of Air and the design of a beautiful cloud, the business woman Rebecca Cunningham and her unborn Molly daughter. This series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you can't understand as a child but understand later in life. This is one series of wisdom writing and it is better to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your children instead of allowing them to watch all the awesome Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, then check "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Delete!
