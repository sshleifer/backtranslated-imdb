I thought this was a good way to spend time at the end at the end of the weekend, sitting in the air hall and looking at a bright heart camera. This plan is simple, but the discussion is stupid and the characters are proposed (even the good bread being judged as a fatal killer). While others may be disappointed when they know this is not the 2nd Match: Dangerous Medicine, I thought it was evidence that Woody Allen still has control of the style that most of us have grown to love. This is the one I was most proud of in one of the Woody comedies in years (dare to speak ten years?). When I have never been surprised by Scarlet Johanson, in this she was able to leave her pictures of "sexy" and jumped on average, but a young woman strong. This may not be the title of his work, but it was stronger than the "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy to see with friends.
