"Footlight Parade" is just one of the most amazing jaunty songs that Warner Bros was created in the early 1930s to prevent Depression. "The 42" address and the Golddiggers series were also produced at this time, and they did the real, millions of Americans forget their problems for a short time, and fun. When most of the films produced were Joan Blondell's talent, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell, the only Foolight Parade was James Cagney who could not be identical. Almost ten years before his special music, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he plays in the original dance styles, usually his hands dropped on his side, and his legs make all sorts of damage and kidnapping. It is easy to see that she enjoys herself, and that makes us happier. Though almost all the music guide will appear at the end of the film, they should wait. I believe that this film was released just before the installation of production code, so some of the costumes and events are a little dangerous. But it's all fun. It doesn't matter what the plot is, just know that there is a lot of laugh and cast superlative. Apart from those already listed, Guy Kibbee is better here. About 7 out of 10
