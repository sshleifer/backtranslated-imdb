This story derived from two pieces of Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of Usher House", "Dance of Death" (poem) is actually creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people who meet in an old house that is in decline (for example, "Cat and Canary", "Old House of the Night", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karloff has a dement inventor of a lifetime doll that frightens visitors. He dies early in the film (or he?) And residents of the house suffer from a terrible experience. I will not go into so many details here, but it is definitely a must-look for the old dark hidden fans. <br /> <br /> Looking for a lot of popcorn and soda in the dark room. <Br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
