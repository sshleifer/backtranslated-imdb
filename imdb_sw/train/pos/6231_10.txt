This is a great, fun, interesting film. It takes the essence of the truth of ten years of people, and describes the beautiful story of the love of the two sisters and the two seas. Although this film can only be black and white, it certainly does not count against it now in modern days. The main purpose of the movie is not available. This film has a good job, a good song and dance numbers, and good work design and film shots. Follow Fleet is also interesting, there is a wonderful time, when it will make you laugh, but sometimes where acting is just getting involved in stories. It is amazing how although this film can be put in a decade, how it can affect those today. If you want to see something big, see this.
