Letters that are not available in the other world were found in the post office post. Here, Alice can manage the job in the hope of finding her lost father. What he does to discover is the soul of his boss, Frank. Audee's little Auxe who came and went to the movies. Now you find it in a deep dark corner of the video store, covered by fifty copies of the GODZILLA film. It is embarrassing for this to be a satisfying film describing the story of the brave and powerful images and beautiful performances from two ways. This film succeeds where the office of the dead letter of Garry Marshall defines DEAR DEVELOPMENT (1996 - USA) failed, and comes closer to the beauty of, not of Kevin Costner Turkey, but POSTMAN's Jianjun (1995 - China).
