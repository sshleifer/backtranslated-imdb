I loved this movie. I knew that it would be closed full of camp and silliness as the original series. I saw it warming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all together again. Anyone who liked the Batman series from 60 years should be happy to return to Batcave. You can tell the actors who enjoyed doing this film, especially Adam West. And I will come that he would enjoy returning to his Batman dress and had the script required to do so. I told several friends about this movie who chose not to see it ... now they liked to have. I have all previous VHS events. Now this film will join my collection. Thank you for Adam's reconciliation and Burt.
