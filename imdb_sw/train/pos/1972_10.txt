I don't understand your restrictions on this film. It is an exciting extension of the character designed "Primary Institution". The only part of the story that is quite a bit, is the fact that Sharon Stone's behavior is still alive and not in jail at this late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER EXPERIENCE: As the movie continues, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) The character of Sharon Stone kills all these people because she is mad (Class addicted); 2) David Thewlis' offender destroys these people to create a character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey analyst kills these people for revenge. What motivates many people about the movie seems to be none of these theories described as "real" stories. (Although the analyst is in a mental service center to kill soldiers, just killing that happens on the screen.) I think this is a brilliant device plot in the spirit of "2001, Space Odyssey." Blonde really is mad, the police actually missed and the analyst really needs to take revenge. What is important is the cooperation between these and other characters in the story. As a real life, everyone is more difficult than anyone thinks and the truth is more difficult than the movie. Get more!
