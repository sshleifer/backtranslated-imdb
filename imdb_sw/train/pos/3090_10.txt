I am very angry that ABC offers on another show that has a chance to become a real winner. This show is good, writing and story is great, the original idea of ​​the show rather than the other real boring display. Compose was amazing! Not only the characters and actors who lived, but these are very talented sets of actors. The concept and idea is a new and cool idea for the TV show, many of us share this whole idea of ​​"relationship". I love Steven characters, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But be honest no one is connected to this show that I did not like, even those who were just for a few events (Appleby Sheri for example). Acting with characters is very simple and so talented !! I would like ABC has provided this show more of space, and it does not take midway show, Also not advertised enough. Really right! for everyone !! This period showed a great promise. I will only allow ABC to know how I feel and will continue to send email to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do that. It worked for Jerico. (Through section 13? I want to show the last!). Please help this show and send an email to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is very good !!!
