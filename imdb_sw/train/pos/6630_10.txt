This is an important film. It is a challenge for the viewer and encourages you to consider. There's a lot of love here. The director seems to be willing to remove some of the movies of the most fatigue. Unlike many recent American movies, this film takes interest in the idea of ​​making a film in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two views that describe the film for the audience yet being transferred after the first look. When the film was hit in Sundance, it made more than a few attention to anger and anger. This is a Sunday morning movie, not a movie on Friday night. For a dedicated viewer, it is a treasure trove.
