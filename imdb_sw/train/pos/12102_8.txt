This begins to hit between Edgar Allen Poe and journalist ... Poe has said that one cannot spend the whole night in the creepy castle. Indeed, of course he can, but will come out no matter what? It is difficult to speak to all these wonderful people who were not supposed to be there walking around, including ice Barbara Steele. This is a very rare film because the presentation is French and English, and it changes regularly and returns. Perhaps this has been done because the bits of the dialog were lost? Also instead of darkness and claustrophobic, since a person does not see much more than a small circle of light which candles and also produce, as well as a sense of fear and the closest punishment at all. This version (in Synapse) is also hidden and I wondered what could be explored on the film since 1964 until I saw the top area, I think it might be so. In general this is good and in black and white black. Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.
