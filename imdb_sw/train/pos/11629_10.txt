The red eye is an exciting film with the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven shows the story of a typical Lisa's hotel worker. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take a red eye. When waiting, he meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) And they kind of become friends. Amazingly, they both sit next to each other on this plane. Then this is the time to start with fear. This film is interesting and powerful people who do not like exciting / frightening films, well say that it is possible for them to overcome their pants. This is a good example of bone production. Wes Craven did well with this film. He chose the actors of justice, like Rachel McAdams, a intelligent girl, a girl who knows what she is doing and has the attention of everything when she works in the film. Cillian Murphy, an awesome and frightening actor who can beat your bones with his amazing acting to be a bad habit in this film, and his face can extend your eyes. Wes Craven did a good job and I hope that he does more films like this.
