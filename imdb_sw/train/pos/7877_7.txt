Word of Write It / What is what you see. Not true! What is the brave and brilliant King Bhandarkar who destroys the story of the bonds with the glitterati magazine that the color of our pages and our lives (read party ceremonies) we follow and the kind of spotlight that only the nature of our voyeuristic nature can describe. Page 3 / Page 3 / Page 3 is an amazing thing as it is known. How did it get the same control over the word that was published and when you started to get into the front page is the subject of another discussion. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids it. He only cares for the existence of this evil. And to do this, he sliced ​​together the different elements of this way of life. As Robert Altman (though I'm not comparing with Bhandarkar for Altman specialist), Bhandarkar uses multiple characters to carry out his intentions. If page 3 wannabe NRI, crashers of gate, new-rich, upcoming example, social politician or novella authoress; all actors are brought to the goal and each has a different characteristic, even if its parts can be miniscule. And there the appeal of the film. Konkona Sen Sharma plays with Madhavi Sharma, a small and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially the content and its work, soon begins to see the evil of this less down which is covered with its artificial and decorative beauty. But Bhandarkar refuses to try to do this in the film's moral code and avoid focusing on only one character. So the film is not just about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi editor who admits his chances as a big machine pig, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a society emerging and social pollution, Abhijeet (Engineer Rehan - a homosexual artist and builder of Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - a Sassy flight attendant and a Gayatri executive (Tara Sharma). It seems like an impossible job to make many characters (and more) in a single story, but a full loan with Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a tight screenplay. Talk to the Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar are very carefully written in detail. Any story, no matter how good, may fall flat with a lack of real performances. Thanks, '3rd Assembly' and administrators are not stars. Konkona flows through its author's role and improper convenience. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best part, but almost removes it. Atul Kulkarni has been lost even with a written character. Sometimes, the director is also interested in imposing possible (religious love, homosexuality, etc.). But the environment that is used should not look looking fast. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Bhandarkar attempt is to reject our voyeurism, but it takes more action. He takes us into the picture and shows us the reality of this humanity group that seems to be alive in a different world and far away. These are the same people who volunteered for the new year's surprise at one hundred kilometers away from their colleagues have been destroyed by natural anger! Sensible writing, integrating with skill, the effectiveness and the real sense of honesty is what makes this film worthy of despite its lack of ethics and poor production. 'Page 3' is a good way to enter the new movie year. <br /> - The Best Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating - **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ***** Best <br /> 29 January, 2005
