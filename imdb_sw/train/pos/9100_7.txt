Spanish films enter, if not the Golden, obviously Silver Age. Pi√©dras is another example of the film that takes people with their own tension. Although emotions are strong or near life or death, they are still not spiritual. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here, which are connected. One is about a lost girl, who does not know to pass the road to the next block. One is about a middle-aged woman who gets a partner of her life in fetischist's feet. Another is about a girl with drug addiction whose girlfriend leaves her. Still another is about the madame of a girl who (almost) gets true love. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth seeing. It is in Spain immigrants take women seriously.
