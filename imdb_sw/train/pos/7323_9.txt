Cruel, impatient Michael Myers said his sister died during six years on Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he avoided the institution of intelligence and established a new fear of terror in his haddonfield, Illinois. He is always followed by a psychologist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how this young man is bad. It opens with a bang, and sets the latest exciting and atmospheric atmosphere that basically comes with many slasher images that helped to mobilize. It is a trick compared to the worst of the blood of the following movies were; trick, and scary. It continues with the ability to make me fly even after seeing it regularly. How many movies, in fact, can continue to fear even after seeing them before? Not many. Pleasence is good in what is perhaps a clear task of its work; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first motion picture, began to become a proud reporter after making "Halloween" and small photographs of the future, and she is the victim who was supposed to have roots. -gent / director John Carpenter knows what works in this film, making good use of shadows and dark clouds; see how many films are posted after night. With this picture, he and his former participant Debra Hill created a franchise that has given seven sequels, many actors, and "next to think" next. It's very quotable - who could forget Dr.. Loomis' (Pleasence) where he tells Michael Myers to sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertory player in several ancient Carpenter works) <br /> <br /> It's amazing, and it is worth searching. This is my favorite movie of John Carpenter of all time. It is not quite possible - there are script holes, after all - but generally makes a strong effect. <br /> <br /> 9/10
