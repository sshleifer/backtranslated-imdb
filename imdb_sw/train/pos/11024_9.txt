This movie is very good. It is an entertainment from beginning to end, you will always be on the edge of your seat in the entire movie. In my opinion this film has been hit by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly suits perfectly in the role of a well-trained boy rescue Gabe Walker. With him Michael Rooker looks like Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best shows I have seen is a good person. And the fact that 75% film takes place on the mountain and many non-villagers make it a way for many steps! <br /> <br /> brilliant movies!
