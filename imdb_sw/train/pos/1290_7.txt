Well, I remember this! Many years since I actually looked at it. The story was quite surreal, but even so great! What anyone weighing and watching movies should consider what the film is about. It's similar to "Kid First", next to the same example. Some movies - like this here - just a clear and comical nonsense focus. Such movies cannot be measured from the view of the hypercritical inspector. Of course these movies are not good, they are not modern stories, often they don't have the first job, but if they keep their basic foundation - that's right. I don't have this movie here on my favorite list all the time, but I still thought it was interesting, it had a very good series and it made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a good actor however.
