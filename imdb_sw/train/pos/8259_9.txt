I think the last curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is your release table when you get a chance. In fact, I'm just happy to Fido took the US distribution. In any case ... <br /> <br /> What! Have you ever seen Shaun of the Dead? Good. How about Lassie? Can connect these two? Well, if your name could be Andrew Currie, Canada with the help of the first zombie family, comedy or zoedy. (To a large extent, it is a media book in Toronto.) Although it is not as violent, dry, or UK as Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains true to its roots: dedicated to the old black and white 50s television as with Lassie and the sci-fi shadow that was being played at the time. Fido (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) stand as a revelation of the beauty of the script. The film explores all the results of its foundation: a world where zombies have been transformed into servants because of the vast majority of them due to an extraordinary accident. Why are you using your new servant for undead? Farmer? Manual Works? Black? Impossible actions? Fido faces all these possibilities in a beautiful and amazing way, with many thanks to the work of Connelly (as one of the zombies) and a TV player K'Sun Ray, who appears sometimes to be a better boy than Elijah Wood Elijah Wood was. If you are expecting another Shaun of the Dead, do not waste your time. There is not nearly enough of the year and interesting in the genre to satisfy you and you'll just have a bitter and sad venue. But if you are interested in looking at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps in the lake, you're in cures. Consider Fido as a younger brother, who was often beaten Shaun's rebel rebels, and begins to get a drift. If you like zombies (or at least tolerate), young children, and satire of deadpan, Fido's film. If not something .... well, you know how to dig. Just hit the square of the m between the eyes.
