I was very surprised to see that How to Lose Friends and Living People It had no place near the comedy 'out-out' if the trailer caused me to expect. I felt quick in the revelation of the details and kept holding. Pacing of the interesting content was seen, I thought, is a spot. (I mean I have been feeling the stages of Pegg's efforts in restoring the very lost control 'in real time', saying.) Sometimes there was a time to be allowed to share the main characters' (ie Pegg and Dunst) on how events affected them and what led them where they now found themselves. The characters were all well healed, somehow attracted to themselves, and generally loved. (Any non-violent evidence would be suggested by a good natural tolerance.) An entertaining, intelligent, more efficient and effective text that I would suggest.
