That could be the only film that comes next to capture on a world film that is totally unknown to the University's 60-year experience of the last-70 years. Continue, mention another film that even approaches this: "Putting Right"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Seventh Day" has its time, but that is a refreshing film on individuals (more than a cover) than a film about time and place * displayed on time and place. "The park, he said" shows - for the trick and nuance where it should, and the fastest speed in the shorts which is the only way - anti-drafting movements, the complexity of high-school sports (especially when there is a war up), the sexual revolution. The period, and the unusual circumstances of the day. I don't believe, it was like that. All traps should be praised (such as director, of course) but specific features should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, a very common hero - except at that time - love interest. William Tepper, as a guide, also drives a real round of applause for his perfect capture of the same period and by actually playing basketball basketball in the film (note Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes!) For all, classic of kind - with the last film person now in grade 6 should write a comment on ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, sonny, please return to your Arnold films). Why is this film not available from imdb?
