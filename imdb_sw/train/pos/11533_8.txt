This film, which begins with an impressive opening of two hot blondes to find them behind the driver-down, moving the car, has quite a little quirky boot personality. The release of seven people (though one girl has not gone for the generation, which is unfortunate because death has been very few as it is) is very hot, as our story around the youth leave the desert (an extraordinary but effective choice) , who are driven by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who gives a black truck. It has accompanied many of the slashers that have been driving so far ("Safari", "Happy Enjoy", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's car itself becomes a bad competitor. The killer himself is very creepy, and we find comfort in the most beautiful heroine in Jennifer McAllister (see the spectacular difference of the worst killer in black, while our dressing heroine all of white clothes, as small and stone as it can be). Director Bill Crain makes things with the truth and his camera, some of the best techniques on the screens, and the cast is quite trying. There is enough year in the lower body to enjoy the fans of the year, and enough T&A from several girls to enjoy T&A fans. In general, this flick is widely featured and much sought in the slasher film world as shown that is not very available on video. It is highly recommended.
