After seeing the horrible BATMAN, awesome, terrible: I KNOW I needed to see this once I heard about it. Exciting to play to see the trailer I thought I was a short time secret from what is now seen as another bad wannabe filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to the existing character. But instead he was greeted with GREAR to keep the trailer for a movie that does not exist, if I would like to see the finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes. FINAL WORLD makes up for BATMAN: DEAD END and then others. <br /> <br /> I expect the next short!
