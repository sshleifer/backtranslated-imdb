First, I didn't have "Blob" since I was 7 or 8 years old and see if an adult is a wonderful experience. Pages can be written for its influence on awesome films even today. And even more can be written on his social subtext and 50 "youth fears". But this small story of panic interplanetary is still a good movie if you allow it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems to be as good as they all come out of our modern world. But "Blob" comes at a time of horror as a fake children's tracking of impaired creatures when adults do not believe. In fact, there are some short moments in his world of candy colors. And Steve McQueen gives a lot more than a suitable story on a paper that we viewers are available at this time and trust him. To conclude, if you can remove your latest modern filter, there is much more to love here than to meet the eye.
