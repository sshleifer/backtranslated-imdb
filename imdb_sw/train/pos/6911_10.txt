When the "woman's kiss of the spider" struck Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unknown Latin Latin country, this time she works for a dictator in the South American country. In particular, the sudden dictator jumps drops, so Julia's position of president and Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) shot movie in the country. From there, Dreyfuss needs to know how to be a dictator, all the time connecting to his life. <br /> <br /> Is it right to turn a bad situation in South America to be a comedy? Well, "The Moon Over Parador" does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this film, it removes it. It just shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the many executives of our era, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Certainly worth seeing. Also star Sonia Braga (who played with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> I agree: The first woman is hot.
