Halloween is one of those movies that give you a deep crack! It is in my opinion, the worst movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best! He was just scared! What makes music so special is that there are no special effects where you can describe how the computer is living, this was on a low budget and it had one mark, but it has been able to scare Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it was '78. It's about the boy Michael Myers, killing his sister at the age of 6 and many years later fleeing the mental institution. Dr Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to bring him back, for he tells Michael as "... evil. The black eyes, the eyes of the devil". Michael is in the mission though, killing another sister, Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis new. She should have Halloween children, when her friends come out and of course, we know the law, they get it! But Laurie can stand position since she is a virgin. ; D offers many honors to Psycho, we have another character called Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is a very strict movie that breaks the borders and makes you shut doors, close your windows, and live lighting! "They find you! They will find you!". Halloween, the last film of fear! <br /> <br /> 10/10
