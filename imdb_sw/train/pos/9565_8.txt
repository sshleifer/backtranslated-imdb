Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full beaten, blowing and shooting (but don't worry ... shooting is a terrible shot), it can be described as a violent violence through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, the Cambodian killer in the city to kill the barrister. Despite being contaminated from his journey, he almost immediately sat on a big table in the center of the expensive restaurant. If this appears not available to you, you should avoid this film. It did my job as waiting to fail to believe, and I was happier for it. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang below is Wai (Sam Lee), a young boy, who likes to beat people around as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks a good line in which you have an interior explore, and his father, Good Cop of the story, is in the subsequent unconscious drug program that went to the south (meaning Wai allows his father to take rap for his worst activities) . There is a car attack, a lot of killings, and a strange and mysterious story that is presented here, all played in the comic style of the comic. I think the humor was deliberate (nobody uses the actual bergantuan bludgeans without an extraordinary spectacle), although the above high level lost the number of my listeners. There are at least three points where the film may be discontinued, and for 109 hours it may benefit from the worst editing, or discarding one of the fibers of the story (hard-hearted things worked well, so I would like to leave the interaction with three fathers). <br /> <br /> I am interested in coding (high) pass, however, if only for the last reason? I have never heard so many people laugh loudly for what is right at the time. This is one to see and a group of friends who love ignorance
