Bromwell High is a comedy of cartoon. It ran at the same time as other school life programs, such as "Teachers". 35 years in the teaching profession leads me to believe that the satire of Bromwell High is very close to the truth than "Teachers". The financial life scandal, wise students who can see justice in a pleasant manner for their sad teachers, a small state of the whole situation, all remind them of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the place where the student tried to burn the school from time to time, I remembered immediately ......... at .......... Top. Classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to carry one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age think that Bromwell High has been searched. It is a pity that it is not!
