This movie is just good! Despite Carmen Electra, this should be one of the best movies I have seen for a short time. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Loren Dean has a starred movie star. The program is also good. It's all very realistic that scary. It says here that it is a drama, but this is one of the funniest dramas I've seen. Go look.
