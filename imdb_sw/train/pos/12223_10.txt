I saw the True Crime when it was first released in the mid-ninth century and I have looked at it many times since. It is a great secret about Maria (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school secondary school in California whose little sister's sister was being tortured and killed by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played with Kevin Dillon), a police officer who sees how he is rough and decides to work together to try to kill him. <br /> <br /> Many defendants in this. True crime feels very "true" or is true to me. I read a review of the news group where someone wrote that the suspension of unbelief is now here and it is true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role by Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn does a good job, as well as other actors. These sites are suitable for the author / director, Pat Verducci, takes some of the realities of the young and lonely life of Mary (see where Mary rises from a series of dreams after looking at the pictures she used Tony). I would like Verducci would make more movies. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any films like True Crime. 10/10
