I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film. This is Laural and Hardy. Open already. These two were violence. Their comic thought is as amazing today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word from any mouth and were able to put viewers in stitches. Their comedy was not modern and any stretch. If the cap of the hat can not collect, there is no reason to look at any of these things that these boys did. It was a simple time, and people laughed at things that were funny without conspiracy. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy these things, so I graduate. Two teams of comedy are not available, We have only modern ... Isn't it lucky?
