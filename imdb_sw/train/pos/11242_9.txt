Anyone who is attracted to pop music, and does not know the trend of British music for seventy years, must be sure to watch Glass Breaking at least once. The movie, about the efforts of a young woman to make her mark in the world of music, drives regularly, due to romantic sex, bad economic times, social status, shifting to pop culture from bad-to-tumble punk to The very fey and futurism of self / Love Love New. Music styles and styles designed every day in the UK in the last seventy years are still available and restored (in fact it has never been new since 1980). It was an amazing time, and the Broken Glass all tells a very personal story and a cultural observation, and it does it very well.
