When I was watching this film for the first time, it was a copy made by the head / was Caged Terror. I still have a tape, and I confess, I've watched it more than once from the beginning to the end! The movie is a very small budget and the conversation is often delicious! I've found my few friends to watch this and we've had a great laughter from the awesome script. The film involves a couple, (this note is like about 70 years so they are just a hip man!) Who goes to the last week's camping trip in what I think should be on NY. They have a good discussion after being infected and eating fish and the girl cries for the death of the fish and that they ate! The boy comes back to something else about how they ate the fish and was now part of them, and he goes; "And that's a good man!" Someone heavy, very heavy! LOL! However, with two young Vietnam men, one of them playing the flute, I believe. (At any rate they are friends of music!) Boys are very impressed by a girl and when the couple show that they are not worried, they end up afraid at night. The boy has already been put into a chicken hat, and he must look at his girlfriend being beaten by two young men. True, at the end of the night, he looks good in it, and when the morning comes, the boys leave with the girl and the boy is free to leave. In fact the husband has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) However, I would like to recommend this film very much for anyone looking for a good laugh! We can never absorb me however! If I could get this on a DVD and take a copy of my old copy, I'd like to buy it again, it's a classic camp! You have gotta love these things!
