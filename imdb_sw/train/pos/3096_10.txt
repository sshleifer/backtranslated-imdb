Six degrees had appeared. I looked forward to coming and quite desperate when Men in Trees changed the space of time. I thought it was just on hiatus and it would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were completely surprised. We can be like the characters who had real problems. We talked about each section and we had our favorite characters. There was no one on the show that I didn't like and I saw that acting was very good. I have often seen plans in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to object to cancel the cancellation of this show and ask you to come back and give it another opportunity. To give a good slot, do not go from today to that day and advertise so people will know it has continued.
