It Can Think More Best Better than This <br /> <br /> Hey, before all go to "Chick Flick" on me. I am Powerful and Masculine, Macho Man, who happens to think this was one of the best movies over the last 20 years. The role was Good and the story was amazing. This is a good medicine for the heart and soul. The work could not be better or not better than the film. I know in good time that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench are among the many managers who have seen on the film. And in fact Cloris Leachman (also in this film) to my perspective could really exaggerate all in the magnificent shear of his talent and various tasks he looks at over the years. At any rate this was surprisingly surprising. This film was like a book that you can't put, and when you have reached the last page you want for more ... still more. I can't understand why my film here on IMDb standards is 3.9 <br /> <br /> That rating here is quite amazing to me. Or maybe not. Maybe I really understand very well and that's what makes me really sad. It makes me very sad that the film like "American Beauty" "Leaving Las Vegas" "The Limit of Animal" and "Fighting Club" standards that block the chart on popularity when they actually in view viewers should receive "R" rating "R which it's for "Mabuzi". Well, I think there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it is a sad definition of this beautiful, powerful ... unique, directed, organized, and written film seems to be high. It is clear that he was at the Academy's awards too .... How sad. And how predictable. My chapter is that if you want to see the power, Happy, Sad, good story? ... if possible to own this film ...
