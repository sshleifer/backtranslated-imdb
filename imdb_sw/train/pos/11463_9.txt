I saw this film at the International Film Festival of Rhode Island and it was completely beaten. The design and implementation of the film was extraordinary ... I know it's not, but it is absolutely worthy of Oscar's. Cal and Andre were emergency as two distressed students. Yes, the film is very controversial and I can see many people have a lot of problems with it, as it deals with school bullets and especially lets you identify with killers. However, despite the most difficult and improper thing, Day Zero is worth viewing. I look forward to coming out of the video so I can buy - it's very good, it's very good. Very strong and intense ... The final sequence of the bullet leaves you without a lecture because it is too close. Uncertainty, "record", pictures and fears of students, quite unknown. I believe it gets that attention. It is made in the same format as the Blair Publisher Project, a hand camera, made to look like a video video video - but god is much better. Very interesting, hat for everyone involved. If you have a chance you should see it.
