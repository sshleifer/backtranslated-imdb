In standing with me, Vern and Teddy are talking about who is tough, Superman or Mouse Mighty. Friends and I often talk about who will win the battle too. Sometimes we get ignorant and compare people like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we're talking about boys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a trivial comparison to see that Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go to what we have seen from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you need to say at least that it will fit well against Chan. In this film he comes as a military art of God. Black Mask is about a man created with many others, being a great fighting machine. Their only goal is to win the battle that some people lose. They are unacceptable in other ways. That is the basis of the film, but what makes it is to put all the amazing settings to fight. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is amazing. He can do things with his body that no man can do. And that's what makes him look at him. <br /> <br /> In addition to military art in the film, Black Mask is powerful and humorous and that is because of the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, police officer. They are great together. But be honest. if someone who reads these reviews, they want to know if the film is kick kick in the action department. And the answer to that is YES! Vote with a lot of meaningless and trivial action. You will like this film.
