Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly a funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. When I saw for the first time about 2 years ago I was in sewing for a week after that. So far I have seen it again 17 and I still laugh at my ass all the time. For those who do not know Eddie Murphy was good to stand the player before becoming a Hollywood star. There is not one lighter in this piece of genius and Eddie Murphy Raw released in 1987 which goes to the flat in the middle. If it is not the type of person who cannot stand up and I can't advise you to see if you hear a hearing for some 5-10 seconds. I gave this 10 out of 10 because it shows the great skills of all their comic for better.
