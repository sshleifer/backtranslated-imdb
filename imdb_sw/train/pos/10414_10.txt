I first discovered Alexander Korda (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD early 1950s on re-issue billed as "The Wonderful Show of the Century!" All movies of Korda Technicolor, THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown in one app that should not be forgotten. Miklos Rozsa's music strengthened both films. The Technicolor in each was very good! THE BAGDAD EXAMPLE remains on my list as the best fantasy made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the color of the film as it was previously released. The True Technicolor provided the way of the Eastman color process in the mid 1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn resumed the film on video and video. But Eastman's buttons were still natural and had a vibrancy of the original Technicolor. Removal of Laser Disc of this title also there is a pastel look - good, but not as it should be. NOW comes the image of M-G-M (3 December 2002). THIEF OF BAGDAD again has a wonderful Technicolor looking on a DVD that is not short of STUNNING !!! It was very exciting to see if this again that after seeing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. Only "Extras" is a Spanish version of the beat, Sub-Titles in English and Spanish, with the original trailer of the original exhibition. Thank you M-G-M for this release DVD release. Now, one can only hope that the FOUR FEATHERS of Korda and the restored version of JUNGLE BOOK of Korda (take place for the poor public clauses in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.
