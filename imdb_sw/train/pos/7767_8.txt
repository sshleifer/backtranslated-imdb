The park should have an Academy Award for this performance, period. His crime that he did not. Surprisingly how he does humanize an unnecessary useless character. Dorothy Malone received the best of the Academy for her performance. In fact, all acting in this film is the best. <br /> <br /> The program begins with a taxi trip, then a flight trip, then it keeps moving on an emotional journey that will help all your interest. You will have fun! However, this is just an opera opera. One-dimensional, 100 percent detergent. You can call it the last soap, because it works completely over devices. It worked well, well-directed, but stable in its kind soap. I can't even call it melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although not denying the great value of the entertainment of this film, you can only imagine how this artist and director can be successful for more chapters.
