I did not laugh this hard for movies for too long. The tools that Hollywood has recently spurred give me a wall! This was obvious and clean. If you are looking at population statistics for testing, only a few women have voted! I don't want to damage the film to you but I'm sure everyone who saw this ran to their computer to measure and give it a bad score, why? Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. If most women vote for this film because of its value of humor and not because it is damaged by men ... it could be a "7" film that was tested easily!
