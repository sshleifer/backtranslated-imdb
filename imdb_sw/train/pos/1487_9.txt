"Casomai" is a good story depicting the story of a young couple who wade through brilliant marriage. The story is reliable to tell the wonderful-saw intermediate between the difficulty and the intervention of others, which is similar in Italy (someone may wonder whether these events are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that's one of the most severe movie points. Working with Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo are wise and promoting. And the parable of the merciful priest is funny and well. All in all, a truly worthy movie, perhaps one of the best Italian movies of the year.
