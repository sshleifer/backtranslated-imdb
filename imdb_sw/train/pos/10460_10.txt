This was a good film with strong messages of love and redemption. I liked to change the brothers and the consequences of the terrible disease in the family. You did well and were well guided. If there were any mistakes, I would like to say that the story showed the families of ordinary cities and their problems again. How about all the people of all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a film where all these cultures are shown - like in real life. However, the film has increased according to its values ​​and its understanding of how disease can bring someone closer to him. He loved the film and brought tears to my eyes
