Common antics and cats antics quantities until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. He gets a sharp idea to put Tom out of ignorance. Cat gets wisdom and tries to do things to make him 'see' jerry even though it is not evidence of folly. Of course Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike dog inside the act (even if it is delayed for a short time, and his contribution is really small) A beautiful animated animated which kind of reminds me of one and white mouse who scars Tom very much. Many work and violence like any good tomato and short jerry should be true. This cartoon cartoon can be found on one DVD of Spotlight's "Tom & Jerry" DVD /> <br /> My bridge: B +
