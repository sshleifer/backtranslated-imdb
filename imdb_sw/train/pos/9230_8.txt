There is a lot that can say about this film. It's not your normal blood transfusion. Of course, there is deception and sex with the elite, but that's close to the story. <br /> <br /> Installed in the 15th century of Italy, during the murder of 800 Christians in Otranto. The war between Muslims and Christians takes the best part of the film. It was interesting when everyone was fleeing from the Islamic reserves, that the great mother would ask, "Why are you afraid of the Muslims, they will not take anything that Christians have done for you?" In fact, there was enough suffering on both sides. Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is taken to a camping camp by despising her father. In the process, he testifies and endures many things: the stallion bridge, the rape of the local woman and the new Duke, the torture of the girl who failed during the visit to Tarantula Sect, and fast when she ran with the Jew. The torture was very troubling with the hot wax spraying on the girl, and her strokes were cut. Sister Flavia will have trouble with the problem if she asks a community led by men who lives. He even asks Jesus, why the father, son and holy spirit are all people. Finally, he joins the Muslim leader as his partner and climbs a camp meeting. Here you see more meat than possible to enjoy at one time. But, the calamity is coming. He can give revenge to all, including Duke and his father, but finds that a Muslim partner does the same for him. She is a woman and that's all I am. I can't explain what the holy men of the church did this in the last time, but precede the persecution of Saw or Hostel for decades. > <br wa sp na sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp
