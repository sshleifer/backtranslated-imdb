I see this film very enjoyable. The program is simple and easy, humor is simple and clean, and because the story involving the identity of evil is quite common, I am looking at how this fiction of this physical story. It turns out very good. The performance of female leadership is interesting; The manifestation of the innocent girl, the ignorant trying to deceive the white lies in the role of modern David was very appealing. I also have a great Vera play, very well. I find myself with tiny fingers as he used the strenuous and unsuspecting action. For those who have had enough films to fill today's debris, you will enjoy this film completely.
