Perhaps this could be the best film made and if not one of those prepared for your pupils such as Brian De Palma announces here is a large piece of movies. First there is a touch of Brian De Palma's director who once again can be one of the best directors ever, there is a good performance from Al Pacino who gives an eternal hero to the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different incidents (of violence) which never forgot (one with a series of chainsaw, one where Tony is sitting in a bath that is as big as many living rooms), there are many of the top links (count how often the word "f * ck" is used), there is good info very much (the Pan American-world that screams "The world is yours") or a great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be called a name that is not good here and is easily shared with "Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat" one of the best ever gangstermovies ever made!
