If you probably know already, Jess Franco is a good boy. Hes made hundreds of hundreds of films, many of which climb. However, he was able to enter the regular work between each meeting cycle. "Succubus" is not his best work (that's "Dr. Diabolical D" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many trademarks that make it necessary for anyone who wants to enter its great list. Includes erotic (mixing between the perfect display and leaving the omitted position) and surreal solid. This is a very fantastic film, full of atmosphere. I especially liked regular nameropping. In spite of the return of being very careful, he likes to hear all of Franco's influence. Still, there are many users who don't like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. Its lovely park, but I can handle it. More challenges are incoherency. The document here was running, and within five minutes on the film I did not know exactly what was going on (and has never been connected to that time). Those who want certain substances and their style, look elsewhere. Also, as his awesome film, it should never be scary or even insist. However, I was admitted to all the psychedelic deficiencies that I had no feeling of these great mistakes. (7/10)
