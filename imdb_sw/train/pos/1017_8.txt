I started watching the show from the first season, and at first I was very worried about it. The original was for babies, and I was going to look at a sci-fi event while waiting for the new BSG season. But after a few moments I was a fan. I have loved the characters - not a fool-like-you-think-she-is Jack O'Neill, Samantha Carter who is not just a host, Teal'c with a glorious, feminine and young, and talented Dr Daniel Jackson. Of course, the story is sometimes not bad, sometimes even ridiculous, but especially not about technology or chance of fighting - it's about helping your friends, even risking your life for it. It's about "we don't leave anyone behind". Facing the end when all hope is lost. About free freedom, and all the good qualities that make man - Man. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking the record, going to the 10th season, and still doing well.
