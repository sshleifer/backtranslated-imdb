In fact, passes are one of the best independent independent films. You must have a sense of humor to enjoy this fully. This film for some reason did not receive its credit due. First, it lets you start with the story everyone likes a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves a letter after consulting a hidden treasure not only brings two families together but begins a hurricane adventure. Mix in the Polish advocate, mother mix, the crack of the crack and the syndrome of turrets, the distorted hypnotist of homosexuality, and one of the queen, the money not only makes the world a round but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this film would be a sister / crack addict and turret's syndrome, suddenly out of burst will have you cry and mimicking for a week.
