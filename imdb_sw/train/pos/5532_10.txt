Perhaps I am fascinated with foxes, fox stories and everything but I thought this was a wonderful thing. I was so happy that it was displayed when Lily was not easily accessible, like fire and room (try to destroy too much here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. After reading a few comments of others I am confused, one says that at the end-destroyer-mother and son seem, for he is the one who told his son about his story. The movie I saw was not a mother or a child last, just the painting of a fox girl. Can someone raise me on that? However I enjoyed this movie, although some events can be slow that can be difficult for children with high strength to stay. They still have value if they can stay still.
