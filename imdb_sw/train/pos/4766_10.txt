It is common to see a film where the performance of one actor is so good that one can feel that the film will be of low interest, including, without its presence. With the wrong direction - in fact, there are many instances that seem to be hit very quickly and inevitably - a low-down budget, a wonderful plot about someone who wants to replace the beaten priest with other points The week, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so amazing that one gets shocked from the very start to the end of the terrible. I have never seen or cannot decide the best performance, even Paul Scofield doing "Man at all times" <br /> <br /> In fact, it could be considered even if ignorance like Fresnay was not playing an open priest who returns to the Church by committing crimes. <br /> <br /> "I am Maurice Morand, preter catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") says with such brilliancy that one can forget Mad Ness made up to that end. Another amazing feature of this film has one area in the Morand district - who despite being locked by the pastor - puts a huge cabaret of the vine turning into the blood of Christ. Gérard - a person who wants to return to Morand to the Church or to replace himself - he needs to drink if they don't want to leave the cabaret. He does so in the middle of cheers and applauses from people who think he eats only three liters of vines. In the second area, the dialoque between Morand and garbage collector is also amazing. "Do you take people too?" asks Morand, who hates himself for what he did. "That will be a lot of work" is a smart answer. Some of the films are not suitable to comment but it certainly has value to see from a very powerful and wonderful state at all times. I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange film, but it should be seen by all the audience - if it's a good catholi is necessary - because it is very jewell in the history of the film. <br /> <br />
