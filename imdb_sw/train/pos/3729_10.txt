When I think this film can get rap as being Anti-Vietnam, when I look at it I had no such feelings as the film was looking for honesty in a young perspective to be trained in the war that the public did not support ... showed their fears, desperation them, drive them ... all of it, out of the open, naked. As a very own soldier of that theme he saw me really in my experience in the army - especially the boot camp. In this whole film, though it was hit on a very small budget, it seems to be good, properly installed, and it works well and leads. I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for the best film Colin Farrell. 10/10
