I enjoyed watching Chuck Norris in the film. Although acting may not be good, the events of the fight are wonderful. I enjoyed seeing Judson Mills doing with him. In my opinion, Norris's brothers have shown themselves to be a few good and this was still another good production! I hope you take the time to see this film!
