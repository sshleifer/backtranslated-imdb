Certainly it shot well and made, very shot and made! But the story was just too weak. And the picture of Lincoln was even weak. It is not that Henry Fonda was not good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. What? You mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise wolf without respecting the law or court. What do I mean who was to be the devil? Vinnie cousin? I mean coming, "I'll just call Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford was going to a good hero of a hero but I wasn't like this man completely. He prepares in sports, he speaks like a real good rice and does not seem he can sit in the courtroom. What? I must take this seriously. <br /> <br /> From it is even weak. I mean coming! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought by the age of 5 in his dream. Saying that I liked it, it's very fun and makes me laugh several times so I can't say it's a bad film. Certainly I must say that I must say it is good, nothing makes it and make me laugh it can be bad But this vivid and fraudulent story was just an ignorance that I can't understand how anyone can see it. <Br /> <br /> I don't know how accurate this film was like if if I really had to shake my head.
