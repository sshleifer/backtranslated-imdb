Watching this again after the gap of many years and remembering the float was on its initial release, I wonder how it has done well. One of the reasons for his failure is that only one generation thought that it was too high and that the younger had been disappointed that he did not show the full glory of the hippy. Seeing now it is clear that Antonion was already aware and attracted to the great mix of passion for change and lack of any clear vision of the future. The leading pair is the best and it is a shame that they took a very flak to the failure of the film. They are the best and they show quite different and vary and show the pure joy in love. I am accusing others of further emphasis on the system of rebellion against students at the beginning but we must say that from there in this is one of the most beautiful directors and she certainly got better from someone made with natural themes. Oh, and I've never mentioned the end of explosion.
