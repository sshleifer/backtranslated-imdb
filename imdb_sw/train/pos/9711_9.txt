Well, I have found that there is more disgusting and frightening show than "Little Britain" and I love it! "Lords League" is a British patient patient who is close to a very small town, insane and foul in the UK. This area makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "Dibley Winner" and "Father Ted") seem pretty ordinary !! The show form is as much as LITTLE UK except it all has stations near the city of this one hellish city. It all reflects the same consistent scheme every part and some open inspired "Little Britain" (especially active search skit class). But the show varies because although it is as bad as "Little Britain" (so it's not a show for kids), the show has a reputation for disease and sadistic which puts away all these displays. In particular, animal crime and attempted murder is a constant theme during the show. Now if you don't think, this is not a show for kids, innocent people or ordinary people and maybe why I liked it. However, you need a really thin skin and a love to enjoy this with max. More than enough of faith - you see to believe.
