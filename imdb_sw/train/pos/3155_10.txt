I would "that" the 70s "show" would return on television. It was the biggest show ever! They should make events between other periods but of course it can mix. But I'd like to come back and make more sessions. You can not laugh without seeing a part. There is a very real part in each period and with a show it was very good when Hyde and Jackie were going along. These were the best times. and it will always be the best show ever. It was sad when the show was finished.
