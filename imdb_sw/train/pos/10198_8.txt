I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his staff at the revival of the once-off moribund of Visayan. "Panaghoy" is hoping to be a new player in this common language (which says more speakers than Tagalog). Description of the description and life description reminds them of this region of the Philippines. Down the bottom: the act of corny and stilted the American opponent. Another thing I was not grateful for was the lack of trust in the "period" of the same character, and above all, its red baby unit that I think had meant to pass to the 1930 roadster. Without these little details still interesting, " Panaghoy "would have at least 9 out of 10 on my level - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Appendix: This film likes to beat Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which provided a different view of Visayas during World War II. Alos, there are some parts where the movie promotes Spielberg's "The Purple Color" and storyline begins to be a reference to "Noli Me Tangere".
