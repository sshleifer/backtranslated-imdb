In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer who klingon Klaang with his plasma gun after a methane shop in his farm and Klingon is sent to Starfleet Hospital. The Vulcan Ambassador Soval recommends to eliminate the support system of life and bring to the corpse of Klaang to his heroic empire on the planet Kronos with respect. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to go with the Company on his first trip and bring him back to Klaang on his home planet. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Dr. Phlox, who works for Klaang, to complete his crew, and Vulcan's Chief Executive T'Pol is eligible to participate in the Company's risk message. When the starhip equipment is closed, Klaang is arrested by the Swedish after the shooting at the hospital. After the defense of the Suliban people who were killed during the shooting, Captain Archer was told by Dr. Phlox that the guest was a mutant, changed the process of genetic engineering. T'Pol converts the Enterprise sensors to monitor the flight of the Suliban airplane to the Riger X planet. Despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I have not followed the "Business" events on cable television. I decided to buy a DVD for the first season DVD and this first part attracted me. Wonderful Business First, Captain Jonathan Archer, T'Pol Good, Reed, Mayweather, Dr Phlox, Hoshi and Safari are the best, at least in these experiments. I have noted in the IMD that this section is actually divided into two parts, but for DVD is just one, so my opinion is correct for both. I didn't like the music theme, which I found so much, but this was different in this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Breakdown"
