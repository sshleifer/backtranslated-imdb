Back in 1994, I had a very long vacation on the fourth day of July - something like 17 days after a line that for two weeks paid vacation, weekends and holidays itself. I lived in the city at the time, playing so much with my parents' house. I had no television in my house so I used my parents' tube. I was finishing watching a part of the X Files when the program came to be called FX. I walked once. I was fascinated by things in our house that had come from my parents' home and through inheritance from relatives, and often wondered about their history, value, etc .. After my long vacation, I was going to my people's house on my lunch hours just get FX Personal. I can remember one place where Claire Carter hosted a partner announced that New York's apartment which consistently was rehabilitated and that once the renovation was completed that Mtul FX would return to the air. It has never been! FX personal was the first-and best - the generated displays. And it fell from heaven! About fifteen years later, I still hurt. <br /> <br /> Ways to go, FX.
