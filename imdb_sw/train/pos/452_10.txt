"My child, my sister, dream / knife! How do all things happen to sweet-knit / we are in that country of living together, <br /> <br /> And there love slow and long, <br /> <br /> There is love and death among them! <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> According to the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be explained in one sentence? takes place at the beginning of the 1920s when four women in London, four visitors decided to rent a castle in Italy in April. It is a good explanation but not prepared for the fact that "April April" - the last movie "feel good" is the completeness of its kind. Good and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, is like the sun's sun on your face during the winter when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this time of happiness and happiness and make it forever. This is the film affecting my life. I looked at it when I was lost, very happy and when I was lonely, when I was dealing with sad and bad events and discussing the wrong facts about myself. It helped me get my hope back and hope that anything can be changed and anything is possible. I had promised myself that no matter what, I would like to withdraw from the trouble and feel sympathy and would like to know every minute of life - and her joy and sadness ... Amazing, exciting, and exciting, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies found with my eternal love. This small film is the highest quality diamond.
