Ang Lee likes to be reduced to film, capture action, characters and put on a hat, as they appear. To cover the end of the US civil war through misuse of young, unconscious, intellectual, or humanitarian militants, this is the best approach. The film turns to being self-centered, adults and relationships. Lee also shows a beautiful panorama in the middle of the south as a quiet character, dealing with strife as a powerful parent. James Schamus's journal is probably the most common writer of this film; around behind it is a number of well-selected displays that carry well. Jeffrey Wright's name alone can carry this film to me. He is a brilliant here but for a slower motivation: rather than we are cured by very good performances (if not revelations) from a great partnership, often known. It is a very good, hopeful film. One look like you don't have a complex concept, more cool Mountain Mountain or Claim, for example. 7/10
