The return of the 3rd Party is a comedic guide to the epic 36 Judge of Shaolin, which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who was a player with a wonderful fighter. In this game Liu has a innocent player who has to learn kung fu after making his friends beat. Anaiga Shan Te of the past, tries all the methods of entering the Shaolin Temple to learn and ultimately acquires the unique skills of combating abuse. Its gold military strength, and the production of Ace's Shaw and the direction of Lui Chia Liang. Choreography is quite amazing, for fighting and beating and striking Gordon Liu, as well as others, especially a compassionate monk works perfectly for devices. The film is much smaller or more popular than other other work stars and there is a much greater, more violent and emerging Shaw Brothers film. But a few have a magical mix of slapstick, a unique training and fighting, and the story of the still subtlety of the guy is useless. With great joy of heart, it is impossible to give this high score.
