I swear, that the zombie was killed as twice, and continued to return. I paid this 8th film. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the general film of indy. The fact that Todd Paper got more than 700 zombies seen in this movie is rent for its talents. Yes, the story has limitations, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who cares so much? Take what, a fun and awesome movie, one to share with your buds, or for general outdoors people you care about LOL. People who are not feeling, I think you all liked the hunks of trash as "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace, and self-help film do !!!
