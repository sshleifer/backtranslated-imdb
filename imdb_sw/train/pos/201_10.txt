The great and emerging Marion Davies shows her things in this late (1928) silent game which also shows William Haines amazing. Davies plays a player from Georgia who beat Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear on the cheap comedy until Marion "available" and becomes a very big star. Great lights on Hollywood and its defense. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (very badly did not make talkie together) and shots of visitors from the loved ones of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you should see it) are hoot. Must be for any buff of a great film or for anyone who is attracted to Marion Davies who is still despised!
