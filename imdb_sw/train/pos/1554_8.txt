I saw this at the playground in the early 1970s. The most memorable and horrible event is when the German army is attacking the yellow mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toes (or hat) and eerie protective suits. A skilled British soldier gives gas (only) masks and again waiting for gas clouds and German attackers. The clouds of gas are moving closer, and ultimately promotes British defenders. The Germans are progressing slowly in their terrifying fabrics. Then suddenly screamed from the defenders ... This gas is like no other that has experienced before ... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I have remembered this area for the last 30 years + and still shiver, I think you too !
