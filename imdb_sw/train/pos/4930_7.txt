"Fear in Street" was very good, but I felt disappointed with it. The main theme of the city being attacked by the signs in modern times is amazing, but the film does not investigate or develop it. Its beauty was made by entertainment, but not as interesting as it should be. Screenplay of this is really weak and brings the entire film down. No intermediate characters are compelling or reliable. Unfortunately, the film has been done so well it supports the scripting weak. Elia Kazan's trend continues to be concerned with film and moving at the speed of electricity. There are configuration settings, especially the memory to remember. When his direction was connected to better screens several years later, the person can't do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Acting is also very good. Richard Widmark was always leading the lead and does what he can and the written character. Paul Douglas uses his time to cry much but also does a good job. The excluded sessions are two criminals. Zero Mostel, known for its comic roles, is as effective as one of the last characters of toady. Jack Palance is, without surprising, the terrible villain. "Fear in Settings" is frustrating but still worth looking. (7/10)
