The haunting piece that the fan of a terrible movie will fall with thanks. Put your Freddys with your Jasons - this film is located in one company like "The Haunting" (original). It is suitable and true, it stays with you for a long night, as well as those of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater shows. Good tax.
