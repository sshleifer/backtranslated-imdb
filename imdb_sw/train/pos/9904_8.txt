Top slaughter is about a boy named Marty. He was being tortured, and he took to school. A group of children played for several groups on it, and these stocks were very bad. The last prank ended with sadness. <br /> <br /> cue for 5 years later. The group of children will meet again for reconciliation. One of them put it in an old school. The school is now rejected, and should enter. For some reason, Janitor is still there, but he tells them to continue and enjoy because they give him beer. They start sharing, looking at their old cabinets, and seeing something of Marty. One girl feels sad for Marty but another person cuts the heart. Once the killings start, it's good. Each kill is creative and tend. We see the figure in the mask, mask them straight into school. It seems Marty is behind revenge. After the first person was killed, they know they are locked up in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now, there are a number of inappropriate things in this film. First, I don't know anyone who has 5 years old. Second of all, after the first child dies, the girl gets blood on it. They all run in fear, but they run the bathroom, and find the bathrooms. Hrr friend has just been killed, and decides to bathe! More importantly, why there are bathrooms in the school bathroom. Anyways, bathtub does not seem to work .... and he dies this horrible death is a movie of 80s. is a terrible slasher. WHO DOES WITH ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. I for one not. This movie has too many deaths. Last .... there is a move. After seeing the Haute tension soon, I can compare these two. The only way that is the same is that there is a moving, what kind of left me lust ..... HERE after the disappearance, comes great, if not better kill, in the movie. After the last kill, the killer looks at the screen and also does something nice, and it was the perfect way to finish the movie. It has me to go "wow ..."
