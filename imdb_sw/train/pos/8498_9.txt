This is a good movie and fun, wise and dynamic diversity of culture and themes to focus on what is important in life makes this movie very worthless. Don't let the audience of the world stop you from seeing this. Keaton has a wonderful time and I am surprised that the comedy never appreciates it, because actors like Keaton goes from humor to big bits very visible easily. Great movie around!
