I have read several comments on this film and I must say "What is wrong with your people?" This was the best film! I thought this film was wonderful from beginning to end and the story was very explained. I am sure people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to the film. There are a number of very important events that if you don't pay attention you will be confused with the following screens cannot be meaningful. I urge anyone who did not like this film to look at it again and watch it alone so you can remember. The story was very meaningful to me and as I said, it was well explained. Each scene in the film is guaranteed and everything matches together at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters did a wonderful job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was as beautiful as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was a good touch too, and it looked amazing. Blair Underwood was a good surprise, I didn't expect anything big from him, but he drew good performance. Ed Harris was a real gem in the film. He loves the sick person and actually makes you see how he was affected by his behavior. Look at his eyes in his scenes, just superb !!! Also, there is a little Scarlett Johansson (like Kate) in one of its first responsibilities ... not their place to start. Posted well in this film! I would like to recommend this film to anyone who loves any members or just interested. This is a good film and should be seen. Listen to all these other people's comments, go see the movie and get your own conclusions. I hope you will see the film, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
