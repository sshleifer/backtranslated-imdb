This, like the killings he wrote, is one of these displays, that after a difficult day at school, I sit in front of the TV, and watch. Why? Because I am happy with the truth, and it is a shame that there is no more air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr Mark Sloan, a physician-turnaround, who with his son, solves the murder. He shares with great power, who is his true son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series of changes to her hairstyle. I also loved Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and was worried how suddenly disappeared. This view is entertaining, with many visitors of the aliens, it is apparent at some point, like Colombo, but in every section, there is always something that needs. In conclusion, a great series, with two fingers and 10/10. Bethany Cox
