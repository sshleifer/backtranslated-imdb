I saw this as a child at the end of eight years and I must say, Galaxy Express is one of those films that hold your attention for a long time. If you have never understood the appeal of anime, discover this film can be your gold ticket in Otaku town. The story is like stylish and poetry like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cell animation, sometimes traditional, has a clear style of Leiji Matsumoto's talent for the design of a character and a visual story. <br /> <br /> This is one of the exclusive children's films like Star Wars, Crystal Dark and the Wizard of Oz that completely eliminates the "family entertainment" and stands as a movie attraction for its own terms. I recommend this film.
