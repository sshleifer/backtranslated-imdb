Hearts That Are Still Walking is one of the films that you accept and don't allow you to go to the end, especially when you see it as a child. To see the film as an adult, you have to admit that it is not all that awesome, but the story is very interesting and has a great incredible event (especially those with a sharp tail) is the area with grandparents and grandmothers in their new RV; The location and rocks are very exciting and awesome. Also events where the main character finds the mother's secret is terrible. Right, acting in the film is not all good and sometimes the film seems to get a little boring, but generally the spirits that are still going are fun. Just badly a few people saw this film, this film is more suitable. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you've done a good job! And for all Hollywood manufacturers out there; If you want to restore the movie, modify this!
