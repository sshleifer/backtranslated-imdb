I watched this film a few days ago on a small independent movie in Paris. It was my last evening in the French capital and the best I could choose. These two pieces made me think of what I had collected in Paris in a way that would encourage the heart without walking in the kitsch schmaltz or sentimental. Each section is full of surprises, strong emotions and beautiful pictures and every small film is directed according to the rules of a beautiful short story. I kind of movie requires more talent and features of the director and author of the story board than any epic two-hour game and all succeeded in their best work! Stories were carefully selected for their Arrondissement similar to expressly flair. Each section was seen from a different foot, had a different presentation, a different style and still twenty story causes a harmonic orchestra of the film. The best advantage and the concept of movie film in my opinion is based on the fact that you can switch between a great variety of emotions and emotions without the risk of overload, just another way: melange of sadness, melancholy happy cleanness, despair, anger, anxiety , curiosity or passion gives this film a clean and unique harmony. And don't forget all about the topic of love! Love among the characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of the directors and actors / administrators of this project. I don't want to go into the details of the events since there is a lot, but I must emphasize many of the world-famous characters and actors from around the world and their way of this project. Others played with their idols, others broke them thoroughly and some described the discrimination associated with their country or their roles, so the interaction was given through each movie. All in all I can totally recommend this great collage and will expect to be released on the DVD.
