I don't believe this was a challenge to deal with Richard Harris. This was a tough plot, still interesting. It's a good movie to watch when you don't want to make a lot of ideas, just want to tell a simple story. Canada's situation was breathing. The beautiful shots of Fall alone made the picture worthy to see.
