This is my daily FAVORITE movie. It was my movie Friday night and pizza with a bottle of wine when I was a wife. I saw this film first with Aunt Brend and Sister Chasity. I was in grade 2. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my best friend. I have read many comments about why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy has "learning to act" marriage. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My translation of the movie now, not when I eight is a relationship with Bud & Sissy takes on the worst side because she makes a fool in Gilley riding a cow. They get a great battle. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to play. Sissy then thinks of two errors he will do right and Wes asks him if he "needs any help". They are all on the dance floor they do as ignorant when Bud asks Pam, "What are you going to home and stabbing me?" Pam's reply: "At any time you will walk already Cowboy". Bud then goes home with Pam for her condom in Houston city. Which Daddy has bought for his oil and "all that means". Bud is the one who uses Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is ONE who gives Bud. Then, it's on Bud to prove Sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and defeat him back. <br /> <br /> Anyways, that's my translation. Everyone has them I'm sure! I love this film. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I've found myself a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
