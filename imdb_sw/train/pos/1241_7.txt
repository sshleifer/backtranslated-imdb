This movie is very entertaining, and any comments are based on personal preferences - not the quality of the film. Other than the most common dirt in certain scenes by Murphy, the film is a great car for its kind of humor. It has special positive effects, and exciting action events. <br /> <br /> As a child of lost children, Murphy's behavior begins to search for a lost girl, which leads to a way that others believe was "chosen" - to protect the Child of Gold. The boy is born as a light to save the world from the power of evil, but whose life is dangerous, if not by Murphy's help, and his wonderful, wonderful and wonderful helper / guide. <Br /> <br /> Also, there is a time of philosophical studies to convince members of the audience who are willing to reflect deep ideas. One part is where the Golden Child, Murphy's character is wrapped up to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. Mr. Elder gives a coin of decorative beads to the child to choose, and the child is tested for his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy that depends on the idea that there are good and evil forces in our world that most people do not know at all. When we receive this Cluster of the plot, we should allow to touch the realities of every day, and prepare for the land and the fallen walls, and reveal the evil area just waiting to destroy us. <br /> This is the best movie, good plot, good acting, and for the most part, a very good conversation that combines great topics and a good balance of the Martial Art fighting, and Eddie Murphy's humor.
