This film begins to decline, it has a mid-term, but generally goes well, it has a very short time, then it leaves at the end of Law 3. I was able to get this at LA premieres 2 times (and last 2 different). Jason Lee is a star, but he's not tomorrow to lead someone. He is happy with his own, but he should be a helper to help. Julia Stiles has no 'ok' in the role of comedy, new for him, but he 'does not know' this movie, how the star of his caliber should be. For an actor who has a very high potential (10 Things, a Last Dance Dance, O), it is difficult to watch him continue to do the tasks that are 'moderate', and then he doesn't have to take place and run with the movie (like Daniel Day-Lewis made in ' Gangs'). Selma Blair is a good sandwich player, and he works on 'ok'. I did not expect the performance of the academy awards from him, and he did not give one, but, his performance was enough. Chris Koch gives another film which is 'on average'. Probably the problem lies in the script over anything else. I've done 'like this film! But, it's not a film where you go away and say ... 'that was good!' ... This 'story' has been done many times before and was not very new here. Part of the dinner exercise was the best of the film, and Larry Miller gives a wonderful performance in the role of helping (can be a great surprise for the film). If you want to go to a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have a good evening, I can still recommend this film, but unless they have changed the last ... again ... leave the church, or you will surely be disappointed.
