I came back from a survey of several hours ago, and I was very happy with the film when I left it. It is very intense, and almost I came right into the movie for some time. That is a loan to Adam Sandler, who offers great performance at many levels, and who is probably the name of Oscar for it, didn't come out earlier in the year. Don Cheadle gives his most unusual performance to play a direct person to Adam's adversity. There is a sense of humor, but many of them are only true in comparison with the tears, as Adam deals with his loss and Don tries to help him. Adam has two very positive standards ... when he is a mental attitude he is funny and pleasant, but when he, well, very strong he is strong and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who loves intense counseling about friendship and hard disadvantages.
