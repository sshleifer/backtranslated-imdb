I saw this movie for the first time ever and I love it. His play was very entertaining. I read somewhere that he found part in this film because he knew how to play. Good conditions were also great. Yvonne is a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed in kissing events, but that's good about old movies! I grew up with him in Munsters and I am happy to look at him in his original movies. Not all may be better out there but they should still look to see her act and sing. I am using his films slowly and watching them as I receive them. I have a huge collection of memories.
