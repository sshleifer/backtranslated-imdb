Barbara Stanwyck recently gives Douglas Sirk directed, produced by Universal only a kick that requires. It is not nearly as memorable as the Sirk's future melodramas, it is easy to see by looking at "All I Desire" where Sirk would be leading artistic in the next few years. Stanwyck is a girl's showgirl who returns to her family in a small town, U.S.A, after leaving them ten years earlier. His family and communities have mixed emotions in dealing with his amazing return. Some movie shows are amazing, and Stanwyck is a nail-nail and provides this film a shot of energy. In general, a good show.
