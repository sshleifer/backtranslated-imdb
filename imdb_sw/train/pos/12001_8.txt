I don't know what film some of these other people are looking at, but they should see the difference "Joseph Smith: The Messenger of Restoration" than what I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both well and stirring. I think it's important to watch. It seems from the outset that many services entered into this film. Nature is good. I think the film has a good job to show Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual exercise is shown by the taste and respect. I would like to suggest watching this film.
