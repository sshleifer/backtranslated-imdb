Once you saw the movie, the true sense of magic of the Walt Disney movies came into me and I realized that it was long ago that I saw the 'real' magic on the movie. The mix of the right music, speech and magical effects brings the emotions of Disney back into your body. Very special things that I saw where it does not harm the film, started with a disney color turning into Cinderella's castle and ended as an old story to tell Fairytale and your grandfather. Magic / Wickedness is back in me. I exceed this 8 out of 10 films.
