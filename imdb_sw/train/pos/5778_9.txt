Despite the budget deficit, this is a good film, evidence that efforts and ideas can overcome the lack of money. Opening, where the painting of the cave appears to show how some dinosaurs at least live in the age of mankind, is a beautiful ring of string. After that, the meteor comes into the lake and causes the heat, which, for its part, causes the beating of the stored dinosaur egg (perhaps the painting of the cave shows rather than this is the first thing that happened). When the prehistoric animal appears, it is a Plesiosaur with a beauty that soon leads to extinction in the area. Indeed, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real entertainment for fans of monster movies.
