This film has difficulty in its presentation, it may even be bad for people who are looking for time and culture, but it faces a player to reflect on various issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judah. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, it is Jesus' humanity. The relationship of Christ-businessman is developed and carried out through the movie. The love of Judah is presented as a parallel with that of Christ. When Judah separates himself, the viewer can see angst. The lack of Peter and his guilt, however, to move, is not as seen as powerful as the drama of Judah. Chris Sarandon provides a novel with the Christ who motivates, whether it is faithful or not. I would like to get this film on DVD or even VHS, use in learning groups or discussions.
