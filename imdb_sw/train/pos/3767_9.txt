Go back to page ten of this review section, and make your way again. Continue; I'll try it. Is it done? Yes, then you have probably seen the same situation I have. You can always talk about limping jokes, the time you have set up and a sufficient number of conspiracy and shtick on 'Bogus', but this film seems to be one of those 'loving me now, you love me later' beat. <br /> The problem with Bill and Ted was that the initial call of 80 children who followed and focused themselves on the edge of the fashion. It did it well in the past, but it was clear the bomb in 1991, when no slacker The independence would have been taken dead in anything except flannel or admit that he liked anything about 80 years. Ted as he said: "Dude, this is a deep hole. You want to play 20 questions?" <br /> <br /> They say that anger goes in the 20-year cycle, and indeed it seems to be the case here. Here in 2010, those who used to have Cindi Lauper and Megadeth start looking back to know some of these important films (such as or not) made us who we are. If you are one of those who look at 'Bogus' as if it was not long (“Fa gs!”), Then you lose the point and probably have spent six years growing hair, flannel looking and checking if you just sprayed it bed. <br /> <br /> In its original nature (Star Trek section "and when traveling with a phone booth), B&T is not trying to hide the love of its creators by worshiping. Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I say 'Bogus' is 'True Love,' but I think it needs to be counted for what it is: the joy of snap-shot of our society before the children's psychology, Ritalin, anti-cigarette advertising, terrorist paranoia and the spread of media terror- looking at. /> <br /> So, for all of you B & T you hate there ... erase your CDs Cries, get them out of your face, go to the beach and shine. Narcissistic and mental concern is SO company.
