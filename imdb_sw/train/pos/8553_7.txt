I just watched the movie I was afraid it would be sad. I was rather surprised at the end though. The American pie franchise is still on my franchise films of all time. yes, it will not be true if I say that I enjoyed like mushrooms if I enjoyed those original. The beta house with two previous pie obviously lost something that the first two pie had. but what hell - it's still funny and good time and I think it should be the first movie to take if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. The beta house is worth 6/10 but I gave 7/10 only for another piece of PIE.
