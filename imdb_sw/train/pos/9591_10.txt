The best document. I personally remember this growing in NYC in the early 80s. This film is for anyone who was not around at that time. People are real and sadly few still live as this is written. Balls are still done but not to the extent they were in the nineties and nine years. That time has gone forever. That's good before "movie thug". When Queens were very proud to be publishers. This Storyville route is another season that has gone but it is very written all the rain films!
