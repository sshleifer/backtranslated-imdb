Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are born in a single-parent family. Jasbir (sister) grows in a good environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and eventually join the hippie movement which ultimately leads to drugs. Prashant (brother) on the other hand grows in a non-low environment but grows up to be a whole teacher. Stories of stories include Prashant to make an effort to save her little sister (who is always in view) from the hippie's hostile environment. This era stands at a time, saying that group groups and hippie are a place for those who leave their lives when they have to stand up and be counted in trouble. Great music songs in this film which means different things in different situations and for different people, and the director provides a sense of feeling.
