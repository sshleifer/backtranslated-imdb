Show this is very fun! The joke is of nature, god and I love Eric and Kelso! I know what they say, after the 8th season is no longer because Eric and Kelso are no longer on the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is comparing with Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> you can not take the funniest characters and switch to and "I'm a cool guy" kind of guy (Randy). not his fault, but the authors try to keep the eighth season funny, it is still not like the original season, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> The 360 ​​is awesome, circular, Red is the real kind of father to hurt the mind :) and kitty is always half the top half pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has time too. The characters of the little favrioutes are Jackie and Donna. they are cold, but not Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> big show. Dumbass!
