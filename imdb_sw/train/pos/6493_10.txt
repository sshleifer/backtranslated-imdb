I remember watching this as a child in England, described by the story and the description of Laurence Olivier. We would talk about anything else at school the next day. I think the first exhibition rate was huge. This is just the best series of success with the fact they had to cut the story to the bone they could catch too. What is interesting is that the British and North American wars were important but they do not recognize them as Americans. The series touches the competition between Mountbatten and US generals, torture of German soldiers in the east, tortured Japanese prisoners of war and US troops. Images of death made me, a non-Jewish Europe, feel forever guilty of the treatment of Jewish people. I don't know why this is not the same number in IMDb positions. Perhaps they express their concern about the document. Spoiler - we win.
