I just watched the first series on the DVD, but it could reflect Sopranos as the Shakespearean plot consisted of Tarantino script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as much as the Godfather (therefore not "10"), and better than any effort of Guy Ritchie. Although there are a lot of steps, some of it is blood, the story is derived from behavior. Even some of the little characters contribute to the big lines of the story; k.m. The connection of the priest (or lack of) and Carmilla and the wife of restaurateur, and Christopher and his wonderful friend (who did not have too long (chosen of Darwin?)) In addition to the plot, script and acting, the other reason I loved; It made me go to New Jersey and eat pasta and tomatoey sauce. 2. music. 3. It shows that anyone can actually suffer from mental health problems.
