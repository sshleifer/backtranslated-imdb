I loved him so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. Chemistry among practitioners (including Little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. It can be used a little more time screen for Frederick Lawrence to play (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was wonderful "on her" since the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> She who enjoyed the most shocking and frightening shock and wonder was Rupert Graves like Arthur Huntingdon. I plead in Forsyte Saga, and all the other things I've seen. But he emerges here as Arthur. In my worst nightmare I couldn't have an example of playing psychological grade as Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I love it. And I love him.
