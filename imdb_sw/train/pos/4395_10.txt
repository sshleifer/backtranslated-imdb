One of my proposed movies that has been ignored by many film actors, a survey you are trying to test me. Not only by the well-known Ang Lee, he had many participants who would be the main star, for example, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker , Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All work was very good and each of the listed executives gave an unforgettable exhibition, especially the Meyers who showed him a bad villain who was killed for killing. When the biographies and successes of the director (even when they won a professional award) and practitioners are listed, this film is usually not recommended from their old performances. I discovered a film on the DVD for an accident and it became one of my films that have been seen many times. However, each rarely appears on the cable. I am hoping to read what others show is the reason why this film is unknown.
