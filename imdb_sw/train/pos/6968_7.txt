As the new BSG was not what fans of the previous series were expecting, Caprica can not provide what fans of the new BSG were expecting (for the most part). It is very interesting, if it is not an independent, or at least one experiment. If you are looking for a great CGI's (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the game, you will probably find something you like and maybe realize. The story of the story examines how Cylons were planned, why Adam hates the nature of the divine community. The authors can also deal with 'human beings with God' and creation or creation of 'human' life. It will be amazing to see how this is shown. I found it to be plod with a certain part and also to preach to others, but everything was promising. A small part of me wants (or hopes) there may be small BSG columns there (away from the previous story I mentioned), but that would be a very critical story. Like BSG, I will need to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's a very early way to tell. It is very easy to find this if you fail if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm ready to give you a chance. In general, I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing a fabric (proverbial)'.
