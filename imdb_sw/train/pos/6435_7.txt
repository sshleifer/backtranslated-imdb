I think many people who have commented on this film do not understand how to watch the film and / or have no sense of beauty. First, evaluate the movie you need to understand the extent to which everything works in the film. Modern feelings require a big drama. No, I don't mean to put characters and squares, but they seem to need emotional trajectories that are very sad or very interesting. This is a trick movie. Its beauty is in its craft (not confused and humble). No stories or characters are not easy on this film. It is a well-known movie that makes more of mixing humor, politics, human weakness, life ... you call it. The world will be an alien and unknown today ... the world where you have you should do it now and desolate, even if you think you just have. Many people today do not understand that the Israelite community was not a normal winner if people understood it today. <br /> <br /> This game helps keep records automatically.
