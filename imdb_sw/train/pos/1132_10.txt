Its Hollywood imitates the Daytiem Soap System for the most beautiful! It's a pleasure that we can't see. Great characters and large lines. Who is the hilarious master ..... Sally Field is more advanced .... Gary Marshalls lines are fighting .... this is what I love about good comedies. Never afraid to boast themselves !!!!!! The sets were beautiful .... The wardrobe was on the point and backstabbing "Montana Morehead" was the joy of the devilish. Terri's player as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines but there was not yet a bit of fun and fun while screens. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this movie came. I have never seen people very much interested in working on comedy! Soap must have it and wait for DVD!
