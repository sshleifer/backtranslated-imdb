I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a short time ago, and since then, I have examined each of his movies accessing my radar screen. As Clive Owen, he has power (and even resembles Owen somewhat) that comes out of the screen. I feel that, if he places certain roles of meat, he will take Oscar one day ... That's not leaving this film completely. It is good news, and people are very reliable (well, depends on shenanigans of the original author and rocket), cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always in my checklist? with a good mixture of humor, pathos, excitement ... and a great song of volume and rock of numbers to get the feet of the beat. But this film was very important to me: 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the stars of the night looking Sputnik as it turned the wind; like Homer also, I was tested by a rocket in my house and I even used the same chemical for oil; and like Homer, I also had many last attempts in an explosive epidemic! What a pleasure it was ... <br /> <br /> I did not reach its maximum (romantic and physical) though. But, you know when you see this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a basic family movie, but that's breeding these days, it seems. Take time to see, with children: you will have a lot of good laugh.
