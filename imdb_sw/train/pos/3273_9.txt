I only give out 9 out of 10, because I need to look at it again, with a more intelligent mind now to have a new perspective. What I remember is a wonderful psychological thriller that raised my brain and my eyes when I watched it. I would like to look at it whenever you got to HBO again in the day (maybe 1990 or so). I could even write it, but the recording has gone a long time, I'm sure. I wrote to GreenCine to try and find this title, currently not taking it. I hope I will find it in the local video store. I would like to strongly recommend experimenting if you find somewhere. Very interesting. If you have enjoyed movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or any other wonderful and together line, try this out.
