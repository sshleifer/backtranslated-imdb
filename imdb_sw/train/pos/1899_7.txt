Arthur Bach needs to grow, but unfortunately it's not the only thing he needs to do. According to his richest father, Arthur should marry a wealthy Susan Johnson or cut off the family money ($ 750 million). The problem is, Arthur does not like Susan (although I hear she makes a good chicken) and has just fallen head-on-heels to the waitress and part-time shop lifter Linda Marolla. Arthur is your best friend. He is just a young man, born in wealth and at least one person looking for every second day. Working only in a bad way - he likes to fun, pour him, and of course, drink. The drink gives Arthur the kind of complex of Jekyll-and-Hyde; and when it makes him in all trouble, it is quite hilarious to look at the screen. Dudley Moore is good here in this film like Arthur, getting an Oscar selection and Golden Globe win for its performance. Moore is amazing with comedic elements of the film, and transforms the funny funny lines into the wonderful comedic gold, but it is also great in bringing Arthur down to the eligible level and making the character visible. Moore has a support in the star department of co - Liza Minnelli is as good as Lina, a man who can not find something enough, and John Gielgud is as strong as a hobson farmer of Arthur. Gielgud won Oscar Assistant for his performance in this film, and no doubt why. Hobson has a good magician and stuck, but always looking for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in that role. The 1981 movie Steve Gordon Arthur is short and simple, but offers a lot of fun.
