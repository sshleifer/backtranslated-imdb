After reading some of the other comments here I was expecting something wrong but it was very strange. HOW TO LOOK: The previous series was not suitable. I think some people remember more lovingly than what they deserved but far away from the car running and Daisy Duke's feet were weak and uninhabited. The Duke boys were very clever and a few of the backwood tanks, the Hog's former shrimpen was so bad and Rosco was only powerful at all of the screens. It is surprising in fact as long as you did because it came out of the story lines during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the film. If you are watching this film fairly, not like direct comparison and however you remember the TV series, then it's not so bad. The real star is actually the Great Lee. Car drove and stunts is the best and that's what D.O.H. it's about. Johnny Knoxville is a natural human person and with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo pair makes this film quite realistic in the hilarious Dumb-And-Dumber series of TV series never found. Jessica Simpson is as good as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes Boss Hog and M.C very improved. Gainey makes Rosco P. Coltrane quite good, the way she should always be. If you do not like the slapstick humor and spiritual car queues then you can't watch this film yet because you should know what to expect. Otherwise if you want a little car-entertainment video and a good little cotton that is not very sensitive to the brain then you see this interesting and intelligent mind.
