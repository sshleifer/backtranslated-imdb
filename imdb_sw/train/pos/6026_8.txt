This film has an end of philosophy. But the end means only if you are watching the movie from the beginning. To leave the youth at the end of the 1960s, due to the young man's view of the young woman, is a clear theme of "Zabriskie Point". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin did not have much experience, something that adds a message to the film. Having an unemployed practitioners gives a sense of authenticity, as all players seem to have a hindrance to the problem around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a script run by script. Except for the first ten minutes, it's more to see, and the amazing movies. Beautiful natural pictures appear to be somewhat secular, and perfectly in balance with the emotional force of Mark and Daria. I would be changing the very weak Pink Floyd music and the most popular music of The Doors. Many events cry out to "Stormers in the Storm". <br /> <br /> However, I would like this film. It's different; is unique; is artistic and creative. And the desert islands are beautiful. <br /> <br /> As years pass, "Zabriskie Point" looks more and more interesting. It provides a situation in the late 1960s in America. It is a wonderful artistic, in the form of bohemian. And the last minute of the film is the concept of philosophy.
