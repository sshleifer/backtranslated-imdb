Kay Pollack (someone behind this film) is a very good person who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He has written a good group of books and well written books on how to control your mind and keep your soul happy. The message in his books and this movie, is that your thoughts are actually what comes from your problems and that the reason for your wrath is never appropriate for what you think. The main message is that you can choose to have fun, but it's not difficult to do it. <br /> <br /> Watching this film and learning something very important in life, you should keep your mind open and listen to all "hidden messages" (or life-guidance guidelines) which many parts in this film include and you look. Look for your ears. You can't learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get more ... <br /> <br /> So, when you look at, please remember: <br /> <br /> "The intention is like a parachute, it doesn't work if it's open!"
