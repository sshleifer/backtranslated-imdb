it is the key elements of this 1917 issue. The glory of the family tells the story of a little girl who becomes a family leader after her father dies. Island on the coast of Scotland, villagers live a simple life of "fishermen." My text is very dark and sometimes it is difficult to read, but the film has a good sea reputation, and the camera works on very good boats. Maurice Tourneur inspired Pickford in this beautiful film. Pickford was already a great star in 1917, and this film appears written for him only: a young woman finds success on the unfortunate. Pickford whip the ruddy locals of the church are very funny. And the last events on a sinking ship are very good. It's not a great picture of Picford, but it still has value to see. Matt Moore (Pickford married his brother, Owen Moore) is a passion for love, and is as good as the island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't see her. My text intersperses a lot of bells and gongs and adds eerie sensation when village warning alarm is rung. Very effective.
