The 18 directors had the same job: tell the stories of love laid in Paris. Typically, some of them were better than others, but the whole mosaic is very good - of course, would not boring if all had the same vision of love? Here's what I put groups (which can change for a second view): “Quartier Latin”, for Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the largest French actors ever directed my favorite place, featuring always stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witch and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Visit Eiffel", for Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "Three of Belleville") stories of a little child whose parents mimes, "Tuileries", and Ethan and Joel Coen The Brothers Coen + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", and Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá" También "," Children's Men "), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); "Place des Fêtes", and Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touch); <br /> <br /> 6. "Arrondissement of 14", Alexander Payne's ("Election", "About Schmidt") look for a wonderful for a good side of life there, feat. underrated character actor Margo Martindale (mother Hilary Swank in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely, middle-aged American holiday, <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis," Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run ") and panic style work in the story of a small actor (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love; "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (with a curious coming to Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!) <br /> <br /> 9. "Simba du 16ème", and Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving stories from Brazilian directors, feat Catalina Sandino Moreno.); "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", and Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), sad story. always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal; 11. "Le Marais", and Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Honest (simple, but funny); "Quartier de la Madeleine", and Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; 13. "Quais de Seine", and Gurinder Chadha; It will be a place for the "Place des Victoires", and Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; "Bastille", and Isabel Coixet (wonderful director of "Under My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; "Pigalle", and Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Pastor of Fanny; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", with Bruno Podalydès; "Porte de Choisy", and Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (especially known as "Barfly", "Changing Luck" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I can classify categories as brilliant and others as average (or even less boring), but none of them are very bad. In general, I offer "Paris, Can t'Aime" 8.5 / 10 and suggest why it is: a nice mosaic on love and other intermediate things.
