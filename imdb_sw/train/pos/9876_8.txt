Presenting Lily Mars is a very interesting film that shows the comedy of the actress Judy Garland, as well as her regular singing. The program includes Lily Mars putting together after producer John Thornway for his great break. I think the comedy is light and no too heavy here. I recommend this film to everyone. Judy is very excited about this role!
