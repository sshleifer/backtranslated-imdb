This is one of the best music concerts that will see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was a brand new and heard again today with a natural artist today is a measure of Sir P Mc power of spellbind any group of any age. This document goes back to events to show us life on the road not only for the band but everyone up to the roadies. I saw this man living in Aussie 1975 and he can assure you of his performance here on this DVD is not under him who gave nearly 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 sound system that makes this right and suggests anyone especially to the Beatles fan. This is the closest you will find at the Beatles Festival today. The singer, Songwriter, manual / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, brilliant purely. There are a few who can stand alone with one vessel and hold the crowd in his hand. If you want to remember the full music, buy a written label CD. If you want to hear raw music as it focuses and specifically for the crowd, with all the excitement of this DVD-impression it is for you.
