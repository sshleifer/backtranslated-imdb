it's a very good movie and I'd recommend to everyone. but there are two lower points: - the level of the story has a huge scope. some of these events are very serious and some are just scary. - Many stories are not self-reliant (if you compare cheats and cigarettes, where each story is sure, message, punchline or even want to call it) but well, many stories are very good, some are great and are generally one of the best movies this year. ! <br /> <br /> anger, that I have filled 10 lines at a minimum, I have no more to say and I don't want to start examining one order ... <br /> <br /> well, I think it's so!
