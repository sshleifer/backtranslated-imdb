Come to the people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... rich people have done crazier items than this. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I look at the comedy being entertained, running from the world pressure for a short time, and not necessarily taking something very seriously. This movie fits perfectly for that purpose. I am judging the movie for personal features and not nearly compare live to Christmas with sharp buttons. I looked at the unemployed people to grow up caring, worthy people who could live on the street from my home. It will remain on my "favorite ..... you must check the holiday season". If you just want to have fun 90 minutes, check out this.
