Very little bit. I expected some kind of a terrible movie review but what I found was a very exciting moment that loses any time. In addition to these movies we should enter the stories of the characters behind so that we will feel their sympathy or hatred when people start killing. o ignorant here. Yes you see a few characters but actually interact only with the heads. As the husband's wife in the motel whose room was canceled. We saw them so that we could only know how Lisa's behavior was effective and how the new hotel clerk was. We see a little girl just because she will have a very small but important role in the movie at all times bursting. Explosive Birds because we especially need to encourage the plot before. The worst person needs at the beginning of the flight. Bad guy at the airport was important to the movie too. Only 2 characters who were only 5 builders who did not use the plot were two young birds on the plane. That was clever because I thought I had something to do with the plot. From the first place to the last the woman's style of a small hotel named Lisa is involved. Even when Jackson shows his true colors he hasn't been involved. He thinks what he can do during freezing. Any other film women's smart executive will do as idiots. But not this. It was a very short movie and I was waiting for a common plot equipment to run because the movie seemed to come to its immediate conclusion. Thankfuly none of them were used. The new hotel commander was not normally called and told what to do, which is afraid to stop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything, or ask your master and tell him he needs to drink and dismiss him. It was Craven should make more of these types of movies. Also the last comment. Brian Cox is in the film but I didn't have one clue that he had. I had to come here to see that it was Lisa's father. He doesn't know at all.
