I have no idea how IMDb expresses a comment but I know that, if it happens frequently on Amazon.com, there is an amazing number of negative reviews for this movie that repeats the same, some points of non-verbal speaking, near words. Campaign? IMD just knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie: it's good. It's a wonderful, interesting and direct movie. It has been more than ten years since I worked in Brooklyn, I lived in Queens and visited relatives in South Bronx. But I didn't find anything that recognizes or uses these children. Is the bride a wonderful character? Yes. What? Discussion and plot agree with this? Yes, thanks, they do. Are other movies put in LES and show the Dominican / Puerto Rican children as possible? You say. What? That makes the crime of this film? as some (with my eyes, astroturf) comments suggest? Not possible. Let a thousand flowers of plastic flowers. <br /> <br /> This is better than any part of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Surprisingly by comparison but you don't_you never have a_and I'm touched, on the basis, and the humility of this spirit and tender film. It said, I would like to know the history behind all these events! :-D;
