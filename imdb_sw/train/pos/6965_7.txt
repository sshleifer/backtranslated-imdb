This film answers the question, how does the relationship survive when your partner is ignorant, connected, poor, jealous and has more power and power than those of the dying women? <br /> <br /> Without damaging the movie, I can assure you safe does not, but there is great pleasure to be on the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as a great scientific striker, a girl girl, known by the name of G-Girl, who is not different from most in her sister, not * always * dedicated to the truth, right, and American way. Thurman is also believed as a completely daft, but somehow still looking for, find Jenny. When he is ignored by a small but emotionally secure and well-adjusted, G-Girl goes to the ballistic, and what follows is not good. It's funny, but it's not good. It is a wonderful column, the spirit is not angry like the high heroine, and those involved do not get it, but it has time, and I think I will get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I loved this film.
