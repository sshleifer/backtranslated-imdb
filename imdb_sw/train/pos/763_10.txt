This movie changed all of me ... I heard about breaking and hiphop, but I've never done it professionally (she was a 11-year-old child from the Netherlands!) When I saw this film, all this has been changed. I was actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, started breaking and writing lyrics. To date, I still feel that this film is a personal favorite. Indeed, the importance and images of "movies" cannot be important. But who cares if the shooting was badly done or could you see a mic on the top of someone? What makes you personally that counts ...
