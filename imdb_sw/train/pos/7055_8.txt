Although Cinderella is not an obvious option for another order I love Jaq and Gus so I didn't have any hesitation. The kind of mouse to write a book to Cinderella was one of the leading. I enjoy writing my own stories and I hope children will be encouraged by this. The three stories are beautiful and exciting, although songs remembered. Jaq and Gus were my characters but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, Chorus Panya and all others. Pom Pom made a perfect friend for Lucifer and I loved Dear. One end done for the right to change. My rating 8/10.
