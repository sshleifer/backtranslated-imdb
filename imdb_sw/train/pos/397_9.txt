I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not over a man with a strong style of film. Chinese photographs can be easy to submit to viewers, the director tried to retrieve the fantasy of the Zu Mountain fantasy and this was shown. The new Zu new has been changed from 1983. From the new millenium update, we can see the vision of Tsui Hark of the Zu Mountains. Shapes of fantastic knives, an amazing epic of wonderful fantastic made very well. I got glued through the whole picture. Very big and very good acting. It's really a fun movie to watch, but it's also amazing? Now the bottom side is people who will be confused with a broader line of information is briefed on the 95-minute movie. understand the characters themselves. Others may complain there is a very strong fight, with the characters who have the usual ability to defeat the enemy, the spirit to fight in hand by hand cannot be completely meaningful. I appreciated this beautiful stylish picture. It can be a narrative story, but hey look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide," we got confused with conspiracy too, but it was really a stylish and amazing thing. Tsui Hark attracts everything in H.K. Cin√©ma. US viewers, may have some difficulty to understand when watching this film, resulting in this is not Tiger Crouching, Hidden Dragon, this is a new new form. Although it can not be a hub, but it is a special effect is better than the Fighters. This is worth checking out.
