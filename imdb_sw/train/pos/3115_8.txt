First of all, speaking like no fan of that kind, "Ultimatum of Bourne" is a breathing, of virtuoso, of a very popular film work. <br /> <br /> Second, it is malarky of the pride of modern heroes. br /> <br /> Third, this film takes a tough action, important, about crime fighters turning to criminals themselves. There is no reference to Abu Ghraib or the Institute of Internal Execution on the constitutional rights, no mandatory. So, recently in the "Bourne" series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (2004 "Great Bourne" and "Union 93" last year, it is a great achievement, perhaps done but not reduced by large quantities and surplus of non-inevitable types of forms. /> <br /> "Breathing" above means that it is an interesting example and a sense of physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first chapter, the viewer looks with his breath, insisting back against the chair by power of failure, globe-trotting, a stressed stance. after a few minutes. ”/> <br /> Oliver Wood - your film is doing better on Tony Gilroy's screens from the 1990 novel Robert Ludlum (which is not good for" Bourne Identity, "written ten years) early. Matt Damon was mo again the inevitable, incurable Bourne, the characters of the fantasy of the CIA, this time taking the whole organization in search of its identity, its past history and an organization of a wonderful organization that has made him a machine of murder. Nothing like his romantic warrior Edward R. Murrow, the striker David Strathairn is the chief executive officer, fought against Bourne trying to conceal the illegal "take-no-prison" policies and procedures. Joan Allen seems to be a good cop against Bad One Strathairn. And, there is Julia Stiles as a re-agent to return to Bourne aid; The mixture of Greengrass's and Stiles behavior makes a surprising effect on the quiet behavior, its lack of communication and empty expression attracts more than the miles of discussion. It is a "Bourne Ultimatum" that goes away from a man-against-the-world bit, while this is introduced to extra fraud, as Bourne causes geographical barriers, time, gravity ... physics in general. (Can you fly back with a car from the top of the building? Why not - it seems to be good.) <br /> <br /> All this "magic of the real world" - jump from country to country for a second, to arrive somewhere unknown as, when, and how required - out of special effects with a superhero cartoon improbabilities. And yet, the only pedal non-capable can allow "reality" to interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of fantasy Bourne.
