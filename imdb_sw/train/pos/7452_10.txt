I am a great fan Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It is interesting, romantic, and classic. I recommend this for all ages. It is good for young children because it is good, Cinderella and good for adults and boy because it's funny and not up. I watched it when I was young and still looking at now. It has many lines that my family and I say every time. Acting is good and not available. If you would like stories and romance stories you would like this. I have watched many Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best of all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this film and is shown Faerie Tale Theater all. They all reject it for years and are all unique and very happy.
