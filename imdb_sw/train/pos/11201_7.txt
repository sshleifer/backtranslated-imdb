The new thing of the first effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the original pictures written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows the structure of an amazing story. He faces a pocket match game where the "Century One" field is lost to the opponent from the audience who happens to be a professional winner. The film slows down to develop characters and set up a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and a professional striker. Other parts of the film are being built fast for rematch between two men, this time for heavy crowns. Even in this original film, Hitchcock shows its talent for an effective film and prop. The vaccine is bought for the girl and the striker keeps running in the movie as a sign of his loyalty. The only major event of this film is that the art of publishing a match match has not been completed in 1927. The final match, as a result, ends up to a small amount. Story, however, is what carries this film through.
