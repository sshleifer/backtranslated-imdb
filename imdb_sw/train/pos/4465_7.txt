ANCHORS AWEIGH is the MGM's music entertainment which fans of this kind will enjoy but I can't do it above with scholars like SINGIN IN RAIN or BAND WAGON. This was the first of three music which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra seemed together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, the two maritime at Hollywood to think of the young Dean Stockwell who enters her aunt's best friend (Kathryn Grayson) who is working harder who works as an extra MGM. Although both were attracted to Grayson, they finally love Joe's voice but Clarence later speaks to the waitress (Pamela Britton), who is learning from the city of Brooklyn. The best way to leave the paper leaves a number of mobile phones including "We Hate to Leave", Joe and Clarence mourn to the sea while they leave the ship; Grayson's drawing of "Jalousie"; The Sinatra Light of the dream "I Fall In Love Too Easily" (the number that is sadly deleted from some of the films of this film), and "Words of Concern", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with Jerry of Jerry's life Mouse from Tom and Jerry. Kelly also does a kind of Kissing Ambassador for Kissing that defeats his Pirate Ballet in the future. Kelly is on the form here, in a consistent and powerful performance that made her Oscar only the selection of Best Actor and Sinatra's love disgrace character here is definitely sexy. Diversion entertainment for fans of MGM music factory.
