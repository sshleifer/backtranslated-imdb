I believe I received this film when I was a young boy. I remembered to look at them as a child, but I can't find the film. I remembered good Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, Mjanja, King Koo Koo. I looked up and down to this movie and still no luck. But one day when I was leaving my house I had found it. We met again. I am 17 years old now. I'm still watching. All the time really. It is one of the funniest movies and touch I have seen and enjoy at the same time. And I personally think I should do good. Mmm, that's the truth. Now I am thinking about getting airline officers tattooed somewhere on my body!
