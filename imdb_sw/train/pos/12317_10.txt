The comedy title, the center of fear, the hub of love, if anything is not about the Chinese Story of the Spirit, may be that special effects appear to be compared to modern technology. Film has a simple Cluster: a small debt collector should stay in a secret area when trying to collect debt. Of course, it happens to be haunted too. I did not expect the first time I saw this film that is one of the most loving stories I have ever seen; which does not lose any of the slapstick comedy which will have you in stitches. Unlike other Asian films, Chinese Ghost stories are not difficult to swallow for those who do not know in Chinese culture. In fact, it plays on a non-time, non-cultural and balanced culture. Think of the evil dead 2, if they were going to strike a wonderful story in the mix. This film is realistic, despite being ignored by many. It's absolutely the best I've ever seen. It is the ability to combine the best aspects of the variety, and cross the cultural boundaries to appeal to humanity everywhere, not something extraordinary. It is highly recommended, 10/10.
