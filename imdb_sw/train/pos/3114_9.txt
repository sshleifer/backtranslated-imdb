I will continue to emphasize briefly that it is not any trap for you. This movie is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with true happiness. The events of the fight are amazing, follow-up events are very surprising, and it may go so fast that it just seems to slow down towards the end when things are explained, but that's because everything went before. Damon shines and has actually proved a very heavy actor, begging not to believe in this role. He is this responsibility. A welcome welcome to David's Straithrain series (hope was interpreted to be right) as a CIA agent to kill Bourne. This is not to stop and will leave you on the edge of your seat in many ways. Other things towards the end are just a surprise of pride, so they ignore the 10 level. The end is left open to sequels and I am sure hope that they will consider doing more, for there is no worse. Very good film in all with an amazing end to the amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. Cam's shaky didn't hurt any of the action, but I still think we can do without it. The good news is, you only see when people are talking and not too much.
