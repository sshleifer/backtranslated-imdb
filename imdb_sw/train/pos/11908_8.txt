This film plays well with the audience. Especially after the start. Plus, Trevor Howard and his smart, prudent and Jean Simmons and his innocent conduct and blowing eyes are hard together. The movie begins as a psychological game but after the murder it faces a desire to follow as the second head leading to the border. Others may think of expulsion is bad but actually dismissing it is important because it helps in eliminating the thoughts of Jean Simmons' behavior by expelling the crumbling household, as well as helping out a real killer - who suddenly emerges that they have to finish the job. The killer believed that Simmons' behavior would soon be taken away. And it is true that his lack of control in the house - with evidence explaining his way - there is no way he could get out of charge of murder. The expulsion that comes out helps to bring the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining film. Find out if you can find.
