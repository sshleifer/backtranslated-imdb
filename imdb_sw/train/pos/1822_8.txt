An unforgettable masterpiece from the Creator of the Mystery of the Nimh and Land Before Time, this was a very touching cartoon. I remember this very well since my childhood, it was amazing and sad and very beautiful. Well begins a little dark, a pound dog, and is killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven, and returns. But it becomes sweet when a friend of an orphan who can talk to animals. Other events were horrible to the other cartoons, like Charlie's dream, but everything else was the same, and the songs were the same. The memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love the guy, hehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws Revenge, God can rest his soul, poor girl, he deserves to die, but he is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. In general this is a very good animation movie, Don Bluth's ordinary enough to keep anime and Disney being shy. It is recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have an original video of this, you will get a movie after, Dom DeLuise has important and specific messages, the love of this person, a laugh.
