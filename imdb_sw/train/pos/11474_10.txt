This movie is one for years. First, I must say after seeing this once, it became one of all my favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (author, director) has put together a piece of true art. Where 99.9% of the cinema these days are real entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us the truth, gives us the learning tools to know why this happened. The most common media around the fingers but Ben Coccio is looking at the school's face blow, he can go where no other media has never gone before, into the minds and hearts of the two young people who plan to kill their classmates. While it's certainly clear and terrible, it is impossible to be so? There are exceptions, the lies and coins of our media masters are beaten aside and we are taken to where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just enough ferry like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hate and isolation is more, it's more people, we are shown that these boys are us and us. The Society has left behind and the result is terrible and true. Respect and love your partner. All of us should learn, thank you very much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope for a great expectation that you will continue your work of making a film.
