Why this film has all but lost in the watch is absolutely crime. "Conan" is probably the best of Sword and Magic. Brutal violence, good character designs, and good pacing, do this one of the best fantasies around. In fact it is the largest movie with animation aimed at more adult audiences I've ever seen. This is not the same as the standard of Bakshi. It is a complete departure of Bakshi, and in my opinion it is the best work. I hope that this film gets to be recognized.
