You saw this film on the DVD yesterday and was beaten and beaten. DDL's unpaid work just hit my mind, and I was surprised and thrown out with its good acting. All of these were true to me, I took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go see it! You will visit your heart, but you will see amazing catharsis! Besides, it teaches you one important lesson: The decision is everything. You can be sick in the poor neighborhoods of Dublin, but when you have enough head you will have any problems. If you can only run your left foot you still have to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to pursue compassion. It will not find you anywhere with the only person who will feel the grief you will be yourself.
