In the same tune as his American America With Mohawk, John Ford takes the American history in a way that is still false. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films during this period with Ford and all three are about some time and somewhere with an emphasis on the environment and cultural environment. In Mohawk, the American pioneers are in full bloom and Americans do themselves against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us the 19th century; when innovation and creativity began to shine and this nation was really great. Among all this was a long, lanky, a lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln and this film includes her life as a lawyer, reflecting on what she will accomplish. Fonda is good in this film, catching the essence of what is considered to be a Lincoln persona, although nobody knows exactly what he was at that time. Setup and support are used well and provide a unique balance in the Ford image of American dream and many of its forms. This is not a film that is considered real but rather an example, showing that Lincoln was burning fire in events in his life that would have to create his inheritance. We even get scenes between him and Mary Tod younger; and it's hard to see how they finished together but not sure. I believe this is just a tax for the size of Lincoln, very much regarded as the US president. His calm and direct behavior was not normal and would have been today. Indeed, our government needs many people like him.
