The movie is quite silly. <br /> <br /> But do you expect a high-tech video on the comic called Slam Dunk? True? Jay Chou's work is not something that I have ever seen, but I really enjoyed the movie. It was almost amazing that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, it is not true. Was it a lot of entertainment if you just take on the value of the face? Absolutely. It is a movie about some of the Chinese eye pictures and musicians who can play basketball at the wrong level of skill. There is a bad dad of the Triad style and wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. Love of love. It is a formulaic but in fact, has stopped the unbelief for a while. Come. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What? What do you think you have joined? Are you happy if you look at it - I have found some copies and other Engrish titles that made the film next to an incomprehensible conversation, but we are very happy. They would seem to be very standing on Jerusalem and number 1, 10. <br /> I laughed, I cried, and threw it. I'd like to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for the area to fight on the bar. Well good and beaten well. I really enjoy plexiglass lit pool table - I'd like to play on one of those. Sick enough for me, but I dig in the trash movies.
