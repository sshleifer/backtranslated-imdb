I watched the first series quickly, but I wondered if I would come back again after a long break from them. However, I realized in one part of Series 2 and paid again. This is very good as well; The ground breaks as Mission: It is not possible after the 1960s. The characters are good, and it expands as the series goes on, they change as they solve - more easily than others - with their new environment, but they are cleverly staying with strict behavior, and still more possible to be compassionate to someone who would not have thought you would feel sad, when something that really breaks them does. I hope there will be many years of 'Lost' to expect - and I don't remember quite a lot of things if I've never found the answers to all the secrets!
