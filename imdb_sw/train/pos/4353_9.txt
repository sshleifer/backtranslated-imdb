So we were happy to see this amazing film at the Palm Springs Film Festival. After entering the playground we were given a small credit card that could be used for our personal film rating. Look at the cards I have turned to my wife and say, "How many movies in your life do you think you can measure as very good? It's just about 5." But then look at the partnership between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser when looking at a spectacular environment in the film's landscape in New York, I slowly started bumping the movie to the community at the same time. It was really good but a very repoire of the characters and the performance of winning awards and someone who unfortunately could be remembered by the rainy weather wearing a detective rather than this film, the movie jumped to a higher level. At the end of the film there was a few dry eyes in the house and my common heart was full of melt like Grinch and I ended up giving this superb. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or dirt but a powerful language.
