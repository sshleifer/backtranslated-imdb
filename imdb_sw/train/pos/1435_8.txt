I appreciate the movies like this: smart and well-crafted, entertainment, absorbing, well-acted and with the aim of being directed. No - even Pacino - is chewing the environment *, trying to stand up; One part of the most effective film (Aielo connecting on his loved one away) is increasingly precisely because of its prevention. It is not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is the same fabric: engaging with the eye, ear, and heart. Why the good entertainment that was hit at the box office is any one of the people. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino doesn't look at a particular location, but correctly because it is needed. Great conditions, too.
