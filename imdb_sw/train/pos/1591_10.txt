My mother and I were soon disappointed with this show, we throw our facilities! I have only seen about 10 sessions, and I am disappointed that I did not listen to this series of pre-deleted articles! The story line is so amazing, characters have many titles (or, not great, but it's still funny!). I TiVO every part of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, with all the excluded, never give us tired when looking! There is an inappropriate language for children and other sexual content, but with the guidance of parents around, they should not have many problems. There is some kind of 'friends' relationship you are attracting to me on this show. I am very happy.
