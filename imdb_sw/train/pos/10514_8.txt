Emma is an evil film based on the traditional novel of Jane Austens. I did not read the book in fact I did not know a lot about the plot, and yet I predicted almost a whole plot. There were also many incidents that bothered me because of bad writing or leading. The film is for some reason of entertainment and I liked it. Of course there were all the events that I didn't like but many did well and they were so interesting. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of his best displays as a heroine in Emma. The film is also a star Toni Collette (Who has the same but it has been better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who has also been better but still very good here) Alan Cumming (Who I have never been very interested in and very similar here) and Jeremy Northam (Who's working is instead of wood for first look but for a trick, even if that was not needed) There has been a better revision of Jane Austen's books but this is still an entertaining and worthwhile look.
