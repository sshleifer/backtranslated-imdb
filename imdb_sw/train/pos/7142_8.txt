Holes, original novel by Louis Sachar, succeeded to be transformed into a recreational and well-made film. He played with Sigourney Weaver as a supervisor, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the tasks were well beaten, and actors were shown their responsibilities well. The movie had stories of local stories that led to the end. The main story is about Yelnats of Stanley and his punishment to spend a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This program deals with racism and is the most comprehensive story of the movie. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which describes the curse of 100 years in the family of Yelnats. In my opinion, these stories are broken together very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, I think you don't need to read a book to understand the movie. Movies are easy to understand. acting in the film had done well, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (administrator), and Jon Voight (Mr Mr.). Other members of the D-tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), the cotton of Byron (Armpit), and Brenden Jefferson (X-ray), added films. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a big team together. Though Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with major issues such as racism, shooting, and abuse. The film film in a certain place has been done well. I would like to persuade this film to people of all ages, who have read a book or not. You should lose.
