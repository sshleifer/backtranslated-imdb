Poor Basil Rathbone, a proud composer who has lost his muse. He has been pretending for some time, buying his lyrics and his music from different sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin's words) happen to meet and fall in love. And then they find out what they did. Problems are required, but they are all in the end. Crosby and Martin are singing too much. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time twice on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. Because I don't understand, the film viewers did not take, so he returned to Broadway and made one Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times played comedy did very well. His ego continues to be deflated by sidekick Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they did not make the film more together. As in most Crosby cars of Paramount, there is no large quantity of production, but I agree with the original auditor about the tune of the head of an impromptu jam session in the pawn shop. Good work with all. <br /> <br /> The amazing original plot and great entertainment.
