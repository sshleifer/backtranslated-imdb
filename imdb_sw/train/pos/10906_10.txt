I have a two-year-old child who has difficulty with the same situation as Jonny Kennedy. I've never had a chance to meet him but I've never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how this program helped his colleagues to raise awareness of this bad situation. This person has touched people in ways that the million pamphlets could not. I believe that this should have a mandatory investigation at school. I also agree with other comments - what have I got to cry on? He took everything that life could throw him and still managed to preserve the sense of humor. God bless you. I could not look at the place that showed that his clothes have been changed. I have enough trouble for my child.
