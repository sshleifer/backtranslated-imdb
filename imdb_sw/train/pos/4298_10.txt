This movie thanked me so much I could look once a year. Sometimes I find it unacceptable. Sometimes I get empowered. And I always get characters and true. It is a movie that shows the reality of LA's life, starting with regular helicopters of the helicopter lights for incidents that are close to the normal life being done by the characters. It is also a movie that shows how the hospitality of a stranger can change your life and enable you to make a difference. Grand Canyon will remind you that every step you take, if you are interested or not, has serious consequences. I have seen this movie being the same in many ways for Robert Altman's Short Term. Both of them had a full list of artists and filmmakers and both movies enabled you to gradually see how characters interact with one another, for better or worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of delivering a message of cooperation, (hope in the face of despair), than the Altman film, though I have seen both of them pleasing in their own way. This film is definitely should see it!
