I read many comments sent here and I can say that many of these posters have serious problems in life. Show this, unlike the most show of the game, it was fun. Mr. Shatner, who bribed at ALL that he did, was no longer hit the show. He is a real humanity shining like a valley where he goes. He enjoys and makes a smile & yes exactly what the show does. Players & questions, all-round style presented only adds to the appeals. And although there is a great deal of money is risky. Pressure (stress) that exists in many game displays does not exist here. Several people who sent a message complained how long it was lit by the players and selecting questions, & c, if the millionaire did not haveters at that time. All I can say is that many of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have FUN & fun. There is something for everyone. Issues of testing your knowledge, eye candy (players), doubtful, Mr. Shatner's very extraordinary filled with fun ... well if that does not perk-up guys up then I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, you can get the benefits! I miss miss show. Among ALL games show that it has ever been high, and become quite clear, I HATE game suggests, this is what I liked so much and I missed it all. Just another show of what I liked was a match game.
