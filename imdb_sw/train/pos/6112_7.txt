It is the very first of the chickens, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This film has an extraordinary screens of screens, I don't think any wire is used or if they weren't flat out of the open. It's not a very complicated movie so it's easy on the brain, there is no need to analyze anything in order to get a deep sense, very simple, good chemistry between the direction, and the enjoyable look. I would like if they made the full potential of girls seems only once because they could be very strange, but in the movie they put it under the most important type of pretty. I would like to watch it again ... and the girl.
