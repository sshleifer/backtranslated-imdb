Eddie Murphy Delirious is the most funniest thing you ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I volunteer you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 mins., And all the while, there was a short time when I didn't laugh. You will laugh for hours after the expiration, restore the punch lines regularly with your head. Eddie Murphy has made a lot of interesting performances on his work (48 Hrs, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, Professor Nutty, Shrek, etc.), But this is off his great time of HARIAL. I've seen this film often, and it's funnier every time. It never loses. From this day forward, every great performance stand will be removed from Delirious. ***** with two thumbs on!
