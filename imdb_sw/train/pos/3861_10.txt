WORD 2: The Academy Award. Nuff said. This film had everything in it. Wishing to make me laugh, Drama to stay with me one of the biggest drums of rival for Breakin 2: Boogaloo of Electricity. Acting was the top tip of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in the top form since the appearance of his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His line was done with the accuracy of gold and the last skill was seen in Jimmy Walker very little. I thought I saw the second emergence of Denzel Washington during the line "My Bus !! It's .... Going" That was sure to turn to the movie. My grandmother loved sooo that I bought him a DVD and recommended to his friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see white Tony Donato and African American trust Nathan Davis. Through thick (laid out on a knife) and thin (Nathan drives Tony's tips on women) a new duo power has come and it's out to win Hollywood.
