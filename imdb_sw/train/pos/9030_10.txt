This film has taken it with amazement. My friend told me that this film was "flick flick." Boy, he was wrong! This film has a great family appeal, without sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job in Homer Hickam shoes. Support support is great, too. <br /> <br /> Science, coming to age, family quarrels, a major train area ... This movie has all. The sound is good, although the marks are completely presented. The 50s music beat the movie on the maximum size. The DVD is quite suitable for testing for coal. Restore the value is good - I've seen quite a bit ready.
