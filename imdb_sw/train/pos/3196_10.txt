This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes a very sad text and allows it to be an important social definition. Groovin 'Gary is a small village child who (he thinks) is very interested in his many divisions. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local show of talent (who is very passionate), Gary's actions suggest that he is against the conservative social environment that he lives. This makes him perform various certificates for his actions so that people don't think he is a savior or other social exclusion. In the second phase, Harris uses the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to provide information from the original document. The third and final phase for trilogy is truly amazing for the great sensitivity of Harris and the subject. Unlike the second phase, "Little Kidogo" shows Gary as a real character. He struggles to gain acceptance within his community without any benefit. His secret desire to wear as Olivia Newton John removes even more from people who already see him as a social pastor. The film is shown effectively that, as a fact, it happens with many effects. Indeed, one can see Gary as a pleasant character, but he can also recognize him as a player.
