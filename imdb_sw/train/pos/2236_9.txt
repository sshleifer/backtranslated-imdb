What I remember most about this film is that it used the air on the local KTLA TV (Less than 5) during the Christmas season during the mid-70's, especially due to the fact that the true story occurred or near Christmas. It was always a problem to see a hell that this girl is going to, the only savior of a plane crash in Peru. An example of this girl's boyfriend that unites her infected foot made sense to this little viewer. It's not the kind of fun Christmas I was seeing at that time. Certainly not the production of Rankin-Bass.
