This is the language in the movie cheek from the very beginning and the sound-top that enjoys everything French and then offers a naif hero but very brave in Fanfan La Tulipe. It is shown by a good-looking Gerard Philippe, a young man who believes in the last situation that Lollobrigida predicts - especially that he will give King Louis XV! The problem is, La Lollo recently knows he also likes and Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Played by good fighting swords, foot tanks, and other film works goes faster and with more comic time . The trend is perhaps the weakest element but the film is lighter and takes itself so it is not-focused that I did not give the shortcomings of the second thought. Beware of Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavyweight in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, pretending to be a trouble, and feeding them a script for a lucky guide that reads the hand of La Lollo! And what? Gem Marcel Herrand is like king Louis XV proposed by megalomanous and disappointed! That is not all: Most beautiful women in one film make me love in France and on the renovation in 1952! The film can happen in that year but its spelling, cheek, good description, inappropriate and memorable pictures Gerard Philippe make sure it remains modern and fun to enjoy. I don't want to propose to my grandchildren alone to anyone who loves movies in general and especially swashbucklers! See it!
