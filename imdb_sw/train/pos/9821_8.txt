I saw this film on true movies (which made me directly and doubtful) but in fact - it was good. Why? It is not because of surprising behavior or breathing conversation (which is little) but in fact, despite what people say I thought the film was right in the direction of young people involved with pregnancy. Creek Dawson, they are not good, good characters characters who go through sex with non-brave skills. They are children and they act like children would like. <br /> <br /> They are clear, angry and frustrated with everything. Yes, this may be accidentally and can only be evil actors but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when it doesn't try to be cool) very faithful performance and I love him for it. Patricia Arquette is whiny and angry, but was pregnant and young? A combination of two is not exactly lavender on your river. What was the plan possible and so what? I believed them, his difficulty and the inability to cope - his bravery, but still an improper attempt to bring them closer. I think the characters, made by anyone else, could be bitter and unbelieving but they didn't. It shows the condition of the condition they have, that they sit in the class and she walks in college with the child. I was angry with him, and I was angry with him for being such a child and blaming him. I felt all. The last, I liked it and would suggest it. See the area where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disaster counseling session - the performance of the work.
