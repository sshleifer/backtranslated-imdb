"Ko for tamo peva" is one of the best movies I have seen. Surprised by the great impact on the fate of humanity shown by the eyes of the most visible and ordinary people from the Serbian state before the start of World War II. I saw it in a small movie cinema in Russia where the film had very little distribution, and I had no opportunity to do it since then. It is a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. I searched for VHS or DVDs often, and alas - he couldn't find. I would like to be very grateful for the other fans of this small gem decision-making film for a suggestion of buying copies.
