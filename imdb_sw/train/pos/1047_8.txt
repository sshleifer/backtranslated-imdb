It may be (or should not) be considered that the only reason I watched this movie was first because I wanted to see the performance of a man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (role 10/10 best Oscar player. He did a good job and deserved to be chosen, at least.) Yes, I am glad I watched this movie, because I was very happy. I was especially excited about Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (certainly selected for Oscar), Bette Davis (badly selected), George Coulouris and, oddly, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child. an odd teen who speaks like some kind of philosophy. He just pulls me. Even the name of the characters (Bodo) is awesome. <br /> <br /> Last g, which Lukas's character he had to do something that he thought was wrong even though he was doing all the right reasons, he worked for me too. I agreed with why she felt that she had what she did, and I understood why she couldn't explain it completely. This film makes it beautiful and beautiful, the landscape (the meaning of the house) is good, and acting is the best. Watch this film if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
