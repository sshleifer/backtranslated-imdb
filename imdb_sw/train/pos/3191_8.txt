Director Edward Sedgwick, the former arm of the visual comedy, effectively guides this Hal Roach road show which provides a fast-moving and adroit environment with excellent casting, using a large number of reliable Roach performers. Although the film was designed as a Patsy Kelly car, the stars of the sun Jack Haley as Joe Jenkins, a Kansani boy who sells his repair business and travels to Hollywood, where he tries to create a screen for a girl who loves, star-Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence) ). Sedgwick, who wants to use all the MGM studios as set, does here as Cecilia, always ready for inspection, treated by the order that will be, the movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), behind the stage of normal events, comedy music, with the head of the Broadway head of Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offers several enjoyable interludes, including their special skit involving small harmonica, and we look at the beautiful turns like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. Equally, one must give the residue to Mischa Auer, who turns out the image as the emotional star of the film, a role that he builds in a large way, and for his director of fasting to Busby Berkeley's film displays.
