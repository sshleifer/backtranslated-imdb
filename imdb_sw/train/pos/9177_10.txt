I tell you that this miniseries was the best translation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Dalton and Clarke are all trusted as Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but no comparison with this. More beautiful for me. I can never imagine anyone playing these characters ever again. The last time I saw this was in 1984 when I was 13 years old. At the time, I was a book book and I have been reading the story of Charlotte Bronte. I was very interested in this miniseries and I remember not having any incidents. I would like to see it again because it is so beautiful. : -) \ t
