"The thief in the night" is a film that is generally not hated by the film fans largely due to its low budget (which was obvious) and its image - the uplifting of the true Christian church and the destiny of those left behind. However, it was a fascinating story that had an observer and certainly did review their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but he did not believe, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film, with its "Far Away," feature must see movies. Even with the new "Left" series, telling stories similar to the largest budget, the effect is still the same - "The thief in the night" broke the form of this type and will remember every time.
