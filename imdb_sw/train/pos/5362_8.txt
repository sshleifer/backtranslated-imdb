WORKER, with TOTAL RECALL, is my famous Schwarzenegger movie. No, this is not 2001, but it does not mean to be. And acting with the script here is not available even with other Arnie displays as PREDATOR or MLINZI. But I present that IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever hit a great hit. The government-funded game showers of criminals from a massive crime compete against armed stalkers and all kinds of weapons (refugees do not have equipment) to satisfy the public's desire for sports and blood. Great prize for winning win: freedom. Or so the laws demand. <br /> <br /> For films such as about death and particles of the same one, it really doesn't have much to say. Another person said all the commentary on the culture / government presented in this film, so I won't go in here. It should say that if you look beyond the feel of the movie secrets, you will be very happy (especially if you're a big fan of SF and many ideas). As I have said, it does not seem to be a great film of art, but it's amazing left to flick of the 80s-em-up. The column has been borrowed from Richard Bachman (called King King) a short novel, but describes it very strongly from its material, especially towards the end. (The book ends up in a scientific way, without saying that this film is not suitable.) I enjoyed both, but I love the best movie. My favorite line: "I think it's caused from steroids."
