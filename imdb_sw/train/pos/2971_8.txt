I found this movie very interesting, I loved how it was done in modern sports politics. This movie is not suitable as South Park but it is very good. And since I am a fan of games I liked how they did some of the most stupid things in sports. This film is good for non-sports lovers, perhaps it is best for them to go through life to ask why people follow games to fast if there are many false rules and games problems and the fact that they mean anything. I also found a real game that came and became interesting, kind of like a horse and bases and out of the psyche (for someone who shot). In general I strongly recommend this movie, and believe that you end up loving this movie. However if this style of comedy is not favorite you probably don't like it. (but that's any movie comedy)
