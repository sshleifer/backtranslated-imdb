1958. The small town of Southern Clarksburg. Poor Pastor Roy Childress (Vic Morrow on top of the climax) breaks down hard on the speed by forcing criminals from the rock to their dangerous deaths through road accidents. Childress meets with her match when a good driver of a hot stick Michael McCord (a beautiful soft picture of a conveyor and Martin Sheen) shows in the city in his car hold for a special purpose to take revenge on his brother's death (Sheen's real-life) sibling Joe Estevez for a short time came. Director Richard T. Heffron, who works from an interesting and exciting documentation by Richard Compton (a man who led a 70-car in the film "Nearly, Boys' Heroes and" Macon County Street "), tells the story of A fascinating speed, creates a good period of delicious taste of 50, and ably pastors are standing out of a bright game of wit and love between Childress and McCord. Casting a good array helps a lot: Sheen shines a sharp shock James Deanesque of the leading leader, Morrow makes more of his worst parts of the animal, as well as the best displays of Michelle Phillips as a maggie food servant, Stuart Margolin as a deputy of folksy, Nick Nolte as a servant of a friendly gas station Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as a younger brother of Buzz Lyle, Janit Baldwin as a sassy local Sissy, Britt Leach as an impressive driver of Johnny's car, and Frederic Downs as a judge of JA Hooker. The struggle of carts between Childress and McCord is a real hitting-pounding white-knuckle throwing doozy. The image of Terry K. Meade, well-loved characters (for example, Childress emerged after his wife and son were killed in a tragic and run-off event), a groovy, planned by Luchi De Jesus and a beautiful scenery of the whole mountain adds The most general sound of the winner's voice for the TV.
