This movie is why I've got this site. I couldn't find this film anywhere! I'm so happy we got it here! We have seen it on TV before and we wished to find it and buy it and have several friends who would like to buy. One post said it was boring, although I must say it is not. Especially if you're a horseman, you will love this movie. The horse is awesome, well taught and the movie has done well. It is certainly we will be purchasing our DVD home library. We will be suggesting to our friends. The bond between man and horse in this film was stimulating and made you want to spend more time with your horse. Surely this is a movie that we will look at several times.
