This is one of Dev Anand's movies which has given a great but different movies to Indian film industries such as an eye thief and manual. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple - the brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister joined with hippies who smoke and chant Hare Rama in Krishna. However, the film shows a few events that the world has found in 70 years. They have been fully addressed. Zeenat gave the best and Dev as usual was amazing. Well-used songs (different from those used for songs) in this film. They are not destroyed. One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam and karo'. Every word in the song is a philosophical and very useful. The end is sad but that is not the foundation of the film. In general Devji who believes in making different movies has succeeded to show what he wanted to show here. You must see the experience of hippie and good Nepal 70.
