Many people who are unfair shs on this series but several video of the guinea pigs are entertaining. The devil's attempt in particular has a devastating effect on the work - not only the eye of the eye-sighted but also the piece of genuine leather on the foot and the hand breaking and the sledgehammer is very realistic - especially for video and low yields. budget. I would like to start at the beginning now for those who do not know: this film is a "scary" / fake film that emerged in the mid-80s. It is a plot if it stands easy: a little girl is used by a few people and forced to go through a series of brutal torture. to see where the breaking of it is. This involves brutal brutality - all of the most effective effects that include those mentioned in the last paragraph as well as the use of hot fat burns by the hand of the captive girl and putting the wounds in the next flaky wound. The small efficiency process is the start of the video and includes a non-motivating session where three men turn to beat out of the girl with his head falling and the second sequence where the three men run to chase the girl and run down. These two events are definitely set to prevent the authenticity of all cases. Those who are affected by "experiments" are very interesting with pain and take a large amount of abuse and bad things on the camera. His ears have heads of head with his head and a loud noise being played for the last irritating hours. Some of the other abuses he takes are connected to the net from the tree once it is given rest. There is also a disturbing area in which the fighters who refuse by refusing and another disgusting place that are beaten in the office seat are forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until he gets. If you haven't seen this series I hope I've helped you decide if you want to give this shot or not. 8.5 / 10 for the devil's attempt.
