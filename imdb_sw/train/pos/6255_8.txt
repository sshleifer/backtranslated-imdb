This film shows people in the two days of the most hot in Austria. It shows people to humiliate others and be cruel to others. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. In the survey I attended people were leaving the center because they could no longer watch the film. And so. Because the film is not easy and easy to watch. It has a very simple message and none at any time in the film. It's a very bright movie, not everyone's taste. You can't say happy words from this film. It finds you in your throat and never stops and you just hear the breathing because of its level. <br /> <br /> I can "recommend" or "not recommend" this film. You should make your own mind according to what I said earlier. Just know that this is not an ordinary film and not everyone's taste.
