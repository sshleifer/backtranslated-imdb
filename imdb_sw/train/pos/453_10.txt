I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie without fighting, no sex, and no abuse. One can think of as a "flick end", but I steal there there is one or two people lights out there who love too. Don't invite children, though. This movie is very important. See "April" is a very healing experience. Sound and good way, along with women's good behavior, remembering the peace and beauty of the original Raphaelite painting / It'll do not think that you really look at just one kind of movie, I will send the line I heard once one on "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "The Hunter Deer" and "Enchanted April".
