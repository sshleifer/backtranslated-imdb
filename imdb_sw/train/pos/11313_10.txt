Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a small and beautiful drifter who arrived on the road bar. He meets a beautiful, beautiful and unhappy wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old husband and oil Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), the owners of the bar. She deals with her mechanical skills and some food and lodging, and has a relationship with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, strengthening the car accident. Their relationship is affected by guilt and police investigation. This masterpiece ends in a bad way. The true and neo-true movie of Luchino Visconti is the best. This is the first time I am looking for this version of 'Double Money Postman'. I liked the 1946 edition and Lana Turner, and the 1981 edition, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the most hot sex areas in the history of the movie, but this is the best. My vote is ten.
