Carmen is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's hard to say his performance is best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are very much. It is a good story of life and story; The story goes through everyday life. The drum becomes life and all life is beaten. True people at the same time live their own lives and become another person, making parts of old lovers. Magic goes on.
