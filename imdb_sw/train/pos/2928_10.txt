EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is a film of the funniest stand-up festival that I've ever seen. Most of the work of standing is long, but not these people. For 90 minutes no one time is different. From the time Eddie is affected by Mr. T, the feeling is not going to stop. Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie did not do anything almost as interesting. it is impossible that the person who wrote this amazing show, wrote a film called HARLEM NIGHTS which was not quite surprising. Eddie, if you're out, please come back and make a film festival in the DELIRIOUS vein. Believe me your fans will love you. And I think you know it.
