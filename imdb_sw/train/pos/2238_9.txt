If this film is completely in Swiss language, perhaps it is difficult for many German speakers to follow this film. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for many years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great spoof of the Lord of Rings. I have seen many movies of this type (for example Scary Movie, Scuffs, Scuffs, etc.) but this is the best of that kind, I have seen so far. I give 9 of 10. The only reason I cannot give 10 is, because there are a few details that could be made well and because they do not submit subtitles to any DVD, so there is almost no non-Swiss space to understand.
