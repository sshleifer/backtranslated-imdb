Guns explode, exploded buildings, beat cars, and that's just the first ten minutes. This picture full of action involving a former CIA trader who cannot be seen no matter how often he was shot (so the head) is very good.

Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala, and many "forgotten" actors. There is a small step-by-step process to hold the whole story: Busey relieves the group of "kidnappers" of the US military forces and return to the "supertank" of advanced technology (a common tank and add cheesy-it closed up to the top of the return of the Nations. Does America deserve more than this bad machine? This question is asked, of course, as in any film that focuses on CIA ... but without getting to the preaching.
