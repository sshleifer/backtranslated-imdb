I was completely beaten by the opening of John Cassavetes. It is the first movie of her that I found it seems to be on a large scale, so it feels more than a rule, but it still doesn't feel like she put herself down in her original films. That's probably what makes it so intense. There is also a non-cathartic thing about watching this film. <br /> <br /> It is about what actually Cassavetes has made its main work, the best that has described behind the camera during its work as a director and is here to describe it in front. Rowlands, a middle-level actor of Myrtle Gordon, is not able to step into his production as it is written so he follows follow-up follow-up, leading to what appears to be chaos at the stage, until he gets justice. It's enough inspiration. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that cannot win the innate operation which one goes during emotional cleaning. No one knows why Myrtle has a lot of things that does, and it looks and even is shown as a destructive thing, but it can only be the best thing for it. It can be a cleansing rather than a break. Removal, brother, rebellion, all reaches the destruction. Cassavetes give them his character touch for cruelty, which is that earlier, he is ardently saying that he has nothing similar to his behavior, but he is in a quiet but emotional fear that the opposite is true. The last place, the ethnic activity that Myrtle shares with the very bad behavior from him who is dealing with him, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hitting, shining, and enjoyable moments when I've ever seen movie.
