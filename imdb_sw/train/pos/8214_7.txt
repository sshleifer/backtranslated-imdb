Auditor "Dirty" Harry Callahan again convinces his chief and his way of maverick to the police work. Refusing to take vacation is given a simple case that takes him out of San Francisco. Recently, however, he found a relationship between the recent murders in the city and the murder outside the city, which leads to the way of a murderer. If you interfere with the Dirty Harry franchise, the film begins in a very short time, including the story "Continue, make my day" which Eastwood offers in a wonderful way through the closed teeth before one arrest due to theft. Very badass and it's just what fans can expect from him. However, the film recently transforms cylinders and takes into account the retaliatory revenge. The problem is that this killer is not very surprised if he has such qualities as Harry does. This strictly prohibits from the presence of the main character which governed all its original film displays, pardon pun, Power of Magnum. <br /> <br /> In this bright side the story of a new story shows several parallels to the unorthodox Harry's own way and provides his deep character that was not before, but fans who were looking for another bad Harry outing would be more likely to be some desire. However, the last culminating end of the film with an exciting note so if you do not mind something different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for abuse and rape area
