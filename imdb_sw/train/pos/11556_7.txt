Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began to finish their work together. Remember well as grandchildren of Old Men and Couples Who have said we laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of the most popular Hollywood comedy teams over the last 100 years. It's not like "raunchy" like Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were a classic comedy team that shows the most modern Marx Brothers. Such as the physical comedy and mixed mix of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were famous for. In an unusual marriage, Lemmon and Matthau oppose the full opposition that makes the chaos. Physical comedy is unique as Chaplins. Jokes tend on their own opposite to adopt a joke on another. It's not your usual movie boy, it's by way of the old boy and two old men as opposed to the young teenagers in their prime. Lemmon and Lemma's chemistry are enough entertainment. Although this film is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
