Despite being told from Britain's view this is the best document WW II produced. Released in the digestible (as it might as a war could) episodes as the loud voice of Laurence Olivier connects many of the eyewitnesses who were forced to survive the horrible events of that time. They bravely await his appearance on a DVD in the United Nations. The Europeans had the opportunity to be released on DVD earlier this year.
