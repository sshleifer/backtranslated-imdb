This is my type of film. I am fascinated by fantastic psychological dreams and this movie is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. When I see it as fear / thriller, there will be others who can see it as a big black comedy. But any way, it's an interesting nature to be mad. Finally it touched me, but what an end! It causes a lot of viewer to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, hard and comprehensive plot, a great script filled with fear and burst of humor, and the atmosphere of the atmosphere makes this film look. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think I will need to look at these several times to take and understand all the tricks inside. But it is a film that will be pleased and not a work to do.
