Bagdad's thief is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although my four children are available for this story, the most famous stories of the Arabian Light, come from Disney Corporation, the thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end. Stories go together at a good speed and include a moving or two that have slowed down the forecast. Sabu, who plays with a young thief, Abu, can also tell any of the young actors of today in an appeal, judging from several times when I heard my older daughter say, "She's c-u-t-e!" In 1940, the film won Oscars for movies and special effects. Today, of course, these effects appear on a very date ("Look, it's Barbie avoiding the sky," declared my daughter before the flying genie). However they join the story well. The film, after all, more than 60 years. Effects are relevant to the script. Additionally, what is seen in the Bagdad Thieves remained a state of art for twenty-five years. One only needs to compare the opening montage from the 1967 Star Trek period to see this. Therefore, it was quite successful. <br /> <br /> This fits like a family film, although there are few stabbings near the end. Acting is obvious and these injuries will not have the same blood as these cases as fake as an animation. <br /> <br /> For all, an enjoyable film to look for the evening of clean entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend.
