Wrong script, bad trend, on top displays, previous conversations. What more can you ask? To laugh, it is not available more than this. The work of Zadora with the selected events finds himself doing with hilarious techniques of "Hollywood". Almost as funny as "Tap Tap" even though it was clear not intended as such. Do not miss the first film of Ray Liotta, "It looks like a penis."
