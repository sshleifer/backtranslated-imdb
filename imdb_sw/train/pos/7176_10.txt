Okay - you want to tempt someone for how they have and their youth and the shy and shy change of therin - then get their quick response from looking at this bad doc about children who make social fricks suitable in 80 cities cities. More films whatever I have ever seen, the film deals with sex and greed in a way that is totally human, it never comes, and it has emerged in the form of the natural beauty of nature that is being played by the adult world of fear where any quirk in youth is permissible for anything from apostasy to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to have come to a deeper understanding of his victory and his forgiveness as a little sister of the kid. What he finds in himself and others is not always good - but it shows how one can improve and integrate with age. Change means without meditation. I love this film.
