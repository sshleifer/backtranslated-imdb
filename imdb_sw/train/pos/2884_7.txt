Of all the stories of Princess Princess Disney has set out there, Cinderella may have a permanent appeal. I can't say why, but for some reason, the post-generation generation throws it up to their list. As a little girl, I wanted something more than a Cinderella and a spoon of glass - it was my costume to love. In fact, I don't think there is any story that is more familiar to the desires of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has ever run away from the grip of everyday life and find someone who sees you as no one else has ever? The story is older than English and somehow it continues to be true. <br /> <br /> About the characters, if nothing else, Disney can make a good villain. Lady Tremaine is evil for T, for a wonderful count, not a physical way. His language of cutting and eyes work for him - they do not need light workers to fear fear in your heart. Animals of animals tend to net, especially that idiotic Gus. I would be happy if he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself did not pushover- do some right words of catty sometimes. However, he did not have a car to show him any mercy. In fact, he was beautiful and fed, but what was keeping him there? We don't know. Even if he just became a servant in another house, at least gets paid to have a shot with respect. It seems that the only reason they work at the end of Cindy is that every kind of fall is in its place. He never works for his dreams that sing beautiful. It brings me to music, which is good, as it is. Wooden Ilene has a good, rich rich voice, maybe my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some of the bigger levels have come here - Fantasy is the Heart of Your Heart Do, So This Is Love, Bbb Bobbidi Boo ... Although it lacks the development of a particular character, it gives ordinary criminals a good job. If you feel sick heart, dial will touch you and give you Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Video quotation: <br /> <br /> -Action! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy Birthday!
