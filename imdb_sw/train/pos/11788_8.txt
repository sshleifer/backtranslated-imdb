I really think people are taking the wrong way for this. First of all, I see this short and entertaining film. I just take for what it is. I think the doubts and secrets are skilled in their focus on the player. Another thing that happened my idea is that once you find the viewer involved even though there is no clear story, just thinking and stopping with the emotions provided by the characters that kind of give you a sense that there is a story for all that is going on. No one else could do it better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism for the best. Indeed, I will agree with anyone that people who begin to look at this with a desire to have fun without any real work of thinking from the side of the audience, they will find themselves frustrated. And right. Lynch is not about it. At least this side of Lynch is not. The lost assistant Highway / Mulholland Dr has already considered here and people who expect to be welcomed if they could look at anything else, they will not only have all that. My opinion is that the Dark Room is about talking to your animal's base, your natural self, by giving you the way (pictures, sounds, conditions) that you do normally. It's not about any kind of pleasure, it's about getting the desired answers from you. And, that, my friend, is a fresh art.
