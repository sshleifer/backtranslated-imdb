This is indeed a very good "good", better than the first film of the live film 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all the right cords! Cruella DeVil, who has had the greatest treatment, now likes dogs and very good kind of them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one dog who Cruella tried to kill, does not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (Owner of the Dogs Store 2) believe that he has changed. At the same time, Dipstick, with his partner, has been born with three dalmatian babies! Little Kidogo, Domino and Oddball ... \ t is a good film of family and excitement and lots more! One shortage of this film is that you have a lot of pain slapstick, but not quite as many as the last film. This is also funnier than the last film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Dalmatian 102"! : -) \ t
