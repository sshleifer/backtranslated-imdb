I have seen this film condemned for the statement, "If you can pass the law ..." That lacks the point. Careful attention is in the guardian's conscience, as it was. This is a decent film and a mystery of common murder, but by distorting the difference that occurs in the middle. The resolution leaves the viewer asking, "What would I do in this position?" And I must believe that that's exactly what the film manufacturer is. By the end, with the end of the audience's entertainment, the film succeeds. I also like ways that violence is not in action, but just off the camera. We just know what happened; it is not only served before us, then it is caused by our faces, as it is today with modern blood and clothes. Besides, violence is not meant. The action is the protagonist of ethical values, which is prudent, though disturbing, solved.
