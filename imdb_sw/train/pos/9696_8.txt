I'm not a fan of new movies, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children can look at it together - how odd! Aunt liked too. It had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a parrot to talk. Reminds me of my favorite, wizard of Oz. Hero, Paulie, an intelligent shepherd, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and despair, always remembering his decision to find his friend, Marie. It is highly recommended.
