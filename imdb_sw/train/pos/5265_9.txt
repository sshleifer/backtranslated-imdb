I can remember this look for the first time, when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "foreign brothers". This movie is still good. One of the original elements is that the fighting events are very short. Show that "foreign brothers" where it is so good that they ended up the enemy off quickly! More, you chase, fight the castle, dragon, and yes even the bar! Yes, acting is bad so that's why it's not ten, also the line of the story has received a lot of criticism. I think it's quite natural. Not for most movies in such a variety that have an original story lines, or a color conversation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film.
