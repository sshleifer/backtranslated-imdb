The most memorable, scientific and non-verbal, from one of the true French film scholars, Henri Verneuil has great potential. The plan is the exact parallel of JFK killings, and it happens in a non-explanatory, false world. The film, which looks like wise, wise, is a blur. Precision accuracy, follows Henry Volnay, Procuror who is making himself a repeat of revolution. In many ways, it is a very exciting movie, not accurate for the accuracy of the coolness and the balance of its views on the work called modernization. The atmosphere and all the characters are completely honest, and Verneuil did not leave anything on behalf of the plot. On another level, this very unknown film had only a 15-year-old head of Oliver Stone, who insisted on the film "JFK", a low film in many places, which is a little that will not be trustworthy ... <br / > <br /> It is a masterpiece, any movie partner should see it, preferably in the original French version and subs.
