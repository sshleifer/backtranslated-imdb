In general it was a good movie and the last end; The act was surprising and the characters were not lost from their people. I loved the plot, although you knew what would happen yet it gave you a surprise through the whole movie. However, I see that coming on the end might be long (extended perhaps) - to me it seemed as if it had run away; as the author was trying to take the linens off the lines before the rain fell. For example - What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he's the one who created something around? Who knows! Maybe there will be good? Maybe? If there is. I'm approaching it.
