The question is, do you? The movie can have a really fun movie that "bad"? My husband and I took this to a video shop used for only 99 cents because of the head and the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" on it (Vestron has been widely regarded as a quality mark since I first got the story of the story "Suburbia "and" Class of 1984 "). We did not expect the movie as full to win if this was. Your basic plan as follows: Grange, this goombaesque thumb from the planet Earth, draws a "Moon bank" and is judged by a colony penalty on a distant planet (I don't even remember the name of the planet) for bauxite mine and other minerals. "Governor" of the colony said the mine owner used prisoners to work. Walker, a bounty hunter (it seems to be just one third on the entire planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one trip out of the whole planet and they would have to deal with it. Then there is an unnamed “Colonel”, a reverent pastor who has a bad disgrace. Most of the movie stations near the "futuristic" drive drives (dunebuggies and plywood picked by sides) and galore explosions. The planet itself seems to be guilty as Hemet, CA or one of the many other Inland Kingdom dust. But what makes the movie actually shine is amazing amazing soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands in the middle of 80s. I am very doubtful that this sound of voice had once withstands vinyl, but it is definitely to buy the value of the movie just by sound. I can't even remember the names of the band (they are listed in credit) rather than the Exploding White Mouse, because that's the only one I heard before seeing this movie, but I'm sure to look at them. Basically, movies are not worth spending your time and it would be better to have a 12 beer pack with a few close friends.
