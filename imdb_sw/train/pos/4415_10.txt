Although others may call it "Cinema Cinema Paradiso", the movie is approaching My Green Village, My Memory of the Lost Case. This film should avoid falling into the political trap of taking sides (pro-Castro? Fighting Castro?, Based on the human weaknesses of the perpetrators and the importance of the family.) With a good acting actor, especially from Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who Keitel's wife. For a jewel, filled with references to old movies, from CASABLANCA to CITY LIGHTS CITY, Gael Garcia Bernal has a small role that is important for the big money of the story. (remember the ROOKES?), has a homeless bomb that acts as a Greek chorus, superbly. It is sympathetic that this film, originally named DREAMING OF JULIA, is released in the country for THINKfilm and the head of CUBAN BLOOD, which is not associated with the film .
