DEVIL'S PROBLEM is my second attempt in Joseph Sarno's production - and although I will say it is more fun than the ugly and irregular shape of Sweden WILDCATS, it's still slower and less obvious to my taste. <br /> <br /> This is the closest center of a group of vampire girls who live in a fortress, who want to raise their "leader" previously murdered. To do this, girls should move around with naked and kiss each other and sing good things - and of course drink blood, too. When a doctor and his brother's car decreases and they should stop on the cage for lodging - provides the best bloodbank for horny vampires ... but they can be as unqualified as they seem ... <br /> <br>> A good example of early 70's using sleaze. Shortage of impurities - including the front part, some malignant sores - including chaos and of course, lesbo-bloodsucking ... but these events are still suitable for today's standards. Some of the most attractive women in this, would benefit from the most obvious sex, but I think it can't have it all. It would also have benefited from the violence / bigger, being a vampire film, but I think the purpose of PLAYING DEVIL was more to show skin, not blood. It is still a little slow - and acting in most parts is wood - but that's expected from something from this time to this budget. It should look at fans - others can get a little bit of love for them. 7/10
