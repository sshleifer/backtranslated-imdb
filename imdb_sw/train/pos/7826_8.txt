Filled as the story of Steve Biko - played very well with Denzel Washington, as you would expect - this was the most realistic story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. It was no doubt that it was making Kline as a good actor, and it was amazing surprising in the role. Attenborough gave this kind of direction you would like to expect, and the most interesting events of people were just kind of can cross. What was required of the cast was sufficiently capable and did a good job, in what it reaches as the last sad story of South Africa which is not yet anywhere near the past.
