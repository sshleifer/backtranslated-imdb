See this as a little ignorant punk when it was released first. I had a snifflin 'like a child when I left the theater, try to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again in '07, I knew what to expect & that they were already ready & organized if their required time approached. Thanks this time I was at home. I did not remember from my youthful care - or perhaps you did not see it because it was the technical beauty of this film. The use of waste that describes many stories without using a conversation. The function of the camera cameras set the viewer, along with the characters in the area. Imagine the opening when Joe crosses the road to diner, the cameras behind the woman and the baby sitting on the bench in front, paving the road. The story itself, and the characters - seeds, sad & real real. It is very interesting in the humanitarian game like this and many of us may refuse. Then again, Joe & Ratso can be any of us. We must have been '70 when I saw. I remember that after I left the playground I was attracted to the company of friends. Years later, I am glad I am not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.
