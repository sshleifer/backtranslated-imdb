Well, let's make this clear. I'm not really in sci-fi, but for some reason I like Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through Stargate. A round-up device that builds soil. It gives you the ability to travel to a distant world. It can be seen as your usual sci-fi series, but not! This program is set up today not in the millennium as well as another sci-fi series. I see that it's good. It gives you things, events and things you can focus on, and you can jump on a series at any time without learning the words and names of all the gadgets. They are confident but thanks to O'Neil who likes to put a simple terminology, no many. The series has a good combination of action, humor and game. If you enjoy loads of special effects you can't get here. They do not have too much misuse but a small amount of special effects done well.
