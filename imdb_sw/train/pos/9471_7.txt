Steve Carell plays with Dan Burns, an agony uncle of the newspaper and one dedicated father for three girls. In a large family of Dan separately meets his perfect wife, only to know that he is in relation to his brother. What does a person do? <br /> <br /> I loved much "Dan In True Life", but I would think success or otherwise this flick would be down if you are willing to accept Steve Carell to play a direct part and block, instead of going through a great comedy action which make him very successful. If you can't accept, don't be afraid, "Get Smart" will be shared later later, but with a record I thought he was very good. The “Dan In Real Life” begins like your usual, exciting, family series, but it gets funnier and funnier when it goes along with the frustration of Carell and its status grows. It is not the original massive (but if you see only movies and original ideas, movies were not very easy, were you?), But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and good cast (who can't fall in love at first sight and Juliette Binoche's light? Do more than a script enough script which has a lot to reflect on the meaning and passion of love. I hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and doesn't have something as interesting again.
