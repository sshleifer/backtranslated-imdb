I was very excited to show the main cast. Emma Lung is confident and attractive. The director has created exhibitions where participants are not directly. Hard stories and changing between eras. He also emphasized the core story of cooperatives losing power and the effect of a major employee to install in a small town. I disagree with the views that an older person should be attracted to. There are many relationships with older men and young women - without being a good looking man. The weight of the behavior can be attracted to not inferior. Movies looks good and movies are also good.
