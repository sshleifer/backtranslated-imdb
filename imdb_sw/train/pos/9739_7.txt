I enjoyed watching this film, especially because of Simon Pegg, who soon became a box office hard to draw comedy movies. <br /> <br /> She has been hired from the end of her career to publish London to shoot the great NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges, as the author, for one of her famous rags. When you have paid his payment, he makes it a top echelons of writing a celebrity hackdom ("seven-room"), where he gets a little celebrity himself. The story of the story is very interesting, and Gillian Anderson has put an amazing chance to help as a media agent. <br /> <br /> In the way of success, it gets a real sense of love, etc.. <br /> <br> The plot of the compound aside, the movie was very awesome, especially due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as the love of love. Some of the cast did his work well. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy & well worth looking out in movies.
