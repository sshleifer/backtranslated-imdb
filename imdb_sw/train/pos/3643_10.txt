The end of the era was released here in the States in Spring 2002 and "The Rookie," Disney live video film which appears to be "best for last !!!!!" It happened here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by the area code found on the sign. It was on a high school coach who was sure to his baseball team that he decided to go to a professional !!!!! <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was sooo good !!! !! It was a very good film of the sports, the "Ducks Mighty" film. It had also taken moviegoers in Texas, from somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso along the way to Metroplex (where I live). I can tell him because I realize the ball (it was "Ballpark in Arlington;" is now "Ameriquest Field")! It was good to see Disney's "Golden Age" finished here in my area !!!!! RIP <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "All started with the mouse ... and ended with baseball." (say) <br /> <br /> 10/10
