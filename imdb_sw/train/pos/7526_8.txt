Canadian movie star Mary Harron is a cultural gadget whose previous films have revealed more than six-year-old artistic and eight-year celebrity. And "Bettie Notorious Notorious" says his unimportant eye in the 50th century America, when it is locked in the moral right of Joe McCarthy, while having the start of the awakening of sex that would lead to free love for the next ten years. Harron and its author participant Guinevere Turner, obviously do not intend to biopic the usual gesture of sex. This is a film about the underground icon of the era and how its pure, unhappy sexuality revealed the illusion of illusion and improper cultural ideas that have not been made by the beauty of the nude body. If Bettie's life story was all concerned about the film, then why did it end before his horrible period was about to begin. Obviously, Harron is more interested in the US view towards sex image then and now. With the leading performance of fear and Gretchen Mol and the incredible film of W.Mott Hupfel III, he fulfills this goal in a pleasant way, setting the mirror in the past making the audience to explore their "light" of the 21st century towards their called pornography. If America faces under the new reserve, this is a much needed film than ever before.
