There is an amazing fact about the fact that the movie released in 1934 could be the head and shoulders on every movie of Tarzan followed, including a piece of strangled and stimulating 1980s Greystoke. Once the viewer passes the first three curtains, which are unacceptable, Tarzan and his wife take as a bullet, providing a non-stop action, humor, and love. Maureen O'Sullivan is beautiful and beautiful like Jane and goes away with the movie. Weismuller is also strong. It is highly recommended.
