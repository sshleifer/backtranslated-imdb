We start all our review with the following information. My wife and I have seen about 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored to receive access to life film at any time at any time without cost! So we can see anything we want every time we want. The point of this is that the ARTS are calculated by ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert do not differ from you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies if they want or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money for two hours of enjoyment that is enough for us! We have never heard or read critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as things like us. Well about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good but very good. Critics are a group of morons. Just because there is magic and the language they liked. It had a ticket value and that's all you can ask for. Isn't that right? Each movie can not be designated of the academy awards. Sharon stone is good and makes a good job in the movie and assures you of what it has violated critics
