This was what the black community was before the disease of the disease, gangsta rap, and AIDS that attacked the ghettos in eight years. Honorable members, strong families who struggled to find all the difficulties and difficulties they faced. Black America was a separate group of people in seven years. It is still full of hopes and jumping over the six-year civil rights movement, times were hard but still worth fighting. Keepin 'your head over the water, and make a wave when you can, this show showed how black people tried to work together as people and family, before they began to meet each other to deal with the fear of ghettos. It's a heartbreak to see what the red was like at that time and what they have been now.
