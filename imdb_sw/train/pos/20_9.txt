'Stanley and Iris' show the victory of the soul of man. For Stanley, it is a struggle to have skills and realize its potential. For Iris, it is to gain confidence to love again after being a widow. The beauty of the film is a drum that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda are doing together, starting and stopping, before each other the knowledge and courage to trust each other and continue. For this it is very good gives us a good view of how life is often, so be reliable. Unlike other viewers I saw each of the characters made to be consistent with the whole picture. Casting hand is also carefully selected and enhances the quality of behavior that the main characters find more due to helpful displays. All in a very good movie. The best thing I take from that is Hope.
