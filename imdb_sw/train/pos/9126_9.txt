This film is beautiful and wonderful has closed. Oscar's Prince for music was very worthy (most people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch as a couple of night nights on DVD. Great surprise: Prince is doing a very good job, and it is very good to send pain on the camera. Morris's Day, Wendy, and Lisa are good in their support work. Very popular historical film.
