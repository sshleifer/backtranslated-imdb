If you are a Crispin Glover striker, you must see this. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you must see this. If you are a fan of the film in general, you should see this. If you do not know who Crispin Glover is and do not know who Sean Penn is, this film probably still has a lot of value, but the more work that has been seen before by Crispin or Sean, is better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is very fantastic, but it is also a good idea. Nothing I know is similar to this film. It's its own kind. I am sure that anything like that will be made again. I can't say anything more than exactly what has been destroyed, and some of the other views here have done a good job for doing so. To deal with any of the reviews here who gave a bad reference, please see the film again. In fact, there is no point where this film can be called correctly "be boring." This is likely to funniest, most of the entertainment, with a small boring film made. And it gets better with age and constant looking. Classic classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim that they have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the wonderful Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also star in. Unfortunately, copies of this film are few and it's hard to find. I was able to get the VHS version after careful thought, and there are several ways to get what I know. But I would like someone to put this on a DVD.
