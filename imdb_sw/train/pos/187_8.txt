Marion Davies stars in this amazing comedy "Show People" released by MGM in 1928. Davies emerges from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). Jalopy enters are hoot - as well as Davies southern south. Davies sets the job in the comedy of slapstick, not what he wants, but it brings his success. He meets a star of slapstick William Haines, who was once beaten by him. Davies then gets a job on the most prestigious studio ("Art Gallery of Art") and sets the work in many pieces. A good but fake player (Andre Telefair) shows him how to become a typical Hollywood star. Davies leaves his friend and father for a good life, but of course he learns that he is not really who he is. Marion Davies is quite amazing, as he - for fury - runs the feeling of emotions needed for the "good" actress. William Haines is a natural man, and there is coming to Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including film director, King Vidor. This is a silent film with a few "sound effects" as sound pictures were coming on their own. Treasury film.
