I saw last night on TV, and I was very happy. It is a kind of movie that makes you feel good and warm around the heart, and you believe that there is still good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see the grace that they did to help and protect - the former police like), although you know that this story is not true completely. <br /> <br /> I wanted to act (they all seemed as usual, ordinary people, living small pictures of the English coast) but the biggest thing in the movie was magic and humor! Remember the event in the shop with two old women after having their "tea"! !! Maybe that end was a little controversial, but it did not prevent me from actually, really enjoy the whole story!
