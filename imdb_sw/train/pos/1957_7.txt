Yes I will say before I start commenting, this film is very inserted. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is good at its place of Catherine Trammell as well as Morrissey as Gold glass. He is the analyst sent to assess him after the death of a sports star. The mirror is taken into the game of trapping that Trammel uses to drive his mind. <br /> <br /> Acting was good (away from Thewlis). He is slow, sluggish and deceptive and does not have a big day than he did in the first. He was very surprised (as in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed very vunerablitity in the role he needed. Thewlis however was blind. He destroyed his character and was on-top-up the whole way. He liked it very much. Overall, this film is not good first but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
