I don't like all Shrek movies. (Since all "PG" and have words in them I never say, so I didn't like them.) But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron," which I just barely looked for for the first time last month, I was a fan of animation films , except Pixar. *** Spoilers *** *** In "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron," the horse ass is born and eventually become the leader of his hearing. One night, he sees a wonderful light for a distance, and he turns away. This step ultimately leads to his capture, and many other things. In all movies, we hear details. It is through the mind of the Spirit, though the horse never speaks. This is what makes the movie goo. They (film makers) discovered the real horse making the sound of the horses made; none of these voices were made by men. <br /> <br /> The Spirit meets with the Rain, beautiful, and Little Creek, native to America, who has the Rain. Little Creek later provides the Spirit and Rain, they go home. I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I'm interested in buying a film on this film recently. Look at this movie, and you won't break it. My score: 10/10
