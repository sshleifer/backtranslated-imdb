The movie has a great text of type. Includes all of Columbo's common ingredients; Lt Columbo's approach approaches and bonds to his suspect, a secret way to him, a Columbo dog, a cat game with a mouse, which is very good for this and fortunately with a good sense of humor, especially it involves Columbo's character. It is all written despite the fact that it does not even have a real concept of nature. Columbo hunting journalist / journalist murders had been made more than once before the movie Columbo. It is also a very well-known movie from James Frawley, who after this has led more than 5 Columbo movies, in the '70 and' 80's. and memorable. It is one of Columbo's movies that are running slowly, despite being too long and too long to run. This style and technique does not work well for Columbo's movie but in this film it makes, which may not be a little thanks for movie shows. More than the Columbo film or made a great star or star from the early days of film making, like its killer film. This 81-year-old film is not known Ruth Gordon. He was not hungry in many bad movies during his career but still known to others, especially for his role in "Baby Rosemary", which also defeated Oscar. He had a real and common style, which some people don't like though. He got his most selection of Oscar in his career, before winning for "Rosemary's Baby", in 1969. He has a lot of relationship with Peter Falk in their collective collection. <br /> <br /> The movie also star is still limited to GD Spradlin. I say young people because I only know him from his recent production out of his work, despite the fact that he already had 57 during this Columbo production. He is still alive but retired from acting, since 1999. <br /> <br /
