This is a completely amazing series. Well done and very interesting. Like a great WWII buff, I learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the most beautiful things that continue for this is all the interviews with the past people when the war was clean in their minds, by comparison saying that is. It's nothing against men that you see being asked in today's programs, is that most of these men were not involved in the top echelons of what was happening then. One of the most beautiful parts is Sir Laurence Oliver. I would like to suggest this to anyone who wants to learn about WWII, but I really think the characters (like myself) will need to buy this or look at it more than once. My true complaint on this whole series is that some of the facts are not quite accurate as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or completely clear in areas. The information is different now we know because of the collapse of the USSR. Generally looking for an amazing WWII and you must see for any historian of WWII or a private professional.
