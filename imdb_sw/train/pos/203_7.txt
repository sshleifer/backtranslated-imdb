The Sunshine Children of Neil Simon with Walter Matthau and George Burns are a funny comedy on a wonderful bond for life and its shortage, but laughter always delicious taste. To see Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) two comedy actors of the comedy are now reduced to a lot from a tough and excessive age you can feel angry and just blue. Willy never gave up and kept looking at the job, while Al was tired of the players and retired at his home home. The couple in his past was really funny and compromise, but out of the area was continuously squabble with quarrels, and for eleven years after they were broken they were not talking between. Now if they would work, they should come back together once to do one of his most old artworks for the comedy TV show. Meet and explode and release of old questions? Neil Simon's Screenshots provides a certain breathing story with disgust for blue and a lot of blue and high yields and laughter that produced a good mixture as well as thanks to a couple of great Walter Matthu (Academy Award as a Best Player) and George Burns (Won Award Academy as Actor Best Support). The two characters are very honest and true and their relationship is seen as they work together for all the time and the truth that they cannot bear between them. The film also applies to all its facts that affect the story as the story describes and how the Love-Temperature report that has closed two actors is a very real part of it but at the same time it is understandable to life. My rate is 7.
