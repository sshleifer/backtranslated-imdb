I was very excited about the information in the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel were best in their support responsibilities. Like it was Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire offered a good job as it was shown, when he had to catch his friend's hand, knowing he would die without order. Beware of deep, good language teaching so that you can be given a very low speed. Why this film was hit under rug and Hollywood developers can only think. I have great doubts. That makes them more attractive to me. I have given twelve copies of the DVD for gifts. <br /> <br /> Before you ignore the film. Use or buy and watch for a few hours, then judge.
