I have not read a book that is based on. This is some (others are the role of the film) the final work of John Ritter (RIP), one hopes that it is hilarious. And it is. Almost every time he is in this, as a matter of fact. Most of the cast, help together and consistently, plays well, and the material tends to be good. Paul Hennessy, the father of three young men: Rory, the old boy of the same age, Kerry, the middle-aged child who struggles with the cause and awareness, and the Bridget, the love style, very popular. Sagal makes return to the female guide in sit-com, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed somewhat after Mr. Three passed company, and for a while, they did not seem to create their ideas if they wanted to go get a laugh, or be poignant and make sure they were polite. One might wonder how or why it continued for a long time after this: It may be very good, some additions were lucky (if you would like David Spade, all of it includes doing his job) and he had something to say. My favorite time is the last season. Humor is a good mix of joke "dumb" (especially related to high school students), silliness, dark comedy and inappropriate materials. This was associated with sex and other adult issues, but never in a clear manner. The language is gentle, and, sometimes, very strong. I recommend this to any fan of those who did it. 8/10
