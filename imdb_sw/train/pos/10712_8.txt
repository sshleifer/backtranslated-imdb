This movie is well described or compared to "Big Fish" (movies with Tim Burton). But it's a bit of delightful and more in you face the story. And of course here is not the father, but his grandfather who tells the story. <br /> <br /> The story of the film also moves back and forth (so the story story here on IMDb, can tell you more than you would like to read, before watching the movie). It's funny and engaging enough, even if you get from one story to another and have a good time too. Also amazing you here and there, and things you don't expect. Little good then, what you need to remember, especially if you like such movies! : o)
