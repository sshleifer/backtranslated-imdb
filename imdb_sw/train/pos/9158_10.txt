Last night I finished again checking "Jane Eyre" (1983), the BBC mini-series was taken from the romance novel of Charlotte Bronte of English that suited to English literature and Timothy Dalton (James My favorite Bond) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, like Jane Eyre, a 18-year-old girl, hosting the property of Mr. Rochester, Thornfield. "Jane Eyre" has been one of my favorite books since I was a 11-year-old girl and my friend gave me in words, "This book is wonderful" and so I have read it several times and I'm still tired. His beautiful, refined, fragrant, and fresh, lively conversation, and above all, the two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many film designers. "Jane Eyre" has been made to TV with a large screen often, 18 based on IMD. The famous and mysterious characters like Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton have played a couple who have won hundreds of social barriers, law, religion, in different ages , nature, experience, and for the wrong mistakes that could hunt one for many years. Of all these films I have seen only one, 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 which follows a novel around where Timothy Dalton who often has dark, brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester openly and for class, was Mr. Rochester - sardoniki, power, natural strength, power, passion, sexy, and the greatest shock of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as a beautiful, gentle, intelligent and powerful man who feels deeply and full of desires mixed with clear arguments, with a strong but stable strength. Added September 17, 2007: During the past two weeks, I saw five movies of "Jane Eyre" and it was a good experience. There is something interesting in every direction of "Jane Eyre" even if not all are successful. This version is still my popular film "Jane Eyre".
