I found Maslin Beach several times - all for free to run TV in Brisbane. I can't enter if it's good, bad or otherwise if others are well and actually covered this. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you it's Australia. Only in Australia we can have films about the relationship between people who use the day as naked as they were born, and watch it on a free commercial television. I'm a friend from the United States who is always surprised by what we put on our free TV compared to his home country. Sex and IC and Huff are just examples. Even though our government is trying to put us in the US Government of the United States, it's good to know at least some things remain Aussie really
