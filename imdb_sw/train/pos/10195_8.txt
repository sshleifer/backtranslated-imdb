Joe Don Baker is one of the few executives who are often better than its material, and almost every time less accepted. He has been in tons of films either as heavy or brave, and has a kind of power, strong in front of which Wallace Beery made centuries before it. Baker can provide material that can be sensible to another actor, and that's very good about it. In fact it seems to mean what it says, no matter how few, obvious or silent, puts it in the league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. What made WALKING TALL Trilogy work well, and the same magic is here at FINAL FINANCE. This was a great hit in movies and on video in the 80s, and has been much better than the most known known time of the time. By moving the step from Texas to Europe, there is a temporary duration of time that will not prevent you from stepping on the screen. Being honest, I have always enjoyed the Greydon Clark movies, who is the most-nonsense director in the same line as the 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of the best. The last service is one of the lost gems of the last 80 years, similar to MAN ON MOTO in its grit and violence. I think if they make this with Rock, all new audiences will like to like me.
