A fantastic and powerful film of the Al-Schmid marine torture. Although it is difficult and unsuitable is in the final hero - the victory of Schmid on disability and depression. The battlefield was very powerful. But one bone to take. It does not matter how many .50 bullets that have been expelled I have never seen any water or dirt faced with effect! It hurts realistic, but I can live with it. Good performance with Eleanor Parker, again, as his girl friend.
