"Wearing To Kill", is one of the most beautiful. His actions and sex and violence make this film for adults. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can compare his use of the camera to tell the story. He looks at many scenes without a conversation, and tells a lot of his stories, through the use of his performances, and the color of the brilliant Pino Donnagio. Published in Panavision, the film should appear on a large mirror, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell her story. Dropped, on the video, "dressed to kill", is not recommended one movie. A strong exhibition from its direction, good direction, and, perhaps, the best film titles, make "Wearing Kill" should see it.
