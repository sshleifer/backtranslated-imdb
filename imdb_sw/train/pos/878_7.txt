Interesting characters, a lot of tension. As close to black and white would be black and white. I was extinguished with how the most common characteristic of compassion, a quiet writer, close to the deaf, was able to turn to crime to destroy his colleagues, beat people in his way and finally participate in the shade, and introduce someone to have a gun off as decoy for himself to get . I am a little reluctant to the trends of other quality movies to show criminals through compassion without addressing the harm they did to others than to show their rivals as quickly as jerks. In this film we do not know who is actually investing, what happens to the innocent wife whose sympathetic member tries to establish the owner of a bargain who may fall for losing. Such a bad, the film can be good.
