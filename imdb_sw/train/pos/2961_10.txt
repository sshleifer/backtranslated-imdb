This is the only movie of David Zucker that is not available for any of its first kind. The funniest movie of 98 and night at Roxbury right back but I didn't think Theres something about mary was so funny it does not count unless for frank and beans something she she. Listen to the attendees especially Roger Ebert does not know the only entertaining entertainment to view his view.Anyway see it you being dissapionted
