I have seen this film in fact more than 100 times ... it's jam-filled entertainment !!! Boothe Power gives the stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I've never thought that an actor could catch "power" like Shatner and Liebmann in these roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! Besides I'm worried, Boothe Power is Jim Jones ... this film takes its best performance !!!
