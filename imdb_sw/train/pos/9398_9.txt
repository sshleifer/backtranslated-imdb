This is the best modern film film .... "best" for it is interesting, start-finishing. There are some holes here and other places to make your head unresponsive ... but I haven't seen anyone who didn't get this information. Movie has the right amount of action, insist, lose a compound with interesting characters. In addition, it plays beautiful colors and movies with a good guitar soundtrack. I wrote this crime film "film film" because it is beauty and all the characters are not good. Even a well-thought-out person, played by Nicholas Cage, finds himself in trouble with lying and has a quick thing that he shouldn't have. He also does something at the end that is wrong, but I can't destroy it by saying. It should say, however, that other characters are bad they make Cage looks beautiful! Talking about "bad guys," does anyone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the "crew" group, he is tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is happy to look for great reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great support function, too. This is one of these films that are not very available, but they should have them. You will enjoy watching this. By the way, try to say the name of this movie to speed three times quickly without deleting!
