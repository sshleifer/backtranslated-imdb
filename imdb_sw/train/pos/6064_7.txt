I begin to tell you how I got this movie. It was a winter time in Alaska around 1990. My partner from Australia was staying with me and my girlfriend in the shoe box of the apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and many people live in the house, drink too much and watch anything coming on television. I found this film out of a modern shop put in snow snow and once the new was a treasure. It is probably the worst movie ever. The TV on its side or slide down with full effect of filling. The true Gem. Laughter will come beyond the memory and it will continue forever. If you see this film to rent in a video store, steal it.
