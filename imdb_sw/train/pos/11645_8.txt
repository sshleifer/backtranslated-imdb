I was in France, on March 05, and I would like to go to this film festivals. I knew about the Latine Cin√©mas Latine of Toulouse, but I've never been there. I decided to go and then I was arrested Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The film is so wonderful. It did not cause me as a Mexican users, because it was French-headed but still awesome. This movie is satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime in Mexico. It is a bad picture of the city. The Metropolis. Secuestro Express, and Mia Maestro's wonderful, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but louder, and I think so, the kinda relationship with Cero y van 4. A, kind of, the story of redemption and that is so much does it much? A man on Fire, had a wonderful power, too, not satire, but an image not caused in the streets of Mexico. Or it is like One of the Brave. The film that is amazing and stops you from guts very hard. This is like Anime characters, it has a certain problem around it, but that makes it even more reliable. Decision: The film that surprises and lets you believe that there is no safety on the street again. Wonderful conversations, amazing patterns and amazing displays. Cero y van 4 is a film that you recently forget. You are shivering and surprised.
