CinderELLA's Walt Disney takes the story everyone knows and beautifies with humor and insistence, while retaining the charm of the story. Disney artists provide a film and look for a fascinating story story that provides at least a story story. It's beautiful, as usual, animated; show that the beautiful place where the God of fairy mother turns the spear into a great coach and Cinderella bags for a beautiful coat. Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston provide love songs like "A Dream Is Wish Your Heart Makes" and "Bbid-Bobbidi-Boo" which adds all the situations to characters. Yet CINDERELLA's story is predictable, it provides that exciting melodrama that one shares the concerns of the heroine of titular and its animal friends. The mother of the worst mother and her bad cats Lucifer offers a dangerous danger that threatens the dream and expectations of Cinderella and the mouse. It is this risk that provides stories for a serious conflict with the interest of the audience. Emphasizing the film, however, is similar to the beauty of serene, especially in music numbers. It is in these groups that reveal the beautiful qualities of Cinderella and her friends, and encourage the audience to care. In general, CINDERELLA of Walt Disney is a good family entertainment that has lived very well after half a century.
