I see the Alan Jacobs inspection very accurate about the movie, however I had the opportunity to rent a DVD from the blockbuster and the definition from the Curator of BYU, Archives Picture Motion James D'Arc. The former LDS Commissioner Heber J. Grant was approved by the film to understand breach from historical content for major exhibitions and visual events. For example the movie showed Joseph Smith in case. despite the great talks of Brigham Young in defending Joseph Smith he was convicted. Then Joseph was killed. For historic Joseph Smith was never judged by anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for the case. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were both killed before the trial.
