First of all, this film was not released in TESTED POORLY THEY SAY, I say they thought the story of the evil fighters, politicians & people of the volunteer magazine were killed, just give us a DVD and TV TV> money & run. <br /> <br /> It is said I usually like this kind of movie, especially for this called cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard & Side off, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. has been made to death, but above it has led to life on this violent film and is actually visible. Justin Timberlake It is as good as a volunteer journalist devoted to the planned newspaper by Morgan Freeman, Others are a Merchant Business, & Politicians or some honorable boys, Two women are a LL girlfriends COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & do what is needed, It is quite violent, many killings etc., not for children. No meaning is a good film, BUT for what is and cast It is definitely beautiful, <br /> <br /> Comparison *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
