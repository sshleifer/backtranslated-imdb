When I bought my Toy Story tape when you left the video after it was opened on the movie I saw a trailer for this which said from the creators of Toy Story. Once I realized that I knew this would be a good feature! I was right! Life of Bug as Toy Toy is a beautiful story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim, Beetle shown by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar released by Pixar Joe Ranft journalist. My favorite part is when Slim stick walk (David Hyde Pierce) lifts Hemlich trying to disrupt Birds and Hemliki as You hoo Mr. Early Bird. What about the good sweet tasty on the stick and Slim as I will come! I'll go! I just died laughing in the area. Be a great fan of insects I think the Bug Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know many people feel that the worst movie of Pixar ever! I don't know how you can hate the film Pixar! I think they're a very good film! Good work PIXAR!
