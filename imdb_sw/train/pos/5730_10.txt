Dumbland is not all. In fact Dumbland goes to someone except Lynch and that's why make funny and cartoon together. Violence? Yes. Evil? Yes. Anger? Yes. Slice of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of other Americans who do not mind and beat the wife and children for fun. From MÃ©xico I can say I love him! My favorite parts are: 1- my teeth come from blood, all the noise and violence make me like to scream and throw me behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! O baby to find it and learn the lesson: other people don't never be grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. Lynch more than all parts, music, surgery and revenge ...
