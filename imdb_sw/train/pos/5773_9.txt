Since I am very interested in the creation of the lake I actually dig this movie. This movie has value to see. If you would like to be very bad it is a good type of film. The effects are very good and just think of the "Lost World". I originally looked at this film in the early 90s perhaps more than 89/90 at the local township station called "Morgus Presents". I was not afraid but I had 8 and anything B felt like A. Years later I saw it on DVD on the Circuit City area and bought it once so I could give 9 because it has a personal spot in the heart there with a monster squad and groups gremlins. Good film B for all ages.
