We saw several times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a good jolt on the system. Half of the surreal is still hard on top takes modern media culture (or lack thereof), based on some wacked seriously, the most-way-Hollywood-fringe approach. It had an early exciting performance from Mark Ruffalo, and a popular film show from the DP who performed the Polish Muslims. There was a deep sense of humor and a natural sense of feeling that makes it clear. This film had a classic ritual written everywhere, and I'm wondering still not a DVD. <br /> <br /> Hope soon.
