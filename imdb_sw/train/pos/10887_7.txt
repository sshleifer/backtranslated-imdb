A horrible movie is hit by things that are not good. It is about a murderer who is masked. The director tells the murderer in front of staff and staff. He goes out and kills two people. She has committed suicide and the film has never been finished. 12 years later a group of film students decided to try and finish - but there was a curse. People who try and finish are killed themselves. Students ignore it. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The program is an old hats but this is not bad ... why is it (a small budget slasher budget). It is well done by young and talented young people. No good person but nobody can scare. It also avoids female (and mandatory) female events. It goes fast, gore is beautiful and bloody and script does not bother your mind. Molly Ringwald is also in this position while playing his faded bitchy actor. <br /> <br /> No big shakes but it's not so bad. I offer 7.
