Step, fear, sci-fi, director of exploitation Fred Olen Ray shows that he has talent as director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best / bad guys in the industry. He likes the viewer and the best performance of his work. With Randy Travis gives the best impression of Lee Van Cleef. It's not bad in the film. Smith and Travis make movies. For all those who have been cast out none of them appears. Ray did a great job leading this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I would like to offer this western B for one to ten (ten to better) seven.
