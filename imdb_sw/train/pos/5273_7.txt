This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many awesome film fans after describing the season with the notorious Holocaust of Cannibal. However, do not expect to get the same attention in a reviewed film here which seems to be very amazing in comparison and has more like a leading hub for a smaller audience. Such a description can often remove many of the entire Conan whole inspired Brother and Pastor type but before you turn your nose on this, it is said, this movie is very fun! It is played for laughter and has two powerful and very interesting heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. Barbar's brother all seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie Richard Lynch returns as a great villain in a piece and is also good to see the responsibilities of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. Adding to this, women are surprised to see and marvel at every time of the film (a large and large appendix in the form!) Can I say, - this is just a fun and good heart that takes that and I wholeheartedly recommend!
