I have seen this film often and I will never stop. It's a classic for every word meaning. The movie is funny hysterically and still quite touch all at the same time. For those who do not have a fan of "heads" or a foreign film in general, open your mind. This is a good movie for "founder" because the story is entertaining. Don't make a mistake, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what works), but everyone will get something out (even if it's just laughing at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't even imagine this movie without an exciting! I love it ... and I think many people too.
