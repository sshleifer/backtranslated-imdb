The best battle of the war shows the impact of war on the city boy that reduces his eyes to Guadalcanal and must come home and make himself a support for family and friends. The best help of the actor's help makes this movie very entertaining. The role of Eleanor Parker as a partner was eligible for Oscar selection. He is guilty of this in this movie. Ann Doran's role was as satisfactory as her small responsibilities. I especially like aura town of Phildelphia before the war. The hunting area is very good. In fact the war of Guadalcanal has shown the truth of the fear of our troops during the Epic War. A well-known film that should not be forgotten
