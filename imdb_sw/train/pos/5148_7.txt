I don't know what with these movies. But movies about history or religion always criticize their accuracy. Of course not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make a 100% film available today even even "experts" disagree. So I would like to judge the movie and what it is trying to say than to reject all the wrong things. So I start by saying that I liked this mini serie. But I agree with the critique that his childhood years went very quickly. The series should be part of the three parts, its childhood being the first part. But if they didn't have more money to hit more stories, who was afraid? There is only one true problem I have with this film and that it is the fact that you have been told in a book history way. Particularly the second part which is the total of events that happened. I would love to see Hitler more human (more scenes where he engages himself etc.). Noah Taylor made it more in the 'Max' movie which seems to work better I guess. However I am glad this was done and got it on DVD. Just remember clearly clear what happened and see Carlyle casting the best. 7.5 / 10
