As the West look at another cultural perspective and tradition of marriage, I have just seen the Wife and the sand. The idea of ​​getting married to a stranger through the arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. However this is the case in this Hindi film. Described by humor, and a new perspective, we learn from Abhay and Ritika who have met once and are now in their five-day honey day. As mentioned, it is difficult to believe in this age of cell phones that are such a customary marriage as a planned marriage is still being done. We see the evil that these couple feel as they gather together on the first night, and how they try to create a bond, even if they don't know. We see different views about marriage and commitment as presented by other couples also on vacation, from a few years of marriage and others still have no right to make a marriage commitment. There is a song, a magic conversation, when pain, mix and compare new ways and traditions. Watching the movie and headlines loses reality of the story, it's still fun to enjoy. Certainly some of the conspiracy is less and the bus case has been deleted and has emerged; however the whole movie was supposed to watch.
