Great surprise of Spanish movies. I never thought Jordi Molla could be a very good director, after all, I don't care very much about his choice in movies. However this film was very strange and unpredictable at all ... something that I always enjoy! It has not enjoyed many media and I think it will be released in the US market. We will need to join a DVD or VHS if so ... I don't want to say a lot about the story because I don't want to destroy you but basically the movie is about homeless who just become a new messiah for kicking and getting money from (like sooooooooooo many), before he knew he enters into a life that he did not count.
