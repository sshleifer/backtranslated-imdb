I could not agree on the scope of this film, and I believe this is a sample of how many viewers have fewer ideas around the world. Really ... Is it? Do you forget that the movie was a kind of art before some of the tycoons tried to make only entertainment? This movie is not entertaining, at least not easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has a style, it is different, it's amazing ... That's why many of you hate it very much: because it doesn't want to please you. It's just a story, one of the most wonderful I accept, but after all, just a wonderful story. It's not a good story, even a great movie work, but I believe it is only 7 stars worth the courage of the author and the lead director to erase the story that has not been made to entertain the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making a great studio even rich. This film is, for me, a European-art film such as an American, and everyone involved in making it worthy of honor. Be bold, or be in a special sense of humor.
