One of the best parts of Sundance sees movies that you would undoubtedly doubt. Unless you are a true knowledge of the house, you may not think many documents. Only a few get any known distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to memory in recent years. Shakespeare Back to Baa is a powerful document on a large production group at Complex Correctional Luther Lutheran in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of prisoners presents Shakespearean to play. Director Hank Rogerson and his staff follow the group as the roles are selected personally, translated, displayed and finally made. <br /> <br /> Movie is filled with interesting revelations for those who have never been imprisoned. Despite the scriptures we know and (defendant, felon, murderer, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect men as to consider human feelings. Serendipitously, the game chosen for the year of publishing was the wind, and its focus on the forgiveness and redemption. All employees face the importance of playing in their lives, finding patterns and similarities with their characters and meaning of the game. <br /> <br /> For a memory film, like a book, the best that could be that we hope is that we find something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Back to Baa was a personal revelation to me. "O new confident world, you have such creatures in it."
