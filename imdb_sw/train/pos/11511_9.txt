Discover the weak sometimes? Yep! Cheesy special effects sometimes? Yep! Is the pleasure of happiness a lot of time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I have always enjoyed the science of science as a child, but I have found many things of Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / awesome things like deciding too much. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the Universal classic leaders, and took Carl Kolchak to beat me on the "dark side" of entertainment. Duke had a Cogburn cock, Eastwood had a Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck was Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. It was mixed with all the weak scripts, the special effects of cheesy, that the baroque group of characters and actors to help with the stars of visitors, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had a sense of humor in spite of that risk, he was good in his follow-up, and a professional when accepting enough to be necessary and eventually hiding from government officials. Additionally, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was ready to keep his neck out and do what was needed to do, even if it meant losing him, at the end of his journalistic work, or in prison. For all his errors, including no taste in the clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and the one who led the beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was the old car used at the time) on his way to save the day to humanity. As good as another false hero Carl Kolchak was a hero of everyone brought every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has passed and his show is on DVD, I hope he is very happy to watch him enjoy playing Kolchak Night Stalker again!
