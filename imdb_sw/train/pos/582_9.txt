as a character I always like to read through 'hate' views of any movie. especially that I would like to comment on. and not a counter-plan; I just want to see what people say on flipside. <br /> <br /> however, I want to handle one thing. Many people who hated them called it, by photography, 'beautiful, but not clear,' even even going to say that the normal desire is still impossible to help his brother was a mundane plot, for the better. I would like to disagree. The brother of a brother who has the same problem, I can relate to. every day, you see them suffer themselves, knowing only that their current way will lead them to personal destruction. and not about what they did at the time; how or why paul decided to take gambling and cooperate with people concerned; it is more true as they connect. On the one hand, they are true knowledge, and on the other hand, with devastating pain (it's as much as people like gender chains? Same forces that lead them are the same as they are destroying them) and all the time you see this, you know this, and it's worse, you realize that you can't do something big about it. <br /> <br /> to norman maclean, the river you are going through probably was the way to get the answer to what the tragedy was done, and who is speaking it. The last, nobody, and often, no reason. but it takes a lot of personal pain to actually come into this understanding. sometimes it takes life. and sometimes it never comes.
