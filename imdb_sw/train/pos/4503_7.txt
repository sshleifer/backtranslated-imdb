This zippy and happy moments from 1916 - when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were great names in the comedy - shows young Oliver Hardy as ne'er-do-well who must quickly impress his rich uncle by producing a wife and child for his visit. This course does not work well and soon there are more and more children than it can cope with; along with a must and misunderstanding that is a symbol of the early reminder of the basket of the film. Well-restored can be viewed as part of 'Early Oliver Hardy' Movies and now available on DVD, adding well to the corpus available of the great duo of favorite comedy.
