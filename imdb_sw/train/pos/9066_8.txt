~ I was able to see this film last morning on the early adoption. ". This was my pleasure. I have not read this book, so I do not know if it is true for the book or not. But it really took the cause of weight to the highest level. This is the story of a "new" child in the city and so it just happens that there is a group of boys who have created a kind of love club to take children .... a known voice? What? We are not all suffering at this time or another. He has a little brother who can stand up with parents that he is embarrassed about it. I enjoyed most of all I was seeing how each one was different from the other, all standing out. The abuser (why are they doing so disgusting the red head? My daughter has red hair and she is not hate! .. lol) is a great shock, who finds herself being beaten by her own brother. It took a deviation to turn and well you will fall in love with all and actually find a way for all the characters! Even parents, a great relationship between father and child. All talking, sweet, funny, etc. ...... Take your kids !!! You will be happy as they do!
