"The Foolish Girl" is a semi-comedy type, watching half-mockumentary business photo motion in mid-1910's. We see a picture of life in the original film studio, where we get a collection of set, running through the scene, taking care of fan fanics movie fanat, even lunch in commissary. We also recognize the unknown truth of the cinema - for example, do you? Do you know that "Artists often," 'don't know the plot of images that they work'? The film's original design is a movie star of Kenneth Driscoll's discovery with a small star of a young boy who he finds during the shooting on the territory of the country. I believe the 30-minute version I looked at was suspended, included in Cecil B. De Mille. It is a very reliable film - a simple look and thrown in excess. As a bonus comprises some of the most beautiful passages I ever accompanied with a silent movie.
