Movie was actually a romantic game associated with three sisters who had the desire to become a popular girl. In their efforts, the older sister meets a drug dealer and street street called Satin, whose Sister goes after the reason she believes it is "a lot of time" who will give her everything she sees that she wants out of life. Although he would be charged with killing him, he only killed his soul and he would live, after which he became addicted to drugs and eventually died to overdose. The story is not about the life of the road or the Italian striker who tries to buy a stick, then tell him, it's about how love can win even the worst disaster in life as shown in the song and style and behavior that was life in young women trying to “discover” back.
