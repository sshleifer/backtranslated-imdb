*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems to be salt, until I remember that my college campus was an old-turned-Nazi-racist-killer-who-then-devoted student, too: His name is Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> looking at the wikipedia- I added a few photos on their article about him. It is hard to believe, but these things really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly & Mike Rappaport were good.
