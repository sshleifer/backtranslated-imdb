I think King Lion 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever if not the best out of three King Lion movies! In the cinema movie and Pumbaa we tell where they came and have the right problem with others like Timon have trouble digging tunnels and other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa go to find their dream and find it and soon they get it with the Lion lift but soon they have to choose between their dream place or help the Lion cope with his evil Uncle Scar and declare his right as King of Glory Rock! He was filled with new amazing characters like Maa Timon (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my famous character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was released by a funney player Jerry Stiller's father of Ben Stiller. Disney had a mind to throw It still in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, and story and music King of Lion 1 1/2 is in my best opinion of any good and better than the Simba's Pride although I accept it as much as well as too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney good family whole can enjoy! It has a good story and it is very funney! 10 out of 10!
