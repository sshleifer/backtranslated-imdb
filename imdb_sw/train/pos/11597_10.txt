I read many comments that I, too, shared this film and wanted to see it again but I did not know the name of the movie. Thanks, because of the search and getting the head on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie I remembered. I did a search and got a movie and I was very happy to see the film again over 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I could get this film for all of you who were looking for a copy too. It was on the VHS version of the Wonderful Disney World's "Iita Courage" which had 2 movies, and the second is "The Legend of The Boy and Eagle." It touched me now as it was 40 years ago and now I have my own copy. I think it is only available on VHS. I got it on ebay and I found several copies there. Enjoy, I know I did! It is a wonderful story about the boy's love and care. When you were offering the sacrifice, the boy put the eagle because he could not allow the killing. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe with punishment after he had rescued the eagle, the eagle, also, saved the life of the young man and, moreover, taught him how to live. The relationship that the boy and the eagle lived together in the wilderness were greatly influenced by photography was true. What a good time this was. I've never seen anything coming near this movie!
