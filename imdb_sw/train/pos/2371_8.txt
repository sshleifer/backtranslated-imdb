I recommended to rent this film to my friend and he was obliged since he had seen the film and said it was the same. I thought the title was a little because the version of our shop was called "Fear: Night of Halloween". I expected this movie to be the amount of Halloween being eaten by a boy of wood. But it was opened by a beautiful scene and the murderer was killed two victims once and pointed forward to twenty years later when his son had witnessed two murders (including his mother) and even saw his father witness to the cabin of hidden trees and friends her and her lover where she tries to deal with her fears until the wooden image comes with her father's spirit. Good for good and I've never seen even the first.
