Was'nt is very bad for the first Raw PPV 006. But that end was very real for everyone who attended and those who were looking at home. MATCH-RIC FLAIR VS. WWE W / LITA TO THE WWE WWE TIME OF WORK It is not a bad opener, these two can win a big match if they had more time to put up a match. Flair wins and DQ after Edge put him in line with his MITB package. 3/10 TERMS OF TRIBE - TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WWE WINNERS OF WOMEN It's not bad to realize that this is the first time these Divas are faced with all sides. Mickie goes to the Chick Kick Chick, but the Trish duck and his own nails Chick Kick to win to preserve his name. 3/10 INSURANCE - CHAPTER HI VS. BIG SHOW Very good this match was, in fact. All HHH matches focus on the injury of the Big Show but the Great Show continues to fight again. Later HHH has the ability to overcome large nails and pedigree nails to win. 5/10 IN MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus match} It's not bad, it was okay. After Viscera was down, behind the referee, the mother of Benjamin got a purse {Which had a brick in it} and slammed Viscera head with three times. Viscera woke up to find that they were not beaten with a heel with Benjamin to win against a great man. FIFTH MATCH- JERRY 'THE STRATEGY OF HIV. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow & non-emerging. All men did not have a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a Drummer Defeat to win. 2/10 <br /> DAYS OF SIX - TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. MICHELLE IN THE WORLD IN THE WORK OF WORK WORK It was very fun to me. Ashley {I think} takes away the last Candice to win the first Women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 PATCHES OF JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DIVISION IN THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP CLAIMS It was a perfect match room. But there is nothing higher than last year that was better. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito returns back to the Masters & gets a roll-up on it to pick him up. Future Seconds Cena gets a roll on Carlito for three counters to win the Room Remove & store WWE its title. But his night was not yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and welcomes Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon says that his night is no longer possible, & says that Edge is taking place in his Financial position in Cena's counter-name. Edge comes from Lita, gives a basket to Vince & heads into the ring as Cena has one match to go here tonight. EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena who was broken off during the Association match] is beaten with Edge, Edge then Spear nails on Cena, goes to the lid and shock Cena leaves. Nail damages another Spear & lid for an amazing three calculation as he hit Cena & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So the New Year's New Year was better than this year, but it was still the same. The EC match was also good for the Edge Investment in its MITB opportunity is very obvious on PPV show. Overall: I will give 7/10 & C
