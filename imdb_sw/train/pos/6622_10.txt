I went to the film study during Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was present and gave a brief introduction. The film came and from the first shot I was shocked: one of the longest one of Paris's most beautiful and white. I should continue with the explanation because I think it's a suitable film to see. The sci-fi story can be found on average for many ... to me it was very good. The stage is good, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things that you cannot do or see are done in beauty. The work done is good, in my opinion nobody writes bad marks. <br /> <br /> Now, something I've got amazing is animation. 3D grafics look 2D. The comic BW raised book. Background information provides a more texture if it was done by hand (I am sure it was when the horns of the change saw deep). Producer in the investigation spoke about hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, he said, is brilliant, but perhaps he had no knowledge since he had one short film in his CV. Therefore, many people had real faith in them. They started their label from the beginning and since they were faced with the challenges they brought. Do not miss. I think you can't regret ... maybe Richard Linklater for the last look of this film is better than I think it.
