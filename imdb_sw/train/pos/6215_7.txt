While it's not a great fan of music, I liked the Fred Astaire movies and Ginger Rogers because it's so fun. In fact, they can be formula formula, but even if you know what will happen, they are still very happy to look. However, despite this, I was very disappointed in these exhibitions. Its part is because this film does not have amazing support as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Edwardret Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to not know - especially in the "happy" department. The silly antics of these participants offer some of the films that are not available by FOLLOW FLEET. In addition, contrary to the typical character played by Astaire, this is more than a jerk - if its head of oil gets Rogers to be scarce again. And, for this reason, it is very difficult to love or want to see them together at the end of the film. Plus, although music is for Irving Berlin, these songs don't seem to be remembered. In fact, there were no unique songs and I can't remember any of them even though I saw only the movie. Although this is still a good and valuable film, it has not lost the magic of some of their other films. Good but far and great.
