Coming to age movies is common these days. In 1980, "Foxes" provides its meaning. Jodie Foster has its character straight out. Since he did "Taxi Driver" four years ago, he has a strong character in this film. She is Jeanie, a high school who has a lot of guts, and seems to be out of any situation she is. Scott Baio has Brad way forward to Chachi on "happy days". She seems to be sandy and other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, depended on a bad crowd, chased by her father police. Jeanie and her three other friends decided to stay on the wild side until they entered the planned house where the party was getting the most. Exploring life on the other side of the songs can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad every time she gets lost. The truth comes back to hard where he is killed in a car accident. And one gets married to an old man. Grow it is not easy, sometimes we have to examine life as it is. In fact, you should be careful about people around you. For me, I was my own person, and I might stay that way! Great music, good plot, this gem is a movie! 4 out of 5 stars!
