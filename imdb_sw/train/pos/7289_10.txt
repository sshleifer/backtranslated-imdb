This was one of the first movies I saw ... I was about 5 then. I was afraid of GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like a monster ... and my mother got very upset. He had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye said like DOUBLE MINT! Now this is MOVIE! Hey at this time was a great movie. The head on the laboratory of the laboratory was as real as it was back. And if your 5 is VERY SCARY! Children are now destroyed by special effects that show very much and leave NOTH with your mind ideas. Your intention can think more dangerous things than special effects! (IMO)
