Not often the movie can make the audience laugh, and five minutes later to fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this, but a few can give emotional effect to this film. Adam Sandler usually draws him to his hot temper and often, but it also makes you laugh when his past shade does not draw him. I can't destroy anything, but there is one place especially that should have your eyes and watering. Even the eyes of the people would have to have a bastard with no heart to hear something while watching this film. Don Cheadle gives another good performance, but is provided by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith offers good performances, but nothing in the line of two leading functions. The Sandler humor is still there, which has actually preserved this film from the line to the border. There are several laughs to have, but don't think you're going to stay there for a long time, because it gets again without a great warning. I could keep on going on how this film is just well written about every human body's sense, but I will reduce this short one. I feel no need to tell you anything more. Make yourself grace and take time to see this film. Even if you wait until it comes out of the DVD, it's 100% worth of time. A highly motivating film is to keep your eyes on your eyes and smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are a soul without a heart.
