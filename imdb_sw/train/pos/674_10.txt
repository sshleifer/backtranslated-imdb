Although for most people watching movies, this will have little interest, but out of hundreds of movies related to magic and magic in one way or another, this can be much better in many ways. <br /> <br> From Golem to Craft's subject seems to be a permanent interest in the film industry. Most of the movies that touch on it in any way make it for children (eg "Witchboard", a true piece of waste in every way) or take transcendental elements as a cheap factor for special cheesy or viberans cardboard (cf. "Violence"). Often this issue comes into a religious setting (in various manifestations of Revelation, the Antichrist is the advocate of some kind of new age practice). From time to time, the film appears to show at least the experience and magic as it happens in real life, but the presentation of magic in such movies can be described as harmful and not real, or typical ... not quite accurate. I watched this film after many years this night. I had seen him before VHS; is a piece of darkness, rotation, and after looking at the DVD, I would like to say if you are interested in watching this film, look at the DVD, don't look at VHS. <br /> <br /> Dark and humor is the most powerful in VHS but in DVD movie takes a very different tone. I think Weir emphasized the dark elements deliberately in style, but when the movie is changed to the center of the VHS color it goes on the edge. The DVD brings the movie again and I saw the difference. However, if I see it as the first time, I realized that magic treatment is very good in this film. It's hard to go for all reasons, why, I don't care to take time to do it. For anyone who has a desire, however, if you want to see what it is in real life, this film is very similar to many levels. And for anyone who is not, you have spent a lot of time reading for this step.
