I love this film. It is one of those I can watch again and again. It is handled well and thrown well that does not seem to be too difficult to be hit. The wife's new wife's widow who returns to the sale of alcohol to reach the end she could be made an American linen proposed by a film or an exciting act. Maybe it would have been completely killed. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like Comedy Ealing because of a very good feel in everything. <br /> <br/> It is worth looking only for the two women's area with a box of cornflakes ... (no that's not a spoiler!)
