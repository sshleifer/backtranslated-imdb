"One of the earliest efforts of the Hung.The laugh is the death-in part like Hung tries to imitate Lee's facial and facial, and also a little where he hung up for the Jackie Chan Teacher. The professional military art end.It is not the biggest film, but good for 'kung fu's 70, especially if you are a fan of Hung and / or Lee. Warning, though: many video versions of the movie have good quality color. The character in the blackface in which other people can get offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a hog-farmer farmer who goes to Hong Kong to fight with other bad guys Sammo returns on his dead-top imitator of Bruce Lee when to fight! <br /> <br /> This film is often presented as a Broke Lee's parody of "Enter Dragon", but not exactly ... Sammo is a village of pigs - considering Bruce Lee - who goes to Hong Kong to help her relatives run a little air restaurant of those who eat from domestic robbers to seek protection funds. When Sammo turns into a battlefield, he changes his self-Bruce Lee, which must seem to believe! This film is very good, in many battles against Sammo against people who are exposed to characters rather than military artists, and there is one character that is supposed to be black who plays with an Asian man with heavy practice (and preposterous). But what this film is not in budget and precision, it is more than it makes for the atmosphere and energy. It is highly recommended for good conditions. "
