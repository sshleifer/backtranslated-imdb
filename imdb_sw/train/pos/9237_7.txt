This movie is very good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I have seen a series and is a good film, but here, well-known "Legend Living, part1 and 2", and "Fire in Space" together. They also did the first film, but for other events. But still, it's a very good film. The only end is wonderful (you don't see what happens with Pegasus). But I still think that it is very good. Actors with special effects were good. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Star: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Bridges Lloyd, Jack Stauffer.
