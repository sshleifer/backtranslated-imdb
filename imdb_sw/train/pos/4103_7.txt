The leading actors in this film fall into two categories: wise and foolish. Simple enough. Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an innocent man, dopey who finds fault with the mistake he made. When he tries to get money for his crime, the old boss, the situation comes out of control. <br /> When Standa is actually (but interesting) stupid, his friend Ondrej is a very fool who unites everything and can say and do bad things every time. Without Ondrej, Standa can stand a chance to go into life with a minimum of success. With Ondrej, life will not be interesting, but it will certainly not have a headache! Ivan Trojan shows Zdenek, a kind of evil care that weakens in some of Hitler-esquire delusional trouble. Zdenek and his people are trying to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. I have been very impressed with high quality and Czech film ideas. For a small country, the Czech Republic has actually produced more of its good entertainment. The best Czech movies I have seen are: 1) Pelia ?? and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (World of Dark Blue). If you see these two movies, you have seen the best of Czech movies.
