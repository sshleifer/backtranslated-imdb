This film is quite stunning. New Blade player - next night in the most gentle. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognizable and visions, and sweeping vistas, grungy pieces and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story line is very simple, with a few surprises, but that's not what I like more about the film. It's a cure for seeing. <br /> <br /> Done in 3D and displayed black and white colors (no grays!) and just one short spot of color, it is less hard in the eyes than sound. There are "arty" camera shots - closeups and odd attitudes - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. Generally get a sense of graphic novel in the footage system. <br /> <br /> I was originally under the impression that the film was rotoscoped, as it was the level of animation and advanced notes in the main face signals. But unlike "A darkly scanner" - which is faced with (or actually being enhanced by) does not fit character normally (just look some way to change the hair!) - Renaissance is consistent and accurate around. When the behavior is near, additional information and architecture can be seen, but in the middle of the bullet or more distant details are not provided, but not the effects of character definition. For me, the only side of the film is that in one opinion we are told that this is one project. As a shy, if I would like to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and English dub is too big. <br /> <br /> All in all good films and was highly recommended.
