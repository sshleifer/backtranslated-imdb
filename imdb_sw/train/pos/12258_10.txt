Emma Austen's Emma is a very interesting story when the worst of this story is the best I have ever seen. Beckinsale's work of Emma is not available. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of good screenplay and excellent movies) can bring comedy efficiently, she fails to make Emma asable. Paltrow has not been helped by the fact that his hairstyles are 'wrong' in part (and I believe the era) and seems to be a good patient in the king's clothes. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, can work easily and still can show what Mr Knightly (most beloved of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in it. Mark Strong is Mr. Mr. Knightly with a proper mix of beautiful looks, age appropriate, chivalry, sympathy and gentlemanly character. Emma and Mr Knightly are assisted by cast to good executives and producers are generally very happy.
