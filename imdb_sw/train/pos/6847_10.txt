I have finished looking at the kill, which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had a version of "R" rated and unrated version.i chose non-included version.since I have not seen "R" rated version, I can't be quite sure of the difference. however there is a very graphic graphic graphic replica including an area of ​​express self-expression self-interest in this version.i I think you can call this soft location based on this porn.if this kind of thing can hinder you, I would recommend the "R" view version.but i digress.All comments from above means the genetic version.this is the mystery of murder / psychological fear / movie violence. blood. However, it is a single sequence of death. However the blood itself does not seem real. You believe this has been deliberately abolished the violence of the act itself, in order to give the area w feel the budget.For almost the violence, or rather the possibility of it, it means.the film is very well paced.as far as I can tell each area had a purpose. , which I find very rare compared to many of today's films. however, I thought that acting was good, especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns into a quiet performance in its place, which works consciously in this case.The movie also has one problem in it, in my mind, though some people can get a predictable complaint (and it is more watchful) I find that I thought the behavior played by Nancy Allen would be more full, especially considering that it has the right amount of screen time. Imagine he is doing a good job and what is given to him. And this is not good for the quality of the film. The film also has strong values, which most suitable today.but movies does not hit you over the head with it.i also liked the color of the music, included with Pino Dinaggioi that it was similar to music in the original Psycho.to, this music strengthened movie.i thought this movie was brilliant. for me, wearing kill (1980) is 10/10
