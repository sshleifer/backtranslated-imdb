I love bad movies. Not only, because it is often like entertainment as a 'good' film 'like' the Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood pathos, but it's often better than these films. And that's why I love Italian to destroy the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I love them especially this movie, Businessmen & Company. The director Ruggero Deodato has made the most beautiful movies, like the House on the Scope of the Park, and also the Atlantis Interceptors and Living as Cop, Die If Someone is a cinema enjoyable movies. But this is very bad. Carpenters are an idiotic film. Peter and Paul Paul as the Kibkuk Muslims Kutchek and Gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and skills to act. But if they can't do it, they cry and scream every time they do something important. In one place people try to be executed by the Brazilian brothers, and they run away from a strange way. <br /> <br /> They did bad, bad effects, very foolish stories, bad patterns, in fact everything is bad in this film. I can't describe how much I was thrilled when I looked at this first time. Traders & Company is a classic camping everyone should see immediately. If you think of Plan 9 Out of space is a fun camp, this will be a real killer.
