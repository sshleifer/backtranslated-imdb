"Roll!" The 90s were opened by a lover of Disney's cunning, "TaleSpin," a series of television cartoon that showed the characters from the "Jungle Book." Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker if they climb the Sea Sea if you have never seen it before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie, on the mountains, through forests, on the water, in the volcano, looking for adventure, looking for treasures, looking for pleasure, all in One adventure of cartoon adventure! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite and my family. This was running on The Disney Afternoon of the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I have seen once a vacation in 1996 before getting cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And news good: today DVDs here !!!!! Enjoy the joy and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
