This is one of the best movies of 80 years in my collection who I think about all the time. The Running Man is one of the best and very different movies of Arnold even today and when I first saw the Man of Race I was very excited to see a film like this. I just worship all the fights and this is really a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura, Professor of Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson, and Thomas Rosales Jr. who seem like death in his movies because he has been killed in films such as Universal Solder, the lost World, Quarter Cop 2, Predator 2, and among others. All Arnold fans should love this film from beginning to end because its action is full, star filled, and one of the best Arnold` to date!
