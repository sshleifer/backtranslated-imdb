As I enjoyed Ranzo's Ranzo movies, the three is clear enough: 'Who has gold?', The last Adventure for a Japanese member with a wonderful bag, is a fun piece of the cinema cinema, but it gives a little new to the issue. of thought when taking a big step back and away from the nonsense involved. The movie opens with the appearance of a female spirit, and it seems to go to explore the familiar area, something that may take a series in a new interesting direction; unfortunately, after spook is not worth anything but the Scooby Doo-style technique (cooked by the treasure treasury wants to empower people away from the lake where he hides stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue deserves to restore common elements from two film first, the result is a common thing. Once again, Hanzo examines investigations that require interviewing women through the use of its powerful penis, divide its enemies and abuse its masters. The way, we get a wild breach, a natural rape (Hanzo engages himself on women who sends to understand his will), and a sword war. If you have ever seen and accepted the first two films, you can also check this item to complete a set, but you can, this is probably less than satisfactory. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, planned up to 7 for IMD.
