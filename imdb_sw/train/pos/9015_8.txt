At first, this is from England, therefore, of course, I had a chance of 98% that would be intelligent and very good movies. I have never heard this film before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I told myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was also wrong. It is missing because these two movies are very different. My left leg was John Ford's film similar to this is the movie of the same Chaplin (not because this is so interesting, but Chaplin for a great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was sure that in 1990 the good Daniel Day- Lewis is changing very little by playing a person with a disability and doing so in a positive way. Here, very good Bonham-Carter did the same thing, but with very female feelings. Stories are well written and very intelligent. For me, miss Bonham-Carter offers one of the greatest women over the 1990s, and Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at his eyes! He had the most beautiful eyes of movies since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! He is also a true talent, as shown in many other movies. Look at this, you can't regret it! And very good work with Branagh too!
