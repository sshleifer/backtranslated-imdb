In general I would like to say that I loved the movie. Some scenes to fight are very good. Especially war against Leung Ka-Yan. One thing that was most helpful was the fact that they used Asia to play black man. I mean the truth. Talk about bad taste. In the battlefield, you can see one of the fighters on the floor laughing. Otherwise, Sammo copies of Bruce Lee's fight goes perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.
