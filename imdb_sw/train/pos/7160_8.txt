Movie's Disney which desires to do something different should be at least given a prize. "Holes" does not make the same mistake as a person can expect on the Disney movie about young people to set up camp. For the first time events are not described for details. Featured flashback actually serves the purpose and presentation of several mature topics that can be awesome viewer. I must admit that for the first time I was stuck away from the size of the movie. But I soon realized that we had to endure at that time to see the beauty of the story. In addition to this movie story also makes it a good way to interview ways that are used in restructuring centers. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach zero reading because they should dig holes to create character, as learning to learn did not contribute to it). "Holes" is a movie that is beautiful and beautiful. You must look!
