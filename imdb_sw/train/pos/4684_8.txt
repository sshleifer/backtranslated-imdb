Petter Mattei's "Love in Money Time" is an interesting film visible. Mr. Mattei gives us a clear picture of human relations. This is a visible film telling us what the money, power and prosperity do for people in different situations we encounter. This will be different on the play by Arthur Schnitzler on the same topic, the director moves to the current time in New York where all these characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another with someone else, but nobody knows about the previous point. Amazingly, the film has a modern elegant look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in. The only thing comes out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of solitude each one lives. The great city is not the most beautiful place where human relationships find true fulfillment, as one knows it is the case with many people we meet. <br /> <br /> Acting is good under the leadership of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and all other talented, make these characters live. We want Mr. Mattei good luck and are waiting for concern for his next job.
