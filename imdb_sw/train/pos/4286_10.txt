I saw this film (the English headline is "Who is singing there?") At the International Film Festival of Montreal of 1980. Winning raves then ... and disappearing. Shame of horror. It's brilliant. Gentle, ignorant, sad, and very funny. Script is a work of art. It has been 19 years and I have seen only a few of the comedies (or any other kind, for that matter) that can resemble its nature.
