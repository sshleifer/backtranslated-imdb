I saw the dream of Insomniac not the first time and I must say, I found it very good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you will love it. The hole of the hole takes place in his mind-or does it? Work from each other is the fast run and shaky and some events can be cut but it works at the end. The items on the DVD are just as good as the film, if not great for those fans of Dom. It has tons of time candidate from the set, login and good interview with the director. Anyone who has gone to make an independent film will like to watch Tess (director), Dom and everyone on a very close personal set of attempts to try this small trippy film. It was very nice and I am happy to have it in my collection.
