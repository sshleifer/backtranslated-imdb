This film, though widely witnessed, has never been released in the United States, such as the "La House" of Lahti's "Housekeeping", the same year. But if you can help the DVD Region 4 (Australia), this little masterpiece must be in your collection. There are still copies of the VHS available on the internet as well. David is added by a good story, with a memorable exhibition from his cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, Jan Adele's chief. Surprised, or perhaps not, this film and its stars did not know during the Academy Award, such as "Household Conservation", but you are happy with both - you will be glad you did!
