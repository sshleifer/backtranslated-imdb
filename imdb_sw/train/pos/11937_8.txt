That was obviously the case with the Angel in Outfield. It was on the eve of the night and I believe I didn't see the movie since my sophomore year of high school and now I am my fourth year of university. Although the film has many errors, it's just touch that you can't help but sit down, watch, and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Ranting of Danny Glover is just about on that you can't help but laugh loudly sometimes. Adds to the film and I'm sure what exactly the director wanted. In fact you feel the characters in the film though progress was not good. Must see. I strongly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
