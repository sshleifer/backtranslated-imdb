I'm not usually also in a special show (except for OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I am 20!), But, no kidding, after one part of the Reunion I was hooked. I can't even say how I was worried that it was the time it was against the Bush's speech last night because I was looking forward to the 1987 year, which will be next Thursday. Again, the crisis was unprofitable because, being a new show, it needs to create the following and have a second part behind the week kills a certain speed. It said, TV is not always suitable for Emmy to enjoy. I don't expect Reunion to take home any award, but I hope you will be able to catch my attention all the season. Are you looking at the first events of a series of loved ones years later? Sometimes you wonder how you have been cooked. The character building takes time. <br /> <br /> One part of the annual idea is wonderful, in my opinion. The only thing I can remember to do something like that is 24, and every session is at ... and having a good year is more realistic than the day it is possible! Please do this show shot. Rest on the form of art ... it's just a TV!
