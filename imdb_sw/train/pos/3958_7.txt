Moe and Larry are new men who are worried, after marrying Shemp's sister. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will get a reward if he marrys himself! "Men Attention" is a 1947 remake of "Brideless Bride," is considered by many to be one of the best vintage films and Shemp. Remake has many copies of the film. The new scenes, shot 17 May 1955, include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sister, with their cook of turkey laced and turpentine! A few new scenes tacked at the end of the film as well (twice for Dee Green was used; if you blink, you will never appear twice) plot to marry a sister. Budget issues, as well as a few bookings for two comics of the tape influenced the decision to use more footage. Even though the new films were still being made by Stooges, most of their releases in 1955-56 were created by old films and small photographed images inside. "Men beware," when one of these hybrids, you look and have entertainment; we get over the "Groom Brideless" again, and new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. This film is one of the last comic comics to shine a new footage of Shemp, and was released six weeks after his death. About 7 out of 10.
