Yes, this gets ten full stars. It is clear whether the day this fills is thought. The world sent Trent Harris a young man, very strange one day with Harris caught him on the tape, in the illusion of the true wrong. Evil ended in a tragedy with a young man, if only the other end could be written to his friend's story. Two other steps in the trilogy look at the story, and Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the role of young, respectively. The world spreads and cautiously caused by voting, and give us a broader perspective on the growing weird in vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!
