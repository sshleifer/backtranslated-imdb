A Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best feeling of kind. Gooding and DeNiro both offer wonderful displays of the heart in two leading roles, and holding the hand are very good, and stand-by with Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. The only "Nit" I can take is that the role of Theron was unnecessary and misleading (not his proper performance, it is only that the film seemed to add two unwanted pictures to take into account his role.) The characteristics, dynamics, and stage of real life stories are riveting and not easy. The transformation of the main characters and the way they learn to change their creation is a unique characteristic of the performers. Despite the length of the extreme film, pacing stays completely. The mark is also strict. <br /> <br /> Is this a popular Hollywood film? You are a bet. So, Mike Leigh addicting should leave the star, but everyone should enjoy it with power.
