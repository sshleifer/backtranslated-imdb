This movie is better and I would recommend hiring to anyone whose local video store owns. Or, even better, you can buy because the position you watch frequently. I can remember watching this film as a child and it was good at that time. But after looking at it again yesterday I've found it amazing. The best combination of comedy (although not as good as "Mr Magoo" - one of my favorite ones) and action. This is worth 10/10 and I hope that they will come soon (fingers crossed). If you are young or you have to take care of small children for anything then I would like to recommend this movie if it will save you for hours :).
