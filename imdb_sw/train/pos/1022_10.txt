Stargate is the best show ever. All characters are absolutely perfect for the responsibilities there. I love the relationship between the characters. If you haven't seen this show I recommend it very much. Although this plan is comparable to the stars of the stars most of the time cannot be because it is quite different. I am a fan of a star journey but I would like to show you the best of any star journey. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we can't get Stargate on our TV so if I want to see it I must give the DVD to the 10th season not out here yet I can't see it for a long time (which is very sad). However this program is very good and you must see, but warnings are very dangerous. So I briefly I like Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
