The series of vignettes, many of them spoofing television in the 1970s, but also with some digs in government and corporate America. One of the longest groups, "Traders" is not funny to me and I don't know what is parodying. Some others, however, are completely divide the side. I especially enjoy the part of the show show. Many of the bad words that I know are used in the film, and, if you refuse the full weaknesses, get away.
