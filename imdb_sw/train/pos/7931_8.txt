Man, if anyone was expecting a great movie zombie after reading that title, then you are retard and deserve to be upset. Like myself, I expected a flick of the budget of a zombie-and so that's what I got. I wasn't disappointed at all. I thought it was a small cool movie. Zombies were as much as they should be, because all the zombies were turned, so they are new-undead zombies. Obviously they did it because it would have been more expensive if they had done more on a zombie FX zombie. I understood anything, I don't know how anyone can play this film seriously. It is called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for God's love! Would you like to watch "Redneck Zombies" and every Uwe Boll film and actually make it beautiful? Of course no! Why there are some publications on IMDb stretch as school girls about this movie, I can't understand. Oh and Yes, there are the worst movies out there, then stop saying that this is the worst you ever seen, because you know you're full! Have you ever seen "ZOMBIEZ"? Au "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead"? These are some of the worst I have ever seen. If you can't see that it's a zombie movie under the open budget made by fans of a zombie movie, then there's something wrong with you. I was very happy. Pieces from me and I would also like to see the series.
