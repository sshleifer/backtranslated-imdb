In the book The Citadel The Movies of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a music leader. I'm sure I can't do better than that. It is a very important film in all works of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do very badly for this. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had given Gene Kelly out of Columbia where Harry Cohn had the inspiration to allow Kelly choreograph his own number and because of it, Cover Girl became classic. So if the mayor did not learn the lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly's artistic control. Anchors Aweigh had finished, Fred Astaire had an opponent to play for the movie dance. The main number everyone speaks to Gene Kelly here is dance with Jerry Mouse. At first Kelly wanted to make a number with Mickey Mouse of Walt Disney, but Disney was not lending Mickey to anyone. Mickey would have to wait until he made Roger Rabbit make the film out. It is not worried because MGM had half of the team's half-team teams Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> Kelly as a player always struggled to do something new and different on the screen such as Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, these two were allowed for all kinds of artistic control and were recommended for their work even if the film did not die. It was like everyone else inspired another for the greatest and best design, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any other studio. At Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to play a little. In fact Frank Sinatra once offered credit to Gene Kelly to show him how music should be done if he paid credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in finding him is Oscar for From Here to Eternal. When Frank Sinatra had a half of her contract being purchased from RKO and MGM insisted on a little artistic creativity herself. He would be friends with the team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his history Sammy Cahn explains how Sinatra emphasized writing his songs to this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote very good ballads for him to sing. One of my Sinatra numbers proposed is from Anweors Aweigh, I fall in Love easily. Frank sings himself in the piano on an empty bottle of Hollywood. It is Sinatra for its power. With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn got the rule of putting more song in Frank Sinatra's mouth than anyone else. They were friends of life and Cahn always named Sinatra and added a great step in his career. <br /> <br /> At Styne and Cahn's bet they said they could write a song just by using the chromatic level. They showed in Aweigh Anchors when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work for the Song of My Sudden Heart. It also made classical numbers. <br /> <br /> Here the real singing is the foundation of the plot. Two traders during the departure through a combination of conditions meet Kathryn Grayson and her nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to strengthen with Sinatra, Kelly says he can listen to Jose Iturbi. They use the film to try to complete it. My only desire in Aweigh Anchors was that Pamela Britton, who plays 'Brooklyn waitress' did not have the number himself. He received new ideas from his performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought him to Hollywood. I am certain that he had a cut and somewhere in the MGM vaults could still be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a good example of why music was not made again. All the talents of the creation were under the Metro-Goldwyn-Treaty agreement. If you had to pay the market value, the cost could retire the country's third state debt. <br /> <br /> The results of the film will be amazing.
