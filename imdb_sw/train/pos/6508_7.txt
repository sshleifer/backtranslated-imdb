I grew up looking at Scooby and I've been a fan forever. This cartoon goes away with the same old system that you can get boring to the audience. Crooks in the order of Mask finds age and this cartoon is a transition from it. It does not mean to replace the Scooby group is just a break of the old crime scene for the audience and the writers I am sure. The view of the cartoon is on Scooby and Shaggy who inherited large amounts of money and spend that money to overcome the world's triumphs from the mad scientist and his goons. Small group and small groups are included regularly. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo you can still know the bond between the boy and his dog, and the joke you come with. Enjoy only Cartoon and help creators / writers and producers so that this will not be the last cartoon of Scooby.
