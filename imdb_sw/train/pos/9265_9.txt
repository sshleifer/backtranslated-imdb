Various film directors from different countries have contributed much to the film for their ideas. As a result, we have seen different music at intervals. Jafar Panahi, unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in telling a simple story; Sexual stories are one of the main features of his leadership work. He believes on direct and with the key minder's view; he does not feel any feeling of going to Alienation or such objects to reach the audience. He is equally effective despite the usual. The obstacle (2006), is another romantic creation from him, where the East-Central Asian Gender control is steadily getting to everyone as a simple but interesting story of the movie continues. Now-day, when all of us scream out on the issue of Women's Rights, this film emerges quietly in our minds and it becomes harder for our important minds to present the message that the Rights of Human Rights is not a thing but an improper beauty, utopia. Paternity will never allow women to be strong.

At the end of the day, the ceremony came as the nation won a match that the girl could not see if she was locked in the field during the match.

The global epidemic has been dealt with easily and sometimes with humor which, in turn, weakens it to be constantly.
