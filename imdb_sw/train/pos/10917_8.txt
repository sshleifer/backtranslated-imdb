I've been able to find the Celestial region 3 DVD's The Five Venoms and the good work they have done. The wonderful definition of digital made and you must have it for any fan of Kung Fu. The story is straight forward, and it is already named and I will never come in again. Needless to say it is the fight scenes that many buy movie for, and do not disappoint. The only problem is few and far between and they seem on display. Bruce Lee can take this vote and drink a cup of tea at the same time! The hurdle and all the hurricanes come with all the "author" stars and the air "whooshes", which is a cool effect even though they really love it! <br /> <br /> I am giving this film B +. Good but not good. Somehow I don't feel better. The Golden Swallow, and the same director ten years earlier, had a good story with the best action.
