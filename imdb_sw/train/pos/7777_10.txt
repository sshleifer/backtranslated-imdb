Rich, alcohol Robert Stack likes to secretary Lauren Bacall. He drinks and is very happy he stops drinking. However, Bacall is proposed by secret friend and freight, Rock Hudson. And he takes the sister of nymphomaniac, Dorothy Malone, lust after Rock. Throw to a few problems with the movie goes without control (in a good way). The most interesting movie in Technicolor with fashions and jaw materials (see Bacall hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and wearing beautiful, suitable clothes. Basically this is the opera's soap and the production standards of the grade A. The story itself is very happy and some discussion at the beginning is a high upward. Acting with Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not good, but to see them so young and beautiful is good ... especially the stack ... when they cried the knees were weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is wonderful - she deserved the Best Player for Help for her role. She is sexy, violent, kind and compassionate ... all convincing. Rejoice, green garbage. Don't miss it!
