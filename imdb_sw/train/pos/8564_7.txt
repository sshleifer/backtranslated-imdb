I don't expect this film to be well understood by the audience from Romania. This describes something about the value, or maybe about the lack of the film world, but also describes something about how different history and even the lives of ordinary people were in Romania compared to other countries, even Eastern Europe. The film is a change of novel by Marin Preda, a controversial writer who died during the Communist regime just after the book was published. It says the story of a specialist, a professor of philosophy whose life has broken down after a false trial at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically the first part of the film describes the story of his fight for life in prison, the second describes his desire to restore his life after his release. His true release is only apparent, the 60-year-old Romania asks from him a variety of harmony and crime, but his struggle for survival is tough as prison. The film has been done well with some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the role of the front will be sometimes and elsewhere the star of mega, we can get here to see the beautiful of his wonderful art. Although there is suffering to tell the news and fall at times in non-important notes or role-plays, the film is still an important symbol for Romanian movies, as well as the process of restoring the ethics and history in the Romanian community.
