The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parent on the birthday of her father, which often has some kind of tragedy, the question is just what will be this year, and you will wonder ... It's a very good movie, and a story that has a perfect balance of humor and transparency, which are invisible. You are happy, hurt, and basically everything is in between. Finally you can not help fall in love with Mia (if you are a boy I think (great actress)) He is a very good actor, like most of the actors / actors. Enjoy it
