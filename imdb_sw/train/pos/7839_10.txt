Planned by critics at the time but loved by fans, this film has now become a classic. Combining the 'surreal' pictures that are being played on John Lennon's house amongst other sites and live images of Marc Bolan & T.Rex for the best, this film is not just for everyone who likes Marc Bolan but gives an interesting insight into these moments when Marc was scared of Ringo Starr's Beatles [who led it] and could even get a short spot from Reg Dwight one [Elton John] to bashing ivory in an amazing version [and never opened] of Tutti Frutti and rocking versions and the ballad of Children's Revolution. There are also positive events involved with Chelita Secunda [said that he 'created a glam rock' and its use of documents etc.], Mickey Finn and even actor from Catweazle! <br /> <br /> The most beautiful for me is the garden when Marc leaves the table to eat, sits under the legged in front of the string section and finds the acoustic versions of classic like Get It On with Slider. <br /> <br /> Very much, it was suggested !! Five stars [between five] and / or Rory
