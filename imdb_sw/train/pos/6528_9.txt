I saw this Documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in Cinema's small 200 seat on the main building at Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I really was in it. I like a mix of false events made. It's amazing set-design. Exhibitions appear to have occurred in the 1920ies or 1930ies. <br /> <br /> And music is very good <br /> <br /> I tested this 9/10 experience. * Destruction * * It's very strange. But this also combines in a new band and that is perhaps the same thing that I can't love in this Documentary. It is the most common use of links for the modern rock-clusters that played the Blues in a modern way. I do not appreciate their tracking tracks of amazing Blues songs. This is one kind of non-musical taste that I have found while looking at Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> Documentary was a solid-ovation in this preliminary survey in the small cinema, that the next Day Documentary was shown to everyone and ordinary tourists on the Croisette coast on an open movie. Although the sand, the quality of the estimates and the poor quality of voice may be a difficult experience to enjoy thousands of people who were seated on that night.
