The film confirms your identity and the community we live in. It is well done and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and they define the world outside the traditional cultural perspective. I believe it is to give a great insight into a small culture that pushes the views that the viewer has of society. It's amazing when more powerful for that reason. Some parts were hard to watch, as the reality is, but not done. It is the first time you look at it, but it gets better the second or third time; because you have had the opportunity to connect your ideas around the topic they are discussing and challenging.
