This film is very good, it should never wait for abdominal laughter to come for more than a minute and there is much more than the original film. In this there are the effects of traditional-boys-done-good-to-good-to-win-type adventure parodies. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get just cheap cheese using dirt; - indeed, there is a lot of that but all that depends on, not free. I loved this film and paid me Â£ 2.99 on the DVD, so for the entertainment value of money, it was the best film I saw this year.
