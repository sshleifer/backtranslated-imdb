(Sorry for my improper language, not a native speaker ...) Yes, this is a movie that requires the effects of responding. Personally I agree on all that superlatives that are close. But I will not use this non-existent way to describe the film here. Because those "perfect! One-and-only! Best-ever!" - technically makes other people leave (including me). So if you are looking for another 'Hamlet' which is likely to fight many movies and all movies - then don't lose this, if it happens to get anywhere. (Unfortunately not many people will have a chance to see it. It seems there is no DVD out there, and the German language version - which has been done well - is not available for any format.) : Ignore that you have reduced the two-hour (or more) version of this movie. It does not use and is unacceptable, and gives a bad impression of the film, which is interesting in a way that is interesting and flowing and architecture. And it was also dropped by 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
