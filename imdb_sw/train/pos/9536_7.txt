It is caused by a Japanese Japanese film about tiny creatures taking people and converting them into necroborg-zombie as a machine that drives and blows off so that the winner can eat the loser. In the midst of this two partners are infected. A wonderful expert on fear (?) It is for those with severe stomachs like blood and body parts go. Good taste keeps me from explaining what is happening here, but lets you just say surprising to him. If you would like this and form several steps on the lighter content by all means see this film. Of course I am not usually enjoying this film for anything but how sick and misleading they go to the level. Here I was so surprised that I might suggest to people I know who love the real gory movies. find. There is an internal logic not available in these films. 7sha out of 10 for those who love blood and chopped legs, zero or more to run and hide caution for everyone else.
