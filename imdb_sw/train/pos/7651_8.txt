The interesting movie of TV derived from the real truth, presented with a description of one of the leading characters, of the prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi has a younger brother, who is responsible for determining if he will appeal to the death of his brother. But when he visits him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has no connection with Koteas' ability to act. He is seen only as a prisoner of a proletarian root based on "G.Q." magazine, and also modern language for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This understanding came after a reunion with an old friend, whom I had never seen for nearly 15 years, which he used in several Panamanian prisons. The boy I knew is gone, not only because he is an old man, but because of his long exposure to the punishment system. There is a prison and there is a prison, one must say, but one prisoner in "Shot In Heart" is obviously out of this world.
