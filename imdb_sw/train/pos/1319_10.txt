This film is great fun. I recommend you look at yourself and then check back with your friends. I did last night and it was interesting how Norma Khouri could pull everyone in his world! I felt very strange to look at my friends through one way of roller as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a good film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the film! I had seen a condom next to the Norma Khouri level, but no where near the same size is finished. He made the illusion of non-gullible and rich people in my Berkeley CA A.A. a group where everyone believes everyone else. He was able to "guarantee" only people who seemed very good to do. Who knew he could steal more than 100k (in 1987 when it was a real money) after being a city for just one month. His victims were very volatile if they were in their first month or week to be wise. He was evil for good laugh and a good smile on his face. The above crime is not comparable to what Norma Khouri did to her former neighbor. But I don't want to give anything away. I have seen this one night at the movie night of the night, "Show" I think. This is a regular fan of filmmakers who get the most experience of being considered completely in seeing something and having your mind beaten. Just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them anything. It is a very entertaining film, it goes fast and it doesn't. <br /> <br /> This should be a classic international at all times. I believe all the good movies will eventually increase to the top. Time will be very good for this film. I am only sorry no one has yet to feel, in other ways that make the most amazing. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were amazing. They deserved to win the best document. Try this!
