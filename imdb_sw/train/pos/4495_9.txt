Outside the house is a different country and the family strives to cross the line between the authorities of Dads and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> Period taken; Bakelite light rises, Georgian floor, photo rails, wall paper, short skirts, fine shoes, mini costumes, modern coverings .... The area is taken; The wind blew the glacier covered with rocks, stone walls, society, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Love, struggle, honesty, faith, deception, matches, behavior, maturity, loss, poverty, welfare, sacrifice, fear, acceptance, revelation, comedy and reproduction are all there. (And there is no special order!) It is a great speech of family tension that resembles today. The fact that some of these are not directly interconnected is the covenant itself for day-to-day but the fact that all of them here are the covenants of acting skills, stories and leadership. If there is anything wrong about this film, it is that the tension that is inserted in detail and advertisements has been removed very little to the end. Maybe I didn't know him - the penalty and the tension that many young people have lost if they are fighting it (**) - maybe the film is trying to send it too - you should do it. <br /> <br /> What is the film trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents are also struggling, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, changes, things can end with happiness. Parents: Don't try too much! Try to remember that your help is the key to their well-being. It looks so simple? Sometimes the film feels like it is then when you see how much it is challenging and unlocked. <br /> <br /> The film is classic. It is not their problems.
