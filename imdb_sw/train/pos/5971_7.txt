Skippy from Family Relationship goes from purity-cutting to a metal child in this fun movie. This film seems to have been done to deal with all the angry parents who said that the metal music had turned their children into evil or made them commit suicide - except in this star of the dead devil's devil trying to return from the grave (using Skippy to Help). And when the plot is corny and cliche, corniness (for example, the ugly green mist to remove the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack is what make the movie so hilarious (and big). And of course, nothing like Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher who asks what happened to the song of love :). Certainly a movie to have a few friends on a good laugh. And when you're there, make a double feature with Slumber Party Kill 2 - there's a "bad rocker" (as described in the video box) killer drill in black w / hem. You must see for fans of cheesy film.
