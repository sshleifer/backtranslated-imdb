This is the most popular movie of Sammo. This is not a dragon intervention technique, the main character (Sammo) is considered by Bruce Lee and it makes him very good for a person of his size. The story of how his fighting makes loved ones trouble - then fight. Oh, fighting. Positive events, high speed and high impact (white man who plays the striker seems to hurt the real one of Sammo's kicks). The most fun of this movie was basically without a pretense. There is Jim Kelly who looks at someone (one of the three professionals employed to take Sammo), but he was a Chinese boy in the blackface of afro. Come, did not have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I have seen that the artificial white-like-hell "Chinese people" in the old American movies too. <br /> <br /> This is one for any fan of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
