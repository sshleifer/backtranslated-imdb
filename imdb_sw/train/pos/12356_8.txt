Contrary to the summary of some people, the women shown on the film do not have a geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) who live outside the most popular district pleasure, and their lives and experiences represent the life of a large number of women of the Tokugawa era. I can't say the stories were targeting, but their charm is in a normal state. The theme is normal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice. I really enjoyed the art of art and acting. I felt like I had a photograph of time and place I could never see. Actors, especially 4 women who played the main oiran, were happy to enjoy. I would just like to recommend this movie to people who want the taste of Japanese culture, or those who enjoy the story of calm and emotional. It is a good example of both.
