Watching "Motion" is a very satisfying experience. Uncategorized movies are such a rarity, when someone comes as "Impulse", it's something to embrace. Script is logical, and very creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn, and Bill Paxton, provides reliable performances. This can be like a zombie film, but "Impulse" is far more than any "borrowing", and nature proclaims within almost every area. You get the feeling that something like this can happen, although the script is a real fiction. From the opening of "grabber" until the credit card, you will be pleased. Very entertaining and certainly recommended. - MERK
