I wanted to see this for a long time, James Merendino is a good director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought it was a follow-up following that however, it begins to pull. Acting and direction were severe. In fact everything that appeared in the film was spinning except for the script. Sometimes, the only thing that put my attention is the fact that in cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. See the great filling with Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
