Hate is a very good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the film and was perfect for parts! It's hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do? As I watched this I thought why they should do all these things. It is wrong but they learned their lesson when choosing the wrong person! Also if you get this film on TV to watch because it's beautiful!
