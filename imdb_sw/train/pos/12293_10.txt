This is the best film, and it is a kind of treasure that one can find only through modern cinema displays, if it is not available on video / DVD. The way the film begins with the two lovers coming, and ends with their departure (though much of it happens in the middle, and they don't want one place at this time), gives you a sense of closure, and the feeling that all is the same as the world. If you have a chance to see this film, then do. I can't wait to see it again, and you want it to be opened in general.
