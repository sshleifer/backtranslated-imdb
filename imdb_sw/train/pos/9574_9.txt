This has to be one of the best movies from HK for a long time, I was waiting to keep my hands on this film just to look at the head. The loads of the wonderful actors in this show and I was especially impressed by Sam's insane character's impossibility and the Edison exhibition of the killing machine, which has completely overturned its image of the statue. I would certainly recommend to those looking for a stylish and operating film. However, I must warn you, this is also the same movie that is the same, if every character in the movie is in some kind of end of the dead and their own problems, and are struggling to breathe. It makes you think about what life is about.
