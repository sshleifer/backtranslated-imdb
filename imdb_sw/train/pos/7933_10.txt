Good times working with Brothers Quiroz, and grown all over this project as "Guy on Benchi." I was surprised how they succeeded in achieving all the features of the real "B" film. I hope you have a chance to work with the Pumpkin Team team team again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and I have been recognized by the public for several times since the release. When one was actually in a video shop and a damn girl almost lost her mind. It was very good and it was my first autograph as I signed her receipt. One day I asked a girl at Blockbuster if the movie was rented often, and she confirmed it by looking at it on the computer. At the time it was the most lease of Ring2 which was also a new release at the same time ... Title actually gets quick interest in more urban markets. He also saw that movies are not always restored by a customer who leads me to believe the movie is very good people don't want to .... Look for ZoMbIeS when hood will get!
