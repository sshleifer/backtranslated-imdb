The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was very close to follow after Alan Quartermain (or at least is Alan Quartermain TYPE's behavior), that the director '85 made the mistake of stealing the IJ movies to talk to the story very deeply. What you got as a finished product was the confusion of the name of Alan Quartermain, in the improper podge of implementing the IJ saga (with a touch of Austin cheese-esquire cheese here and there). It was written by many critics to be "great beauty," or "unintentional comedy." Unintentional is a word. This movie has never been a pleasure to be pleased; witches, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is ignorance rather than envy. With this new M4TV series, you get more stories, promotion of your leadership behavior, powerful images, and fine, even, a mix of entertainment. This story is long; much longer than its predecessors, but surely if this version changes the true story and not just a step with Eye Candy. Although it deals with all the actions and Candy Eye, it also collects an error made in the 1985 version by forgetting all IJ together and returning to the source equipment for AQ, by making a good, well-thought-out plot, and agreeing to the smaller plots. Now this attempt is not all efforts that are Indiana Jones. Neither is the attempt of the poor to be so. This car is a plot and character driven by a good AQ / KSM saga. Selected in the South African area, the audience is given good vistas (if damaged), African indigenous cultures, and beautiful wildlife pictures to mix well with presentations and stories here. Steve Boyum was completely surprised by this, if I had never joined his vision. In fact, I did not like much work as a director, to this test. I hope this is more than a new vein of talent and less fluke which appears to be. This version has a rate of 9.8 / 10 on "TV" level from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
