Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards almost every area and if you want more from the cinema you become quite unreasonable. It feels like during the late proceedings, when the series was no longer a way to burn, but it was still more amazing than not, think back or UK and you can't be too far away from the mark. Pamela and Denise are interesting, interesting and well aware that they are not what they do, although you can give me a lot of things that I am told to love. Casting help is strong, even if some of them are not very good; I can't see a couple of turns back to a film that has already forgotten to do many different things, then just smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder are Ace and I hope you hate me for it.
