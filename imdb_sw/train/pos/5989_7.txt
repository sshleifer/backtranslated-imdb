The movie begins with a group of children in the reform school and focuses on a child called 'Gabe', who seems to work hard to get his pardon. Gabe and her sister move to a new neighborhood to make a new start and soon Gabe meets with the last dead children. Children in this film are little punks, but they are much younger than they were in some of the previous films and less, they mean the punks. However, in this neighborhood there are also criminals who are making fraudulent insurers through burning and seeing Gabe as fragrant - after all, he would be making a school and no one believes that he was innocent once he was planned. So, when Gabe is ready to return to the "big house", it is up to another group to heal and open real obstacles. "Dead End Kids" was seen in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s and the film was generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH FIRES FIRTS). However, after the contracts of the boys, they continued with the Studios of Monogram and the film, to put it well, they were very weak and formulaic - and Huntz Hall and Today Gorcey became pretty much the whole show and the group being named "The Boys Boys". Because EVERY CHILDREN HIS EXAMPLES had a good writing and production code. And Hall and Gorcey did not interfere with the camera, it is a very good film - and almost gets a 7th mark (almost close). In fact, when this is not a very good film, it makes sure it's so fun to see, so I'll give it 7! Indeed, it was a tad hokey - especially towards the end when children took the law into their own hands and Reagan ignored the Law of Justice - but it was also quite entertaining. The Dead End Kids perform their best performances with Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided the best support. In fact, this part of the film was unknown and impossible but somehow it was still interesting and interesting - so if you could stop unbelief, it works well.
