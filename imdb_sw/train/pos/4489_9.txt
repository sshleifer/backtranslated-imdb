This film is not about cats and mats as described in other comments. Its about a cat that has spent up to 8 of its 9 life and now lives in fear of losing its last. Cat is jumpy and afraid of death at all, so the name 'fraidy cat'. The old life of Fraidy offends him as ghosts that come out of a different era and tries to kill him, but he is very afraid of nine lives that are represented as a cloud in the shape of number 9 and provides bolts. very old now but it would still be fun for children if you have to hold a copy. I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
