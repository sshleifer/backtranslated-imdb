Everyone should see this film because each of us is broken in some way and can help us identify 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) It is very important to use a child who needs. There are many out there. Thinking that the movie was really fundamental to the real person made us think a lot about life and how the world is and will always be. Destruction, but the damage should not reach your home. We all have a choice! Of course suggest this ... and when you are there, I would like to blow in "color paint" and "woman, you have opened" and TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies that depend on life and give us a picture of life.
