The main problem of the first "Vampires" movie is that there are no sympathetic characters. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a good hunter of vampire and a charismatic vampire. Vampire Girl You are certainly a very cool vampire since Frost's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately there are some good concepts like the cooling place of a slow-motion restaurant (why does the siremala use more than this?) This film is not so good as it can. I expected to see the power vampires in action and at least one long lasting choreographed struggle sequence (for example within the city) and left a certain disappointment. While "Los Muertos" goes much faster than its predecessor, it still pulls a bit in some place (though there is no place as bad as "Vampires" made). Items like "Vampires" however the top of this film close to the end are not too strict. Most of the above can be seen as "Los Muertos" is a bad movie but it is definitely not. In general it is enjoyable with an array between the best intervals in the form. It is not a casual dracula record (as almost every other vampire movie out there) is not a non-intelligence festival like Blade II. It can only use more excitement. I would like to see the third item made by the painter but should not happen. It is also a predictable way. You have to have gone away - it would have made the film very unusual.
