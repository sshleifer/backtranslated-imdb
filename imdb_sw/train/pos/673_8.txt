For the most part that we call understanding, there is still much that we do not know about what was described by the first tribal elders. In each case, there is a lot about the dangers of knowing more. On the contrary, there are those who warn us about not preparing what they warn is 'End of Time.' In this film called "End Wave" natural ethnic origin is killed for no apparent reason. While those involved are arrested, they remain silent in order to destroy the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) has a Protection Advisor to defend the accused. Although haunted with a picture of the prophecies from his childhood and warned by modern signs given by the compassionate Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend the crime as a Tribal Act and therefore not less than the right. The film is full of incredible, dark-tempered images of the catastrophe of the world of rest and warn about the island's tsunami and punishment. Black player and deep traditions what gives this film a fear of horror and therefore is not a desperate heart, in fact, the simple haunting wonders can last for years in the murder of the innocent movie. Good silent player. ****
