I was very surprised by this film. I would like to measure the standard as one of the old western past. I say anything: acting, mature conversation, theoretical story and the best movies. Director Anthony Mann, who has made a lot of well-known films near the same time, also made some western like this. It has a black-looking film. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated with several West this time. . If you like this film, I recommend the Mann-Stewart film "Bend Of The River." In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam," (Stewart) who owns this prestigious gun Winchester 73, the weapon won the right with a square in the race. It is therefore stolen and approved from the villagers to the villain. All consumers are interesting characters. Help Stewart makes this interesting story is Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All are happy to enjoy. It was a little stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson playing Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can't have everything.
