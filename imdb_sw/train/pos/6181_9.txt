The most enjoyable film, let you know how to watch the old / hidden music. It can't come close to Agatha Christie or even the secrets of a celebrity as a film film, but it's more interesting than a "boy meets a girl" or "let's put it on the show" of backstage music. As a music, not Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can add a classic "Coctails for two" and weird "Sweet Marijuana". The film runs at the exact time of the action show, opening the night of "Obstacles", where the killings - and soon another - is discovered back. Is the killer found before the fall of the curtain? Indeed, but the search is fun, even though it is possible to be destroyed by a deficit of comic aid (luckily in the shape of a shapely goddess of chorus girls, Toby Wing). The stupid hat is just a little fool, the leading hero is just a little piableble, the woman leading a bit of grace, bitchy dima bit bitchy bit too, and a very happy waif is very dedicated, but as the stereotypes go, they are beautiful stylish. There is a beautiful girl of chorus girls, better chosen than girls for Busby Berkley's music period, which is sometimes a little over the whole side. Yes, this film would be better than it was, and Duke Ellington's number is embarrassing, but if you like to dive into old movies, this will be a very tragic journey.
