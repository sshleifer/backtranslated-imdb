Let's start by saying that the English headline of this film "The Power of Kangwon" is quite bad. It is because in the Hong Sang Soo film, no real shots of war, trouble and conflict. With the idea of ​​establishing the power of the state is not good or valid in the context of this film. If we were to judge this film with its head of Korean language, "Kangwon-ui" will appear as an example of crying over the emotional shock of its young characters whose mind is not resting. The people in question are young girls who are always in the process of expressing their feelings, counseling. If making a film without anything could be approved as a good film player, then Hong Sang Soo should be honored as a brave film manufacturer whose films are talking about any shortage of human relationships, feelings and life. not, this is the only conclusions of this film.
