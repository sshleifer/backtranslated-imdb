This cartoon was wonderful, but the story was actually more detailed and more impressed than other cartoon movies. We have a girl in a very proud camp with other unprotected friends, but only brothers and sisters who are just like her. He reaches the lowest point and when the opportunity arises he makes a contract with the denomination as a demon. I saw this film very real to life and justice when things are not so bad, the girl sees what she has done, feels sad and then changes and then helps the dark, historical creature to learn the humanity of love. Twins also improve, by helping the little bears and then feeling a sense of self-reliance too. A very good message for children, although some of the features of the film were wonderful, it was still a fun film. Music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film better
