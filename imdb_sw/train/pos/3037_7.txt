The movie "MacArthur" begins and ends in the Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata College of American Army of West Point on Hudson. We see the 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur gives a start-up address for the 1962 graduates on honor of serving their country. The film goes around two hours long on Gen.'s leadership work. MacArthur as a controversy that begins in the dark hours of WWII on the island of Corregidor in the Philippines at the end of 1942. <br /> <br>> When asked to leave the island to Australia before the Japanese army invaded General MacArthur for The first in his military career almost ignored orders directly from his US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his men at their great time for MacArthur's fear, with his wife and little child, he did what he was told just to hate to remind him of war. It was the reason, his escape under fire from death or transfer to the Japanese, which dismissed MacArthur's wife to use all her influence to get FDR two years later launched a massive Philippine invasion, rather than the island of Formosa, to return her promise to all the people of The Philippines with thousands of US POWS left behind. That he will return and return to the ability of the US Army and Navy to strengthen his commitment! Over the past two years until the destruction of the Philippine islands, Mwac MacArther beat the Japanese forces in the Southern Pafific in several island island islands that were unique and starved by thousands of Japanese soldiers in surrender. Generally made that the loss of more than US military losses then another joint commander in the Pacific War! It was 1950/51 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur won his greatest victory and his most defeated military. After opening the North Korean Army in the brilliant and fully executed, the American bandages who suffered under 100 injuries, the back door or left to Inchon's hook. MacArther impressions cannot be used to send US / UN forces under his command to the very border, near the Yalu River, the Communist Red China. He told his assistants that he faces the threat of major land attacks and the Chinese Communist troops. MacArthur insisted, however, until the attack took place to cut the US and UN forces into branches. The unmistakable wave of attacking Red Red forces forced US / UN forces to return to the "Big Bug Out" of the 1950s and their very lives, leaving all the back equipment back to the North American border and leaving the city. South Korean head of Seoul! This happened to be one of the major military disaster in the history of the United States and US forces lose record, in the Korean War, 1,000 live on the first-Nov day. 29/30 1950-the Communist invasion of Chinese! <br /> <br /> Shock and shame in what was allowed, due to its own pride, what happened MacArthur did against it against developing Communist Chinese and Noth Koreans forces but its own Commander and General Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, for it did not have spin or guts to do what is happening: Introducing a complete invasion of the Chinese Communist minority and nuclear weapons if it should prevent its troops from overrunning the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman who had taken enough garbage from Genesis MacArthur to finish his mouth to the public how he was fighting without going out, as MacArthur wanted him, against China's nobles is the last straw! April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman without faithfully served Genesis MacArthur from his command as the Chief Commander of US / UN forces in Korea! Pres. The Truman warranty but very unlikely also, for the lack of the MacArthur war strategy, prevented the Third World War from the Soviet Union-Communist Communist Party - whose time-like US-had an Atomic Bomb! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to lose Mr. MacArthur was also a major reduction of his choice again in 1952 and his election numbers were very low in the mid-20-year that he left-March of that year - from the US President's Campaign in Disaster Gen MacArthur was almost at a time when the political and military situation in the world changed how to make future battles. Despite the nuclear war now, in 1950/51, the reality would have been suicide for the nation to go out, such as Gen. MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese and thus most likely to touch the nuclear death that would have locked not the USSR and Red China but the whole world! It was the key truth of the future war that Gen. MacArthur had never been taught, since A and H Bomb has never been established, in West Point. Back to 1962 we can now see it. MacArthur, having finished his first speech in West Point, was an old and wise soldier and, since his retirement from the US Army, an old man in his feelings about war and massive loss. One thing that General MacArthur was taught at a young age, from his father of the United Nations Parties of the United Nations Douglas MacArthur Sr., who relied on his entire life is that for soldiers like the battle itself he must be the last - not the first to solve the issues among the nations. So they are soldiers who fight and die in it. It took the whole life, with the arrival of the nuclear age, for Genesis MacArthur to finally realize how his righteous and wise father, Mr. Mr.'s Conqueror, as himself, was the truth!
