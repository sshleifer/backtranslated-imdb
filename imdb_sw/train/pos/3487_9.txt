Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the largest Wrestlemania but I would put it on myself, on my 5th, if not the top 3. It has many things, and it actually led to the birth of Era Attitude, which was WWE's best, in my opinion . HBK has the heart of the lion, and he put on Austin as he did, when he went out, he was a clean class for his side. It has one of the most hot groups that you ever see, and has J.R and The King in announcing the best !. ? The battle of the royal pop LOUD team for the return of L.O.D. It's not a fan of royal warfare, and this is still the average one. Very likely, even when you see it, obviously L.O.D will prevail. Watch Sunny for 8 minutes or so though, definitely helps. <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </> / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / <br /> <br / Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Disposal gets an amazing pop, and its door. Fast, high-flying, and very exciting. If these two had a lot of time, they would have to overcome the ceiling, and the items. Waste is successful with Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart The emphasis here, is Chyna is considered delivered to death. Nice pop for Owen, a mixed reaction of the trip. The real, grounded match, that's one of my favorite Wrestlemania, really. The two are very well mixed, and Owen can go with anyone. Journey overcomes, and the interference of Chyna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> Match the combination of Tag. Marc Mero & Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. Define pop for Sable, don't hear it at the time, for the woman. Sable actually seems to be hot, and the crowd just grows! Sable ordinary songs, and circles every time it gets the ring. It is not bad to match the mix, it had an antics of entertainment, and it passed the time well. The Sable team is winning, while Sable plays TKO. 2 1/2 / 5/1 / W / WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs Rock | C | Before examining the match, I would like to remember the Rock showed its great potential, and her interview with Jennifer Flowers, before her match. Nice pop for Shamrock, high temperature during Rock. I lost so much, and I thought the latter was stupid, though Shamrock's antics snapping an amazing sight, and the crowd went nuts for it. The rock keeps the head, while Ref reduces the decision. The Dumpster match, for the WWF Championship Team / <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The Outlaws Outlaws. The lost are not over, as they were at this time. The group is really dead for this, but I thought it had some hardcore bits, and some look checking. Cactus and Terry win last names. The Undertaker vs Kane. The great time of ovation, for Undertaker. Better than coming out of Wrestlemania 20, and for the big match of a man vs husband, this was very good. It was very good out, and Undertaker take the patient to watch the eyes, through the table. WWE was good, by making Kane looking for power, even for failure. After the tombs of the tomb 2 kick out, the last Taker eventually subtracted, and 3. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF championship. <br /> <br /> Specialist Visitor "Mike Tyson" <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. The meeting is going to shp t for Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed mix, for HBK. This is a very special match, one of the biggest events of wrestlemania in history, you can know when J.R is even out of breath. HBK offers all of it, in what should be its final match, and Austin has never been better. Enmity and electricity from the crowd is wonderful, and it is exciting as it receives. Austin wins and stunner, and Tyson joining the 3:16 to hit michaels. The victory of Austin's ceremony, it is wonderful to see, with one of the most people you ever see, the King said, they were going to nuts. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Under the bottom. Wrestlemania 14 is one of many true people. It has everything you want in Wrestlemania, and the true cup started the Era view. This is very special to me, because it was Wrestlemania 1 I saw, behind 98. "The Era Austin, has started!" 9 1/2 / 10
