This was a good movie. It was not your usual battle to open but something little different. This movie showed us recruiting in pre-war training and not really fighting battles. This film is one of the most realistic views of war and army than many other films like this was done. Colin Farrel did a great job in the show of the army and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed well. See Colin Farrel leave from b grade to grade in a few years, You will never think it will happen. I will also add that the creators of tigerland did a good job in imitating movies in 2000 and made it seem like 1970 was a good touch. Its beauty to see talent is used wisely and I hope to see it again soon.
