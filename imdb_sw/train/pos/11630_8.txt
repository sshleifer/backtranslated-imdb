The red eye is a very good thriller to watch on Saturday night. Strong acting, good villain and unexpected action. Some may not want to see this film because it may take a little of 85 and 88% of the film is on the plane and just talk. Don't worry to take it off so well with the wise and good conversation. <br /> <br /> Movie PG-13 seems to be a new cause for director Wes Craven. But he certainly deserves more violence as he can get into this desire. <br /> <br /> This most powerful film has been sent. This film required good actors to give talks and exhibitions. If they did not have these actors it would have been lost and provoking. We had Rachel McAdams from the boys of the mean and wedding. Cillian Murphy from Batman Starts with 28 days Later. To overtake this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2. <br /> <br /> Walking in this film was good. When only your thinking is going to get boring they throw a twist at you. Luckily this is not a long film and it doesn't matter like that. The best time is the Bird Airplane Plan. <br /> <br /> Here is my flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not shade. <br /> <br /> 8/10
