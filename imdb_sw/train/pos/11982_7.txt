This is what I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the show but it was very wrong. > EL EL EL! <br /> <br /> Stealing story lines from old TV shows. They even stole from "Family Partirdge." Then in part 1 "Partridge family" is mentioned. Officials play different roles in different periods. MTV Martha Quinn is well-known to do this, especially when playing himself in the section 1. <br /> <br /> The character of Michelle should not take a joke but then make this child make a "revenge" for his sisters with joke with them about it. <br /> <br /> The lines of the story that came & entered into part 1. Joey to get a TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard from it again after that. Danny suddenly plays guitar. Part 1 he is teaching soccer, 1 part he is teaching softball / baseball. Game 1 and you're out Danny? Jesse & Joey continue to get jobs quickly without experience. Just in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I liked D.J. & Anime of Stephanie. You want Jodie Sweetin can learn from Candace Cameron Free & had an adult life of drug addicts.
