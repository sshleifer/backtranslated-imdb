Dog Devil: Hound of Hell is a very good film. It has a good job for casting including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong.The music is spooky and offers that glass devil! I liked the effect on the dog and I think the creature itself looks really cool with its horns, frill as part of his neck, and he did really good! If you like the film fears and have not seen the Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and they can get and buy this ordinary film then do it because it's a good movie and I don't think you will be faint!
