I was watching this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I just remember without precision. If you ask me, it was a good show. The two things I remember are certainly the opening and opening of the theme. Apart from that, everyone was thrown. The writing was also very powerful. Exhibitions were high, too. I hope some network brings back so I can see every part. Before I close this, I would say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I don't think I've seen every section. Now, in conclusion, if a network returns back, I hope you catch it one day before leaving the air for the benefit.
