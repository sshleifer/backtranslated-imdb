I was interested in reminding the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni passing through many films that have not been recognized to be on VHS; however, I was given a lot of a gorgeous Christmas marathon, I just had to do with this! If it does, it shows one of its best performances - and he was certainly Oscar-chosen for it (and the film itself is also respected). This was also one of 14 collaborations with another well-known star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, usually, play against kind here - he as a single housewife and he is gay! By the way, the title of the film has two meanings: the leading characters are brought together in the historic day that Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long-term memory pictures), but mainly refers to the star '' encounter 'which will be they include the time of friendship, revelation and briefly, enthusiasm - though everyone knows that the return of their normal life is inevitable, which leads to the end of a very unpopular film. This is close to the two characters (with all the other characters - safe for our concierge of the apartment which the story is done in fullness - which includes the husband of Loren and the Christian husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, just seen the manual hour first and fast); yet, a short scenario does not prevent the Scola director (for record, this is the 7th film that I have witnessed and I have more than 3 on VHS) and cinematographer cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so that the results - though low - key - are far from awesome: The camera is allowed to move different parts of a large building, taking into account the case closely or gently as the condition is required, but always carefully. <br /> <br /> Stories, of course, depends entirely on two star performances to convince them, and both are provided (their screenshots are not quite possible); it is interesting, however, that when Loren walks away from the prize in their home home, it is the Mastroianian still moving outwardly (film, in large quantities, it seems to focus on her gender deficit and Anti-Fascism!) who generally attracted the international audience!
