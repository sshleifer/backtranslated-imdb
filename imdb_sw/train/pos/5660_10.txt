NIENDA event or 2 when the original show happened but when I look 1 part on netflix I also walk. I watched the whole series in 2 days.) I was very fond of Gary Cole's behavior. First he is totally guilty and begins to love the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His people Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson meets Satan is good. Painting, charismatic, smarmy, and uh type of danger and for "kind" I mean "true". I want to be like him when I grow up. Black Lucas is also good. These words are also great. However, I thought this was one of the best TV shows at any time and you were able to see it.
