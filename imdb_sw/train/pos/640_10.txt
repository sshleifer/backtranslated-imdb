I and my sister saw last night's victory ... it was very good we were asked for anything. hahaha .. I think I've stumbled for the season! .... they have other real actors. The head coach and the player who likes the ring is very good and the plot has already found me but I don't know how they will put it for a long time .. probably will have some big twist tho..i cant wait until Tuesday .. finally who Jeremy sumpter is? I can tell hes to be great! he was very good we loved for his character at the same time. greedy waiting for the next section .. GO Jeremy! Aimee
