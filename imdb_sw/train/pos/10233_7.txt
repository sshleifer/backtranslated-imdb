I have been willing to watch Hong Kong movies, but all have failed to meet my expectations ... even now! BURNING PARADISE has no more humor than HK movies, nor is the second level of the level you have played on the film. The story is not complicated, but they have no incidents that have come to fill a certain "mind" (the only military military that I have seen is connecting TIGER, but since Hollywood is not really a HK movie for me). There are some incredible combat scenarios in this film, from the first (which is the most cool one I ever seen, but it's short) at the last end stations! But mind, there is also a lot of blood run (people cut half, overturned, etc.). Production is good and special effects show that the fantasy of the author can be fulfilled though some shots should be good technical (see: the paper that he throw and got pinned in the wall!). Yep, not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my famous Hong Kong film, is Ringo Lam! And I'm sure if the spirit will look further from this director! Ace.
