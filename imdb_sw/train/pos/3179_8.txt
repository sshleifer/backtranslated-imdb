Who made this film? I love this film? A person has a sense of wacky humor. what gives the film as deep. Without being a comedy is just a group of ideas. Who cares. It may get to laugh, but it comes through you like a half-good hamburger ... next ... They come upon you. I started this film to think "Oh, I get - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup." And it's that - but if there is attention there is a small text and character when you fill out. For this film breathes. It makes suggestions that give pause - if you are available to see - and then, of course, it continues its unhappy way. You are not sure if you sign a suspension contract during the film. Between truth and surgery It is one of the points of this film. Crosseyed is not perfect, but intelligent people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> Right room displays are HOOT completely. Keep your seat.
