This typical Mamet film provides a sense of tranquility, according to what makes a brave person (Joe Mantegna) good. Investigating whether psychological research and psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly drives away from its world with the most common side effects. Sent by many of the players available are several Mamet films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and are doing their regular work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and often wondered why he was not the best known player than he was. Maybe I'm not looking at the right places! <br /> <br /> The movie continues at a slow pace, and a flat dialog, still continues the level of tension that logically leads to a bang-up ending. You would like to expect really to stop at the end time, but I have raised it up and satisfying. I love this film!
