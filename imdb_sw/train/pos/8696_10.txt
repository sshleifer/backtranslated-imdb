One of the improper standards of the 1980s, Events ... shows a bright-satanic satire and excellent exhibition from Arnetia Walker (how did she get tons of responsibilities after this?) And Wallace Shawn. It is used the flavor of class wars and people in these classes. The writing is a hierarchy and characters, while not a trick, they don't care. And, sorry, but Asian groups (if you can call one Japanese boy adding one of the other characters "gang") are not set to "social value" if other comments should be. The value here is in what the movies are fun and in the worst way it does. I found that creativity, funny, and idiosyncratic.
