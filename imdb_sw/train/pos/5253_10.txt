I don't know why people are so interesting and shape this film! Remember people, this is a SNL movie, not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and nature in the field or direction! Ladies Man is a hilarious movie, though it is ridiculous sometimes, and thrown out with, as usual, the WONDERFUL performances and Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters can not be trusted but its comedy! I don't know how anyone can laugh too much during this hilarious film. Otherwise, all I ask is that people take this as it is - the SNL Serie, which is ignorant and not angry. There is nothing that will win the prize, but however, the modern gold comedy. "10-4 Apricot!"
