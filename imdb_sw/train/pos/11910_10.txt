The most fun is opening with Trevor Howard in his Jag circuit and ending in dockside in Liverpool. It is a pleasure to lose if an old user begins to set up his work as he gets a lot of R&R butterflies (how is the UK?) Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons helpless from London to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he has been thrown out of MI5 or something, and he, you've done it, is a rush, against the charge of murder. There are seed bags, Lake District mountains, sheep, country bars, reducing losses, stoves, a group of amateur cyclists, roofs, and a lot of Chinamen (don't ask), and it's very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque. <br /> <br /> .. and a good example of Noir of England ...
