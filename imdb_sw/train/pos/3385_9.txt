Green Green I found that the best movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Runan's Run you would like this. <br /> <br /> Yes the movie is old and no special effects and some acting can be described as "cheesy" but the story is better. The story of how the world can have its impact on society is very poignant. The secret was not secret but the story was easily seen at the right speed. <br /> <br /> It is a modern modern day that will be "Angel Dark" for how the US is shown to be the third country of the world.
