In all films / hip-hop films released in 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street film is undoubtedly better. The following story DJ, his younger brother, the graffiti artist and the caterpillar-be showbiz advocate through the winter season where they try to eliminate ghetto using their talent "street". Acting is not always until the characters have not been fully implemented, but are more than compensated for low-to-ground talks, a clearer story, a wonderful playback and a hip-hop sound track. It should be noted that this film was shot at the place of birth ("This is not New York, this is Bronx!"), And the traits of the breeders, the dance of Rock Steady Crew and Africa Bambaata record. Rock Steady Crew provides an excellent location in the film while fighting the drum battle in the first break of the first 80, Roxy. You must see for hip-hop lovers.
