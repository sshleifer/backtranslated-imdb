On the Day of the President of California, midnight and at 1:00 am, spy Victor Rovner sent a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the Federal Governor Jack Bauer has returned to his family and has trouble at home with his daughter Kimberly, who says his mother Teri to put Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a good conversation with Kim, and they find that the girl has run away from home. While trying to solve his internal problem, Jack is called his Anti-Terrorist Organization and his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with their heads Richard Walsh, who explains the dangers of Senator David Palmer, who runs the president, and you need to get a shooter. Later, Walsh has a private interview with Jack and explains that there is a conspiracy in the organization against David Palmer, and gives Jack a search for partners. When the airplane explodes the Mojave Desert, Jack has one extra problem to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first part of the "24" is the start of a series of success, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I have watched this show and I admit that I liked what I saw: the hard and mysterious story, with many and true characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family member and a reliable agent responsible for three difficult missions simultaneously: to find a killer to protect a key politician; get a traitor in his organization; and find her daughter, who is in trouble, trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
