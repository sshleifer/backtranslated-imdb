The stars of the film Emily Watson, of Breaking the Waves features. This film about one quarrel takes place at a resort center where a chess tournament takes place. Lord chess comes and shortly after the fall of deception in love (the first front) and the woman, played with Emily Watson. He falls to this unusual person, who is considered by the chess. That is all horrible for his mother, who is more than willing to see him and another little gentleman; the right gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a fancy passing to a young woman, if she has a tendency to take in an unusual animal and that. What is going on is a trip through a person's psyche. It tells the story of how old it has been locked close to now. Emily Watson is wonderful in this, with an actor who has the main character. It's obviously slow, but it's good to watch. The end was satisfied. :)
