'Last End' is more than a total of its parts. It's not just a tragedy of disaster, not just the spiritual observation of the Australian Aborigines, and certainly more of a simple court game. The author / Director Peter Weir can take these features to the next level to produce an effective and stimulating film that has the least minded atmosphere that gave 'Picnic In Hanging Rock' two years ago, that will continue to remember many years later When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) on the death of the Aboriginal people who can or cannot be directly accountable, he feels not only trying to get the truth from Lee, but he feels what he hears when it comes. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - daily and during the Dream, the truth exists in two very different levels, with more risky goals than Burton can think. The reason why 'Picnic In Hanging Rock' is best to remember it because of its permanent secret. We have been guided in the same way but we had to find answers to ourselves. In 'Last End', we can piece everything with the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of the normal reality. <br /> <br /> In the production side, Weir uses its budget for great impact, continue to create a sense of punishment in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rains, for good use of voice. Common music is unobtrusive, never tries to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain can bring the audience to the course without feeling trying to erase the secret. David Gulpilil clearly shows a man bound between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but he is afraid because he already knows the end. Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of what David Weir is a common name in movies thirty years. Highly recommended.
