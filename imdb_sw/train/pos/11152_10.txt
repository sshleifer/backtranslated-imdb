Watch Midnight Night Cowboy is like taking masterclass in acting / leading / movies / editing / writing. I was too young to investigate it when it was originally released, and it saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it has stood the test of time, and I've watched it several times since. Everything about this film is brilliant, thanks to a beautiful show from Voight and Hoffman (although I know this film well, I still find myself relaxing every time. its path to disease and horrible) on wonderful movies and a dream of excellent dreams. It is embarrassing that most of our modern filmmakers are not prepared to take risks in making movies that appear to be appealing and interesting like this. Midnight cowboy should be required to look at all the film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
