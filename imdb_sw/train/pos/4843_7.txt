In fact, this is one of those movies you should give 7.5 to. The truth is; as described already, it is great fun. Beauty of the sky. Askey really comes up as high, but it's a great car for him, such as Oh, Mr Porter is for Will hay. If you like old movie and train movies, then this is obvious to you. <br /> <br /> Amazingly it's a kind of film that you want to see from time to time. It is friendly and charming in a pleasant way with all the nostalgic references that made the great hour of war. The odd band of actors play only as it does in the other common British war. It would be wonderful to see this film written by Ealing labels. A true pity that the 1931 nature has not been saved
