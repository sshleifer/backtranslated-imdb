Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. He has a good wife and a big house with a pool. He usually finds that his wife works with a beach servant - he knows that behind everything clean, there is decay. The dentist is completely reliable. There is a surprising little surprising but the incidence of dental pain is very serious and pleasant. "Dentist 2" is also useful to watch!
