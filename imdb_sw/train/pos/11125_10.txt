What can you say about the display of this size? "Sopranos" has really explained the television as we know it. It has broken all the rules, and set new standards for television quality. Everything is free, writing, guiding, and to me, above all, acting. Watching this show you will find out that these characters are not real. Acting makes you think there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This session is also very useful. Some people don't watch the show because it is violent, not all about violence, it's about business, family, and many more things that all depend on what you, like a fan look. For me, I don't like when people mention on the show, show about Mafia. For me, it's a family show. Families who, through generations, happen to be away from the group. In general this is the center of the show. This is the television should be. Here. Complicated characters from the amazing acting, beautiful story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these links together? Exhibits the quality, and tries to be different.
