Let yourself be taken to a different kind of story of old school. Scoop is a classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in the final match match Point, also with Allen), is a wonderful failure to drop its tone sex appeal appeal and convert into a typical student-type look with the help of glasses glasses and clothing but still fails to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman a decent character can be so beaten by him, due to royal history (do not worry, no spoilers here). There is no great change for Johansson's behavior here, for he constantly has the same character and despite the script saying otherwise. You even forgive his lack of logic, continue with the matter with the shocking murderer, just because it's the Fire of Fire Jackman, who enjoys seeing without Wolverine duds. <br /> <br /> If anything, the balance is what Allen is 70 years old. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid the same way he always has; if he has never been made by modern films, which probably is what makes his films calm, easy to attract. They don't seem to have a specific market target; as Allen does the movies on his taste alone, if the public likes it or not.
