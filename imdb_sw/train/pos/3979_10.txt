I would like all the fans of this document to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I've been proud of him. This mini-series shown on VH1 is a good look for the drug culture in the last 30 years and my uncle worked very hard. The amount of time and effort I have looked at in this document and the first book (It Can't Find My Way Home) makes it better to look at it on TV. I know that he likes what he does and does well. His understanding is shown in an interview, which he made himself, with extraordinary additions that he adds to the definition. From music to video and everything in between, this is a great document that shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived that way. I appreciate any comments on this from those who loved it (or did not) and would like to hear from the fans! Three fun for Uncle Martin!
