I have recently seen this film due to the recent success of Jake and Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would like to see movies that are missing. I had no prospects for the film so I was surprised that I had lost this film completely. It is a promising father and story, and also a low story. I cried even at the end of this wonderful story. This movie is interesting for all ages. The only reason I give 9 out of 10 is that it slows down in the middle, but it comes back at the end. Acting was good, the story was very good, and the movie was very interesting because of the film settings. SEE MOVIE HU! Buy, buy, see, GO! I know I did!
