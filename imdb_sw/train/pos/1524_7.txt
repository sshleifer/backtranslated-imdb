This film should be normal. Not perfect, sure. Stimulating, when perfect for action, is in the form of a slow film as torto and arthritic knees. Jean Seberg has been forced to be very sweet and gentle. He shows enough talent of skills, skills, and cunning to influence the clever play, passion, and courage Joan, but, unfortunately, the director missed the point of character. George Bernard Shaw is my partner to play. In no other play has its more fierce conversations, no more musical lines. However, this film processing needs to be regarded as a lawyer. This movie is the case, and the viewer is the judge. That's how this picture should be interesting. 7/10.
