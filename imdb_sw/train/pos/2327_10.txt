A 14-year-old girl is losing her first 17-year-old boy who lives near, while trying to overcome her improper feelings in comparison with her older sister. That is a simple premise of this beautiful film, of old age poems from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is known for leading the early summer of '42 in 1971 and killing circles in 1962, two of the major coming of the age. Here he directs visitors to the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in his first movie, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as a great sister; Jason London, as a court, a 17-year-old young man. Warfield and London are all the same as well. The film accurately shows the thoughts or feelings of each young person concerning love and sensitivity of the heart, never coming into the excess of the soil at once. Kudos on autobiography screens from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the few films about the little love that is honest and consistent with sound without having a sense of trust or feeling. Music is wonderful, it adds sounds and emotions from location to location, but never knows. The most beautiful movie is the famous director of fear Freddie Francis, who was 70 years old at this time was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston are helping the parents of the girls for the death of 1957, caring, strict, and easy to understand. Gail Strickland is also good as a boy's mother. There is a sense of solving, learning lessons, and the fact of coping with this sweet-natural film that gives you the emotional wallop. So far, this is the final film of Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
