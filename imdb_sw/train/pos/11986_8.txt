I expected to 'Easily Speak' one night and think it is. Perhaps Buster Keaton was deliberately giving me away, or the delivery of the woman's leading line. The next day I continued to reflect on the film, though. I couldn't find Durante's song from my head, I tried to remember more than Thelma Todd's first place, I thought that maybe Keaton made a strange and physical falls. The following night I watched the Thelma Todd area as a group of a group of girls trying to impress Buster and Jimmy for her sex appeal. A very interesting place, excellent artists, their faces, their eyes, their silent words. So I watched another area, their show opens Broadway. Buster in his innocent bottles of doing every act. Again, I was laughing loudly, thanking and declining Keaton. So the following night I watched again all the film, and this time I saw it for the first time: It includes! It's Sensational! It's the Foundation! Good lovers! Children of Todd! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Certainly not good ... but there's a lot to laugh at this picture.
