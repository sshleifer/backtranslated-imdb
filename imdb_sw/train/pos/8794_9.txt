Chang Cheh "Shaolin Temple" can be well-marked on the Shaw Brothers martial arts circulation film. This stimulating kung fu has an amazing surprise - who is who of Shaw's firm. Although the plot is standardized and the fight for war is as good as it is, it is the Cheh's handling of the issue that makes this film wonderful and enjoyable. The feeling of respect shown by the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is appropriate in every chapter. It is no different from William Keighley's paean to combat 69 fabled in the film with a personal name or a John Ford salon for West Point in "Long Gray Line," Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is a loving ode that is designed in the same style. The ratio of culture I'm tempted to do, is to compare the Shaolin Temple with Alamo. Watching this film will give you the same feeling that you have found years ago in the history of the grade school when you learned the courage and sacrifice of those lost heroes of Alamo. At the end of the film, you can also be tempted to call, Remember the Shaolin Temple!
