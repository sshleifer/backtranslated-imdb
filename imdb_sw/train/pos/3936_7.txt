This is a picture of the exhibition and the best of Lincoln's original life (born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). The best movie of Ford takes Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied the law, common law and started practicing as a lawyer in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his apartment days, an early relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), following a couple from their first ball, and his departure to the candidate group. But it focuses primarily on the brothers (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) who were accused of murder, an attempt after a controversial court discussion and defense to their mother (Alice Brady). Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and prosecutor Donald Meek is not a brilliant. Good work from Henry Fonda as a valid, supporter of Springfield traveler, had a regular star for Ford from this film, like ¨Grapes of Anger, My Friend Clementine, and Fort Apache¨. Apart from the sterling made by Alice Brady as a sad mother, she was a good actor from a silent movie, but this was the result of her last movie because she died prematurely from cancer. Lincoln's actions make up for fun. The desire to despair of past and old things and describes his goodness, conversion and love. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a straightforward person who was no different from his youthful values. This Latin American is correct on both counts, as a good story and as a great festival. The other theories about Abraham Lincoln are the following: 1) Abraham Lincoln¨ (1930) and DWGriffith and Walter Huston, Una Merkel, are talking from his birth to his death; 2) LAbe Lincoln in Illinois (1940) by John Cromwell and Raymond Massey, Ruth Gordon, about such incidents in Ford film through her work as a lawyer 3) The TV version called “Lincoln¨'s Old Vidal and Sam Waterston Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd.
