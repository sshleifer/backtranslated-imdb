This is a very interesting movie. It is a movie of the drama with a mix of comedy. Foxx team with comedian epps in this movie to give them comedic spin. It will allow you to wonder what will happen to the next Foxx. It was a well-known movie, the director used the correct color in this film (black-blue color) to give a kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also made a star in this film and is always pleased to see him on the big screen. He plays his role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this film. It is worth seeing it. It's definitely worth getting if you're a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more credit than given.
