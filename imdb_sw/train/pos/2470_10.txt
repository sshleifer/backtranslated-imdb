After the first shock of guts of Mr Branagh to be this film, I was trembling with the excitement of having this epic before me. I had no desire. So it's true for Shakespeare and it's still available. It hit my mind. I always enjoy seeing, or rather listening, Branagh making me wonder ... is this film called in another country? That would be like a mustache painting on Mona Lisa.
