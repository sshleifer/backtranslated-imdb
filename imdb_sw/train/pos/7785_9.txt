I have watched the Pang 2 movies, Eye and One takes only. As I watched the eye, I was desperate about these two, which I had heard beautiful words about them before. The film (Eye) has a very bad script, especially ended (baby, cliche and also likes it in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental pictures. So I decided to see one take just and I didn't despair again. Still beautiful pictures, amazing images, MTV style editions, cool music and this time, the story has a lot of indie spirit, logic and good, you will see a few holes of conspiracy, but it is not worth any problem with stories. The only problem with this film I get a bad DVD.
