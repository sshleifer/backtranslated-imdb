I look at the many movies that Nick Mancuso is because, in fact, I love the husband, though as his age he is typical as a baddie (long-term fans should realize that he is for some reason blond in this flick). It is a common film known as a plot (but many movies today are not the original), but Rick Roberts attracts as an incompetent man, Martha MacIsaac also attracts as a daughter, and Mitzi Kapture is doing a good job, if that was her goal, to be angry and sometimes it's very hard to love. Nick has not yet found it to be able to show all the charm and psychosis. However, most conspiracy is done off-the-screen - like inspiration, original behavior, good times and bad times - and things that seem obvious to the characters never do to the audience (ie, I). The last part leaves everything wanting in "but what about ..." group, and in general, I can say that I cared so much about the characters. What it said, was what - a good way to spend the day - and still like Nick.
