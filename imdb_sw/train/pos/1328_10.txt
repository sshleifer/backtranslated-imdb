Without the "anthronism of the mind", this film that I would like to find in the DVD provides a common race in the most important and intellectual environment of the people before "disbelief the world". That, there are thirty years, the director and author of the environment can measure that understanding and the romantic reality of doing it to the hub makes me wonder. It should be able to see and explore the film by taking better than the long and cultural distance we lose the ability to be together / analyze, analyze and finally accept the model or model of "first thought". Because these ideas continue to be impossible to feel in a world that is promoted, however, it has certain characteristics of our character, that only future generations can focus on the necessity. If someone knows where I then get a copy of a number or a VHS to me or a DVD? Thank you.
