I have seen a few movies on eating problems but this was definitely one favorite. The problem with others is that people with eating up to the end will only get better or accept the fact that they need help with that. This movie I thought was the real reason for this Lexi main character is not better. He gets better and then repeats. I think this movie shows more of others that I have found that getting better not just happen, it's hard work and takes time, it's a long way to recover. I think this movie shows it all very well. There should be more movies like this.
