Publisher notes Miss DeCarlo writes everything from the Franco-Prussia War until the American Civil War, the Great West America, San Francisco in the days of his heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, coach trainers, and Chinese junk. Only when you thought the plot could not find anything, it does. It is very good, it takes a language in the cheek. DeCarlo's behavior (here called Anna Marie - Sio Salome, is her role playing) comes from the well-known work of Lola Montez, who was the grandmother of the King of Prussia and led the coup when she gave her jewelry. He ran to the west of the United States. There is a city in Arizona called "Salome, Which He Loved," according to the historical fact that Lola Montez played the role of Salome there. The Chairman of the Chairman and the Russian Sir who falls under his bonds are not accurate in history, nor do I think it is a wise man of China and the Scottish emphasis - but it is one of my camping classics all the time and DeCarlo is all very beautiful. .
