When this movie is not classic and any stretch, it is very entertaining as I remember. I saw almost 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. It was written by the man who wrote and led "Arthur" and though it is not as funny as the movie, it shows the ability that Steve Gordon reached with "Arthur".
