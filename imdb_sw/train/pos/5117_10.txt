Very few movies have affected the American culture how the way to the Cowboy Town is. Thank God for a short time. But UC is next to the classroom itself as one of the flicks that when you open the facilities at 3:00 am you can't clear your eyes .... My top three is a House of Animals and Walking BTW but that's the point. I remember that in Cowboy Town's performances and documentation there was a honkytonks opened in every corner, men had a cowboy hat and their money bills, and if he didn't know two steps it was thought to be a social community! Of course I think it's a good movie. Travolta was really surprised on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who could thunk. In fact he is also trusted. Voice sounds are amazing. Bad Charlene Tilton, the popularity of Dallas television destroyed the work of Johnny Lee to cause them to be the only fierce guy. Stealer show here is Scott Glenn as an ex-con redneck cowboy greaser. And I have nothing against the cowboys of ex-sem-semi-greaser, but I always have envy what I feel is the most powerful line of all time .... "Pack-in S * # t!" Type like Clint "makes my day." And looking at Sissy next to it is the closest thing I will see my fantasy of Julia ..... ..... As I said, good. 9/10
