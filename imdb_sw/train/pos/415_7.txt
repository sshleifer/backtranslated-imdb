The Cecil B. De Mille Festival teacher goes to the West. Using three western stories as its characters (perhaps they have never met), Gary Cooper is shown Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Bill Buffalo and Jean Arthur does a good Calamity Jane. The story serves only by De Mille embarking on an extraordinary process of action, such as a major Indian attack.Scenes such are being done very well. Look for young Quinn Anthony Quinn trying to play the role of a brave Indian who took part in the Little Battle. This section found him at least saw in Hollywood.
