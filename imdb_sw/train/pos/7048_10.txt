This film program can be extraordinary, but what makes this film special, is characters (and actors playing with it!). I won't go into the movie's details, but I'd like to say this? This movie is not for everyone! The film is realistic and you need to be clever enough to get all the satire. If you don't even know for the second time, you may know one of the tricks. The film is full of these trivial but dirty stuff - if the ads are going on behind Turaqistan, the adverts on the barrels (which I have died almost) and these are the ones that make movies appear to them. > Ku> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na (why did she become a collaborator and producer too) and has her character? Hauser, a heartbearer? very good. Cusack has done the same role before Grosse Pointe Blank, but his comic character in the movie is superb. <br /> <br /> Yet the actress who steals all the show is Hilary Duff! I've been a big fan of Mrs Duff. But being honest I was disappointed when I heard about the kind of role he played on the movie. But after watching a passionate movie gave way to a very respectable actress. Let's say! Increased child, but yes, so it's his talent! All critics, who shouted that Hilary can not act, will be silent for a while. Hilary had to play a very difficult character? hard out, still a good child inside? and has done perfect justice. Does he make you, and he makes you cry? to cut short stories (because I could continue to praise him forever) he is GOD! Marisa Tomei and Joan Cusack have done well too. In particular, the hysterics of Joan is worried! However, I was very disappointed with Ben Kingsley when he was lost in a very small role and his performance seemed to be weak. Overall war, Inc puts you on your fingers with his sense of humor, and ends with just the right amount of lostness in the plot. I would strongly recommend this film to all (and more for Hilary Duff fans) !!! P.S. - I am very happy to hear the movie going to break free of its release and release of other sites soon !!!
