I have lost a number of times I've seen this film - maybe I know all the talks back - I'm still fascinated on a regular basis. Keeping Hungary, young Jimmy Stewart plays a Bachelor who deserves "Kralik" who has the reputation of "Klara" of Margaret Sullavan who was innocent. Kralik becomes a friend of Klara's pen secretly, and working with Klara promising Kralik about her letters (Kralik). In fact Kralik is experiencing Klara - but he can not make his feelings known when he is in a contest with a "friend of pen". Confused? Well you have - this story has sweet, close to the end of sugar - but we all know it's the end we want all. One of the most appropriate letters to mention is Frank Morgan with his normal role, this time as the shop owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovich", the Kralik composer. Joseph Schildkraut as the pride of the women of "Vadas" - played so much that you can't help him but hate him ever since. Last William Tracy who can love us all with her upstart on the brave shop shop "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently made again as "You Have Got Mail" star Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect the small audience did not agree. If this film is in your area on Christmas, I tell you to turn on a beautiful glass of wine, put a log on fire and have a Kleenex box.
