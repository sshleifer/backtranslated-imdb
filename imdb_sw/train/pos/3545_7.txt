Great Broadway film film. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to overtake the dice and prepare the games to decorate illegal. Blonde likes Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry her. He decides on one final game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who enjoys great, is in the city. He says the Sky that he cannot find a staff employee Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. That can be seen as a summary of a wonderful plot but also a film! <br /> <br /> This is a concrete package - there are other amazing things here. All songs are beautiful and play is amazing. The actual drop rate is in the game to decorate at the end. Also Brando is very good here - it may seem strange to think about it singing and playing but she removes away. I agree to see the bigger, the powerful Brando that takes away the tough stages of the dance was great fun! Also Sinatra is good and Blaine is just as wonderful as her long-term partner. His song and dance numbers are important things here. Now for the worst part - Jean Simmons is a good actor but he is stuck with the color of color without color and can't do much. The movie is very long in 150 minutes - events between Brando and Simmons really drag and should be condensed. Also many characters say in English - inappropriate periods have not been used. Maybe it tries to be exciting from the lips of the sticks but I have got the jarring and it keeps throwing me out of the film. It is important to be infected with songs and drums but its length gets you over time. I offer 7.
