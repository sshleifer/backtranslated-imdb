Ashanti is 70 kinds of film (1979, to be correct). It reminds me of the Meat Horse by way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a message in Africa). It is also a very good film, and I enjoyed it very much. David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa and married a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who has been trained in medicine in the United States and is also a doctor. When they are a doctor, one day she has been taken by the slavers to work for a Arab slave trader named Suleiman (fully played by Peter Ustinov, of all people). All parts of the film are David trying to bring him back. Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and has a character who has decided so much and is willing to do anything to get his wife back, but instead of having no use of guns and actions. He helped first with English banning against the slave trade which no one accepts (Rex Harrison!), Then for a short time with the pilot helicopter (William Holden), and then by the Arabs called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a mark of staying with Solomon (he is very aggressive, very active behavior), and so he sits with David to seek and find Anansi back - this involves a wonderful place that David fails to find his camel. There are also lots of moral values. The success of the story is not predictable from this point, and there is the freedom taken by planning the mobilization of things faster, but it's all right to be forgiven. The question is, What? David will get Anansi before Peter Ustinov tells Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is here!)?
