The sad story of experimental under B-17. Brady is shot on the occupied area. Local workers gave them good and protection at the expense of their own lives. I have never heard of this film and beat me for two hours. After the film is completed, I am glad I spent time. It is a whole story described to describe the look on the face of Brady at the beginning of the film.
