Patience was a show I had. From night to night with Penn and Teller for one, only, Joe Bob Briggs. The show has strengthened Friday night back in my high school, and providing some of the best car-in records never coming out of the car-in. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best night night television ever. If it didn't, it wasn't outside. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob are going on, but I want them to go back to ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... is anyone else sitting for 4 hours of "Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Live long!
