This is the making of the film is simple and is the best. I was worried, because even though Freeman is a good actor, sometimes he is involved in bad projects; this is not one of those times. It is a small story that runs more than an hour and fifteen, when we get a movie that is long and long, and not much better, the director spends a little time for its benefit, because characters are well defined from the beginning (the best exhibition with the Indians and the Vega through), that the little details of the history of them seem to be real, Morgan himself even though his name has not been mentioned, has been out of the movie for a few years now because he was full of business, and made the fear of doing on the script, and conducts research for the character in the indie movie where he plays the shop / supermarket manager. The story begins with stopping at the supermarket in a poor neighborhood, where it meets a trader of 10 or less items (Vega) and needs to take a trip because of its "production" you forgot to pick him up. In many ways it is a movie of the road, Morgan offers a laughter, and an array with his surprising smile and a good view of everything, showing an accomplished actor who has taught his mind to know everyone who sees in the character he can play, and Paz (by way , a wonderful woman, even better than Penelope Cruz) brings the risk of a 25-year-old woman who is working harder than anyone without any credit in the last dead work at crappy supermarket. It is talkie, there is a lot of talk, but the balance between light and fun and sadness is used well, the characters are soon interested that you spend the last 20 minutes to pray for more time of the wonderful couple's screens, but the shortage is in the state of The story, so it was a good call from the non-deputy director.
