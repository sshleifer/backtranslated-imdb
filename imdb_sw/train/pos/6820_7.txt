The movie was better than another auditor said. It's a good movie of the family. It has a fantasy feature of a walk for a while. This story refers to a 14-year-old girl who accidentally traveled a way back to her elevator. Of course, nobody believes him when he tries to describe his disappearance. He gets and makes friends with a girl about his age and can help the girl's family in many ways. She can also help her relationship with her father for a long time. It reminds me of the Hallmark movie so you can position yourself and decide yourself. It seemed to be more aimed at children about 6-12 years (perhaps a little more) and is a very PG or G tested. I am an adult who can appreciate a good movie "family" - I think another inspector is not.
