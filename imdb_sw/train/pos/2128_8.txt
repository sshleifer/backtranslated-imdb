I just looked at Turner Classic movies last night, for the first time I saw it, and I liked it. I love many old films, especially because of the lack of all the language of dirt, and many violence, fraud and sexuality in many of today's films. I also think they were better done in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is a special style of mine. I just thought this movie was very fun, and I was very happy. If you hear the same way on old movies I don't think you can go wrong with this. I believe "You have received a letter" is a remake (though it is different from also a very enjoyable film) of this film. On the evening of the rest with the movie you are cheating if your children or anyone walks in your perspective, get this, or do it on one of the most popular movie centers.
