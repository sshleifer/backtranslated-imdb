I saw this film on television and I was impressed by Jennifer Mccomb's beauty. It was a good film and you can look at it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time I was delighted to watch this film and since then I am trying to VCD this film but I can't find it. Many African bullets make it appear in its film and we will be spell closed only by the size of these animals and their grace. All viewers can watch this film especially children will enjoy this film. But other events related to the leaders of Mccomb's parents guide to this film. It enjoys the movie's holiday with one and all.
