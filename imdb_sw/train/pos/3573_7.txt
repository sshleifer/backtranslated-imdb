This film was almost a great film to think. A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and story faerie. This film was a twist imaginative on Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, headed by Kathleen Turner completely, this movie had everything going. Everything but the production values. I almost never think that the movie requires special effects or large budgets, but on top of high production like this, it came with quality qualityy quality like everything for tv movies. In addition to the best movies, this film was almost entirely. <br /> <br />
