Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Certainly. I found myself, with the attendees attending, laughing hard and occasionally in some of the best Woody Allen verses we have heard at once. Allen ill builded a personal responsibility as the "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, kind of. Others say Johansson has "Dianne Keaton." I ask for a difference. He plays the talk of Woody, which, in his match, always has a very similar feeling ... like, well, Woody Allen comedy. That's good for us defenders of Woody. In fact he made the talk of Woody better than the little girl of his last comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some can get the Woody humor, but for those who love it when it's done well, we expect the next.
