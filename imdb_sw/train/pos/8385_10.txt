This film seems to get a bad opposition for some reason. Maybe just for the most people. However, this is really a very interesting movie. Film is a non-budget sci-fi movie that works really, thanks to interesting stories and scenes well. <br /> <br /> This movie can't be for everyone though. If there are any Sci-Fi fans to read this, I recommend this movie really if you like good fiction science science. Film has thoughts of things. The arrangement includes war nations and GIGANTIC machines which all countries are investing in all the money! The world has been adopted in areas. Anyone can oppose anyone for war, or say, 'robot-duel'. The way of war is cleaner than the nuclear war, since everyone is wearing these breathing masks. Identify the movie that makes you think. Good, well written, with a good effect on the measuring budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to love movies that have a small budget and work.
