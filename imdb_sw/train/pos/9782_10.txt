Peaches is a very amazing film. I am writing this to reject comments from a person called 'Auscrit', which has been displayed on this site. First of all the idea that the first film Monahans 'Interview' is somehow TV is a wonderful declaration. Here is a highly respected film in the world as one of the best Australian films. It was best to win the best image. Peaches are leaving brave, bold and confident. For me it works every level and I have seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who shows great skills and extraordinary attention. For 'Auscrit' make a comment that is another movie on TV etc and that Hugo weaving is not only good does not 'get' film. Or especially do not want to get. In fact it is a kind of opinion that one expects from someone of the film who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from within the industry is a distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average punch, I've got the right not to write such comments. I have seen other views on the site and mention the Sommersault film. One needs to ask what people think they look. Unfortunately in Australia when SS was prompted to push it, if you did not like then there is something wrong with you not a film. This damage to the media is very common. The fact is the only effectiveness between the two films is that they are the rights of the film's passage. Unfortunately for me the SS is a film on anything, which can be told in 15 minutes. Peaches for comparison is a master piece. Personally I can't wait for what Monahan does next if he is clear way in front of any of his time when it comes to the cinema. In conclusion, the film does not provide all these years in the AFI and IF awards, then it is an injured game. For Auscrit, please search for something that builds up most of your time
