This movie has all, action, fight, play, run bulls, music, beautiful girls. This film is looking for accuracy in the middle of America. I don't believe, I was there in 1980. Most of the fossil fuel, many women, and many tons of honky. All bad they have gone now. Movie is essentially another boy meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, a boy gets a girl, but is redeemed by actors and music. There is absolutely no movie with any best music which this film, and which includes the Graffiti of the United States. It is the movie I watch over and never missed. Every time I look, I'm a boy again, and it's time to go out of tonking. The only reason I have only 9 is because you can't rate the movie zero, I don't think you should measure the 10th rate.
