First first lead to Bill Paxton. The very black / who-really-made-was-proposed was proposed by Stephen King. This is a powerful, sophisticated story about a faithful, but a man standing in Thurman, Texas that continues to be killed after getting orders from God to remove demons trying to control people. The view of several conspiracy and eerie finale makes your loan eligible. Many violence you can not see, but still enough twice on your stomach. Director Paxton strives for a deviant person to be the Chief of God's killer. Matthew McConaughey is the same as the first son of man who has finished telling this story to the Agent of Dallas FBI (Power Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and useless. Farmer white knuckler! It is highly recommended.
