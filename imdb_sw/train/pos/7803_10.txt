I have finished watching this film in my GCSE history class. it was exciting and was a priority of what happened to Steve Biko during the apartheid law. How anyone can say that this film was two and a half hours of their lives without knowing it because it had me to walk from start to finish. it was so nice that Denzel Washington showed him and showed how he fought against racism and getting equal rights for black people. In one place Steve Biko says to the police we are just weak and human like you, this is to show them that he and all other black South Africans were different from whites. Donald Woods led me because he has power over what he believed and did not believe in racism. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that struck South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I was very excited about this film and I strongly recommend it to people. has helped me to see that racism is not correct and that everyone is the same, their fate should not be determined by the color of a person's skin. n
