Scholar William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells have made this unusual film of anticipation, and the desire and scope hard to find today. They predict World War II and the British way was fought, and also the fact that the war will be followed by the race of space. They change the time; in the film films and space exploration is long, but there are good things that are wonderful. We see even a helicopter (the film is bigger than them). Non-acceptable and unacceptable aircraft and modern heritage of scientists who seem to be Romans and bubble helmets: as you can see through these amazing outfits you can appreciate the design of art and masters from the years of 30, A positive vision of the community of concern, interesting reflection on the nature of power, and John Cabal as an archetype of an emerging and knowledgeable man, who chooses to create truth and not to be created by it. 1/2 of 10 1/2 of 10. Encourage as the last monologue by John Cabal.
