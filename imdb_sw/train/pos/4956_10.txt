This movie is real and normal. It is very difficult to find similar movies in movies now in Hollywood. I enjoy watching this film, I bought his DVD on Tuesday this week and I looked at it for 4 times. And her acting with Morgan is amazing and unusual. <br /> <br /> My flavor of film can be quite different from others but I must love this movie, easy is the best! <br /> <> I learned something more about life from this film (well, or at least American life) ... life is quite normal ... Sometimes, you meet someone, passes your life and becoming your friends hard, and you don't spend a lot of time with them, maybe just for a while but you enjoy it when '' time '' with them, and then you and they will never meet again, but when you are together they are real. We look at that time in your mind as a memory of gratitude and good ... <br /> <br /> This movie can be cheaper in making a price but it means it's absolutely not cheap. I rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is different.
