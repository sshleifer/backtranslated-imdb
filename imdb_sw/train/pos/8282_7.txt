** Possible channels ** <br /> <br /> A large part of the film that doesn't work is Wendigo, and when your head behave fails, your film is often not behind it. The commentary of the Wendigo filmmakers is interesting, and it can destroy well when it is precisely closed - when a runaway killer sees Wendigo in a flash in his rear view, for example - and the tree form was very good. However, if the monster's behavior has never been survived. We cannot find much information about his character, and what we see from them is not found in the story described in the film itself, or any of the Wendigo I have read. I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it doesn't give enough to do, in the movie. When you beat this film on its bones, what you have is a great excitement and a little element of a common feature, rather than a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The movies are good, though little cheesy; The authors of the film use the environment, lighting, and during the day to convey the mood and feeling rather. The character of Otis comes as a very dangerous and unpredictable, makes him a real monster in the film. It may be more effective to describe his character as he who has the spirit of hunger of Wendigo, which will also be the most appropriate representation of the true story. I have heard unverified reports (from the group) that the reason for Wendigo is not so much is that, when a monster suit was built, it was seriously injured and uncomfortable (in order to imitate its standing position on fears, the actor had to walk on his fingers) that was difficult to run, walk, or otherwise do in it. Therefore, the enormous light of the creature stands still, and the obvious visual image of the race. I emphasize that these reports are not recognized.
