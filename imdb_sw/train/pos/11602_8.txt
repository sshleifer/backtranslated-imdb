Now I was very happy to see someone who felt when they praised on TV after December 2000. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Infectious Diseases (William Hurt) has lost his family when an unknown illness enters his home and kills them. Now some years later she is now in Russia or a certain place. I don't know where exactly, all I know is happening somewhere in the area. However, because of budget cuts in the infectious disease laboratory, they have to leave many workers. One of them, a well-known security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, known for his role as Robocop's inability) goes there and asks to give him his work back. She needs this job because she has left and she needs to pay child support. So he goes in there, the war is down, and some things lock up, dangerous things. Recently found that Muller is infected with a deadly pathogen. It is really deadly, one drop of blood will kill a person in a matter of seconds. Recently the word comes from the disease expert (Hurt) is called to investigate and later joined the US journalist. Now Muller has decided to go home to see his wife and son and stop anything even if he should infect all Russian people. <br /> <br /> Now as I said before this film is a lot like Fall Down. We have a distressed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in the fall down) who stops anything to complete the goal even if they kill a few people in the process. Then we have a hero (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Fall down) who is compassionate and determined to stop the defendant. The infected person is really a very good film and good story line with some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
