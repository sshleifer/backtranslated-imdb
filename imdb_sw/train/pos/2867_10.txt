I lost my father at a very young age. So, young people, in fact, I didn't remember him. For years I had learned so much about him. One of those things is that he loved the west, and watching Bonanza every Sunday evening was a perfect worship for him. I, myself, remember the last tail of the series' run, after the age of 8 when the show stopped production in 1973. Looking at this show over the years somehow made me close to my old lost father. to make a successful show, laughter, tears, the edge of your festive seat, and even your frequent anger. .This special section, with the end of installing credit, shone the image of the Blocker, and faded with black, and I also remember my older sister and tears in her eye before this. I can remember this as though it's yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say so myself, we love Bonanza.Long live Cartwrights.
