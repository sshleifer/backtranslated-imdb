This is a good and quick fight against Wes Craven (Dream on Elm Street), who for 85 minutes stops from the normal and gives us something more horrible - the wickedness of mankind. We are most likely to encounter the bad badness of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) is doing a good job of presenting a friendly, friendly killer, even a charismatic. Murphy's exhibition and Rachel McAdams (Claire, from the Crashers of the Wedding) are brilliant. Most of the films are done at a very close rate, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small step, not a great deal of canvas, and not under compulsion for these limitations. Style is not the only thing, although of course one can do only very much with the camera in the airplane barriers, but the discussion is better, our story. There are no obstacles, no small things that combine the issue that is his heart battle between the main characters. By keeping his focus and avoiding the ban, Wes Craven can take something that is a very small plot and make it a quickest quick action.
