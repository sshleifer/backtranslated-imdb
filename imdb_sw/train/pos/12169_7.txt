On the night of his training, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets a good player Becky (Julia Stiles) on the bar, drinking a lot of water with the next morning, waking up with him on the bed. His future son-in-law will call him and tell him that his widow Karen (Selma Blair) can come to his house, and asks Becky to leave his place quickly. Recently, she sees that she has a crab, and later, in the preparation of a wedding dinner party, knows that Becky is a cousin of Karen. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, and hilarious conditions. The first attraction of this movie is certainly the main trio of actresses and actress. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are the best and very interesting vendors, and Jason Lee, who is a wonderful funny, have a good show. I laughed very much in the story, but there are some cases that are hilarious. For example, when Paul gets Becky in his bed; when it gets its colors; his thoughts in many situations; in the drug center, try to buy and get information on crab prescription; many events of his neighbor, minister; when Karen calls the department store; or the police gets the accused to accuse Paul. I was able to count many other things, but better to hire a reader or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
