I would like to set the location. It's a school holiday and nothing at all on the cinema. I and my friends decide what to see. We are looking for the latest movie and "Grinch" is coming. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we were was a fun coaster of happiness. Jim Carrey (who I add is my No.1 actor worldwide) was as big as Grinch in this best movie of Ron Howard (next to Apollo 13). The way this film was made, the environment, artists, equipment and music was amazing. In fact it brought this movie of childhood life. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the story of grinding. As we all know Grinch is a terrible person who can't stand Christmas. He lives on top of whoville and has never mixed well with the city city. But one little girl will change Grinch's views on life and others in a great way. Cindy Lou Nani (played with a beautiful new actor of Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as she finds part of her once. He tries to break the barrier and help move to Grinch and interact with the townspeople. All of this movie is a barrel of laughing for the whole family children and parents. SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
