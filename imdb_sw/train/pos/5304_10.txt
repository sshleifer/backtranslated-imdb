Pecker is a very interesting and interesting film for a small town in Baltimore who every day, a delightful process is broken by Pecker, a small photographer who takes pictures of "real things." There are no good examples, no good men, living hard. This amazing film is fun in the plastic chain of the city. There is one area in which a homeless woman who buys Pecker's mother's best shop gets the same coat as one of Whitney's art for 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you may not always worry. However, John Waters will send you to an endless spirit of laughter and a bright reality. You can have the latest Hollywood movies and special events and mountains of witnesses, but give me a "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another excellent film of John Waters) on "Titanic" or "Godzilla" any day !!
