Pinjar is one of the few movies leaving the mark and makes you think hard. Put in India, this film shows the real reality of dividing India. Urmila gets a perfect score for her beautiful and emotional expression of a woman who is suffering without any way to go. His independence, personal identity and family dignity are taken immediately on the land of the worst. Manoj bajpai is just as brilliant as his sad abductor. There are several times in the film where someone brings tears. Movies on points are very amazing. Some of the events of the distribution are the spotlight, but the patience and life of Urmila are all wonderful. From a woman stealing her freedom for a woman who gave her freedom to women in such a situation. A fantastic film that should be given credit to intelligent and legendary characters.
