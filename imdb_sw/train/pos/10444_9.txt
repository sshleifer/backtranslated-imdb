Beautiful and interesting, interesting and interesting, a low and meaningful plot, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who has ever loved it, is in love, or was not in love still dream and hope to find it. It is one of the rare movies that are / should / will be similar to the youth, their parents and grandparents. It seems a very small movie with an impressive sensory impression, expulsion, or long and steamy scenes scenes. Two teenagers at the age of 20, two university students (US web site Ethan Hawke who returns home after a summer in Europe with a French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend classes in Sorbonne) to meet on the train. They are instantly impressed before they start talking, they run on the train in Vienna where they walk around the city all night. They say and fall in love. That's the film. It can be boring and silly but instead, it is beautiful, reliable, wise, and exciting romance which gets only the best to look at each other (at least, for this viewer). Great thanks and thanks to my sincerely going to the director and authors to give two delightful characters, beautiful text, every interesting and interesting conversation, two amazing performances, and a magic atmosphere that comes with love is. Julie Delpy, who is seen as the angel of Botticelli, is a good indication of a young, self-centered, attractive woman.
