I disagree completely with other views about this film. A beautiful tangible fulfilling the theme of the movie and not preventing it from the plot over there I like how this argument was different from Crouching Tiger because at this time the action sword was without being attached and over time you can see step by step. <br /> <br /> I think western viewers will be very confused with 2 scenes that involve a monster trying to burn himself alive with others about the villagers singing that is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are derived from a certain translation of Mahayana Buddhist text (Buddhist Mahayana can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and other area deals with quirk in the Japanese calendar ... people at that time really thought that the world will reach to the end ... Gojoe has an action , stories and illustrations mesmerize any viewer. I sincerely believe that some art editing can be sold to my US One complaint is in the last battle area (I can't give anything away - pole).
