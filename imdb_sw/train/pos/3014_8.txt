This amazing Whodunit is an early example of what was a very popular film. I was delighted to see William Powell using the story of spying for charisma and charm, and without the romantic view of Nick Charles's character (from "Man's Series"). When the story is good alone, I think what makes this movie relaxing is a wonderful direction of Michael Curtiz. From a perspective perspective, this is a wealthy movie, and Curtiz shows a remarkable command of the middle; from the screens of the screens, by the corners of the weird cameras and the touch of touch, Curtiz shows that he was one of the best directors of Hollywood. It is highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of film.
