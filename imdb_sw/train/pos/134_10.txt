A person gives this film on a DVD to take its dedicated position as the largest movie in all twenty years when critics and movie historians look back to the so-called film of the 1990s and see how they were dusty, and how Lars Von Trier tried to fix and enrich the world of the world film with this masterpiece. If it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europa" as outwardly known as the United States) is one of the most amazing and artistic views of physiology and psychological uncertainty that left out of WWII Europe's post, that of Germany's decline, which physical evil is similar to the destruction of his people. Von Trier carefully shows his vision on the screen. You will hear if you are expecting some of the traditional traditional fighters from the late 1940s and the whiteness of the black and white strikes, at the same time you feel you are on the edge of something other than cutting edge, especially in events like being killed inside the train. In fact, when you see this film, you are witnessing the art form of the art. For some reason, Von Trier was found in his own pursuit of Dogma shortly after this. And when his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are common to their rights, it includes "Zentropa" that he actually raised the art of making film and new and exciting height. 10/10, age as good wine, and asks for the release of DVD.
