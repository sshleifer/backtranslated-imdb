I lost the film (I do not think it was given to the exhibition here) out to expect to be worse. Verification made the film look bad. I was so surprised, it was good to look; it was written freely, almost like a piece of film. It had a very short time in it and though it is bad it is a very effective satire on the show and people on the show would not be so bad. It is wrong, especially with the bad sound of bludgeoning 'effect of' comedy 'but generally comes as honest and actually actually create a show in altmanesque or Larry Sanders way. at that time is the style to be useful for Jerry Springer, it is also a simple goal. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be announced that 'the worst film has been made'. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the show. A piece of film made but beautiful and interesting.
