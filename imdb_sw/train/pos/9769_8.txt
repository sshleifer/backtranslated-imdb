I enjoyed it. In general, I am not a fan of comedians and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I am also part of Sci / Fi Fantasy. With dinosaur craze. I read it with pleasure, but when I had to insist or have a mind-dead, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do so. That makes it successful in my eyes! I didn't even go walking to do something else while it was running. If it is not counted as "good" or not for me. And no, not babies. Nor am I moron.
