Risks feel that the stock films of type - one of the movies that the studio hit in the middle of the largest budget / box office. It is only 70 minutes and is not suitable for many sets, and only stars are Barbara Stanwyck. But what stars, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a hard woman once again if she runs a run of run while looking for help for her husband beaten in the Mexican desert. Many of the films take into account how she deals with her captor, who wants to betray her for her help. Some psychologists are fighting there. It is a very interesting and effective movie - its short length does it, and that Stanwyck is good should go without mentioning (but I'm still praising it every time).
