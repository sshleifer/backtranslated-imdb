I loved this movie. It had done well! Acting great with a concert and a historical signature. I love Romy Schneider movies. This beat, not like Sissi but still causes! With Scorpiolina, he commented and said French dubbing. Well this time it's a German movie not French. So yes. Second of all there was a plot, perhaps not known by history. Oh and his mother played part of his pastor, not his teacher. And the story was not Cinderella but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed it. But even then .... it's the history of this film is good, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very interesting! I like all historical things. Like the man who was trying to lead his mother. And when he ran and found her future husband and showed him a "new kind of dance" waltzing. When waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandal because the couple dance around. Well, his leadership was like oh my god! And also clothes, I like clothes. Styles are beautiful, loop skirts are amazing. And in fact Romy always looks very good.
