I can't add a bad vote for good comments already here - a beautiful text, good balance, different characters, a great competitor of Tony, a great commentary on the life of America's millennium. The key use of psychiatric surgery and Tony's mother is particularly clean and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - an interesting history of Hesh as an external player, Ralphie a total of irreplaceable evil, Chris's desires in life, and so on. The opposition, however, especially 'promotes abuse / neglect of one of Italy and Americans. Many of the writers and actors are Italian and America, will they attack themselves? There are several good Italian and American characters - Artie Bucco, Dr. Melfi and his family and Cusamanos near Sopranos. In fact, former Dr Melfi husband explains in the 1st season that only a handful of Italian-Americans have had a relationship with Mobi (in fact less than the number of Americans who are involved in crime, I say. ). Most characters do not choose the life they have; The family history or environment is largely a corner in it. Outside (even the Italian stocks) who are trying to interact in it often meet the end of trouble - Matthew and his friend in the 2nd season, for example. If you criticize this show, I think Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist, or Will & Grace will make you want to go homosexuality? Maybe you will not listen to rap music that discusses groups, or r'n'b talking about adultery, or rock music discussing drugs (or any mix)? People are not as stupid as some of you makes .... <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect yet. Many characters have only been seen once, while all logic should be seen or at least mentioned in the previous events - Tracee dancer, a friend of Meadow Ally, Junior's daughter (spoken for 20 years until they were divided into 1 season).
