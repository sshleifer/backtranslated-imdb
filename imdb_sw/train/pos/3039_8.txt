Frank McCarthy who awarded the film's award for the Academy Patton Award is a strong track for one of the US forces, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a good reputation for a person, his skills as well as his appearance. With MacArthur you have never been a place where someone started and another stood and often blended. The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour film or a mini-TV series. It would have been hidden from his days in the boundaries and his family until his time in West Point where he still has the highest education acquired by cadet. It would be pointing to his ministry in the Philippines as a young officer, his ability to build confidence in the battlefield of World War I in France. It would also have to tell him about the run of the Bonus dealers of Veteran World War in 1932, perhaps putting the last kabosh to any position President Herbert Hoover had to get again selected. During the last years of MacArthur he and Hoover had houses of houses in Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must be something that has escaped. <br /> <br /> This film takes into account 1941 until 1952 and is featured in flashback. The movie opens with MacArthur talking about the student's body in 1962. While speaking the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's thoughts are back to World War II and his clashes against the Japanese to develop on Corregidor Island and farm of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him to his victory over Phillipines, a Japanese job and the first 18 months to reach his President Truman's decree. MacArthur as a film cannot work all the time if it was not for Dan O'Herlihy's and Ed Flanders exhibitions as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It is part of the film I enjoyed most, seeing MacArthur and its relationship with the two men. FDR and O'Herlihy hold a historic squire with an ignorant man who was our 32-year-old President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points for unusual fraud and cunning. Sometimes he planned to arrange very little plans for himself, but he was a great politician of the last century. See how he deals with all MacArthur as a war commander and his opponent at the same time. The Truman and Flanders are like people to remember him, someone who spoke with ease of people who did not like to boast to MacArthur from the gitgo. Of course it is in history books that Truman collected MacArthur in 1951 for intervention. MacArthur was not concerned, of course about it. Yet I would write any lesson on Truman-MacArthur's relationship. On the way should never come with a crisis. I've been hearing that the FDR would have been dealing with anything in the best way if he was still president. MacArthur was also a great expert and Gregory Peck takes some understanding in some of the conversations that made him a lot of stories as a victory on the battlefield. Listen to Peck in Japanese surrender, when the return of MacArthur to the nation before the Congress session, and of course his words to cadets in 1962. Look at the news and see if you disagree.
