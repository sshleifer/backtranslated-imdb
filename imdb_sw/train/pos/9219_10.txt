The movie itself has made me love and call someone so they can also enjoy. It was very funny. Angelena Jolie was as strange as Juliet. Parents are hilarious.They are aliens with enemies. Children play the Romeo and Juliet parts in church play. (Spoiler Ahead. I think) hits off after the party and doing it. Surprisingly still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like the exhibition and dirt of ancient literature, it will not work. If you don't care about those who will have an explosion of this look.
