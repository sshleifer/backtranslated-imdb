Similar to the "Kingdom" is a bloodier and even further continues. I saw only half (I was exhausted and could not sit for every 5 1/2 hours) but I liked what I saw. Spirits, blood, murder, poison, children who are all together, voodoo ... this has all! If you have a severe stomach and like a wonderful movie it is for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you don't need to see Part 1 to understand this ... you will see it! <Br /> <br /> What! Anyone knows if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in the playground is bright. Unfortunately, it is likely to be "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this closed. But you don't know!
