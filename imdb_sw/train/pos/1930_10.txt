This film is hilarious, original, & beautifully directed. I have been a BAD BAD SWIM groupie, tracking film festivals at any time & wherever I can. I have seen twelve times right now, and every time, the enthusiastic response of the audience has proved my feeling that this is one of the best films available in years. Almost every festival has examined, has sold out, or won the Audience Awards award. It is clear that people love this film, and even know why they do it. Style is beautiful, characterized by making brilliant, amazing end, and fullness of compassion, wisdom & art of perfect time. It's hard to believe this is the first Ishai Setton film. I hope it will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
