Romantic comedy. The plan is very hard - I tried to open it three times and I can't. It should say it's worth seeing. The movie is funny, good - conspiracy is absolutely unrealistic but it works. Everyone in the film is very good and everything seems to be too big - builds a feel, romantic love through the whole film. Acting is good - Robert Downey Jr. and Pastor of Cybill is in the top form and enjoy every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are the same but okay. If you are a sucker for the beautiful, sweet, sweet movies (like me), get this. Also Downey looks great in her underwear! Additional bonuses - the song of the title played by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" singing with Cher and Peter Cetera.
