As the first film of Jean Renoir "Whirlpool's destiny" first brings us to the countryside, the rivers, the life of the farmers who continue to explore, seems to be only appropriate that its second film works in a large and wealthy way, with higher classes and those who are trying to beat their way up. Put the characters from the first two films together with the seeds of its "Grand Illusion" and "Game Rules." This has been done with the beauty, with the unstable camera that uses the full use of many amazing rooms and backstage sites that leads to the interior of the film, and acting even though it has often given them a good time too, especially from Werner Krauss' Muffat. But the Hessling woman who is so nice and happy, who looks first if she could give Louise Brooks run for her money in the vampishness, never goes beyond one mark, the pretense of pretending. Maybe this is part of the problem with the script, which looks exactly going to the top points and feeling angry; without having to read the novel I am not quite clear if the choice was made well or not. However, the difference between Nana fighters is given well, and I loved the relationship between Muffat and Vandeuvres of Jean Angelo - a misunderstanding that everyone seems to have had their final destiny with their sympathy for each one, especially in the area under the great staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will leave - this and other harvest of ignorance of the wealth of laziness gives the film a comprehensive film. <br /> <br /> In addition to its great achievements, and for me it is probably the most embarrassing of the "Whirlpool of Fate", this is still important to see for fans of Renoir or those who love the cinema in general.
