"I don't want this to be difficult, Leese. I must think she will read it." Fear takes run to 30,000 feet in this taut, thriller action. One night flight to Miami becomes a war for survival while Lisa (Rachel McAdams) knows her chairman (Cillian Murphy) has a plan to use her as a part of an interesting killing plan. As a minute to consider, he is in competition against the time to warn victims before being late. One of the many reasons I love this movie, is because of the chemistry between two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my top executives. For example, the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people continue to run into each other .... I gave them a hand for both too, for making a film like this work. Specifically, Murphy's behavior. Jackson who seems to be so difficult that he makes a charming and innocent, still tries to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally. I mean, in some place she seems to be concerned about Lisa. Very beautiful climbs the whole path. Most movies I would like to see prequel or sequel about, but I really don't remember the prequel of this, which would have been done by Jackson to monitor Lisa. A pleasant event is probably the head condition, because it was unexpected. There was also a beautiful building in the famous 'pen'. Where will he make you his argument? There was also a positive change in Lisa's McAdam, where she changed herself to be a victim in fighting. I also liked the place where he sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some women to investigate the food court. Murphy was very strong to consider .....
