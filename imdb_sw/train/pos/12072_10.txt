What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy would meet together in a beautiful evening evening? This interesting roman values ​​do not use the real names of the characters so much so that dirty and dirty images show not only for people should be, but also for what they came for a while. If you are confused with claims, or if you like your films on predigested by mushy, you don't like this film. It is an opus opium that gives rewards in many levels the viewer and mind of understanding. Stopping, at the same time, avoiding the full use of the actual names of the characters, we see Einstein, about giving a pacifist speech to the UN hell for nukes, visits by Marylin Monroe, after publishing The area of ​​reputation of the Seventh Year praise which some say has led to the end of his marriage with Joe Dimaggio. They had a good cooperation which Einstein is experiencing a good test of professorial around the lack of perhaps the most important sex of modern times. Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is Red. He has decided to confirm Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the United Nations Action Committee on giving the last weapon in the name of peace. Adding Joe, an extraordinary and more desperate and perhaps more unlikely person like Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibition and believes that Einstein has become his partner, although Marylin just wants to show Einstein that she understands a special theory of relationship. <br /> <br /> But there is more. Just like each one of us, these characters have their deep fears, which reveal directly in a bad situation. It is this weakness, ultimately, that gives credit to people who cannot help but see almost alone in today. Finally, we see the terrible fear of the vision of Einstein, and the information of the movie becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable time. Important is one of my top five movies all the time. It's quite amazing.
