This film has taken full surprise. I looked at 2 or 3 times. I liked this film very much. There were many facts of this film released. I love all the characters in this film too. This movie makes a lot of sense because if the community "becomes more than the earlier" What! What is the culture opened? It's not hearing the sound. I can relate to this film from my child and stop away from my life that will never come back or have been the same. This film is on my top 5 movies I have watched. There is such a sudden truth that I hear when I watch movies and not the kind of truth you have to dig right in front of your face. The creators of this film worked fine and I enjoyed this film very much. This film cannot be personal but if you have an open mind I think you will love it.
