The Dana Andrews cycle of Otto Preminger's films are among the instruments (in large quantities) that could not be used. Because they have no deficit, misogyny or hysteria, they may seem to have no place at that time, but the image of a clear, hard to play and identity, masculinity and representation, the destruction of ethnic psychological elements, all geometric patterns seem to be modern today, and very similar to Melville. The greatest shortage of this film is a burden, the worries and worries that the end 'happy' is one of the cruellest in Hollywood history. The brilliant on the exciting level, too long, and full of two discussions.
