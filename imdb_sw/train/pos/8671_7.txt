Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> PPV end of 2006 <br /> <br /> brand smackdown br>> We start the show with the Match of Inferno. Kane v. MVP. This was the same match. There is nothing about fighting here. This was about the picture. In general, this was not bad. There were a few ads here and Kane very close to the fire, but finally, Kane won the MVP's ramming into the fire behind the first. Nice opener. Let's go on. Teddy Long announces a new match for the team's title tag: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, Hardyz, and MNM IN LADDER !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: Match four deadly levels. This was the total murder. By looking at three of the four teams here, you would like to expect chaos. Ads were amazing. Total spot-fest. One thing Jeff came to Poems in Mwendo and London moved to Jeff fell to the level! After a while, Jeff was put on the top rope and two levels like MNM going to kill Jeff, Matt saves and Jeff shoots "see-saw" to Joey Mercury! Mercury hurts. His eye is fast closed and open. Mercury has been taken out of the match with Nitro still located. He will fight alone with names! Regal and Taylor then grab London and upset the first face at the level! Jeff climbs the stairs and Nitro in the spot to kill, drop through the stairs to the Nail Jeff! Awesome! At the end, London and Kendrick maintain the team's titles. What a match! It was possessed. I can't think why WWE did not advertise it so far. The Buyrate will increase great. I am sure the value of replay will be good however. <br /> <br /> Mercury has found a broken nose and pain for the eye. She is in the hospital now. Get a good baby. <br /> <br /> There is no way here that will be up. <br /> <br /> Then up: Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This is not the same. Will Boogeyman get forever? Miz also takes. After the crowd of mad, this kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a powerful match. I enjoyed it. Chavo has hit the superplex of the killer for one step! Benoit hit eight German HUMAN too! Benoit succeeds with sharpshooter. Good materials. <br /> <br /> Helps the championship match of the Yang-Cruiserweight title. This was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans didn't care about this. WHAT? Helms and Yang are very talented and have fought well. I agree with the JBL. He ran to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to understand this or go. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. Ride Undertaker-Last Match. Not much here. This was a festi of slug, and a few exceptions. Kennedy for one step was taken Take off on the stage to the floor. Spot was good. The answers were terrible. The last emergency was Kemeri-stone Kennedy stones on the hearse and winning the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. Both are working hard. However, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should be lost. Creativity has grown again. The stupid thing is the second. I love women. Not this. At least Torrie was not here. That's comforting. Judging from the crowd, Layla should win. WWE wanted Ashley. Imagine this rest of your bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also not a match. The goal was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. Finished stripes. Finlay had a Batista knee with a shot seat and Batista had no-bought a shot and finished the match. Lame. It's not the main event of all. Overall, Armageddon would have made it down, but the match rate was the main event here. That was worth enough money there. A few others were stable. Last Word: Good PPV and match levels to be a savior. Smackdown is not a bad display is not compelling enough. Smackdown requires stopping to let Cena score together. Leave the Smackdown to stand on their own feet. This period proves that Smackdown may be.
