Jim Carrey's amazing quiz with him as a journalist who receives God's power for a short and perishable time. Carrey has come down here and seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as she has put on a partner is also charming and affects. The story is permanent to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is good and makes the film should be infected. GRADE: B
