These films make an effort to hide the genre of its true genre - movie B of B. It will be flat out to tell you the beginning of the campy comment. It should also give them the meaning of the invention of cheese. But the two gather in this film in a way that makes them go, "Hmmmmm ... that's stupid!" and then laugh. For example, there is a backyard in the "16th of Japan" yesterday, which shows a couple of Samurai walking in front of the temple. In the back of the temple, there are several tourists looking away in slippers and briefly. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I couldn't stop laughing. And acting goes from honor, bear, to oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You will see other dignitaries and then get some really awesome. I need to digress somewhat because I saw Stephanie Sanchez in several games and she's awesome. His time in the film was too short. I found Bryan Yamasaki in several games on the islands during my visit and he is also the best in the theater than in this movie. However, it is a entertainment film, if you have nothing to do on the evening of the week.
