I loved this film very much. The story goes back and forth and is not easy to follow. There is no resolution for any story, and you are left to ask yourself what happened really. Since I love the film I enjoyed this. I especially like the "dating" events between boys and I was attracted to their lives. And of course any filthy film Staphane Rideau will receive several points. ; -) \ t
