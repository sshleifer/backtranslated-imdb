As I understand, after the Chinese took Hong Kong, the bad cat. 3 movies of Hong Kong type disappear. At least so far, and it's a movie of this amazing. I knew it was a crime crime game, but being the first Cat. 3 I've bought it recently, I didn't know what to expect. The Cambodian man hit-man goes to Hong Kong to end the judge's wife, who is also a lawyer. He returns, the judge made arrangements for the man, because he had refused the judge, and threatened to take all his money. This is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is given. After the hit, the fighters looked at the person very quickly, but trying to catch him, several police officers and civilians were killed. He chases the police and now the race is on to catch the boy, before running back to Cambodia. This is a never-ending film, and gives the player the opportunity to get their breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many fighters are killed, if that person emerges very difficult to track, and take down when they see him. On the way, a man trying to hide in a dump, finds women raped and abused by someone. He helps him, and he saves him from the boy, and persuades the man to take him with him in his escape. I loved this film, it is like a high-speed player who keeps moving and moving faster, because one event leads to another, and often the police are worse or worse as a patient. Acting is very good, and photography photography and photography is time to breathe. There is no allowed in this film, even with the most amazing end. The end is very strange, and also an appropriate end for all actions and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes cruel, but this is a very violent crime game, which will build your socks off. "Dog eat dogs" definitely requires more release spread, including R1 release for sure. Great movie, it was highly recommended.
