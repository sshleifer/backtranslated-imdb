I saw this movie in the first few weeks was out, (I don't remember at any time.) I thought it was the same, for Ben Stiller's movie. This movie is not for someone without a good sense of humor. As many of Ben Stiller's joke think about them. Or if I said you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this site I noticed that people did not have anything to say about it and did not have a very good score, but I would give a great one. Maybe this is not a film for you. I only give someone else's opinion.
