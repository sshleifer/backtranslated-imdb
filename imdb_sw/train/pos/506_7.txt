A powerful experiment, this two-hour period does a good job of establishing characters and history of "Business," "prequel" for the original "Star Trek" series. Faced with a few times in the "Trek" contract and cliche - the candy pensioners do not seem to go out of fashion, and I can see before the reflection of T'pol as "Seven Vulcan" - but the sets seem strong, the characters are well fed, and one can see tips that these workers will need to have more resources, in a different way, than that of the previous series (later?). Scott Bakula writes the precise details as a brave captain of Kirk and with his feelings unloving and waiting, and I expect the channels that will consist of an engineer, weapons weapon and communication officer (not just a glory phone user again!) As players to help. The authors seem to have taken one big mistake made in the "Star Trek: The Generation Next," "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a great transition sent by providing short characters, it starts with a small base of characters that the smallest might to be added later - which I hope happens, because after half-dozen periods, many types will be needed.
