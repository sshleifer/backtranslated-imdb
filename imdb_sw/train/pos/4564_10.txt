If there was a stimulating story that could encourage anyone, disabled or not, hold despite a bad situation and make it (even when “doing it” as an explanation, correct, it may have a great width that is ultimately personal), MY FOOT LEFT is. It is a complicated look at the scene: seeing the elements under the stability of Christy Brown's appearance occurs in two key events - one when her sister announces she is pregnant and about getting married when her father has a bad feeling, and during the evening table time The woman who has come out, has been able to speak effectively, has now announced at a critical moment (the launch of Brown's art) has almost got married to someone else - it's tough. Very, very hard. More so because this is a person who cannot respond to these events and can express himself in the only way he knows: through shouting, shrieks, and dirt you want to hurt yourself. However, this is not a story of heart pain and dysfunction of the family even when there is quite a bit to give an autobiographical account, but of a person to overcome his disability, being human work and the power to be counted and in the world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as Christy Brown who was convicted but strong, and Brenda Fricker also did his duty to support as Brown's mother.
