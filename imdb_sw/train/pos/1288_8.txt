Preston Waters is far from good summer. In addition to her birthday comes, nothing else seems to be promising. First he should share his room with his brothers who will run the business. They can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space. From the birthday it gets only $ 6 dollars while others get $ 32, $ 35, and even $ 50. When one of her birthday cards comes early, she just gets a check for $ 11. <br /> <br / > Go to the bank learns that he needs $ 200 at least to start the account. Departure from the bank, the swindler stole the checks. Tracking the child to get away from him (surely his bike is damaged) and a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley has come from the bank also from giving the $ 1,000,000 owner to give this person tomorrow. Quigley begins to write damages, but he only succeeds by writing his name before the police car. Fear, he gives Preston checks, informs him to give his father the finish. Even that evening, Preston told his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants himself back room, better still his house. His father locks him in his room in the evening. The artwork in his room Preston shows things he can not get worse than he knows that he forgot about checks if he still in his shirt shirt. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, it makes $ 1,000,000. The next day, trying to pay the money to the bank is taken to the owner who thinks he is the one who should give $ 1,000,000 and he does. He is not like a real person named Juice is coming soon. <br /> <br /> Now three should follow Preston down. At the same time, Preston enjoys buying all kinds of items including his house and even going on a date with a woman of a hidden bank who is actually a FBI agent (who tries to track 3 bad people) . He makes this man named Mr. Macintosh who works and even builds a party for his birthday. But eventually things get (money comes out, bad people get). <br /> <br /> Overall, very good flick. Miguel Ferrer has a very good role. If you have enjoyed him in another Stakeout, you will love him here. He does all the bad things. Rick Ducommun (the suspended boss from Ghost in the Machine) has a wise player in this film.
