The talking parrot is not a thought of a new film, but Paulie returns a simple idea into a talented, hearty film that will enjoy the whole family. It helps to bridge the gap between fraud and brutality during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events in the film cause a profound emotional conclusion. Animal training is done well - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads wings and rivers for the first time. Paulie is a good character and should receive more achievements, although this film was not a display of 1998, unlike Save Private Ryan. This hour and half this will surely be one fun and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is moving, sad, fun and interesting - since when he first appears when he met with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learn about friendship and the worst of life and way. It's not a lost person if you have any kind of heart or feeling. 9/10
