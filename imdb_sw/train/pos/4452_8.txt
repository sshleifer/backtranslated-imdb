Do not be taken by wassayers. This is a very destructive film. This was asis project for the author / director, JT Petty. He did a great job with me on the edge of my seat. I did not know exactly what to expect, and for a jade-horror-movie goer, this is Nirvana! The film deals with an old man who lives in a logging unit provided in the forest. One day, while looking for his cat in the forest, he witnessed the murder of a child, or did he? He insists on all this film. It is unusual for this film to be that there is no conversation until the last few events. I found this to be amazing. The author can find your strength and give you a problem that is not too quick. Make this film go, you can't despair.
