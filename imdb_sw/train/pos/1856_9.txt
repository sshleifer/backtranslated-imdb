He magnified himself as a good actor in 'Glory', confirmed that he was not 'Malcolm in the middle' of the best 'Malcolm X' actor, expressed his love for working in 'Philadelphia', had slam dunk in 'He found the game', had no restrictions and beat us like a hurricane in 'Hurricane', gave us a good 'Day of Training', and now he has shown that he can also lead! The first of Denzel Washington `Antwone Fisher 'is the most moving film of the year. The story of the 'fish' is not related to the strife that took place in the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against New England Patriots in the final season of the 2002 season. Unlike the Dolphin disaster, 'Antonye Fisher' has a happy conclusion . The movie depends on a true story about a young army officer who has a problem of anger management because of the hostility as a child child. Denzel is building a village psychologist who helps Antonye win his anger and persuade him to find her natural mother. The first performance of Derek Luke as Antone is the best actor I have seen with a mentor at a time now. In fact I saw some detailed instructions in Luke's acting as I saw in the old Washington exhibition. It was as if Washington tells Luke- 'Of Luke I am your father'. Okay! I will put off the joke of Star Wars before my readers use it on a different galaxy. Referring to the chief Denzel, his work as a psychologist was knowledgeable. But you can expect from acting 'Teacher D' yourself. 'Fisher' Fisher was written by no other than Antoni Fisher himself. The emotional pathos that he inserted into his story story story was the 'king of fishing' material. I am the chief rainman. Washington 'in catching the right bait in' Fisher 'Antone. ***** Best
