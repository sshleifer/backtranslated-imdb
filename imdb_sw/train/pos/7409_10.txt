Expecting to see "small films" from China, I was prepared. Family dynamics, community and non-conversion are often not well thought out in the film. Each character is strong and I am quite impressed with the story. The organization is more complex than the American audience will be accustomed to. However, there is no difficulty following the development, even when reading headlines. Jiang Wu, as a lost brother, is a constant light shining. Leave your dirt in your locker. It will be when you look.
