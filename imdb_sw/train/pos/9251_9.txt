What can I say?, Ms Erika Eleniak is a beautiful girl of blonde forever, and like Italian America, fan number one of the female beauty I can't forget this film. <br /> <br /> you know I really don't remember a lot about a plot, or a situation or other actors. I can only remember about the decline of Erika's beauty and that in this film it looks much better than at any time, I don't care if it's a bad movie or a good movie, I just look at a good time I was a young man in Brooklyn just to reflect the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well just complete if you're a fan of the beauty of Erika Eleniak as I definitely this film is for you.
