I saw the first trailer of Frailty on Yahoo movies back to the day, after hearing Stephen King glorified him in heaven. Not a star of either star, I wanted to see it because I am a big fan of thriller. <br /> <br /> I had no desire. Acting was good, especially from two boys. Usually I hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton did a good job as well. It was shot well. <br /> <br /> One must also look twists twists. The third course was fast and fast, and I did not see them coming. The last motion of the film, along with the attractiveness of what was given, gives me even today, although I have looked at the film many times. The true gear.
