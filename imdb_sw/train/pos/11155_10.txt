Young, beautiful, nerve Joe Buck (Jon Voight) may go from Texas to New York to think he'll make life to be stud. He gets there and quickly finds that it won't be easy - it goes through one experience caused by another. At the end of his string he joins the disabled, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? Very black, exciting yet interesting. Director John Schelsinger shows a very bad picture of NYC and its inhabitants. That way is the date - the city can be very bad in 1969 but it has been done to a large extent now. It also uses every trick of the camera in the book - to change the color to black & white color; The process of trippy dreams; front row; the backs of the fire (particularly involving rape); cuts in shock; The sound effects of a strange ... you call it. It prevents you from damage and away from the middle - but I couldn't stop watching. It is not a lot of stories - basically it says about friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is a meaning that can be lovers (the last shot type shows that). It is only a picture of the two characters who are trying to live in the cold, brutal, suburbs. This was previously tested X in 1969 - the only reason that MPAA did not think that parents want their children to see this. However, it was a big hit with secondary school students (behind X did not mean less than 17). It has also become a unique X-rated film that has won the Academy Award as the Best Photo. Hoffman and Voight were on the prize to do if it was (hidden) Sylvia Miles who was on the photo for a total (maybe) 5 minutes! Finally it was revealed to R (without cuts) when it was developed again in 1980. <br /> Also the best song "Talkin of everyone" was introduced in this film - and it became a great hit. </> <br /> The big film â€” but very dark. I am giving 10. Don't see on business television - it's cut with ribbons and incomprehensible.
