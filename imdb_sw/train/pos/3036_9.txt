The name just says it all. I watched this film with my father when it came out and after serving in Korea he was very grateful to the man. The disappointment of this film is that it takes into account the shortest moments of one's life - surprisingly that the whole life of man would do the same epic bio-pic that is difficult to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters generated by attributes caused by man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Tariff, Respect, Country" is not just the words that came from the lips of a top-bronze officer - it is a comprehensive statement of commitment to one person to his country. Normally Peck was liberal that he had created a better understanding of that person. He is doing a great job that shows the fearless one who is on the side of that person.
