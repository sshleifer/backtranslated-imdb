"We are wearing to kill" is certainly one of the most awesome / exciting movies. It's taut, stylish and a great mix of sex and abuse. Acting is very good, orchestral logo and Pino Donaggio is amazing and there is a lot of surprises to keep the exciting fans very happy. "Wearing kill" is the secret of a murder that involves a housewife who is having sex (Angie Dickinson), her boyfriend (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine), and a top girl (Nancy Allen). The killer in the film is a homosexual partner who is the name of Bobbi who is also one of Caine patients. The film is full of breathing: the most suicidal scene is very interesting and highly recommended.
