William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) bought an old house where brutal killings occurred many years ago in a very serious condition with a desire to restore. They move with their daughters Sophie (Emma RidleY), and become friends of their neighboring Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, good events occur at home, with the death of Sophie's cat. At the birthday celebration, the pipeline leak pipeline and leaves the place, revealing the future. <br /> <br /> "The house that was beaten to death" is awesome and one of the best intermediate series "Hammer House". To lose surprises, reveal the secret, and the sad conclusion is very good. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House That Killed Death")
