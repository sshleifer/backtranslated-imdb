Up to the sixth and final part of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I was looking at this 1983 entry as my popular series of long series. The incidence of different actions with different characters (Jabba Hut, wooden fruit, etc.) made this very interesting film. It hasn't been a long point to consider in a single place, either. The last half of this minute shows this more if the area takes every few minutes from the forest to go into a battle between the space ship with a laser laser between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Another beautiful kind of film was that the last two were not available to fight between two stars. They were a clash of Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on that page! It was good to see. <br /> <br /> At the end, this was just a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
