The advice of the plot is as high as light like fur. But the advantage here is to reject the boy and the classic girl we've accustomed to "Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" now. Instead of ordinary crash friends, duo's play is the old lovers Baker Baker and Sherry Martin, who still love since their play days. Of course, being the 30s music, there are problems with misunderstanding of romance, common shepherding and a little lobby for sulfate experiments and bicarbonate soda has the cost of ginger instead of special. And then in the great fiscal culture of decline, there is nothing better for the smugglers of Hollywood than to put on the show. The fun numbers from Irving Berlin are described in the show. Top hats and evening clothes are kept until the end, which is still changing. Fred and Ginger are no longer a charm to the world ... with a navy charm. Everyone and everything is once again just enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Normal white beauty for the best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we only know it needs to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
