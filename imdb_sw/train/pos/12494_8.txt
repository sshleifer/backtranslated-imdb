Finally, the indie film which offers the most obvious! I see many awesome films that come from ... Theatrical, Similar-to-DVD, cable, etc ... and many are ... . I found this film on the South Padre Island Festival ... The audience liked it ... and my wife and I liked it! With anonymous name, I think the budget on this film was very good, but you will not know ... The movie looks amazing ... acting works for the film ... The story is good ... and awesome is great! While many filmmakers focus only on the horrors, they often forget about the development of stories and behaviors, two things that help to provide more scare more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. He grows all with the attention you care about the characters, you know the characters, and so they are very scared when they are dangerous. Watching awesome films that are lost anywhere from 80 million dollars to $ 5,000 to do, I see "Night Night" being one of the jewelery out there. Check out this film out!
