I will be honest with yall, I was junior in high school when this sitcom started to open ABC I didn't think I would like it. But with John Ritter in it I felt that it had little power in it, with them was something else and I liked it. Acting was good, not a lot of awesome 2 lines rated, John Ritter always brings his game when it comes to playing. This was a good show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a good show. My father who sees at all times, watching movies, sports, rules and order, sat with my 3 brothers and my two sisters, my mother, and myself, and looking at the show I think because John Ritter was that. I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God could rest his soul would not die.
