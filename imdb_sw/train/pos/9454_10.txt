In a matter that should be an excellent external film, four boys are faced with natural anger, in the story of life. Settings are Georgia's backwoods, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers. The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to show the second characters. These residents are filing the film with the depth of features that have never been in the history of the film. No characters "characters" can enter around these voices, sounds, or actions. I do not remember the film in which the second characters are real and colorful. Also anything else, this false effectiveness that makes this film amazing. <br /> <br /> Another power is a film theme. The situation, in the wild, may be violent. How appropriate that the environment should be South America. Very few places in U.S. is, or have been, as violent as the land of redneck. In the story about Darwin's fittest life, the film shows the idea that humans are part of nature, not different from that. <br /> <br /> "Rescue" is very much at its time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern about the desert desert. The popularity of films, airplanes, frogs, cricket, and the sound of the rapids of the river, as well as the lack of civilization, all reflect the environment. And that's another film power. At the level of recreation, tension gradually increases, as the field continues. Even half the way in the tension film becomes extreme, and then never put it on the side, until the final document will continue. Very few films can develop that maximum scope on a very long plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is the topnotch. Trends and editing are worthless. Style is the best. Discussions are interesting. And acting is severe. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Beatty Ned is fully beaten and does a good job. And Yon Voight should be chosen for Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is music, which you beat me like shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Rescue" almost certainly will attract viewers who love adventure out. Even for those who do not have, the characteristics of fraud, acting, and conspiracy of the plot are sufficient reasons to watch this film, one of the movie history.
