A good example of Busby Berkeley's impressive music produced in the early 1930s. Listeners should have been very interested to see James Cagney in this type of car. Unlike the "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney does not add spark and interest to the usual story of fatigue planned by the plot. But the film show is the number three backs back. First with the conservative "Honeymoon" hotel, then followed by a series of "Waterfall" that emerged, followed by the closure of "Shanghai sequence", Cagney shares only in the last number closing on bar to deal with Ruby Keeler. "Shanghai Lil" and Cagney are the best but a bit of the city's city & anti-climactic after the most exciting and most amazing of the mind "For Waterfall". If I was a director I would enter the "Lil Lil" number in the middle and close to "Waterfall", which calls the other number out of the water to talk & to my best view of the number 3. Cake & James Cagney are added decorations for cake. The best performance of music, 4 star movies, the last music, good to enjoy, you can't despair !!!!!!!!!
