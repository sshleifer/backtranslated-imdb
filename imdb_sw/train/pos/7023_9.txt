I liked that this film recognizes the viewer's mind, allowing columns to look from the characters through their partnership with each other about the unexpected loss that has affected each of them. The movie is beautiful, and it's the ideas revealed by the vision of a person who I believe is a new and talented film starter and artistic skills to tell stories that other highly skilled people have failed to complete. I see a bright future for the author / producer / director who was able to focus on the purpose and fulfilling faithfully. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this success.
