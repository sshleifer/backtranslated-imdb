SAPS AT SEA is definitely hitting the film Gary Cooper, SOULS AT SEA. The title describes the team of stars, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. who goes on a sea trip to reduce Ollie's nerves just run into a killer who escaped Nick Grainger. As played by Rychard Cramer, this breaker is amusing and awesome, making him a good foil for the characters of the comedic characters. Despite its powerful presence, Cramer is not available Boys, taxes for Stan and Ollie's charisma to ignore. That is as it should be, for Boys should be involved in this film. That is the charm of Laurel and Hardy's personas that they add the average devices. For SAPS AT SEA has its slow ads. For example, if the previous advertiser has noted, a little where the doctor (James Finlayson's pleasure) tries to put a balloon called "lung test" on Ollie, they have no punch. This phenomenon is very episodic, and the first part, takes place in the Boys' Club, almost completely unrelated to the second place where it goes to the sea. But in general, the film is a delightful and short-lived entertainment so that it can invite. Hal Roach. I have not seen all of Laurel and Hardy's films after 1940 but those who have seen me do not even make the products of Hal Roach weak. In these future movies, Laurel and Hardy seem to be in a guest environment, reduced by color players such as Finlayson and Charlie Hall and Marvin Hately and LeRoy Shield's music symbols. It is also not the most important and optimistic bumblers that we know and love but in the future films, either caused by non-pathetic barriers. It is a pity that most of the Hal Roach Laurel and Hardy films are now not available to the public. Even in small entry like SAPS AT SEA, one can see that Laurel and Hardy were good players. This is because Hal Roach, for the most part, allowed Stan Laurel, the leading power behind the team, the full independence of the crafts. Once Laurel lost his independence in another studio, the team lost a lot of his own.
