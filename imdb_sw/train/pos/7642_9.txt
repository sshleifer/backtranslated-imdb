It's not really a great box office, but I was surprised to be surprised by this movie. James "I did things with Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> wrote and led this film about a common person, the name of his name Larry Burrows who thinks his life would be worth it. beat homerun on a key football game <br /> when he was 15 years old. But due to a wonderful and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry gets his passion, but soon realizes that her new life is not just as she expected it to be. <br /> <br /> I must say, this movie was very interesting. Critics have given a knife / coin, and I must say the concept is true and <br /> <br /> pulled well. Yes, it is a little bit, but enough buttons are worth it! James Belushi (I think) was Oscar worthy of his role. Jon Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton with Renee Russo shine in their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen, I <br /> <br /> recommends watching you
