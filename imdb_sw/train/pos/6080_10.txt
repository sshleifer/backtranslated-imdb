Othello, the story of ordinary Shakespearen of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember reading this story at a secondary school, in fact I've got Othello to be my famous story of Shakespeare because of how interesting, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism in full. I mean, when you learn this story, you can get into many philosophy on why Othello loved envy and jealousy in the eyes of the eye. But later for my report I also looked at this edition of Othello and I must say it was quite brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just catch the story well and understandable is dark. Othello is a huge soldier during his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king realized that Othello was coming with his daughter, Desdemona, the king was angry, but he accepted. Othello is welcome in the city and makes her best friend, Cassio, someone on her side instead of Iago, who is standing with Othello. Because of insane jealousy, he is out of revenge. He still pretends to be the best friend of Othello, he only shows Othello that Desdemona cheats him and Cassio, never says it is, makes Othello think that it happens. Othello is driven insane and has no good plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago are more fun to help out. <br /> <br /> Othello is a fantastic story, I strongly recommend that you read. It is a wonderful story that keeps you from thinking after reading it. Othello movie is also good and once again I recommend, adapted the story perfectly and has a great variety of tears to feel, or you can only be a great shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, as soon as she believes that it is really love you would betray her. This is a terrific movie, good acting, good set, and good direction, this is Shakespeare means when he wrote a story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
