As a boy who has seen all the season, I can say that JG always surprises me. I mean, after seeing him change from laughter to paranoia once during the seasons and after every small sign of his belief he is a gangster, you thought yourself: Well he is a good actor and can get a gangster skin. But after seeing him open his eyes and strive for his life, I mean I could hear the pain that "made us" believe that he was passing by. I was touched by his performance that once I thought in Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were obvious to their generations and even more. But today they are old or dead (Brando) and it's the same that they make small movies and their exhibitions are "lighter" than they were. I can't wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where it offers a completely different role. What? Can you recommend some of his old movies where he offers unacceptable performance?
