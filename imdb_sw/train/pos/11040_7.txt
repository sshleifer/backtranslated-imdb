Watch this film of France last night and very much. The whole film takes place in the prison cell with three detainees who get a newspaper written on a wall from a murderer who had been rescued 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. When they look through the diary, they find it coming in black art and command that can be their way out of cells and freedom. What they know, it's a totally different thing, and it is shocking to say a little. I like the awesome low-budget films, which offer products through quality, and tell good news. This movie makes it only, despite taking time to go. The results and fears they open are very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the journey. Not much of a year, but that can't achieve the story, although the year is very good.
