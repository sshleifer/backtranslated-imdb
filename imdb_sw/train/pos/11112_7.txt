Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix with GOD, add other Roman stories and a lot of comedy below, and you have SOPRANOS, about the clan of a group that uses north of New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as you fight with a pro. I'm not a big fan of this show, but I'm very happy with James Gandolfini Tony Soprano, psychopath with a constant stress. I have also accepted the contributions of people like Dom Maanese as the so-called gravel as the nominee Junior but was killed, Tony Sirico of the finest Paulie as an amazing and always beautiful and Edie Falco very good as the hard, whip of Carmela Soprano. Violence is sudden and an example, the body calculates fast every season, but it is often a short time that is most useful here. See Paulie and Tony Christopher's nephew (Michael Imperioli at the end of the Law and Editor) disappear in Pine Barrens and stay the cold night in the trruck left, they believe they have found.
