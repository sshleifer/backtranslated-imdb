he is a narcissist hosted by manipulator; in this case, marking the attorney (and the murderer) Tom Capano. Kathryn Morris is a sympathetic actress, Anne Marie Fahey, but at first a very young victim. We are sorry for the situation, but we hate them at the same time after seeing the violence of several other women (including Rachel Ward). The sad part is where she gets help with her self-esteem, and Capano actually had her psychology killed. Pretty hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameos and Olympia Dukakis (best) as Capano's mother. For all, interesting stories because it depends on the actual murder, and you will need to read the Ann Rule book to get the correct information. 8/10.
