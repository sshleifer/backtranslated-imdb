After graduating from high school, best friends Alice and Darlene, decide to take a trip to Thailand. When they were there, they met a fine Australian man named Nick. After spending time with Nick, he asks if they want to take a week's trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport however, they find brug for drugs and then get guilty for 33 years in Thai prison for something they say they have not taken. Not really know what to do their last contact with Yankee Hank, a US lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. The word has that if you have money you can help you. Things start well, but still can't happen. <br /> <br /> Movie is very good because it doesn't allow what will happen and it's interesting at all times. I couldn't believe the end. It was one of those expectations that you do not know 100%, but you still have a kind of know what happened to Nick and drug fraud because of 'owning' etc.. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both offer good performances here. The performance of Beckinsales was however weak. The friends of Danes and Beckinsales are good but they may seem to be strong. Paul Walker even has an unlimited role here. ;) <br /> <br /> However, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it 7/10.
