One of the many Cary Grant assistants is Mr. Blandings builds his dream house. Although judging by its size will be a dream house today. Cary was still making a good life in the broadcasting field although he had a devil when he tried to come with a slogan of ham and Wham's name. What made this film so popular was the lack of a house after World War II. Refugees from the war demanded their rights under the GI Rights Act which included home loans. The problem was there was certainly not enough housing to meet the needs. About the time of Eric Hodgins and the film were very popular Congress and President Truman signed the law of Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing which put the government for the first time in the construction of a house. I had a uncle and aunt who were almost at the same time building their houses that moved into the early five years. As Cary Grant and Myrna Loy had two daughters and they were looking out of the inner city of Rochester. Their area was not as big as a house in Connecticut and eighteen rooms, yet they lived there all their lives like Cary and Myrna did. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and the only cost to keep up and up, threatening to send Cary to cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to give advice, usually it's late. The truth is told she is a kind of sweet to Myrna and Cary knows. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is just Nora's extension. If you think of Charles's move to the country and William Powell with headache Cary Grant does, the film will still continue to do good work. <br /> <br /> Blandings Build His Dream House still works well as a comedy because the situation is universal. And this review is dedicated to Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.
