Other aspects of this film are dated, of course. All white men, for example. And as many of the Star-Science Science Fiction Wars, it tends to take too long to join. But, yet, no movie ever caught the taste of the Golden Age Science Fiction like this, even less for the use of "tons of electricity" to give a brand mark. Robbie Robot announced the Asimov robots, and was an inspiration for every follower, from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot, of course, is Shakespeare's "Rain". Morbius is a Prospero, and a sorcerer who receives his invading kingdom and collaborators ... It was a movie treated by Fiction Science as an adult type, perhaps first.
