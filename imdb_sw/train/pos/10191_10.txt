What is on this disc is the first level of display for the first level band. This disc is not in the heart of despair ... music is very intense, and it is very good. What you will learn when you watch this film is why who was so great for a long time. It is true that their records were good, but their performances were on the pot. In 1969 when the festival was shot, the clamorous teenie screams that produced jelly beans on Beatles went with the band (and viewers) were seated for a long time and often an amazing display of music quality - something that a few viewers are interested in. The mind to follow in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What exactly is learning here is the amazing things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to delete. Try out the festival, it's very strange.
