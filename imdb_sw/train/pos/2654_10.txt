Everyone should see this film completely! It's awesome, but it didn't mention the cripples "fly-out-of-you-just-to-awesome-you-and-pass-off-like-scary" stuff. It is very true. Check out this amazing movie! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the general director who has ever lived. Each of his movies is masterpieces, including this. Shine is on this family that goes to the hotel in the Colorado Rockies as keepers for the winters, and get the snow inside. Well, the house is haunted. Child is psychic. The man is easily attracted to the bad haunted hotels, and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not true. It becomes very interesting where items are split by the viewer from different directions, and it is worried. It's not just classic, "Here is Johnny" area. It's memorable, but can't talk to all movies. It is one of those things where the words will not describe it sufficiently, and you just got to see. So go to Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
