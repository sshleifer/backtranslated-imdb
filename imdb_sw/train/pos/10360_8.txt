This is the story of docudrama on the case of Lindy Chamberlain and looking for its impact on the Australian community. It looks particularly at the problem of conversion, rumors and expectations when dealing with real life dramas. <br /> <br /> One issue story is taken and the expected way all people give the same emotional response to the same situation. Not everyone enters the wildlife's lectures for each major dispute. Just because the characters in the movies and on TV do somehow do not have to expect real people to do it. This is very appropriate for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking at a large area of ​​laughter that will draw the parameters. It is a matter that should always be addressed. <br /> <br /> Guidance plays deep characters, personality and sensitivity. And they are used by the great hand of all who play. Other observers may be surprised to know that many of the support in this story are the most well known people in Australia as comic actors. It reaffirms my idea that comic executives perform some of the best assistants in dramas because for comedy they know how to introduce quick feelings of individuals. Spoiler! Warning! I need to say something very personal here; since I am a former Adventist who was a member of the Australian work when this event happened; so I have different feelings of story than many. I think it is addressed with wonderful creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best location is one where the couple is beaten with new choppers. It captured the theme of the story carefully. I've ever heard of Fred Schepsi saying in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best condition for their behavior". Although this is appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general rule that should apply to all who work as well.
