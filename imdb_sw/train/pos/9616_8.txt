It is worth looking at twice as a result of a rapid pace of change between several compelling stories, "Bug" is emerging as a satisfying work of art that has a long-term love over models among the fact of the offensive. The characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) who are more concerned with life - from that of flight flight to which he is a responsible part - inappropriate film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time building a surreal but a tasty meal for her unworthy husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, cable television technician and baseless faith in a biscuit message: "You will meet a girl of your dreams." From these hopes it is the power of quirky reality, all of which come from the actions of the characters: parking ticket, gas run in the Chinese shop / donut shop, TV disturbance, damaged fender, The damaged dinner that eventually leads to the cancellation of Hawaii vacation. <br /> <br /> The film is funny: Olive to drink in Chippendale's performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a client of an experimental service trying to cope with an angry client, Cyr obsessive of blood disease (Brian Cox) faced by an inspector restaurant, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) responding to her boyfriend for refusing to have children by writing the unfortunate cookie of the Chinese: "Your girl is asleep" with a man who sleeps while having a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's cat. A small story with a public cabl hosting (Darryl's) and a local teacher teacher from the "Boy in Bubble" explains the main theme: Love comes from the heart. "Bug" inserts to the same level as "trains, airplanes and cars" but with a low budget and an enjoyable eye.
