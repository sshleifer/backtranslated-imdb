Bela made pic 9 for Monogram, but it was only this, 4TH, things started coming together. All others in the series will use this as a useful template for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the same series will also involve with one important thing: a scientist (usually Bela) makes a pilot in an apartment or an old house (sometimes inside an apartment in an old house) which causes things to go blooey. This was the first time that the Director of Art Dave Milton had the opportunity to spread his wings. He came to the BLACK DRAGONS board, flick before, but this is where he gets to make his trick start. Lewis made a favorable situation with something, and was close to all of Monograms. Sending is important in these, and it's a good B one-wise movie, here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), with Russell, who could star in the Lewat 'CAT PEOPLE movies and Rosetto, from the SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a good piece of poverty. If you have a limited time and budget, beginning with this ... it counts everything that they have learned so far, and gives you something to compare with others. Poor? Bela steals gland juice to keep his beautiful wife sand. They both love to sleep in coffins. If you can read and exciting, the rest will be easy.
