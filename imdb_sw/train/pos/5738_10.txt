I just turned and watched the film on this film. The DVD transfer comes last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a very small film. Ignored by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and I have loved it since then. I like the shot of Pittsburgh's opening (not Baltimore, if another user commented). It makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, a visit to Pitts on a trash truck and Nicky is very strange, one interesting! Tom Hulce, like everyone else said, provides wonderful, wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, without extra, but the glass structure. I recommend to those who love the movie.
