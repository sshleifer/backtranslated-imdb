While in the barn of Kent Farm and Shelby awaiting Chloe, Clark is attacked and awakened in the center of the center of the session with Dr Hudson. The psychologist tells him that for five years he has been a fraud, believing that he has come from Krypton and had authority. Clark succeeds to escape, and meets Lana, Martha and Lex who confirm Dr Hudson's words. Chloe just believes on his words, but also seems to be insane. Clark fights to find the truth about personality and its own nature. "Labyrinth" is undoubtedly the most fascinating part of "Smallville". The author was very fortunate and refused the presence of a powerful young man from Krypton. Hum sadness gives a sense of discomfort and a wonderful security of identity needs to be explained. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Labirinto" ("Labyrinth")
