Eddie Izzard is not something short of comedic, and this is Eddie for the very best. Its material is very witches and hilarious, and its delivery is some of the best ever to witness on stage. Instead of insulting the audience of the audience, he hopes to draw humor from the recommendations of tablets, Hitler, new moon, and UK. By laughing very memorable, one can not help but repeat some of its lines. Ever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered to be one of the funniest lines ever released in routine standup. Every fan of the comedy on the highest level needs to see the "kill dress". Apart from the UK's best player I have witnessed, Eddie Izzard has tried to achieve the success of the live stage. However, his lack of business success in the film should not be an indication of how talented he really is. "Kill Clothing" is a treasure, which by chance has found a way to go to a home video, and it can and should be interested again and again.
