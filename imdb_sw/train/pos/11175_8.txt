Regularly with Stephen King's change, you only get a collection of characters to write conversations from books. This is very interesting to the heart of the book. Maybe because they don't use large text texts from the book, but it's a little more than a story in the story. Much of his success is Miko Hughes as a child Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really does as his parents. There is a place where Louis beat Gage, and they are very natural. Fred Gwynne is amazing. He puts the sharp nail of Maine perfectly without running into the disease, and it is wise and warm as Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
