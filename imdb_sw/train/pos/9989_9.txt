I had the opportunity to see this film recently. I believe it will be in the cinema in Canada some time around Mother's Day. Located in the theater near you ... Go! It's not a very good-sounding movie - it's beyond the lines of feel and reflecting movie. The director is doing a good job of character development - allowing you into the heart, mind and pain of Hagar a little bit. At first, his attitude and behavior are not very concerned. If his story reveals, it becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... insight brings compassion. I found that he was recommended by the end of the film - especially when he opened his heart to the boy in the shade and lake. Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and reflecting on our own experience in this world. His youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the edge of their seat - and in a kind of raw sense that is true and unusual. It is fun to see Ellen's page works in this film. He is very different from a young woman playing in Juno. It gives me more knowledge for its acting ability. If you love him in Juno, you will love him in the Angel of Stone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is no way to show the ability to act as power as the actor's ability to make you forget all the other qualities that have ever played. Never once in this movie I was thinking about Ellen Burnstyn - I always have only Hagar's ideas. He took me to his character - hook, line and sink. Kari Skogland The ability to capture this so-called book and one of Canada's most popular authors is amazing. She carefully brings to the scots the stoney and angels of this hard woman, Hagar - the angel of stone.
