I must give how to move around-perfect because the content is very good. If the previous auditor commented, I do not know how this film has found itself in the list of less than 100 IMDB! That's absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those who share the theme of the theme - can't hold this candle to the question of its top mix, trust of the act, and the drama of an amazing dance. in order to finish the basic story (this is not just about winning competition) is very easy to enter in, and really amazing. No main characters in this are 2-dimensional in any way and, at the end of the film, it is very easy to feel emotional investing in them. (And, even if you're not a type of crying, you can get a little bit of eyes before the credit limit.) An interesting and effective story. How He is going to be imperfect without a doubt (what is a film?), But it is definitely cutting off more films that use beautiful faces to hide a plot and a half or characters who do not have a substance. Artists and settings in this film make a real journey that is very interesting thanks to the amazing talent of players!
