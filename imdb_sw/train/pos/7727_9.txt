PLANET IN IT is the best SF film from the golden age of SF movies and what makes a great film is a wonderful feeling. Once the spaceship sit the audience - through the human crew ships - travels in a wonderful way and sometimes terrible. We meet Robbie, an incredible, Dr Dr Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell who died out one night. Or do you? You can nitpick and say the planet is clear on the film's original color film but it adds a sense of danger to claustraphobia and I feel with Bebe and Louis Barron's electric music enhances the sky more! br>> I was shocked by this film not on the top IMDB 250 film.
