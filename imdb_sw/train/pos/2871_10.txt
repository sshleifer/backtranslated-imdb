Comments? If my opinion is important? We are talking about all the time, for all seasons and generations. This is just the kind of movies that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies it is some kind of magic. All characters are in some way, "living" and "real" so it's easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language, (if I didn't understand when I was watching the film, because I was six years old). Maybe my English is not good, but I have learned what I know more from this kind of movies, and this is one of the most trendy of this movie, which at this time is normal. But there is one great shame. In my country now it is impossible to watch this, or another movie of Disney! We do not have copyright, so our children have been denied to enjoy and learn from this kind of movie. So, we will look at this film again "Once upon a dream" or ...?
