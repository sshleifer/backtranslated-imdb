Rookie relies on the true story of a 40-year-old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas which reaches majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a high school secondary school teacher and a baseball coach. His team is losing so much until the team finds that their coach played on a small league and they can give us a maximum of 98 points. The movie sells stories from Jimmy being a boy playing in his first game in majors. It is the story of the story of the story and the friend's friendly family. Dennis Quaid makes the movie appropriate at the time, giving it emotional performance and is assisted by the best casting including: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. The story takes a little time to develop and some scenes are slow but all works well to the end. Baseball performances are fun, well played, and well displayed. Modern realistic is not about football but on one man's effort to achieve his dream. It's inspiring, it's emotionally, and it's funny. I liked, I hope to do. Rookie. Stars: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 Stars.
