When I saw this film I first had my father. He encouraged me to watch this film because it was one of his favorites. After watching the film it immediately became one of my favorites. The river you use It is about two brothers who each take a different way in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is an elder of two brothers and has been placed in the way of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a younger brother who goes on a road full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters as each follow their own way. <br /> <br /> No downside for this movie. You will be welcome the whole way. Acting, leading, and script is perfect. Two things that are unique are movies and symbols. All that you admire in the world of Robert Redford creates you. <br /> <br /> This is around the popular film that is supposed to be normal. It is certainly in my book. If you haven't seen this film you should watch it as soon as possible because it will continue with you forever.
