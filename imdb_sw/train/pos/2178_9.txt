For many suns, light shades and shadows blow through windows and inside rooms, tracking shots moving through the crowd with supervised cameras, quick-fast editing and almost close-ups here and there, photography is something in this interesting, artistic film made. This movie plan begins as a bit of thought about the beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday in a swimming pool, where we meet Lucienne played with Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little show-off in front of people gawking and poolside, she soon decides to enter herself to represent France in a beauty contest of Miss Europe, with a large amount of envy, a muddy partner (a good man who was angry, realistic). To win the road ten competitors show themselves in swimsuits, when the winner is selected as an opponent who gets the longest blows (I wondered, the girls can not just walk slowly to extend their time - and so clap - on the catwalk?!). Lulu has been expelled by Prince and Maharaja, but her head of fire does not like the ears given by other people or her public recording, for that matter (I think she just loves her home, cooking her food, and sitting out, eh?!) . Louise Brooks is beautiful and beautiful, her presence helps to add this film, but it is really a way that has been photographed which had my most interest. Amazing little is the odd sound of dubbed, which is far less. The publication of this version is visible and full of good though. Watching this I have tried to stop the sound problems and watch the film, and I have seen the movie better, worth seeing.
