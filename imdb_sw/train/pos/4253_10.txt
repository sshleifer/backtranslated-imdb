the best movie, one of the best I saw. Touch and simple - like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you just hit and it's just fine. not much of anything, as required to be. In fact he liked the idea of ​​the movie, no bad or good people, all or just people, sometimes makes more mistakes because of the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and others are more successful than others and the most important thing is that you have no reason of anger - you can do that, but eventually the anger gets out and then you need to let love return in though it is hard, there is a real lie. <br /> <br /> Chief executives and cast, the film makes you feel the movie. <br /> <br /> beautiful good. I recommend to see it, especially if you would like to see the lives of the tourists.
