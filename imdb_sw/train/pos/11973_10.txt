The perfect house is a good sitcom which is on the father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. So Danny tells her brother, Jesse Katsopolis, and a good friend, Joey Gladstone, to help bring her three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner, and Michelle Tanner. This is my most popular show, and I can look at it all day. And something on the Full House always makes me laugh and there's a sad part too. There is no bright time in Full House. Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner), and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner).
