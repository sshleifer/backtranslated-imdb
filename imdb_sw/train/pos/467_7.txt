This film is one of a few of the 2000 best quality films and one of the best. This situation depends on the novel and Vladimir Nabokov and transfers on the big screen are quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> Filming is better as a turturro actor and Watson. Turturro definitely provides its best performance to date to prove that he has more value than what we thought. Watson also does it gently. <br /> <br /> The story is about a wonderful chess player (Turturro) which is also very eccentric in his daily life. The film has been presented in a timely manner, with many of Luzhin's childhood constraints. In these ways, the character of Luzhin's complex is described. I don't have anything to say, but suggest this film to anyone.
