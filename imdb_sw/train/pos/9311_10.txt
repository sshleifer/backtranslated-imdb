This was the worst movie I ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi movie of nature must be bad, that's what makes them happy! Line, "I would like my meat dinosaur has done well!" it's probably the best quote ever! Also, the plot looks like something out of dreams if it is a dream. I can think now, the authors rise after a whole night of getting up and playing a dance drum, then put the ideas together for this: Pirates chance to get to the alien planet, which is affected by dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, to protect the science team studying the planet. Best ever ever! In fact, it resembles a full list of the movie Sci Fi perfect: guns dinosaurs during the time of travel to a terrible action / / <br /> So walk to watch this film, but don't tell it.
