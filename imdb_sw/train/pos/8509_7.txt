I hate reading comments about saying something like, 'Don't waste your time, this film stinks on ice. It does this for the inspector for me, it may have some kind of na√Øve charm. If you like the other 'Whistler' films, this will appear. If you like 40 noirish films, this will appear. This video is not good, in my opinion, like any of the previous series series that showed Richard Dix as the main character. It's very slow, and the plot is bad. You have seen the device used in many other films, and is usually better. <br /> <br /> But acting is good, and so lighting, and conversation. It's just lacking energy and you'll likely think what exactly is going on and how each one will come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through. <br /> <br /> 'Whistler' series is half noir, and there are behaviors, emotions, lights, camera movements and corners are more important than the story itself. But this film is not black. It is too expensive and Hollywood is not guilty of it. Neither Richard Dix's behavior nor the desire of any of his women in the previous film had come to a good end. You just never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> But still, I'll recommend this one for at least one look. I have looked at it at least twice for myself, and I've had enough fun twice.
