I enjoyed this film very much. I've been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie just insists. She shows the housewife in an African and American family that encourages a community chain from the success of the husband (Danny Glover) as a prosecutor. He goes to all the white neighborhood where people are friendly, but it's still a little bit towards him. Several events occurring during the filming period make for some people laugh but many are reluctant. This film is not comedy as drama. I give 8/10 power. I strongly recommend making it on TV or recent rental.
