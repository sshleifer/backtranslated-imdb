I was hearing some very good things about this movie and maybe I saw a low score here on IMDb and that's why I avoided it. Today they showed Sky Vanilla on TV and if I didn't have nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, I'd have a hard time getting anything better to do. Sky Vanilla is a movie of fear, sad and touching, in fact one of the best I saw in time. I was amazed at how I was affected to look at it. It's hard to explain, but during the film your feelings towards the characters and your view of the changes that are taking place is a completely emotional journey. Vanilla's Sky has touched me in a very unusual way for the film, or any media for it. I recommend everyone to watch this film. Regardless of what you have heard about it.
