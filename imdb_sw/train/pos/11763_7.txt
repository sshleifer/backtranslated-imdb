I think everyone needs to return for some time. And that's a shameful resident of Taft Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) expects to do in "Best of Times". Yep, a man who went both mad and radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" plays football. In this case, he tries to restore the game that bears his high school status. But the Powerful Reno Force (Kurt Russell) is not just going with it with ease. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not the best movie for anyone. But Williams and Russell are really a good team of comedy. And some names in this film are likely to give you giggles (say limited). See.
