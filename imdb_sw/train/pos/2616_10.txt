The King of Lion 1 1/2 is a very good story to go with the King of the Lion. It depends on the original story of the King of Lion but with a few feet. In the film, the wind is defined by a different perspective of the characters. This story is still a natural plot. Besides separation, Disney is not all good in doing things worthwhile. This, being the third part of the King of the Lion (Simba's Pride is second.) In fact he has a natural idea at that time still involves the first happiness. Timon and Pumbaa travel together and find a good place to live. After searching far and wide, they have the opportunity to "No Matata". They then encounter a young lion called Simba, and through many things that parents today pass. I think this is a very good movie, and I enjoy adding it to my collection.
