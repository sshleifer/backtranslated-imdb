CITY HALL is a certain combination package. Part of the vignettes of the life of the NYC, and the moral story. Al Pacino, Boss of Dukakis-esque and presidential dreams, gives them the times of failing stars or failures. There are two times when stimulating the environment, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where it shines. John Cusack provides less and general performance, without going to a new caricature of New Orleans, or walking on the melodrama at the peak of the film. Danny Aiello as a political head, is also very good. I like exhibitions, too. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is a general sense of lack of speed. It comes more like a document, than a motion picture. We see an action or follow a story from a personal perspective, and usually, the viewer doesn't participate. When the viewer does not interact at a certain level, they are concerned about the characters, and finally, the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to destroy, and what is supposed to be riveting, clarifying details, came as "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say you "You can't fight the city hall," as if the worst course takes place. However, he can not stop you from thinking what might be, if they were standing screenplay and pacing of this movie.
