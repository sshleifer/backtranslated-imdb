One of the West 's most satisfactory, Johnny Yuma has the most beautiful Wai made during the heyday of the kind and is highly recommended for fans of the type or offbeat, the intellectual film. Johnny Yuma is, in many cases, not natural nature, but this is not appropriate to eliminate it. The success of the type of film depends on how it meets the audience's expectations and it also provides a surprising difference on these expected features. Earlier, interesting experience is restored but by distorting (or large) misleading that provides ongoing interest. The quality of action also, obviously, is important. Fatigue will be more successful than a real attempt to invite or encourage viewers. From these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are many types of elements from the original films. The layout is the world of the semi-feudal twilight of the evening evening and westward than the western “family” of 1964-1968 such as Tempo di murder (1966). The program is a mix of the core dollar (1964) and Ringo films, an amazing fact as the film writer Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best journalists in the famous Cinecitta movie in the 1960s-70s and his work helped to provide continuous interaction with such partners (with several other creatures in several different actors, directors, and Authors of the picture). In FOD's plot, the protagonist arrives in the city, causing a bad situation, then has a close death and the resurrection and resurrection (in some films, like Quella sporca storia in the west (1968) is actually crucified. The Catholic channels of story and gestures are amazing, especially because of the clear clarity of people / followers of film and film. The Ringo program, developed fully by the image writer Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films related to Guliano Gemma, the egoistic protagonist chooses the community's interest on himself through a relationship with the member of the community (with a good dash of health uncertainty) ). The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clear according to that of Manco / Mortimer from Fistful Dollar (1965). Two parts of the belt conversion belt provides a clever discussion and understanding between the two. Most movies, including Uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, whoen sabe? (1967), use this relationship between an older and younger (father / child, older brother / younger, Anglo / enemy counselor and farmer revolution) as the main strength of the plot. <br /> <br /> is a view of deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, which return to the most original original WAI. Canons and pueblos of Almeria have real mazes in a way that the protagonist and opponent plays sports shifts of cat and mouse. What is the definition of Johnny Yuma from the other WAI is the quality of Romolo Guerriri's use of knives / psychology as well as the settings and intelligent systems of the script to move the plot. The discussion was not very important for WAI and was often unknown without thinking (they thought there was a difference, like a stupid opinion in Django (1966) or faccia faccia (1967). through iconic images, it is juxtapositions, and is the description of the general state of the news. Look at how Samantha's death is being demolished during the beat-up area looking from the roof or from the history of action. and Pedro of their safety and confidence in their power through its invasion of reserve, hotel, even the bedroom (this, again, is the theme from FOD) Finally, see how there is a focus on information search. caused by the FOD which ultimately depended on the secret of the boiling of the Red Harvest. and the pursuit of the harvest made by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in this surreal and mysterious fact that the details that precede it are the conclusion. <br /> <br /> The movie was known at the time for what they knew was extra in violence. Of course, these films were no more violent than many western Americans. What was different from the psychological wind of violence and the factors that were involved, which is to say that it is not abuse but it means that it had changed. Johnny Yuma is different and interesting in its use and displayed on violence and this is another interesting feature of the film. <br /> <br /> What I get so much interesting on many of this kind is a link that provides for anonymous, non-name audience in Italy and Spain whose common stories have had an important importance and interest. The fake can not have a local value and itself? some soil from the original site, the pottery, or the piece of the skin and the burned metal? but it is a reference to another name that is anonymous, life, which was meaningful only because they existed. When Johnny Yuma has a local value, a lot of my interest comes from this relationship with the secret. <br /> <br /> On the list of western spaghetti lists http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWS http://imdb.com / mymovies / list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> For only poets (under barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list L = 21849890
