Sometimes I watch the film and am attracted to it? and yet it's not easy to explain why I liked it so much. Is this really true for non-standard movies? those who can not resemble others out there. Goodnight Mr. Tom is one of these special movies. There are many emotions in the movie? and acting was very good when I was watching movies, I was crying and laughing as the story continued. Nick Robinson youth? is a young boy (William) who was transferred from London because of the air strike there during World War II. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man who leaves the village rescued children. <br /> First Tom refuses to take any responsibility - such as caring for a young boy? but he receives since he remains without election. When staying Mr. Tom knows how to frighten William's life? with his luggage his mother sent to the belt with orders written to the host of his son? not reluctant to use. Is this belt closed in the field? never to be used in such a cruel way. Mr. Tom provides real homes to William, and the boy enjoys his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and finds the secret talents. All of a letter to William is called home in London with a letter saying that he doesn't feel good? And it starts again? just this time it gets worse? There are many feelings you can see in this film? love, fear, sadness, joy, pain, hope? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of the British movie similar to others like Frankie and Billy Elliot's partner? if someone is a comparison. I am very happy to look at it and recommend it very much. Before completing this review I would like to mention the good performance of Thomas Orange in Zac's role? reminded me of my friend since my childhood (:
