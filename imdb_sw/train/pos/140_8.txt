I usually don't like the series at all. They are all predictable and tend to boring and decreasing very quickly. This series, however, is played well, the story follows through all events and even if you lose one, the story will still continue to focus on your thoughts. These events have been done in hospitals and are taking you more and more in the dark and old secret secrets that are under the surface of a severe hospital.
