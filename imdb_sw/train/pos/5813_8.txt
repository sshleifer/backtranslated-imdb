This film is good. Now, I tend to love my heavy movies on the story and talk, but now and sometimes, something like Moonwalker comes, and it appears, despite many mistakes. <Br /> <br /> This movie is much more fun Michael Jackson. Starting with a video of the patients installed to the 'Man in Mirror' on the montage's success list, and bits and bobo from his work, goes through all of his life, then falls down to the real part, which acts like a video The music of 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ as it runs from fans of manic motion, and finally playing against rabbit dress. Stopping is not as bad as others would believe. Can be approved. Then we see a great video 'Leave me alone', and directly on the main feature. Yes, the plot is delicious. Very good. We see Michael walking out of the building, then he is shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we hit the hitback, showing MJ and three children oppressing the underground. 'Big Big' (Joe Pesci) is a nefarious woman who plans to get every child on earth using 'drugs' (no special ones are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl she is getting caught, then chased ... yada yada yada. The program is not the most important part. We get a very cool system where MJ turns on the car, then something of a robot-spaceship, and of course, a wonderful series of 'Smooth Criminal'. <br /> <br /> It's a film of it, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has a lot of its great hits, and some cool bit bits, and some very special effects (Robot / Spaceship sequence exactly) Worth it, especially seen as you can take for a quid on ebay. It will prevent children from stabilizing for several hours, as well as more than 20 who were children when they were first given.
