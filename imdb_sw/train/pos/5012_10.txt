In April 1965, CBS announced the first television series for Barbra Streisand. The version was not just a polling achievement, but gave Emmy 5 awards as well. This is one of the most memorable moments in the 1960 television and (unfortunately) a special TV type does not get any longer. Filled with good tracks and amazing performance with Barbra, this special must be able to see for any fan of Streisand and anyone interested in early television.
