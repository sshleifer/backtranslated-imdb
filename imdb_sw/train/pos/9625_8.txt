The first time watching this film is difficult to know exactly what happened, but the next look is more obvious. I enjoyed this film. Dean Cain was the best in Bob's position. Lexa Doig's attitude was to combine understanding, for the first time, he had gone to Bob's trap but I believe he loved to love him though he had broken his heart. Cain's work was very common. He gets the best and every film he does. My only question at the end of the film is what happened to Bob, Camilla and baby. It remained for the viewer to decide
