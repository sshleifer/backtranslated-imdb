I looked at one place two days ago and today I saw two parts. Of course the two parts are part of the world so I have been exposed to all that I have seen. I felt I had no knowledge of the death of Che; for me, opened the entire movie. I think that's what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, happen slowly to escape his death. The second part was very bad compared to, again inevitable but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia was very serious. Bolivia's political movements had only been explained but they were not largely met. For me the unforgettable ceremonies were at the end of this film: the struggle with jail and heavy discussion with the Bolivian official where the official Che questions are about the failure of farmers to support his revolution. I had not considered national differences playing as a major role as they did in war, Argentina against Bolivia. I thought Soderbergh dealt well with the inevitable problems in the revolutionary struggle; What? How do you get food without resisting farmers? I was beaten and how hard it would try something like Che tried. I think it's all in time; Is there enough anger against the government to start the movement; Bolivia did not. Che recognized the terrible corundum of revolutionaries in her letter to Fidel reading at the beginning of the film: If not now, time, 50 years from now. Very interesting and well-designed film; do everything to see.
