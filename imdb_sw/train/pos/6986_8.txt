If you are researching the facts of UFO, then this video is very important. 'Meat' of the video is a comment made by Buzz Aldrin. He is of course from the best of America. To be taught to have a purpose, honesty and truth in its reports. Most US experts of all eras have reported some form of contact, or UFO observer and there are videos from some of the messages. In some cases something happened that requires another objective that continues to explore. I think this evidence from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that another world can be interested in our development. Like the recorded video, this can be planted, but has more information and views from the successful American hero. Nor do they come every day. So the fact that some people don't like the information should not remove you from watching this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend looking for a clear mind.
