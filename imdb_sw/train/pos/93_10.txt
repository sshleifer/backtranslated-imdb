My first child was born this year, and I played a record album for boys every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still gave them to friends and relatives when they started the family ... always their Christmas album. I recently got a couple of DVDs (arranged on DVD-R from videos, maybe) sold on eBay. I bought it for a better copy, and it was very good to see the show after more than 25 years. But CD and all DVDs will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
