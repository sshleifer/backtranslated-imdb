There is nothing that doesn't like about Moonstruck. I am from the Italian family of New York and I find a small house when I look at it. Actors & actors, drama, subplots, humor .. all were fantastic. It starts slowly, but a lot happens in those two days! I loved LaBoheme because of this film. In my list of proposed movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It is a movie "to feel" where you come from a reminder of the "venue" game or repeat some of your favorite lines: "old man, if you give those dogs a piece of food, I will push you die "; "Chrissy, bring me a knife", "who died", "you love Loretta ....., good because when you do, they run things because they know they can". I always keep the Moonstruck on when there is nothing good to look for because it's fun.
