As an adult in the mid-40's, I am not close to any of the "Nancy Drew" of the key population, but I was delighted with this film this afternoon; so, I can tell them, they were two of the six women of the smell of silver under the line from me. An old man who came out of the playground in front of me especially pronounced the film for a 20-year-old girl (who said he said the film last evening and loved it). sure, however: In a row in front of me, there were nine - counters, girls aged fifteen went up next to each other, passing popcorn with a hot dog and candy back and forth and hitting the preview. Once the movie started, they immediately set down to look at the ... <br /> <br /> .... and was not enough enough until the closed documents began to expand. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect film; it does not pay for a small part of secondary school, not quite the sound of its own voice, and its buttons are just too far away to an indefinite time. But the resource-based revision is essentially respecting, the plot is based on precision, and continues to spread among the most humiliating and contemporary sins. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the movie with an amazing grace - At the time of the beautiful Josh Flitter however, this is a movie of Roberts, and he removes it with beauty. Nancy Drew is a direct elder of Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars, and the film is also the first parent of Jodie Foster's first and "Under Candlehoe" under the bottom. <br /> <br /> In the market today, it is a shortage: a family of family respecting the minds of the audience. So, it will not have everyone's taste - but why, it's the best movie of its kind for decades.
