This film is not sandy, despite its production and link to Troma production. Dark stories for adults. Using it is the theme of the Sugar Cookies, and someone wonders if the cast did not fall to the prey to say the theme. Wonderful movie and interesting pictures: shades and differences are popular. Certainly worth checking, especially from fans of Warhol and delicate damage. Through all cruelty and evil, values, if they are, can burn.
