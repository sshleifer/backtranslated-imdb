This is an amazing movie with all actors and artists and very beautiful! Although some actors and partners were not very popular in the show business they seem to have been doing since they were 1 year old! It was exciting, general and all just from a very good movie. In many places I didn't know what would happen next! I was like I think this will happen, be patient I think this will happen. All age groups will love this film! In one place I could not stop laughing, it was amazing, but in other places I had quite found it and I couldn't believe what I was seeing! I'm sure I will see this film again! It's one of those movies that can't get boring. Every time you see it is to emphasize. I certainly recommend seeing this movie!
