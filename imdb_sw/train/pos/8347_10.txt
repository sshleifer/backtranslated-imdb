Maybe I am generous with the rating ... but I just love this film! I've seen it many times, but every time I see it like it again. It's a simple romantic comedy, without anything big or staple. But I am a great partner with this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is very funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen. It's clean, beautiful movie - and that's very small now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just flick-flick. ;-). It's good 'un!
