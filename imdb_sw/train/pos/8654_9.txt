It is amazing that many people I know have not seen this small gem. everyone has come back and returned to the same response: WHAT MOVIE GREAT !! <br /> I have never been so concerned with Brad Pitt (though he returns to 12 monkeys and Fighting show show Club) but his performance in this film as psychological cannot be used, dark and right on target. Every other person in the film provides the best displays and a slow and deliberate filmmaking film adds too much trial. The feeling of fear for the perpetrators continues to increase as they know what happened. The only thing that puts this from the 10th book, is that compared to the previous one, the end is too small and infinite. but that was the only thing I could find in this ethnic group. Watching this film, try to get a non-suspended director's refusal for the best option to view. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 9
