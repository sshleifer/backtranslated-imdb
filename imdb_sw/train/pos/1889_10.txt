My family stands Arthur Bach coming down and strengthening since the movie went out first. We have many headlines. I looked at the last two weeks and I am still pleased with the sense of humor and the lifestyle that Dudley Moore shows. Liza Minelli did a good job as the other side - though I am not a big fan. This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite part is when Arthur visits the home of the fianc√©e. His conversation with the father of Suster and Susan is a ban on the side. The line from the pastor, "Do you deserve to wait at the Library" followed by Arthur's answer, "Yes, I would like, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL information on my computer. "Arthur is really" amazing things "!
