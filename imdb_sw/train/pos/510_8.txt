I watched this for the first time for a long time - I had forgotten how the pictures were thinking, and how the movie was envious. I did not even forget the opening events that are (with the location on the Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) between the romantic romantic love. Anybody who is interested in politics or history will be interested in attraction records - anyone interested in romance will be evicted by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who likes to see pictures will enjoy an afterworld show. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" made almost simultaneously - but this is very good. <br /> <br />
