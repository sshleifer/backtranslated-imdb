Once I liked to "Push Daisies". This show can put a smile on my face and a great discussion of stories, magic talks and good acting. But not all: It will also be able to keep you to the end. The basic idea behind the show - Bringing people to one touch, finishing the undead situation and the second - it's interesting and can be in the future season. But the murder cases of concern, the special look of the show and the journalist greatly enhances the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than part. It has a certain charm that I enjoy so much and I hope to enter the world of Ned and Chuck for the second season.
