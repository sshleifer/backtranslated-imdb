The painter stressed the art of Andy Goldsworthy, seeking him for friendship and land and water, and his sense of proportion - and so gently, so relax well for the film for us. "Rivers and Water" love Goldsworthy's work and integrate it as a spectacle to see time and the presence of human beings in the world around us, the world that hides its power in the open. Watch this film!
