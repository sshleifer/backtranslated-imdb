For my life, why this film has received R rating? Although it's about zombies-eating meat, believing or not, it's really a good family-friendly film - at least if your kids are 10 years old and more. Unlike traditional zombie films, this has a good sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- although it is a little happening! The language is not a big problem, no ignorance and style of film is obvious to children (such as the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - however a modern head shot R single rating! Believe me, many children have seen the worst violence than this and it just seems to be worried to make the audience think this is just an adult film. <br /> <br /> Stories installed in parallel world. While fashions, cars and material are seen in 1953, in this bizarro world has had a serious risk of a recent zombie that has led to a "zombie war" and a dramatic change in everyday life. In school, children have been trained in the fight against weapons and there is a fun place at the end of the film where the father gives his child handgun and tells him to put it in his "just like"! As for life outside the school, it's as good as people have learned that zombies are not a bad thing! Heck, using shock collars and training, can be slaves who can do your homework, clean roads, give milk or, to the case of a really sick guy, be "your special friend". This film deals with one family who eventually buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). The mother is happy with her child slowly becoming a friend of a zombie. Father, on the other hand, are not sure - if he was forced to earlier kill his own zombie father and has not yet been filled on this! Funny, useless and unique - this film needs to be seen by a broad audience.
