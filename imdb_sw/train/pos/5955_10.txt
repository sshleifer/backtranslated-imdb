As in the gloom of "this darkness," I admit we ignored three very important qualities in our last qualities. The release of items was on top of items that could not be corrected immediately, nor cooperative parties - who saw the movie - mention at that time. On behalf of the best and the film staff, I am adding them to forgiveness. Obviously, some criticism sent here is sharp because of their credit being accidentally. Our production standards were poor and our "special effects" were very special, but the plot is very strong and John McLeod's movies are good. We expect you, the reader, to enjoy this "darkness" and the efforts of those who have done their work for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
