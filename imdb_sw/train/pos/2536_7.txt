The three horrible films that well remember always love Dracula and Frankenstein; and there is a very good reason for it, but there was a small number of production, but the Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plan is not the original with other plots that have been seen many times before (even back in 1936) but the way everything is put together is very sure and director Lambert Hillyer has created a small original movie. The program focuses on the good quality of Dr. Janos Rukh; someone who has found a way to restore the history of the world. His discoveries make him believe that there may be an unknown part of the radio somewhere in Africa and so it keeps away from a team of respected colleagues to find it. However, the tragedy takes place during the journey with a good doctor takes it to the point; which makes him gloom, and also sends him ... ..... The biggest big film of course is the fact that the star two big stars of his day's fears - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both offer excellent performances. Karloff really demonstrates good performances and his character has a lot of meat for Karloff to impress. Bela Lugosi has a role that is very different from what we are used to see, and is a good performance from him as well; it is advisable to see a bit of mixture from Lugosi. The movie is leaving for a slow start; but soon things begin to take. The second half of the film is better and yes when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not put its focus on major special effects and largely depends on the actions of the main character in order to put things interesting; and it works very well. The film remains attractive everywhere and boils up to a very decent peak that binds everything well. In general, Invisible Ray can be one of the best films of the thirties; but it is very good and it is proposed.
