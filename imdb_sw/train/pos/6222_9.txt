This is really a great movie. Some of the songs have been of immortal origin and playing with Fred and Ginger are among the best. But basically, all Fred and Ginger films are the same. After singing and playing, it is the other characters in the movie who performs film work. What really bother me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His love with Harriet Hilliard and a small plot of the movie is why I look at it regularly. Adds to this film, not available. He has a winning personality with a nice smile. Randy is in my top ten list at all. It's nice to see him as something other than a cowboy. Well, so he is not a good actor, but as many stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc.. He liked it very much and could lift it up sometimes. All Fred and Ginger movies had small plots based on other actors to fill the space between the mobile numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by almost half an hour. I just want so many people will enjoy Randy and I felt the need for his stand.
