In fact I think that this film is good, personal. But, in every movie there is a downer. Now, some of you may not watch Hilary Duff's 'Adding Your Voice', but If you think about it, these two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In a 'brave new girl', Holly intends to enter the Hairy Store. In 'Raising Your Voice', Terri wants to go to the preservation at L.A. (do not remember the storage name there). Both are in the field of music, and both should sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films are the same. I personally like 'girl boy hero' better than, 'Add your voice' though.
