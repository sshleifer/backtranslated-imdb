If you would like CB4, you don't know what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet. This film is proud, and it involves much more about the hip industry than any movie animation ... It is unfortunate that this film has not been removed from the dvd because it is one movie that everyone has watched and liked and wanted to copy. If you want a good laughter and you like hip hop and a little unknown to the old school artists, definitley to rent this movie. These are not many video rental sites that contain their own copies, but if you are available for one you will not be discouraged.
