My and my groavadelic 20-pals just simply can't get enough for this wonderful Posey CLASSIC Parker! I tried to rent this on DVD, but it doesn't seem to get it - it's too bad, since I'm sure the article will be "more special" !! :) We all recommend this cool-cold ferickerino for a date, or even just a happy night house! This can also be a kind of film watching your cat, or even giving us a basic party, like the "Party Girl" party, as well as one in the film that Parker Posey is loved, is proposed, visible. to the end. Oh, and have a look to finish the surprise of HILARIOUS ... moving aside, Sixth Seats, you've got out through a radder film! Sorry, no error, just call it as it is! Taking from the old flick partner, the comedy just isn't available than "Party Girl" and Parker P! Feel! Wako, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
