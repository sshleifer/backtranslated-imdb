This version of Bleak House is the best of the classic novel known to me. Representation of the Chancery court as a 'character' in the festival is very good. Acting is amazing, from Tulkinghorn the sinner, to Dedlocks, Small, Crooke, Miss Flyte, and two young lovers. But it is an electoral network that holds one thing together, and the movies are very good. What mistake did the BBC do on copyright which meant that this version could not be seen in the UK for video or DVD for many years? I tried to get from them, but I met a stone wall. Finally I have a copy of the DVD from Canada.
