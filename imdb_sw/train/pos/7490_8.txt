To this day I have never seen this film. It was done on a set of Old Giza and Frankenstein's House and involves a small village of Bavaria where it is alleged that large bats are absorbing the blood of the villagers. It is really a very good movie that has at least a cast that will not leave, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas are playing a character called Brettschnieder which is useful to me because it was my boyfriend's name bibi. This is a carefully planned film that has a coin and a single one that creates a slower time in its shortest time, disappearing within ten minutes before they realize they had little time to cover everything. . From that point until the end is run directly to the end of a very little fun. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb are a good time of 71 minutes and warning of short clauses. The problem is that IMD and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are since the source I believe more says the full time time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia) Quibbling on this I know is insane but since many prints that are available to walk around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is as little as 67 minutes long. Of course I think it won't care to be a lot more than five minutes and I am very sure it will do or break the film. What time at any time, if you like old creaky films, do, for all ways to do, see this film, its dark and stormy night film.
