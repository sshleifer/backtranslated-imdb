The movie begins with Vincent Prices about starting its function as a witch. However, in the middle of the way through a successful show, the police come and bind down. It seems that his former boss had deceived him out of the designed tricks - even those he did at his home. As a result, the fair price kills the wicked. The problem is that when the viewer understood why Prices were killed and they probably thought this was a GOOD, because the price was low, he was not able to stop one (such as eating potato potatoes). <br /> The movie was full of innovative and interesting techniques (including a great round of round and burning fires for the exhibition), it is a great deal of conspiracy and interesting action. One thing that you can't say about this film is that it is lighter. Although it is also far from the trick, it is fun everywhere, although it is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> If I have never seen the Vincent Prices for HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would like MAD more MADIC and close 8 or 9. WAX). Under the foundation is that since HOUSE WAXX was very successful, the form decreased again in the tracking film. Both of them were made in 3-D, they all have a plot where the Price has every right to kill but can not stop immediately made first and both are happy to look at. The main difference, and there are few, is that the WAX ​​House was painted and was the awesome film and MAD MAG was the most obvious secret. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this film with HOUSE OF WAX (only price version). They are all terrible terrible movies of 1950.
