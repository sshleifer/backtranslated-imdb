The best role of Arguebly Al Pacino. Playing Tony Montana, a small camp from Cuba turned into a strong and powerful master in Miami, and he does just that with two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and he does not break 'em with anyone. He walks like working with a great Cuban vendor, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and goes quickly to the organizational level with his long-term friend Manny (Steven Bauer). He recently has an eye on the wife of the wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank saw the threat from Tony to his place, he tries to kill Tony but without luck. Tony is angry and nothing can stop him now. The film has great support among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a misleading error trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's younger sister. Credit for Ecxellent screens and Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brightest Brian DePalma's points in his high and low work, you can see this person is very talented. The movie has a great look for it. Also beware of two memorable events: One in a fancy restaurant ("Say good night to bad person"). another is the last shot where Tony shows that he still knows how to rush the ass and kill 20 lost murderers in his home. this is definitely one of the last surprises for the movie I ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies are a must-see. For all others it is highly recommended. 10/10
