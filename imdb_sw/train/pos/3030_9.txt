This film has events that are coming back to me in the most wonderful moments - the area where Mr. Muckerji told Mrs. Melande that the man who spoke to the girl girl had wiped out the window with a woman who suited her statement — it's one that keeps going around - how she keeps calling her to name --- for the Greek emphasis "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer realizes that he has just taken poison and gave him the end of the head before he dies — it's fun! "Fools - Foolish - all my life ..." etc. etc. - you get a point. I have to buy this. I love Dan Seymour's actor - usually plays a great foreign pastor or police and appeared in Casablanca with many beautiful pictures.
