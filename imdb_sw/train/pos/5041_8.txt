Matthew McConaughey is a wonderful man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Boothe Authority) in his FBI office. He says he has information about the serial killer dismissed by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the real killer is his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his father widow Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father collects two brothers and tells them that God's angel had visited him and gave his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the awesome movie I have ever seen. I watched this film four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I looked again, now on the DVD. Although it's a small movie budget, bright screens are bright, without fault. Sent is the best, but I'd like to show the performance of Matt O'Leary as Felton limited. It is a very complicated and complicated role in young people. Bill Paxton's direction is amazing. There is no clear violence in this terrible film. First great behind the camera. I am grateful for Brazil's theme for this movie: 'Mão do Diabo' (Hand of the Devil '). If at least it was 'God's hand', it could be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the hand of the devil' is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the scribe of the screens, had no reputation for the lack of respect from the Brazilian division. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight. Headline (Brazil): "Mão do Diabo" ("Devil's Hand")
