I have also lost a personal loss (double) and this movie shows enough of the gut of a very well experienced experience, a harmonious life, nothing appropriate, good family, etc ... /> It was good to see Ally again. He is one of all my filmmakers who have always loved it. I scored and cried as the story was revealed. Great stories and cast. Well done!
