I enjoyed this film. It was exciting, interesting, ridiculous, and entertaining. It was well cast and was actually hammered by other critics for reasons I don't really understand. No, it was not "The grapes of wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable film. Julia was better to play psychological man behind that man. Story is a little silly to be sure, but this is not a high game, people. I came to see the film's screening, perhaps one of the best ones that got it and then went into it one night when you were looking for the film. I have never heard of it had to smell until it was seen, and I was glad I saw it. Finally purchased a VHS tape on a bunch of business, and I look twice a year.
