Someone knew the hard work of connecting games with love. In fact, games and romance go together as oil and water. So, successfully put both together on the screen ... well, that's the same as dividing the atoms. I've never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I usually do not like romantic comedies ... but I like games with many movies about games. This movie was a good combination of two. Being a baseball player, I could identify the comedic problem with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a fan of Boston Redsox. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curses of Babe who opposed Redsox for 86 years, and know how nuts about baseball are a lot of fans of Redsox. Brother Farrely did a good job of catching it and made a good comedy. This was a very good movie that can appeal to many.
