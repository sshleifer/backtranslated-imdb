This film is a very exciting film of anthology (with a series of stories from Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It is good fun for awesome fans and has thrown the best. Movie should also be desirable to look for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (Third Doctor) has a delightful role as awesome and awesome star!
