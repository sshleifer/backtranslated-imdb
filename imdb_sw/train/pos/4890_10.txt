From so much, please please! If you can find anything else written by the Plater (or talking to these amazing actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a real sense of jazz, my opinion is to see the trilogy of 'Beiderbecke' whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - Fire, Cool and 'What time does tune start?'"
