Mary Poppins is much better, but this is a very good film. Angela Lansbury is a beautiful gold like Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson is very happy as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was also brilliant. Children, however, did not have the same match, although Paul is very funny and beautiful. Those songs were not as bad as other people say, "The beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, for all the songs are the best. Special effects were strange, which had a lot of magic, and the story is original enough. Important things, however, like Mary Poppins, were an interactive animation. The sequence of the water was good, but the favorite I was to match football, which was highly hilarious quite. The only other case was that I did not have the last time when I first saw it. All in all, a good film, which is not available. 8/10 Bethany Cox
