Robert Siodmak works very well with this B star of Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Alan Curtis. And he does, I can add, without great support from its male actors, namely, Curtis and Tone. It is all the rain, a good actor, a lawyer who for one reason or another has not reached some of the "other" characters. <br /> <br /> Use of Siodmak's sex, light, shadows, and music is really fantastic as she cope with this type. Shades, light effects, and camera angles are all suitable. But the film's film is done in a nightclub with the very best dance of Elisha Cook, hit by excited trees. It is this area that brings "Lady Phantom" in a new location. Siodmak's commitment to the material is similar to Raines, who offers real performance as a loving woman trying to save her person. The Franchot tone called this one. Alan Curtis was not found to be angry that he could die and was not found to be happy that he lived. And he never, except for a short time in prison, seems to be in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> Something amusing about many of these films is that, as World War II continued, the interest of psychiatry exceeded. But these terms were often misused in films such as "Found," "Spellbound," and "The World's Greatest Exhibition." Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone perhaps has a certain paranoia attached to his disease, but it seems to be close to psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by headaches, he may have had a brain tumor against his brain. Lady Phantom is not a big plot, but it's good to watch.
