Quick and easy, I love this film. If others are mentioned, I also, not from the south, don't really care about the music of the country and I've never been wearing a cowboy hat. (I have never drove a car and a dead body into my trunk either, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is just a decision of the film. Dial to the 2.35 aspect ratio and transfer to DVD. (VHS was a full 1.33 screens). And yes, solid 5.1 mix with your pleasure to watch. What? What can you say about this film? <br /> <br /> It is a great story of love / hate set in Texas, and beautiful performances. Travolta is amazing. Next to the "Fiction Pulp", it's the best thing he did. It has been in my top 5 years for 25 years! <br /> Check out this !!! It's 10 !!!!
