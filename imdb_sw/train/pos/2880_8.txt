"Cinderella" is one of the most popular Disney class. And it really deserves its status. According to the story of tribal stories as described by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and suffering of Cinderella, a beautiful girl who is abused by her bad mother and the inevitable measures. When the royal ball takes place and all the women are invited (read: The king wants to call Prince), Cinderella is left at home when his daughter's mother takes her bad daughters with her. But there is a fairy tale on the side ... <br /> <br /> The story of "Cinderella" alone can not overcome the element, so when in general stay true to the story otherwise, the ordinary characters of the fairy tale of fairy wife uses to help find a characteristic title for the ball to become a true group of Cinderella. Jaq and Gus are the main groups, and their own nemesis are the mother of the mother of mother mother Lucifer. Their Antics incorporates in general with the main plot of the story, and for the most wonderful part. In fact, the film decreases slightly between the main introduction to the characters and shortly before the tourists go to the ball, but after this decline, this film gets again and surprisingly (since "Cinderella" is a very lost story of all time , perhaps) ends up as one of the stories related to Disney. <br /> <br /> Animation and art gallery are good. All of the nine Old Men animated stories on this picture, and the color of Mary Blair's art and fancy art (also made art fancy and color styling for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "Three Caballeros" and many others many ) control to manage their way to the screen. Colors and designs are beautiful, especially in the fairy wife and the events of the ball, as well as the shortest time here and there. Overall, "Cinderella" is like one of the best of Disney Fairy- stories and is filled with young people and all that includes Disney philosophy which dream can actually happen.
