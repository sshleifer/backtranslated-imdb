I got this movie in the IFC and I enjoyed it, though I felt like the work of editing was too bad, though it might be deliberate. I had a very difficult time to decide what was going on for the first time because they seemed to go a little bit for the presentation of an unusual Pulp Fiction. It seemed to be a little forced, though. In fact I think that the movie is worth watching, but I think it can be used a little cleaning up. Other events didn't seem important after others. <br /> <br /> I wonder to see the score below as it is. It's not good, but it doesn't have any serious problems. I paid 7/10. The movie showed at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when she wants. They should have told him not on the Matrix movie.
