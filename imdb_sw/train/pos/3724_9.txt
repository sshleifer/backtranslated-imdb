Tigerland follows the life of a group of recently written men in the army who are called to fight Vietnam during 1971. This time, America knows they are fighting a war, and the director takes us through a 16mm film recording of the life of several employers in the training camp. "Tigerland" in Louisiana. This film is more than a study of character is not a real plot, but it focuses on the key character of Roland Boz, who is a stupid but intelligent person, who just wants to run camp. We are taken through several characters in the waiting room story to be opened. I would like to say this is a good story about Vietnam and most importantly about the army in general. Directors also use film and fashion work, because it looks very much like the old films you see about Vietnam. It is good to see how the film shows that all the illnesses and problems were important for the fight against these wars. A certain place that Boz goes away with a training message where the teacher shows how to use the radio as just a torture tool about the whole thing about a brief war ... and it's useless. It is a wonderful film. It's not just about Nam but about who individuals should decide what ethical rights to be 'in the army'. <br /> <br /> Measure 9 out of 10.
