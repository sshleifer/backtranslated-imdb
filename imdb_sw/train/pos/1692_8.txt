Like the great cartoons of Bugs Bunny, this film has humor at different levels. I started only with my 10-year-old daughter and a 11-year-old child. Both enjoyed a movie-busting out of a few laughs ... and my daughter was not a lot of sci-fi fan. The movie has made me laugh a few times ... the adult humor rate (ie, the humor that adults will only get because of the greater experience of life, nothing of baudy or R-rated here) keeps the film also enjoyable adults. For example of adult humor, Martian sounds depend on characters of different movies / participants. Martian's attempt, Blaznee, has a voice and order of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, the Dr. Strangelove of Seller Peter. Special effects are amazing for this film. Lack of top 10 actors actually works in the courtesy of the film, and the actors / actors play their part well - in fact I will tell the producers they chose the executives and their skills for the roles of the role of the box-box office (best model is Wayne Alexander "Vern". I had to write this review ... children play this for the third time in 4 days on dinner right now. Good for rainy or weekend weekend no movie-to-do -money-out.
