although this movie is very old, no matter how often I look at it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One quotation in the movie comes out. When Danny (Joe Piscopo) climbs office and dad desk in the disabled spot, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "can't keep here, it's for disabled people". Danny responds "I have a disability, I am psychologically." <br /> <br /> is one of the many lines in movies that doesn't matter how many times you expect, I'll make you chuckle. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands at my top 5 comedy / spoof movies all the time. <br /> <br /> As a bonus added it also includes a story actor Peter Boyle in cast. So, watch this film and if I myself and many others who have watched it, you will be able to be considered.
