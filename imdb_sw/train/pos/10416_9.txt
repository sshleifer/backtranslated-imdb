As the Light of Arabia this film is done by storytelling to make us feel that there is a conspiracy, conspiracy and conspiracy, it opens up to what appears to be the image of a blind person telling the story of his life, and then enters into a flashback which takes us the right now the blind, where we discover that about half of the stories still come. (It should be accepted that the second half does not live entirely with the first promise.) As the Arab Nights tries to run as many Middle East-East topics possible in one work. Genie free, beautiful princess, carpet fly, amazing mechanical performances, sea trips, crowded market, bad vizier, jewels ... I don't know why all the work, but it makes. Everything is just fine. Set is good. June Duprez is good. The Rozsa logo is very good. As always, it seems Hungarian; but in some way he can persuade us that he is Hungarian through Persian.
