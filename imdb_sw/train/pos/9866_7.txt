I saw the ICE AGE, a very interesting and interesting film. The story is simple but effective, the characters prefer to be recommended and better but what is shining is the design of digital set. <br /> <br /> More directed by traditional animation movies than fact, designs give you the truth, very good to look at the world for the wonderful use of colors. Sometimes touching the truth shines through (especially the water was amazing), but however, it is a fantasy-world-based reality. Including the cargo of large themes especially helps to reduce delivery costs. Pixar movies shine with technical skills, this shines with good use of technology skills. <br /> <br /> Enough babble technical, film entertainment, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.
