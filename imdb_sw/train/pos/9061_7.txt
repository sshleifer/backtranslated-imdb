I loved the film. I remember reading several times as a child and I was glad to see the movie made on the book. <br /> <br /> I was a child-sitting by a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8 and had to talk to a girl in watching the movie. But happily, at the end, he was delighted to see it and even said that he wanted to buy it on the DVD as soon as he lost it. There was a good time to laugh and the movie was not as "general" as I expected it would be ... tho that made the top of the top-level meter ... <br> /> <br /> The only thing that I can think is why they had to have a "dilly" line that was done by Woody by mentioning its privacy section ... that for me only when the shocker (and you can hear the adults in the audience are singing sound at the time of the film ... I have no clue why that was put on the film; did not add anything to the actual film except for the reason of the shock / gas ... moreover, a very good movie. Good to see the girl "Pepsi" all raised.
