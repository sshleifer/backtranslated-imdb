I am glad that someone has made a film about how hard it is to your heart for a second time. Or third. This film is especially that it has to be good, pleasant and gives you this beautiful feeling close to your heart. The plan cannot be very innovative, but there are millions of ways to tell stories and have never been used yet. The cast is fully selected though Scott Wolf does not look like a father of eight years even when he is wearing a suit. Therefore, sparks are located in all right places, support is supported easily and although you may probably predict the entire movie you would like to change the station. It's just a kind of entertainment on Sunday evening.
