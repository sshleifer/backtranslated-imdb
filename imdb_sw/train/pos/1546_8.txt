I saw this movie once or near the year of its release 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember their pieces, I would like to see them again. The places that I remember, of course or bad, include the Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering gender-based sex gifts behind a closed truck to get military details from him. The music mark was particularly memorable with the sense of stimulation in the Gone With The Wind and I would like to hear it again. You must have some business or copyright reasons for this movie. Anyone knows what? I have no doubt to do with the lack of quality or interest.
