Many movies about, or entering, New Orleans, turn out to be bad, and will not be appropriate (consider: remember "Savage bees"? But I will make discrimination for "Tightrope", which almost got the right). This is the one that is not found to be bad. This is not so bad (yes, "yat" emphasized down here is more than Brooklyn than south), the 1950 city is shown how it was / was, without shots of "tourists", and better understand the ceremony without trying to make everyone "river of south ". <br /> <br /> One of the few films to do right for this city, and a good film of boot.
