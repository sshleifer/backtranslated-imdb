I love this film 'Spring and wine'. I was born in Leigh, 7 miles [7 km] from Bolton, moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. My job was always through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes by bicycle but by car when I could afford the film. it returns all the memories of class neighbors who were almost always breaking but who will help you always if they could. Fred Dibnah was round corner from St Bromwich were my bedsit was. If you didn't see the film when it was first released then you can be forgiven by comparing it with soap such as Coronation St, I also accept it soap, but then, it's called 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' Look at this film for a talented artist who soon became the names of households from regular roles on television, I look particularly for the shots of the area and a good feeling of people being poor but happy!
