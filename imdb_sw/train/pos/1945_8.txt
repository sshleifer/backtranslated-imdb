The last journey of Voyager begins 23 years later. Voyager has made it back home. In many years it took to return tho, the Vulcan's Tuvoks mind was destroyed. He carried the sickness that was too late to go home to treat. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway comes to visitors who have travel technology time. He knows, there is a Conduf's Warp in the Quadrant of the Delta which can bring home to home once - if he could return for a while and inform Voyager. There is one problem. Soft is within Borg Space. Janeway visits Tuvok. She is like a child. He writes, hoping, working with problem problems or film inspection or something, is believed to be important in some way. In the institution, Tuvok cries, asking 'Janeway' to better, please return to him. Janeway decides to order a federal transfer and make it with weapons of war 20 years before Borg, in the hope of returning to time and using this new technology to guide Voyager to the Warp Conduit. <br /> <br /> When she comes back and connects to Voyager, Janeway meets her own little one. The two officials do not agree, discussing the plan. The usual refuge of Tuvok ask him if he really has a brain problem. Tuvok admits that it is true, but cannot be cured by shipping equipment so he puts it himself. The little Captain agrees with the Old Age plan. In order to increase their chances of success, the aged Janeway has a plan to disrupt Borg and her transfer trick. Borg really puts Janeway to his transfer. King Borg personally manages Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected this! The king of Borg has put the virus in himself that is killing him. With Borg the dead Queen, it does this with Warp Conduit behind the federal position.
