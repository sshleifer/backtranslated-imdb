Watching this film from beginning to end without bursting in laughter at a certain time requires almost the act of faith, as someone continues to say, "it's old", "it's classic", "being gentle", not because the movie is bad, but because for the best is very good. This is one movie dated. It is also classic, as one damaged. I'm not interested in laughing people in any way, by principle, and I get over a little bit angry when others do that. Surprising skillful with my mind is a little like fighting for the safe idiot when he dribbles his orange juice all over the table table. Yes, someone says himself, he is a fool, and even when he is on his game is also a true savant. It is also true for the skillful, which at times is very awesome, and yet enjoys good photography, good acting, beautiful and beautiful, beautiful good news. At the end, which I can give, politics, religion and psychology gather, in the church, through making a scene look like corny and up, and still life is sometimes. People who have no knowledge of simple faith are different from us (perhaps a brilliant) modern people, and the area is not too big (I sell it, but I know Ireland) as a shame. Yet people do it that way, say things like that. Not everyone has a hip, and it may even be valid for everyone to be hip. Are people today more than those of seventy or twenty years ago? And how? I don't think so. We are just different. Now watch the film.
