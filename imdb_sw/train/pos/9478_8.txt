This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful story, which plays the most important role in the entire film. It is a wonderful story, and also romance in it. Stories are told slowly but this works very well for building. The characters are beautiful and well displayed by its actors. It is usually not a very big fan of Asian act but acting in this film was just good. Of course the film is very different from its style and style from other films, produced in the west. In this way the film continues to be ready and its way than western films made during the same time. I just loved the movie's fashion look would be better. For a film that is considered to be a kind of movie of the movie this movie certainly does not exist in the guide to look good. That was a very cheap film to do and it was done in general. It is not that this is a bad thing, it only prevents this film from itself and lifts itself on the genre. But oh well, this film is all about a well-built story with the characters in it. In this regard this film is certainly not enough. <br /> <br /> 8/10
