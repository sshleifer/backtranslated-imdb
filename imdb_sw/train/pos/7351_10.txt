This is one of my favorite Govinda movies all the time with the best film 1994. David Dhawan does a great job in leading this movie, making it funny and adds a family game. Govinda is Good as Raja Babu and provides good performance. Karishma Kapoor is a disgusting actress, this film is very young but still bothers on certain events. Kader Khan is a maestro in action and still gives good performance. Aroona Irani is as strong as a mother and offers excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is a brilliant as the Nandu of Sidekick. This film has a comedy, action, a family drama and a perfect romance on entertainment.
