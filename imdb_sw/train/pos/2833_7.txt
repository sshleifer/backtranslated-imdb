Look at this film after thirty seven years. I was eleven years old and I got this South Beach Flick at Cinema's long Theater in Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where the Hour was! was a very good movie. Now, however, after forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this movie is now exhausting fatigue of war between generations. It did so, however, getting a chance for a time that is just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashions, ancient Vegas, Little Don Rickles, cigarette chain, and the opening of the hip opening. Acting was good, the script was somewhat out of dated, but the records were still fresh. Where it is, it should not be in you, but for me, it was still a beautiful and entertaining journey under the memory line.
