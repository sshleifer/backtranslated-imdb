With this Darkwing Duck is deleted correctly. Disney has been slowed since Tarzan and we need to show this like to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect with the sounds of Louis and Baloo (apparently visible?) The theme theme of the theme is also interesting. Of all the criminals, who are all ideal for their own reputation, Tony Jay says like Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo really sound similar to the sound on the Jungle Book, which is not the worst thing. In fact, it's absolutely inspiring! The animation was visible, and the script had an abundance of quantities which has been very low in animations for years. FUNA FARING BACK THIS! 9/10. Bethany Cox
