I am a fan of the Crash Shock and Blade and this movie explores some of the deaths of the road and 80 pictures of movies that I would like to see, so I have enjoyed. Overall, although it is the ignorance of the film's protagonist is not pulled properly and the female leadership and its hero are almost neanderthal, so warning kitch.
