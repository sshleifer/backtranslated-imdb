Everyone is my name Larissa I'm 13 years old when I was 4 years old I look at my face and I close my socks I have been watching that movie for a long time about 30 minutes ago I've seen it. Alisan porter is a very good actor and I love the movie that's amazing when he plays a card. Every time I look at the movie at the end I cry, so I knew I was only 13 years old but his very touching story is so amazing that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I look at a movie one is less and the movie comes out as a year after you do it and you look at it and know how old someone in the movie really hurt how they can go from one age to the next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also good but Daniel was 12 years old at the first movie and I was 11 years old. What could he go 12 to 16 in 4 years and I just have 13. I don't know if he is 16 right now I think he is around 18 but that's kind of weird when you watch one movie and the next there on 4 years then when they were just 1 in the end. So I'm sure I have great ideas and I would despise them. I am a kind of a computer but I would like to do many kids things too. I am very smart as a matter of interest in the movie but one thing that I didn't like in the movie is when this person who calls the house to develop and makes the issue of deviation removed will kill the man if he really did in real life. Yes, I will stop writing I know how to write a lot but sometimes children have a lot in the head that they need out and if they don't have children they will never learn. Larissa
