I loved this movie! It is really amazing, very interesting, disgusting, magic ... It is not appropriate to tell them about the contents of the film, because then I would like to give results! You see it without knowing what it is about! Everything is connected with the reason and because. It starts gently and then things begin to increase faster and faster until they finally reach more carefully than you can think! It is even more fun to watch the second film, once you know all the "tricks". Actors are the best, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final events are a masterpiece piece! I highly recommend this film, it is one of the first that I have ever seen!
