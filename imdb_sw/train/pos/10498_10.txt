It's very simple. That's about it. <br /> <br /> Images are clean and true, except for the fact that some flower is 2d, but that is forgiven. All other photos are more cleaner than GoldenEye and many N64 games. Sounds are too big. Everything from talking to SFX is good and true. <br /> <br /> The camera's camera is a little exciting, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as now Christmas in 1997, and since then, I've got 120 stars more than 10 times.
