It may not be the best movie in 2006 but it was only an exciting movie and thinking about. The Sentinel is a good political movie that looks similar or even borrowed some of the features from other exciting political films such as In In Line's Fire and candidate for Manchurian. The basic film of this film is similar to the other movies like this: plot to kill the US President. Michael Douglas star as Secretary of the Service Pete Garrison who works only to find out later that he has been prepared.iefer Sutherland star stars as an opponent's name with David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is rookie agent going under the registry Breckinridge and the Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this film can be a step further as with other sources considered as a great film like the Thriller film but the good thing about this film is the plot of killing the US President, it also involves mole (traitor) in the Secret Service that leads the President in the wrong direction.
