This movie was led by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Gold of Ulee). To write well and directly, selected for the Independent Spirit Award, look at the day of the day of Ruby's day. What we see is a piece in the life of a woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Best Female Leader for this role. Ruby begins to live alone and establish its own identity. He searches the work, friendship, boyfriends, sex, adult searches. The movie won Grand Jury Prize in Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film lover I took the film for Sundance. I appreciate this kind of film, because it is not suitable for Hollywood loads. Even though the story is completely different this reminds me of the Foo Man, looking at Paul Newman. The future movie is a piece of everyday life of an ordinary person. I like it. The story is well described, and all we have to do was to sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I don't know about is the head. I am sure that there are not many bugs, and flies in paradise like Florida. If I am allergic to mosquitoes, Florida can not be a paradise to me, I will try to think about Florida. I turn into a perfect red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite Scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I've been there. Favorite Quotes: "Always important has been a good excuse." "All that contradicts looking for a man is no different now, who will have time and why." <br /> <br />
