It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally bad Latin stereo types have passed! As Gracias, Se√±or Lopez! I like this show, and I just started looking at it about three months ago. The whole concept of the Latin family family was very interesting to me. I wonder that finally Latinos has a good shot to be on TV. Showing this is one of the best things I have seen, is exciting, hearty, touching, and beautiful.
