Surprise James Stewart, the Vera Miles car. What makes this historical film facing a very good FBI is a family feature involved in 35 years of work as shown by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows the history of the great research organization. It deals with airline plots, killing the Indians in Oklahoma for real estate, fighting the crime, Nazi and Communist in the process. The human element has never been back like Stewart loves Vera Miles. They bring 3 children as Miles's heart goes every time Stewart comes out of work. <br /> <br /> See short but unsupported performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 "Student." Film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He actually brought the FBI to. True, this can be viewed as a right wing propaganda, especially for Stewart's view of the life of the true Republic, but it has done well, historical information, and a well-expressed family view.
