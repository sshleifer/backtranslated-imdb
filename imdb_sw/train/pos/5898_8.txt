Penny Princess finds a girl working for American Yolande Donlon successor to a small kingdom in the triangle where France, Italy, and Switzerland meets Lampidorra. It seems that as the Lampidorrans Debt Bill worldwide and the main work of the country is fraudulent from its geography. Merika Million buys a place, but dies before taking the head. His immediate successor is Donlan. But of course the property should be addressed in the United States and Lampidorrans? Particularly since Donlan who has now become a king has prevented fraud. Enter Dirk Bogarde who is a Swiss trip to learn about the cheese industry. It looks like Lampidorrans have a kind of cheese which they play playback like Schmeeze. With few road terraces, Schmeeze solves all financial, geographical, and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How is the work of Schmeeze possible, that's a gimmick for the entire film. But here is the taste. In Lover's return Jack Kruschen could only have found the secret of Schmeeze when he was busy talking VIP to Rock Hudson with his advertising agency. But the Penny Princess is a good mix of UK farce with romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again has a role that Marilyn Monroe would be healed if the film was made on this side of the pool. Dirk Bogarde was healed well in a section that was the beginning of his career as a romantic heart, the way before anyone but he thought he had a chops he had. <br /> <br /> This film was shown sadly at three in the morning on TCM. But at least I have found a reason to be grateful for sleep.
