The unclean angels' unclean name only by name, the angel removes their appearance caused some of the shenanigans of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan this should be treated as a real sequel for angels with dirty face, at least to continue. Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is one of the true light shining of this film. To define a picture, Ann Sheridan could read from the phone book for two hours and I could buy a DVD! Another fine of this film is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this feature of the film is placed too far back. For the best example of Sheridan-Reagan's I would like to recommend the Girl of Juke or Kings Row.
