Of course conspiracy, script, and, especially give it a powerful film. Many good things to see. One of my favorite things is the idea of ​​an opponent - Luzhini's (Turturro's) - an old consultant doing his evil work on one side. His opponent of chess - dandy Italian in a third piece with cane - seems to be a real gent, with a good chess player. With his loan "opponent" nobly goes along with the program at the end to complete the final game for the posthumously championship (Luzhin has taken a flyer out of the window - depressed, but so betrayed him) through a strong widow's thought (Emily Watson). , because of the honorable master of honor, the protection of Luzhin (which he worked at the end of eligibility) is allowed to play. The Gent of Italy congratulates the play and calls it a brilliant. Talk about the best "final game"!
