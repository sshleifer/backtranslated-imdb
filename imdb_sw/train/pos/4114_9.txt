The title of this movie is not good for many minds, even if it seems to be working, because it is the voice that the lost young man does while driving his thinking trolley, which he always does. And he is just one of the most amazing characters in this surreal & sometimes, the horrible story of a Japanese group of Japanese actors. There are two callers who are doing business with her, there is someone who hopes to be an architect, and her son who sends out to beg for food. There is a wise man who seems to be a pillar of purity in all that walks around him, and there is a businessman who has a strong nervous tissue who has a wife who treats him (and everyone) as dirt. <br /> No / some plot for this, in fact, is a group of stories that comes out and come back between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. All in all I thought it had worked well, and I had died to see this for a long time just according to its details. I had little desire, and I would recommend suggesting this. 9 out of 10.
