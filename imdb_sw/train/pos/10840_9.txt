In a voice that begins the film, Hughie (Billy Connolly), 70-year-old Strange Fruit Fruit, said because the lightning was hit on a rock concert to stop a set of Strange Fruit was that God was an extra 70 patient. Indeed, it has become popular to put down at that time of music, and see the punk as a welcome remedy. When I accept the extra was tiresome (with misogynistic desires that came out), and as a punk, I am still a fan of what taken a classic rock or glam rock, and this film about Strange Fruit long, wonderful reunion is a love tribute to the day those. One reason the film works is the service of people behind events. Brian Gibson explained what love to do with IT, about Tina Turner (when I had a problem with a large part of the film, music was done very well), authors Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais wrote a conference and were behind the UK TV songs mentioned by The music, and the wonderful songs of fruit had been written by foreign Mick Jones (not confused with Mick Jones of Clash), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. Also, two members who were beaten are their own musicians (Bill Nye I don't know about, though the film proves it to his own singing, and it looks like the lead singer of the time, when Jimmy Nail was in another UK. , though I forgot the name, and was in EVITA, and others persuaded them. And while, as I have said, many 70 bands like the Fruits of Fruits do the wrong to women, the film does not make the same mistakes (except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around); As the conference manager, Juliet Aubrey is very good and has a fully rounded character. Other characters are also good too, with special features for Stephen Rea, who is responsible for the most important role without feeling. There are several points of conspiracy, but in general this is quite fun. Oh, and music is also good.
