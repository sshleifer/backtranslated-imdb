The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is an amazing and very interesting film. The 16th winner from the world, this film from Wang Bianlian's true stations, a street musician in 1930 in China who continues to grow but has no successor to adopt his opera art. He has a special talent to change masks quickly, and nobody knows how he does. He has a desire to have a grandson, as his art is a heirloom of a family that can only be passed on to a male successor. We are going to the streets, and see that people are selling their children because they are not able to take care of them: others even ask to take their daughters for free, because the girls are not worthy of much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story comes from there. The film was so amazing, acting it was amazing, and the issues were weighed and well used. There is a lack of gender inequality and the fact that the time and place, no one wants a little girl. Also interesting to note is that the famous actor of opera who always has a woman and is known as Bodhisattva Living is a man who is dressed as a woman, and when she is popular and well respected, she considers herself as a low, half woman. As we go further into the film, the face is the business of human slaves and its needs and thus the lack of possible solutions to them, violence and military corruption and police, and inability and power anyone can face because of bad events or even good intentions. This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, an actor who plays Wang Bianlian, gives another good performance.
