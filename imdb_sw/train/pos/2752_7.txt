Although the plot of the "eighth day" seems to have been done many times, the film still has a lot of spark, mystery, and signals that the first film of Jaco Van Dormal had. Although it is not as good as "Toto's Hero", which will always remain on my list of favorites, the film still leaves us with a lot of emotions. Daniel Auteil, a 2001-year-old who had no taste "The Closet" affects his part, fear of strengthening (in fact, the role has been easily damaged if the actor was overly serious). However, I heard that part is more needed for more realistic, more focused on the character itself rather than the characteristic growth. Do not enter this film you expect dark humor and unexpectedly you have found "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film is still used as a decent movie, if not guilty
