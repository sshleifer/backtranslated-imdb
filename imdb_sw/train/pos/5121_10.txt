I am a great fan of the film, but not for common reasons. I think Travolta and Winger did higher rates than average, I think the sets represented the location and time, I loved the song of the sound and Charlie Daniels Port. However, I think that picture was awesome! Since the events of the interior took place at the real club and Gilley had a low-perhaps low ceiling 10-12 feet high and smoke that should be imitated "bar-filled smoke" set 2 feet below the ceiling. The camera has managed to find shots through the smoke and focus on actors, cow, bar, women, play, low level of light that actually was on the bar! What! Certainly there were auxiliary lights, but in order to maintain the status of the bar, it had to be shots below. Ray Villalobos (operator of the camera) was the best! He found some shots that he did not hope to achieve and his impacts brought a sense of truth to the film. Thank you, Ray - Great work!
