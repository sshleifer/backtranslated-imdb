You know how Star Trek fans gathered on all Star Trek movies, even the worst? Why? See their heroes for action once more. That's what I feel about Dau Savage. I am a great fanatic for character, and hope to see Doc and his staff in the adventure was great. And the first 20 minutes of films became more than a sense of expectation. Then they decided to beat the elements from the number of adventures of Doc and throw them into this one film, causing a certain movie to appear. There are many promises here, cuts and unfortunate choices (music, elements of "camp", etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and that's what we know with Doc and its employees respond. So, in my long way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad film: it's not as good as it should be. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters should watch this movie just so you know and the hero has inspired them all.
