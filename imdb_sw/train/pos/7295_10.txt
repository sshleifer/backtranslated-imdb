I was able to see this at the New York Film Festival in November 2005 with my partner. We both were very impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be moving emotionally. It was well directed to the pictures. The visual effects were extraordinary - especially for a short time. It had an original fantasy approach to a real and concrete theme: this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her bad father. There is also an amazing surprise at the end that has caught me off. This depends on the Gothic feel. I would like to see this as a full film feature. - Carrie
