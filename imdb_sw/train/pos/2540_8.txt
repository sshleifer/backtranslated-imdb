Although not popular as some of their other partnerships (such as BLACK CAT and BODY SNATCHER), this is a little dandy film awesome though making the casting were odd. Boris Karloff has Dr. Janos Rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the Carpathian mountains - near the city of Dracula's character. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - his heritage has never been discussed, although the name has been found in French. In fact I think it would be wise to have two roles to change, as Carpathia's role seems to be done by Lugosi - especially with its emphasis. However, despite the normal deviation, the two still worked better. Karloff was definitely being the first role, but Lugosi himself separated himself from an ordinary person - something that did not play very often in the film! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are strange and unusual. However, over the film period, Rukh returns to the right and Benet is especially generous in his new reputation for Rukh. But, unfortunately, a new phenomenon that Rukh discovered has a negative impact of making him a killing machine (don't hate it when it happens?). Although this may be just a good scientist who turned out a bad story, the plot was well-built, the characters were well organized and Rukh was not a killer of one direction, but it was tough and interesting. <br /> <br /> This film should enjoy with anyone except people who hate old films. You can truly say that Universal Images have removed all items and made the biggest film budget rather than the cheapest lays all the Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately restricted in future years. Good things.
