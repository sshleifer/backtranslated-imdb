It came out of the sneak preview for this film. It was I laughing every 30 sec. The latter was so surprising that the tears had dropped my face and it was I wished I didn't buy a big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, in general, very entertaining. The movie allows Steve Carell to have a chance to shine after stealing carefully from Jim Carrey in "Bruce All" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movies. Paul Rudd is cautious as always. I love that he can be very surprised in these broad comedies and keeps working in indie drama (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work, because he has the ability to work. Leslie Mann also had a wonderful time. I highly recommend to those who just want to laugh like maniac. However, if you are sorry, do not see this film. If you are a fierce woman, don't see this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you're one of the "hip" parents, don't take your children on this film. Indeed, you should allow your young people to see this film, don't look at them. It could do some very wonderful time.
