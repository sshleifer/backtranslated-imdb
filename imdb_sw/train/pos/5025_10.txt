Man, some of you have to go beyond. This movie was artistic skills. Instead of looking for ideas or messages to prove your truth, why can't you understand that it is a false work? Stories. Entertainment, for God (no planned pun). It seems to me that many people here are trying to be critics of the film - and they don't do well. I am very interested in the film and work of Bill Paxton in the lead, that I will contact myself to tell him. You know, if you try to analyze out of the possibility of a story line, you can only enjoy the film. All my friends and I did!
