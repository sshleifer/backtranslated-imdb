Not everything is said in this first section of CÃ©line Sciamma. Friendship, "you want to focus on", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is the smallest way of swimming water underwater. All three girls in the movie are trying to find and describe their personality in a very different way. It is a less violent approach to understand the teenage years compared to, say, "Nine thirteen", but a very valuable journey however. <br /> <br /> A must see, and please delete all the movies of America's movies when she door. The voice sounds is A + by way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinema!
