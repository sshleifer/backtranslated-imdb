Obstacles seem to be one of the series that has been lost in a short time. After the early 80s infection and repeat once, it has been executed without tracking. This is the shame of crying. I was initially looking at this being adopted in the South TV region on Sunday afternoon and it was the view of tea tea time. Although I don't remember a great deal about the program, a few things have already caught my attention. Special events were unnamed names. The cries of the mournful pipes accompanied by an attempt to escape from the Eastern European border and the next car accident (and the area has left me a permanent love of Mercedes models as they used Merc 200). Although it was not clear at first, the secret solution of the series was in those names. The plan about a young music student trying to erase what happened when he found that he had taken a lot of votes and turns but the obstacles were a wonderful game of 'adults'. Benedict Taylor was as good as Billy and it was a shame she didn't do much more. This was a quality drama, a lot of time for the release of the DVD and I hope you get an opportunity to introduce yourself to that later. <br /> <br /> memory records from my childhood
