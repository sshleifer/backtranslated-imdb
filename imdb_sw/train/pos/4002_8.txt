At the beginning of the film we look at May and Toots prepare for their trip to London to visit their adult children. One can see Toots is not better than health, but it goes. When he dies suddenly, the world of May, begins to eliminate control. The image directed by Roger Michell, according to the playing screen with Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure is approaching and her new situation in life and wake up in a world that she does not even know where she is even now. <br /> <br /> Life in May as the wife of the peripheral cities can be boring. Obviously his sex life was close to something. We know that he had an extra marital affair, then nothing. May lose her husband can not return home, so instead, he sits back to remember his grandson in his home. It is in this case that May begins to desire after Darren sand and young, regular partner of his daughter. Darren wakes up in May she has never been known. It can answer by changing yourself before our eyes. May, who at the beginning of the film is dowdy, suddenly begins to wear, to be an attractive and attractive woman. He finishes the falling head on the heels and this boy stops him from disappointment he never felt. After a number of cases, like this story, it was not surprising to me to look at the answers to May. His ability to conventional relationship with Bruce, a widow, ends up for May, who knows how his sex is with Darren. The little person, we see, is just in this matter to self-esteem and with the possibility to extend the money from May. Finally, daughter, Helen discovers what Mom has been doing behind her when she gets pictures of paintings her mother has made. <br /> <br /> The film is a winner for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found a wonderful actor who brings a lot of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will respond to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also important to the story if she is the one who should tell the mother what is going on behind her. Oliver Ford Davies has a small part as Bruce an older man in Helen's class and very well. <br /> <br /> The film gives rewards for those who will see it with a clear mind. <br /> <br />
