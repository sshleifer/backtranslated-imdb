At this point it seems it should be possible to say that Jon Bon Jovi provides a stable performance, solid, seamless like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor has been initially introduced with his key attributes planned in another film (Personally Leader, No Looking Back). But, if anyone is wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can do well and it comes to him. It is easy to separate Derek from a boy who hits the VH-1. Normally I didn't have a look at the awesome movie. I expect you to focus on the year of feelings rather than talk and plot. What was so interesting about this film was that there was a good plot to move away. Gore is not a film orientation and does not have the quality of films including technical impact budgets. Therefore, fans of the year may be disappointed, but fans of the story will not be. <br /> <br /> Unlike an effective film like U-571 where the conversation takes the back seat behind the bombast, we get a chance to know "good guys" and really cares about what's happening to them. Few events have been left unannounced (as a reminder of Derek) but you get some feeling that just like they laid the foundation for good. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this film, the second will never happen. These few events are forgiven to know that vampires can be a continuous series. Is this the best movie I have seen in my life? No. Is it a good way to spend two hours being good? Yes. It cannot leave a person who is afraid to stimulate movies and sleep and will not leave a movie of a very frightened movie. If you are somewhere in the middle of fear of a kind of fear and a lover of fear, this film is for you. Approaching between fun and effect and balancing the story. <br /> <br />
