I think this film will be better about Mike Hammer, and the performance of Biff Elliott's Mike Hammer's point. The Harry Essex Script is excellent and has many improvements on the novel of Mickey Spillane. His direction is powerful and thoughtful, and makes good use of light and shade. The function of the camera with John Alton is high, as the symbol of Franz Waxman. The cast comprises many old players, with Peggie Castle in its memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the private eye films that have been done. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should get more opportunities. I've always valued this film.
