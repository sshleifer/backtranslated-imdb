The Castle Man is set in one of those jerry built houses in the open and parked areas that during these times were called 'Hoovervilles' named after our misfortune our President 31 who stuck to the Great Depression to occur in his reign. The suggestion of this film is that a man's house is still his fortress even though it is a shadow in Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a shack and really told this man even a good time he didn't want to do all the work. But in the most common part of Tracy before he was thrown as a priest in San Francisco, to begin to kill the classic tasks, he is playing a difficult sophisticated cup that takes in Loretta Young. One of the things about the Castle of Man is that it shows the effects of depression for women and men. Women had other problems to put on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had two hard times. And they were sexually abused and some committed adultery for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who is experiencing those kinds of problems and does not give claims on her in her castle. Pretty soon though they are in love, although Tracy is not kind of sitting down. <br /> <br /> love scenes and some extra extra for them because Tracy and Young were being a torrid thing during the bullet of a fortress. Both were Catholic and married and in those days it was an impossible barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith seriously. Also in cast is Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the entire camp, Marjorie Rambeau who has gone through all the Young pitfalls to meet experiments with Arthur Hohl, who loves the one who has his eye for the youth too. Hohl brings the plot of the Castle of Man to its peak through its decision. <br /> <br /> Man's Castle is bad to watch Great Depression, not a typical movie escapist fare for those who try to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.
