The time it was hit on the Florida National Park, "Tigerland" has reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, running boundaries, operating areas, waist-deep water and all. The movie was precisely the same with the same characters in my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland in 1971, and my 1974 are all drill operators and teachers knew that they did not return to Vietnam, if it was quite good, so practice was very enjoyable - not always challenging. That was all of our trouble in the 70s and 80s, which I know as much as I stayed until 2004. I've never heard of anyone saying "Tigerland" but the Army had the villages of Vietnam with distinct bases in the United States. Vietnam Vets tell me that until 1972 Basic & AIT could be pretty bad and rugged, because trainers were there and were authorized to teach Vietnam-men tied up the skills to do so, although not always the case. Both Sergeant police in Polk and later one of my Vet Vietnam leaders, when we were teachers at the basic brigade of training in Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people should know and think out of themselves . These high quality films.
