This interesting film is one of the most amazing movies I have seen. It shows China I had never seen or thought, and I believe it shows the 1930 years in China in the light of the REAL seen on the film. It is quite discouraging in many cases, to see how difficult life was for the characters, and still the story and the end is great fun. You see the depth and depth of human existence in this film. All actors are perfect, as if you feel you have entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie enough. It can only change forever once you have seen it.
