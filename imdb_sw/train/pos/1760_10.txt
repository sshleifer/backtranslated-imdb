Emergency on the top of the comedy on Tity Andy Stitzer (surprisingly played with a lasting second Care Career in a truly amazing performance comic performance of its stratosphere for a list of A), tech service rep for electronic storage in Southern California who has discovered his secret identity to the trio of close collaborator partners (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one of the second fundier degree) decided to make their friend disappear without cost. What follows is an incredible but very warm romance with a unhappy mother (Keener's great fun here) leading to more fuel for the fire in Andy. Romantic romantic and unpredictable romance; The funniest since "there is nothing about Mary" and a conscientious script script with director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some amazing gut-busting procedure including David Caruso joke scandal, homophobic debunking ribbing, sending of 'date-value' undermine the sexual battle with the cheeky aplomb. True winner and classic instant; The funniest film of the year.
