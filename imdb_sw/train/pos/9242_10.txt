It is difficult to measure a film like this, because you measure the level of production or fun? I saw this film back in 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I have a poor saying it started a long life with ninjas. The program is realistic and acting is awesome, but there is a certain mystique around the ninjas in this film that makes the atmosphere quite beautiful. What is important is the scenes to fight, when 'little' sparce, it is very good <br /> <br /> We must say it was better when I was a boy, now just I can see great points of the amazing nonsense in the film, but if you 'sit back and a few beer "martial arts film I can not commit, offers and is better than the" American Ninja "mountains that was churned out of 80 by hundreds of boys in black suit but not very good to fight scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the author and director of Sakura Killers made another ninja film under the Bonaire movie banner called "Phantom White" I don't know if this was meant to be good to Sakura Killers " but the family of Sakura is no longer the main feature, including the same color as the same story at this time including White Ninja. This too, when being more, had a little sense of atmosphere but scenes to fight it more sparce and be clear, it's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a military fan then give the blast to kill a few hours!
