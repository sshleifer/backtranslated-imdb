This film has taken me away when it started out in Cafe located Arizona and Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04, decides to have something to eat and find all the hot and tortured on very hot, sexy waitress. When Rex leaves the Cafe, he sees the pastor of the Government and asks, "Do you like?" and then all hell loses more than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Wearing to kill,", '80, is a TV reporter and always wants news to advertise. The Maggie Wind on the hot tub and Rex comes to call him to tell him he wants to show, Western style, with the top troops of the city. This is a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who support this picture at the time!
