"Scoop" is a film of Woody Allen's funniest of 2000 so far. Allen, though looking at his age, is about his game as a little magician of Sidney Waterman. Its pieces and its behavior are hilarious. Don't allow critics to get your opinion. "Scoop" is a picture of "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> The classical music score is the best thanks for action on the screen. Scarlett Johanson seems to be good in that bathing suit. Jackman triumphs. The movie finds you. "Scoop" is a good flight to run from start to finish. The last shot of the film alone is worth entering.
