In northeastern Brazil, a 12-year-old father of Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) does not know to read his child to a middle-class prostitute, Tadeu (Chico Dias), employed as a hostess and a better life. However, the girl is told by the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who is distressed, and gives the girl an abusive child to her first sexual experience. Then he is taken to the gold house in the goldfields in Amazonas and sought his owner, Sarava who was despised (Antonio Calloni). Maria copes with Rio de Janeiro expecting a good life, she is examined by Vera cáften (Darlene Glória). "Anjos do Sol" shows the sad state and shame of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year I saw the "4-ever" which describes a similar story in the former Soviet Union; therefore this problem is in the Third World countries. The director and author Rudi Lagemann shows a great film that shows the real situation but never finds the soil or sexually explicit cases. It is the beginning of Fernanda Carvalho, who has the best performance in the role of a child who is afraid to fight for survival. Many of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to identify the famous Darlene Glória so different he is after many plastic surgeons. The end of the story is also true. Voting for me is ten. Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angel of the Sun")
