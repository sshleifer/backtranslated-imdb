Keeping in the World of Depression Era Prague, this is the story of a securities who guarantees a collateral who falls in love with a mysterious woman who has contributed romantic letters, only to discover that a mysterious woman is no other than a sales girl from her shop, who seems to be constantly fighting with his colleague. Add a little bit (the owner believes that his employee likes - Stewart- has a relationship with the owner of the owner), leaving Stewart for a short time 'expulsion', as well as acknowledging that the sales girl 'loved' Stewart all the time, happy Ending is inevitable. Though for a long time (poverty and I have a wife and two children think- more than to be used, as well as indications that many small things of happiness, like music box of cigarettes, are out of reach The happiness of ordinary people), this film is more suitable (and more reliable) than the 1990s again making "You've received a Letter". In renewing star Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the worst of the series-of-events is so incredible that the mind of the viewer is strongly charged. "Shop Around The Corner" is guilty of walking down the line of memory in the less difficult period, under the hektic, and more romantic and the place known as the reporter of Utopia.
