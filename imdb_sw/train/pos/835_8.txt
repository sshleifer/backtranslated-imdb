Pierce Brosnan new but again James Bond, is a murderer. She is very good at what she is doing, but gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is as good as a slow and thin business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their different lives. Then one night they have to drink in the bar, and they start talking. Then suddenly you find these two people uniting together during a series of events. The story is good, acting is a high sand, and humor is the pride I never think Pierce Brosnan will be this funny, but he is real and I must say the movie must see.
