Giallo fans, search for this unusual film. It is well written, and it is full of all the most common life forms produced by these films. I don't want to give anything away, so I can't even say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very strange atmosphere, and you don't know who you are expecting or who is accusing. Recommended! The only part I found to get this film in english is from the Cinema of the European Disco, for $ 15.
