I cut hard during this film my face hurt. Ben Affleck was a carpenter and reminded me of a good boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini offers its normal performance. The whole cast is funny, beautiful stories and moments of amazing comic. I came into this film very unexpectedly so maybe that's why I was so surprised by the flick of all pleasure and emotionally exhausted. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify and lonely during the holidays and / or consider the relative. The most beautiful part of this film (me however) was a bit of a trick of humor that has taken me completely away and made me laughing long after other viewers have left. Therefore, the location of the Christmas tree lighting. Go and see it with a good laugh!
