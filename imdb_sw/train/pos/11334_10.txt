I would like to say that this film gives insight into the problem that a small mind can face when a family is divided by divorce or another tragedy. I would like to strongly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals who plan to have a family. I have seen the characters being attractive and sympathetic from the abundance of tests. The horrible monster though perhaps not afraid of many adults, has a real sense of what the ideas of a child faced with unknown fears can create. <br /> <br /> I saw the film good!
