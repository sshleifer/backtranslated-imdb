This fascinating Giallo adds a common but still exciting strategy with a real killer who loves to hunt its victims before they kill them in a bad way. Guided by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year earlier, also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my opinion on that), the film begins slowly, but for all, no time is left with small plots of necessity or order. This film is a German and Italian partnership, but it was released in Germany only for video edited for 15 minutes of conspiracy under "stupid house". At least the murderous scenes, which satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the cause of the last killer. But the Italian version with all the pictures is still one of the search, of course. Giallo influencing the necessary feet and red, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended for Giallo fans and a little more of Miraglia on other mentioned thriller.
