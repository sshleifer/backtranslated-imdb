Ok, therefore, this comes a few weeks late, but it's here. In particular, this is because of the negative background information. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS race, the technology of special effects was very low tec, and moreover, staff had little money to make any kind of good ups. During the 35 years of TOS began, the Star Trek staff have become experts in the economy. Finally, they have decided, indeed in my mind, to abandon the look for TOS and restore all TNG. Why would they decide to make a foreign importer or make a pistol to check next to those from Star Trek II? Since nits took the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was considered according to the comments made by Kirk and Riker that the World only met Klingoni in 2200. The company gives us the most promising place of exploration that we have seen in time. This is what Voyager would. No series can turn without a few inconsistancies, but be grateful that Star Trek has very few. Therefore, stop joining and enjoying.
