My beauty. This movie really shows the talent of executives. Billy Connelly eliminates his muscles of action. Really amazing, if you look at the Absolution as rebels, Boondock Saints as mad / killer, and finally in Fido as a zombie! Her character in Fido looks from an interesting to fear, quite amazing! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Jump into work from Matrix and Momento as a black character, with a warm-hearted home of the 1950s! Nowadays they see the characters can be not the type of the beat. <br /> <br /> Now go to the story story (No alert, worried). This movie could make Max Brooks (Author of the Zombie Guide Survival & World War Z) happy and fun! Finally lose good for zombies and delightful. <br /> <br /> If you love zombies, if you love zombies, if you're just tired, or if you are too busy, go see this film!
