The simple hand-hand camera provides a close feeling of the document for this film, and also relates to the films. <br /> <br /> What! Have you ever been tired of those Hollywood-style characters who come with brave people who get a job james bond would be jealous? Did you have a marriage partner who was married, a man-but-family, a human donut and a hard hunter? Have you ever wondered how the real work of the police is? <br /> <br /> Well, in germania, this film shows you. To keep the north of the western germany and the eastern germany, the old DDR, the published office clerk begins his work, clean from police training. He finds a quick way to around the ordinary customers, and he practices life as a police ... but this is not very fun. Other pornographic crimes like Derrick, Der Alte and cetera have dignified officers to speak calmly and suspects. These traders here should deal with the lowest level at the community level. Good conversation and authenticity makes these views interesting, even more so if you know that part of the little germany.
