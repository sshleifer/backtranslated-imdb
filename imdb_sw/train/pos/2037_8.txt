Christopher Smith is a horrible fan of this apparent and this is made clear in his first flick of fear of 'Creep'. 'Creep' though a little bit on the news, proves itself worthy of the real gory classic. From a little more than the recent US state (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake) this dark and horrible story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of the underground tunnel and unused roads like him, and others many on the way, try and run the attacker. Although some negative comments have expressed this film, I am convinced that with a strong budget and British production from the first Smith director who 'Creep' really lives in his name. It gives a quick step by step more or less from the beginning, sometimes very quickly as the story fits in some places, but with a perfect place with the best-response-end-end I've got time, 'Creep' provides certain scenes that are definitely crazy dream.
