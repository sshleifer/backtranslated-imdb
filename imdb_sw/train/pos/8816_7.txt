Given the nature and nature of the 11 film authors it is not surprising that this film is not favorable in its situation towards America. Perhaps most of the 'fight' comes from Ken Loach who has never had a New England party line. Although these events last year are shocking and hurtful to many Americans and many viewers who see them opens up through CNN etc. most of the authors and directors choose to show that the crisis is not a US monopoly. What? Anyone should be surprised that 3000 deaths are given the same weight as elsewhere as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnia, Chile, Kurdish (we need to continue). If this was a 'wake up' call to the country it is very sad that in the past 12 months after Israel / Palestine established it more from the solution when George Bush Jnr. it would rather be a revenge than to make the world a safe place. I think most of the contributors are wondering where the idealism of the Foundation's father went, and why America is built as quiet as the basis of freedom, justice and patience now you see his personal interests when the Third World is surprising where drinking, food or shooting comes from.
