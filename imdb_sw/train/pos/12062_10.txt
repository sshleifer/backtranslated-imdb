This film has misled me since the first day I saw it. My mother had watched it when it was on the phone back in '92. I remember being raised in the middle of the night with her tears ramblings as my father helped her up. He was saying something like "Don't let him find me" or something like that. I asked what made her very sad and told me that she would have looked at a black woman. So it was obvious that I had to look at it and even though I was eleven then he left me. Fearful s *** out of me. I've had awesome movie protection since watching this!
