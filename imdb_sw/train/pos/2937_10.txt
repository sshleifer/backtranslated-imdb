I know it's normal, and I know it's not quite a PC, but it's very amazing. If you can put it out of view that it is from the previous 80s and it takes all the time interactions - and the movie still makes it close to laughter - rather than a good comedy. Going to the traditional comedies what has been for thousands of years, the issue of this film is exagerated. If you can stop your political validity for an hour and a half, just have a laugh-out, than please check this. <br /> <br /> P.S. What? Anyone can see this on DVD, it's hard to find it again on VHS.
