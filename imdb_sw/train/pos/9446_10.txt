James Dickey is a wonderful writer. When someone reading "Rescue", one is transported immediately into the amazing South Deep mountains. When someone looks at John Boorman's film version of this book, someone knows how he uses the book of this book correctly. The camera is like a description like a story. The characters are fully aware, and the performances are wonderful. I saw this film first in 1992, after my new year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all opened in a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon", and "All Men's President"; A good film, all. This was easily class group. That says a lot.
