This movie describes a wonderful story with history and compassion. From a careful explanation of the incidents of crime for mental health screening, you will be incorporated. It is absolutely necessary to see anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relationships and how organizations work together are also great. Not too much. I recommend to anyone interested in the history of Russia, too. How the police works with a political party to be ... What is really amazing and exciting. Settings are good. It's been time since I saw this film for the first time. It does not reduce the effect. It is not a great achievement or color, it leaves enough for ideas, well, you'll see.
