I can't understand why they decided to open this film to introduce US listeners to dynamo which is Jet Li. Legend's fist would be the best choice. However, the Mask of the Beast is not terrible, but it is certainly not great nor. The final sequence of fighting is done well with Yuen Woo Ping who continued to coordinate the Matrix. But the release of English is faced with editorial editing and dubbing. (I am asking for a Hollywood studio to unlock these non-headphones.) Jet Li shows her charisma in title position and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as a woman 701. Black Mask has a wonderful goth style that adds interest is full of gunfire and explosions. Focusing on the extraordinary physical knowledge of Li was the order. Black Mask is a decent film but own yourself a favor and take a Fist of Legend if you want to see a great film that shows you the skill of Li.
