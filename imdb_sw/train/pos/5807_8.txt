This is in my opinion, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson's lovers. It contains messages on drugs, wonderful amazing effects, and amazing music videos. <br /> <br /> The main film focuses on talking to the music song and 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike the four-minute video of music, it is the usual speed and, in my opinion, is very easy to see. <br /> <br /> The plan is amazing, however. Michael Jackson has a magical "gangster" which, when he saw a shooting star, turns it into a piece of machine. In all the film, it transforms the race car, a big robot, and a space ship. <br /> <br /> Part of the robot is actually a little drawn and amazing. I saw that little out of the whack compared to the remaining film. The child has been kidnapped, Michael tries to save him, tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a big robot that kills all bad people. Little by little? Yes. In addition to the wonderful location of the robot, it's a very good movie, and any fan of Michael Jackson will delight all the videos of Smooth Criminal and movie.
