No (3+ outdoor stars 5) Another powerful cluster from the movie director "Cube". At this time there are two main characters who find themselves with their house transported to a mysterious white mystery. There's really nothing out of their small story story. Surprisingly to be sure, but I thought the comedic sound introduced for this film from getting going was a very sick pregnancy. There is a need to be humorous, certainly ... and I have no trouble with humor which was finally released by the trouble of our two heroes ("last" they were definitely hoot) ... but I think this movie would be better if it had been gone more in reality at first. After watching the film I see "Make" on a DVD and a short trailer at the end it is almost completely without "good" features and ... it looks like a completely different film (and a little more). The last half hour of the movie is a place where it actually begins to assemble ... similar to the latest movie movie "Primer." Artists are preferable when they do not get a comedy shtick. They are absolutely true in their "normal" time. I was already ready to write this film as a failed attempt at the center center ... but it won me the end. (And continue to look back at the credit for the last area ... don't ask us to explain.)
