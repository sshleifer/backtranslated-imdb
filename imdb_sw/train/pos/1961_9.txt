It came only from the first show of Basic Foundation 2. I had entered into thinking it would crappy according to critics of the preview and I was very surprised! If you liked Primary Foundation I think you will enjoy # 2 only if not more. A great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. Music is very good, it shows the original theme. Do not go to the University of Excellence Awards, see for fun and fun. That's what movies planned for - escape. I can't imagine the best way to avoid than to avoid and Sharon Stone who is as sexy as she was. I think about going back to see this week. Go see!
