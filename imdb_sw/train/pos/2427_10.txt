This is a very unfamiliar movie. Talking to a biography without a typical clich√©s. This movie was based on the actor's talent and was removed away. it affects the litter and sexually transmitted sex in.I particularly liked all discrimination issues. <br /> <br /> Now go to the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was very good at playing a small crime. It is a shame that it is only allowed to show his talent in his own movie. Titus Welliver was very strange as a half brother of Fishburne. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already selected film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a monkey of grease / master of drugs. I loved her acting since the "King of New York". But the best working in this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were paired fully as two of those of Calderon. <br /> <br /> Once in Life is sure the guardian. **** 1/2 * out of *****.
