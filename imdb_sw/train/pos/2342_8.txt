I watched the Pie plate last night and the word that comes to mind is "nature." It is a word that has not been widely used on television because it all has any copies that the other web is doing and ends up with seven nights of crime displays, unwanted profile, and real destruction. The first thing to hit me like bricks was Jim Dale's presence. Those who do not know and the UK series "Continue ..." or those who did not listen to the book of Harry Potter, may not have Dale. I don't know if his presence as a writer adds or loses. I will need to look more, but offers a show of "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Child, Great Player) has a gift. It does not explain where he found it, but can bring someone from the dead for a minute. He shares with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve the killings using this talent. Everything is good and beautiful until he comes to the love of childhood, Anna Friel (Goals! Goes, Time of Time) and things can be difficult. He cannot bring him back and never touch him. Boy, do you? That would have difficulty in connection. I will be looking to see where this series goes on in hope that will continue to remind you.
