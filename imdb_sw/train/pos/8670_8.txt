WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane against MVP in the Inferno match: So this is the fourth match of the inferno in WWE and Kane vs MVP ( The wonder why it was the first match on the card). I was just looking at the last parts where Kane put the MVP ass on the fire as they are on the apron and then MVP runs around the field at the sound? finally refs put out fire and hot flames as MVP sprawls along the road to the door. Funny and visually end of entertainment. 7/10 Championship of WWE Tag Team: This was a must have William Regal & Dave Taylor against Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a team's team's team team. However, GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it will be a team match team of 4 bad. MNM and Hardys are thrown out and it's all the confusion. One word to describe the eye-opener? wow. Man, I cannot remember the many advertisements of patients in this match and words cannot do right. There was one important spot where Hardys had established a level in the sight-and Jeff climbed up the string when Matt made MNM to kill, and then WHAM! Nitro rushed when Mercury apparently wiped it and had blood like hell and pain on his face. He had to be taken by Nitro and kept the match alone. Another emergency was when Jeff beat London when he was striking off the stairs. There were so many breathing spots to remember. London finally unbuckles belts win this show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> Boogeyman against Miz: Two men are beaten and around the ring until Boogeyman will lose the powerbomb to stay for victory and then throw a bug on the mouth of Miz as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito. United Nations Championships: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another Guerrero match. Some of the best ads included superplex on the top and Chavo string and the usual sequence of Germany and Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes to the ring with a belt for Benoit nail but Benoit isolates himself and takes a long time to decide whether to put him in Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go to the roll-up but Benoit overturns once with Chavo closed on Sharpshooter. The contest is over. Good to fight even harder battle sometimes. 7/10 WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this, with an equal average match. Did the match have good spots? especially Helms' leaves the upper string? but the crowd does not seem to be in it after witnessing the match, and Yang needs to get more. Helms won the match after hitting Yang away from usobuster on the knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ > Mr. Kennedy in the last Ride match: after a series of matches between the two, this is the last game of the ride, the second of its kind and the winner should escort his opponent out of the field in the season. Better good in fact why these two can offer. Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke the free of chokeslam throwing Take off Armageddon setting around 15 feet down; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be cruel. Kennedy almost won the victory until Taker had come into the season (I loved the camera view in the season). Taker then missed the steel pipe seized Kennedy and broke the hearse window instead, but later drove Kennedy to open and seat, and followed by chokeslam and Tombstone series on the roof of the session. Kennedy was conscious and Taker drove out of the field to win. In fact I found myself interested in having a boyfriend to take / give real sick shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" finds my ear. When breaking. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena against Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma vs technical. This match was a really great event and the speed of shifting from one team to another and remaining good. Even Finlay got good shots on his opponents at this time (I had no doubt of his power against competitions), and he and Booker especially did not succeed in trying to cheat? but one time the Booker was celebrating its ceremony at Cena's throat. Batista opens Bomb to Booker for winning, not seeing F-U; Cena made 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyhow and I think also made STFU. This is the best technical night of the night and the participants did very well for what they could without level 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Become a fan of WWE over-and-off, we must admit that Armageddon was closed with a few of the eyes, and the match of the level finally swallowed half of the show; The last Ride match included some of the most bold advertising, and the main event also made it good for its community. All other matches were also spent on their bills except maybe Boogeyman vs Miz bout and lingerie lucky competition. The sum of Har â€“ Magedon was very fun-to-view and in spite of many obstacles in the early PPV period, Armageddon is demanding this year's honor with respect. PPV: 8/10 Period.
