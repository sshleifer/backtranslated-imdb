Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I saw in the movie. My father took my sister and me, and surprising it - when we got home, the father asked him "what do you want now?" and we said we want to look at Raggedy Ann & Andy! lol, and my father really took us to the theater to look at it again - at least I remember. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was very good for five years. The area with a large sea of ​​candy, and the area of ​​the hypnotic camel. I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
