I just took out the DVD release of this film during a holiday in Norway where it was released by English clauses. The video has been photographed and efficiently. The child who shows "Frits" a leadership character has a wonderful face which mirrors and precision the adverse events that surround. Earlier in the film we see that the father of Frits loves very much has mental health problems and this brings the brutal head refusing to accuse the boy and shows that he was his father. <br /> <br /> Example of a situation where Frits refuses to show any respect to the chief administrator; standing under it and repeating 'False' if he has been brutally attacked in front of his peers is a place that you cannot forget. The only weak film is part of the 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every tricky teacher teacher in the book. Other than this I feel that this is a very popular film.
