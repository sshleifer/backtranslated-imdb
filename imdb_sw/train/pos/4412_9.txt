I have watched this film twice on the DVD, and twice did not fail to impress him with his impartial view. It seems more like a manifestation of the truth than the most of the Hollywood birds, especially on topics that are still being discussed by fire. Although it holds close to the south view, it is not worth asking, and finally the only sentence is that the war has been lost, no matter what, and the violence is a common denomination. <br /> What exactly makes this movie better is more refusing to play. Recent films (in short) are few and far away, and the usual price is enjoyable (if you do not have high expectations), but it is very sold for business. I think this film comes as a very good movie (without being a helicopter), because it joins itself, and gives the viewer a chance to look at it and analyze it, instead of wanting to beat him with effect and feeling to erase the mind. This film is cool, concentrating, and usually gives light in its judgment, which is Good. <br /> <br /> The story has its faults, especially the character of the jewel comes out of course, but again the situation at that time was so chaotic, that for a little widow may be logical only to somehow return to normal life, even to pick up each boy next. Yet he does not know if he is weak, in fact I think he is one of the strongest characters, he always has control over relationships, and men only put it. And I'm so glad that she is not a widow crying. I believe in the death of the dear 19th century is more common than now. You can easily die from minor illnesses and injuries, so the expectation of a dying person, while actually causes sadness, has never caused people to suffer as it is now. People did not seem to build monuments for those who were lost as they do now, and I like that view. My recommendations are for smart people to watch this film, if it's something different than a typical hollywood hotel. Don't check if you want a non-stop action or heartbeat.
