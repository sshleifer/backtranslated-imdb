This unhappy film is true for small audiences. Herros are a dud spies whose sophomoric view leads them to very silly roads. Wanting a great murder case, you will see these investigators go to every height to solve the crime. There is no weakness, but the importation of sex, the slapstick packaging ... everything young man goes. Low budget, but very entertaining. Honesty of the traditional worship service.
