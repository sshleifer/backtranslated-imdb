The movie was coming from beginning to end with its b / w pictures of America Heartland is stunning. We hear that we are right with them when they cross the great sky and then go to Mexico and return to the United States again. Near the end of the movie, the rain reflection of Robert Blake looks like a few sweat streams and tears down. At the end, we follow the action for their last time. Two criminals, made by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, like Perry Smith and Dick Hickock were seen on any street in any town. Hickock is a young man who laughs near Smith, a star-shaped boy in his eyes from the wrong side of the city. This action is done in the movie and always surprises us that criminals have no different difference than anyone else. Evil, even worse, is part of human nature. These two fraudulent men kill the whole family, seeking the security that does not exist. Once the rush, it begins to write bad checks, making a way for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are a few helpers to help. I would like John Forsyth as a detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a short but better place as a prosecutor. I've been wishing to see this film all the way, if I just got a small picture; I reached the end after buying a DVD. The result is the best film of ethnic crimes I have ever seen. Do not miss this brilliant film. For me, this is the biggest decision of all the film about.
