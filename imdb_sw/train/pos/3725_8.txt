There are four beautiful movies showing the Vietnam War. They are (in any order: Apocalypse Now, Born on July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. Both Tigerland takes into account the real war with men in it. The most important exhibitions of the person who asks war, and its perversion. This has been done in many movies, but rarely in the boot camp. The film of Boz makes this movie very good. It is a shame not to get a great deal. It is on the shelf of any movie's films and films mentioned above.
