Now I have been a fan of the work of the Full Puppet of Month. But we must say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yes, you have heard. Stories are doing a good job, the atmosphere works and actors are doing the first job. Gary Graham who makes his mark on TV in shows as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that he can become a star of action who hits a donkey and takes a name. The effect of the stop motion can be a little bit more. The color was bad, they look at my plastic instead of metal that they thought to be. But that's a small complaint compared to all that is Robot Jox, if you would like Gary Graham or other Full Movies, then you would like this film. 9 STARS from 10.
