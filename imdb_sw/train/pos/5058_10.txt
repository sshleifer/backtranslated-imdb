There must be more films about our American Americans. I especially think that using the real American Americans, it would be the right thing. I know that Archie Belaney, who played with Pierce Brosnan, did a good job in displaying that attitude, since he was English. But my opinion to Hollywood, is to put many American Indians in responsibilities, and never use anyone else. The Sioux nation has been placed in the back of the back for a long time. Their poverty is a shame for our country. It is my belief that our country should return to Black Hills to Sioux. We ask Israel to return to their land to the Arabs, but we do not try to do the same, we should feel ashamed of themselves. We must practice what we preach!
