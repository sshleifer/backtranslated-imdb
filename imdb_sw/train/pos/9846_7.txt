Ok, at first it looked like "Shrek" - alone that is followed by regular comic aid. Then comes in something strong, like gauntlet installed. And the result is a enjoyable movie, which has a time that I agree is very little too much for kids to watch (formerly Manny, for example). Cluster has been open to work for a long time, so they can win in making a movie set and almost no different sets (just ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It is good to know that they succeed in doing something emotionally. As I have said, it can be heavy-laden sometimes, so, children, soak. Restoring the real is animation. This was not done as a story of a toy or a shrek, and it shows. Humans have no meaning, and we have seen the best examples of CGI before. But do not leave this permission to record: as a real effort, "Ice Age" is recommended. And it will collect many fans, I have no doubt. O and yes, when the little mouse is worth, and show-stealing.
