ITALIAN is an amazing film for its time. For shooting, for the effects of lighting that is true, this is the first gem depicting REGINALD BARKER to be a stand-by-pioneer pioneer with D.W. GRIFFITH AND MAURICE TOURNEUR. Thomas Ince's control over the production is difficult to know, but this film still has a wonderful power. The simple story of Italian migrants trying to keep his family alive in New York, is moving very much. The theme of social justice, revenge and forgiveness is very important today. The use of close-ups is the best and performance of the powerhouse of GEORGE BEBAN is electricity. What we need now is very good to be transferred to the DVD so we can understand this first realistic movie.
