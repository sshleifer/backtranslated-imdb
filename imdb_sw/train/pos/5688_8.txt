Credit unlock: good. Music: just the same for this film. Definition: concern for great impact. <br /> <br /> Disturb the excitement in the way of the fall of the train. This is how some control of some life may be. "Wonderland" shows the destruction of drugs (and the result) is not as a transfer, but it shows how it really happens in our society. It is better than a group of other wild -Manson-because exhibitions because all of Manson's films, books etc. concentrate on Manson's fiction rather than the overall image of cheap popularity that has spread today. If you want to see some "best-acting" best on the film, see Kilmer on this film. He shows how "Method" can be riveting in the role of justice. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers here will succeed in adding "out of control" to the level of art art, not only for throwing the cheap thrills.
