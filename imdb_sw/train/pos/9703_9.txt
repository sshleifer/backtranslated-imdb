One of the best series of comedy who ever came from England. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are actors and artists who are seen at home and acting as they play. Ably has been assisted by their girlfriend writing Jeremy Dyson, who have consistently followed up with many memorable characters over recent years. Little Britain is not as important as imitating their poor ideas. Of course the original and insistence I am sure many people hate this series if they like it but I am sure that no one can have a comment on LOG. I haven't seen a lengthy film but I have heard good things and bad things so I will keep the balance. The original radio series that LOG came was creative as a series of television sets. I don't know if the television series did it in the United States but I would like to see how the American audience got an amazing English humority.
