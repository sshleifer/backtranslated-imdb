When I saw this film first, the first thing I thought was this film was like a movie than a movie. The reason is because it involves Vampics doing amazing stunts. Stunts are as much as Matrix goes like moving very fast to kinda shoot and fly very close. Another reason why I movie is good is because the adorable anime face they do during the movie. The Gackt way makes his face walking or just the way to do, often. I think it's a very good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ Activity in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde is also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a Gackt and Hyde fans, you must see it.
