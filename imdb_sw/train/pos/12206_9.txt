Among all the films of the 1940s and 1950s, this should be one of the most wonderful, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four chief executives: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are common for everyone but it is the last two that make this film my entertainment, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the most remarkable people I've ever seen on the film. His voice, and some of the things he said, must be heard. Slaone is not back in the "amazing" group. Hayworth is not so interesting for short hair, red but it's still a Hayworth, which means a lot of sleep if you're a boy. Welles' is amazing as always. One tip: if you have a DVD, walk English headlines. His character in this film is Japanese and you need headlines to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also described a film that means having a large camera angle and a good face-to-face buttons. You also have a special, visible, and shot at the mirror house. Great things! As strange as this film is, I still thought the surveillance situation as a pocket during the trial close to the end was too high and occupied away from the area's weight. Other than that, there is no complaint. <br /> <br /> This is a good entertainment, which is the name of the game.
