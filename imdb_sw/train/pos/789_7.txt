Crush provides a mixture of drama, humor and similar feeling that I find English to establish very well when it involves heart issues. More known for leading John McKay wrote this beautiful screen about three and forty friends in a small town in England. All three professional women lost luck and men made a nightly collection of female women and gin, fags and sweets with sweets and last negotiations on their date of error or demand for their libidos. Andie MacDowell was once again thrown by the British environment (where I see that she becomes more) is quite charming as the grandmother of a prestigious school who works with the younger. The small gossip of the city with uninvited friends (great help cast) are facing his relationship. It shows a series of unfortunate events and shows us many problems when someone wants to enjoy real happiness. Remember the main cluster of this film is a friendship and the end shows us exactly that. This is the kind of film you like or dislike, that's why I believe a lot of mixed views and not a great achievement when this film was released. If I'm sure many just like the movie now. I was very excited about this film and strongly recommended for those who like films such as "True Love", and "Three Wedding and Funeral". Not to mention the sound of the voice is wonderful to keep at that moment very important.
