I saw this movie when I was a little - called "Glacier Fox". I was completely defeated by that! It follows the small family of the fox near. The beginning was good and I remember having very few holes. I also remember my mother took me out of the theater when I was in wonders. I won't tell you what happened, but let's just say it doesn't end with all the mouse. I was used for the Disney's original film where animals cannot die. Oh man. This film made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was very young and really told - every one I remember was happy with a fox and then seeing one of them die. Use as much as you can, but don't show your children!
