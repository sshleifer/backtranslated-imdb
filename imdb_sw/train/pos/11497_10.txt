This is one of the few movies out there that are very exciting without having a romantic picture, despite being a very serious plot. No voice or conversation; instead, executives make a voice to describe their experiences, why they participated, etc.. <br /> <br /> It is a document. <br /> <br /> It's mind-blowing. I can understand why no one else has tried to do something like this. There is already something like this. This. :-) <br /> N / A: Producer has no rights to distribute the DVD version. I have never seen it being sold anywhere; The person can email Mr. Boerner and order copies on VHS.
