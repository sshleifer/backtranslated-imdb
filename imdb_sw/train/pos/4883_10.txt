We, as a family, were very happy with 'Blond's Bombshells' we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> Acting is A1 and cast has many characters and singers. The theme is odd with the script written well. Music / songs are unavailable and send us our young days when we sing songs on our voices. Defining the story here would destroy the 'plot' because it is very good to sit back and enjoy the story as it reveals. The full text for this productive and enjoyable product and we strongly encourage anyone who is looking for laughter and many abortions.
