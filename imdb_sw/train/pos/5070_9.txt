Recently I searched for the Wide Screen DVD released recently and came on an amazing name I have never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough's film took my attention (he is responsible for such a beautiful film like GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I saw that the screenplay was with William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "special version" had an attractive sound equipment and the price was less than $ 10.00 - so I used and bought it. WOW! What's a good film. Star Pierce Brosnan as Archie Gray Owl, a real walker in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the Canadian countries of Canada, and worked to help them. Brosnan (who made a star in James Bond film) gives passion, warmth, and power like Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and affects her feelings for the creatures of the earth - especially beaver. Good mark by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) with beautiful pictures and Roger Pratt greatly enhances the effectiveness of the film. AND extra on this DVD is nothing else! It comprises two shorts made in the 1930s and Gray Owl real music and sound lyrics and Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; Article 2; and other good preferences for PLUS for those who access PC and DVD-ROM components. OWL's GRAY has been given directly to the DVD in the US - the fact that Richard Attenborough attributes a lack of Hollywood's interest in supplying something that is not included in many violence and sex. This is just a film that is not only informative and includes but it connects you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of the film - with a new love and understanding for the beavers! OWL GRAY is a very good film - worth looking out! This is one I expect to share with others.
