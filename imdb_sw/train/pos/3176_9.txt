I came to find this film in Brooklyn - it's hard to explain the plot; has a lot of wacky characters, but let's just say I'd have a hard time choosing who made me more difficult, I don't know popi started. Even the input functions are well documented and well done. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of small touch that makes it unique and very enjoyable, has a few "few" that add and add another column. It's enjoyable to watch; not the other things that I have ever seen before. If this film can reach a broad audience, I am sure it will be a fun people, the story is natural and heart. There is much here to love, past stories, misunderstandings and misunderstandings that have caused the last act and an amazing conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very interesting movie and tones of heart; is the story of touch and connectivity of the comedy around. Certainly worth seeing!
