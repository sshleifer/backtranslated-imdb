Released in December of 1957, Sayonara continued to get 8 Oscar appointments and would pull in success 4. Red keys won Oscar for Actor Best Supporting in his role as airman Joe Kelly who loves to love the Japanese woman in Kobe during the Korean War. Oscar was appointed by Chief Leader, Marlon Brando has Lloyd Gruver's Chief Executive, the Korean War to Fly Ace returned to Japan, who strongly insists military opposition for marriage between US soldiers and Japanese women and attempts unsuccessfully to speak to his friend Joe Kelly out of marriage. Traditionally, Marlon Brandos's character finds his own love for a Japanese woman. This movie shows discrimination and cultural differences of the time. Blowed by beautiful colors and with amazing nature I have seen this film worth looking only for these effects alone. Beautiful movie, more gimme ... GimmeClassics
