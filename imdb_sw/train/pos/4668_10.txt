This movie appears now on TV TV at least once a month, I have watched it several times or more, and it has never been fun. If it were tomorrow I would look at it again. That is the skills that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, the two great magicians of the acting profession can create, assisted in a very small way with the best trio support of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in small tasks. <br /> <br /> It is a simple story, just described, of a con con, a loved player, to fight and succeed with "new age technology" ie computer, and to find love in the process. Even if it is tad (tongue in the cheek) implausible, even strange, the characters are not. There is no abuse, no sex, no bad language, and the best in any way that is so prevalent today. The true lesson for contemporary filmmakers on how to make a great show from, and to, almost anything ... except the best talent.
