I don't remember when I first heard about this film, but I spent six years ago, and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I will admit you, perhaps you will despise this film if you don't know anything about rap music. But if you are a fan of rap, even ordinary, you will like the local joke and memory. One of the best lines in the film is about the difference between b **** and h **; I still use this line today and get lots of votes. One of the best displays comes from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in the 'Revenge of Nerds'. It is unfortunate that this film will never be released on DVD.
