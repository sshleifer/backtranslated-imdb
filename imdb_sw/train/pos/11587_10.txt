I love this film and I would like to have one day. It's just an interesting story about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I don't remember very much about it, but that the boy of Kiamerica lives in a beautiful village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he should go to the desert alone. His sister brings him food and goes. When she is out, some Indian boys come out and put some feathers on her, and she turns to an eagle. The story says that if you see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is a boy. I have always been fascinated by stories, especially American stories and I would like to see this day released on DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, anyone involved!
