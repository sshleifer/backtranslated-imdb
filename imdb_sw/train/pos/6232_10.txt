One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. A strong helper from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. Scary songs include "Let's Go to Him," "Let's See Music," and "Put All My Own In One Basket." The last song is brought by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a good dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let's Go Go" and Grable among conservation singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and has a sister of Rogers mousy. "Get you behind me" is a song that lives with you for the day. He also sings "But where?" Snappy and fast paced, this entry into Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. A wonderful and amazing end, "Let's turn to Music and Dance" is among the most known of their number. Rogers wearing one of the biggest clothes in the history of the film .... The embedded number of shimmering that spinning his legs as he plays (tent-weight) and also sees little. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters have been created in Pennies from Heaven. Randolph Scott looks an extraordinary election as a pal of Astaire but also appeared in their Roberta and Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have a great place in 1936 but they have a few screens and a little bit. Allwyn has a greater responsibility but it is just the same. Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series and "Let's Go to You" .... Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. <Br> Happy all the way, though exhausted "We joined the Navy" after the third time ....
