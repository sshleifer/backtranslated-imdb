Although not the best characters I have ever seen but I enjoyed the death of Lady. I've never read a comic book and I just saw a video shop and I decided to give it a chance. The animation was the same, I got the feeling of 80 anime from them that put it for me. Why everyone hates that is more than me. <br /> <br /> Character development is good. I like how they brought about from Hope to Woman Death around. for you who does not like, certainly did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and he used his words. The player was a good mentor / soldier for him. Its desperate style was perfect for this kind of movie. I think everyone here who has done this needs to take another look and think again. cause everything that people have hit this can be said about every favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
