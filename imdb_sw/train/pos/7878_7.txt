As the story in my family goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for Dorsey port. After Sinatra joined the band, my father worked with him for a long time. Then, one time, my father told Sinatra that he was good to be bound by a small group (band), and that he should separate himself. At that time Sinatra had enough credit 'under its belt' to do just that! Dorsey never forgot my father, and others, as they say, is history. I have some pictures and records for these results, as well as Berkley University in California. I just seen every movie of Sinatra more than I would say, and its movies are not available. . .
