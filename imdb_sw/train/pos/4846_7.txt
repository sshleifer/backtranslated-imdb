This is an exciting British british style that I always wanted to watch but there was no opportunity for it so far. It depends on a well-known game that had been done several times earlier (especially in 1931 with the same director, but unfortunately, this version does not seem to have been in its entirety); for remake under inspection, the plot has been updated at the moment-time war when the situation. <br /> <br /> However, I was particularly familiar with the UK's early comedians through the film Will Hay: given that this features features the same characteristics of the hauntings of stories, fraud and enemy agents, are very in vein (it was actually written by the ordinary hierarchy of the Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); The feature of the beaten travelers, then, was a tried-and-genuine formula. The stars are now near Arthur Askey (accused by Richard Murdoch) - no film I had ever seen before - who is like a non-Hay hero and whose personality suggests that it is likely to persuade them ... up to him, and Askey certainly comes with lines A number of magic and exciting business bits in ensuring the fact that the leading character of the play (and the film's 1931 version) was divided into two, and Murdoch performed as a direct partner of the stars. The one-dimensional layout (film events mainly occur during one night of the storm) provides an incredible atmosphere; The last hour - and the sudden appearance of a wonderful couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the car itself - is hit and manage well. Also mention value from the remaining list of cures is Kathleen Harrison as a fearful spinster, and a parrot as a regular companion and who is driven by all the excitement of drinking his first drink.
