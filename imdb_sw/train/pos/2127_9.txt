Doing this romantic comedy is correct but these days are misleading. The species has declined to destruction, and it also focused on making the couple more together with a very small room of ambience and other stories, making it a more formula and more predictable. The Corner Around Corner does not look at these diseases: it can create an atmosphere in the middle east and east of Europe and has a stronger power than it (powerful) leading; I avoid using the words 'help cast' for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a great role for the film and his story is the same as not more important than romance. The 1998 movie has found the “borrowing” idea of ​​the unknown pen-pal for this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. This is not correct and is certainly not suitable for a new film - it shares a type of type and borrows an aspect of the plot, but that's all.
