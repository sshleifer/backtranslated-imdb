I enjoyed this film. The work with adult actors was good, although I found a very young child. But he was too proud to be a new talent. Humor is very good and not in your face as a junk comedy of Hollywood. I.e. Professor of Nutty. If you have a short time to consider and are used on the usual Hollywood stations you might not like this if it is slow. I took it on Blu-ray and I must say the quality of the image is the top line. Probably one of the best Blu-rays look I have seen so far. The extra was too cool. They were completely deleted, but probably it is good if most of the deleted events did not add anything.
