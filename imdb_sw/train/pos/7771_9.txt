The full summary of Dane's work Douglas Sirk (born by Detlef Sierck), Written on Wind takes great attention to each chapter of gaudy. From its opening of the right, and the buzzing leaves of the baronial house of Texas and the wind blowing the calendar pages in a flashback, the movie faces 99 minutes of family controversy that you were doing later, little knockoffs like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest on their long term runs. The combination of wealth and destruction is Americans of the theme, in our dollar society, found without fail. Brother and Sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the deceased heir, unfortunately for Hadly's fat; boy chum Rock Hudson and a new grandmother Lauren Bacall are foreign people who are trying to put a lid on the right shell. (It is written that the story was based on Libby Holmann's marriage in the money of the Reynolds of tobacco.) As always, the misfits finds all the chewing environment - with the best line to ban (Malone, in its performance of Oscar-nabbing as absorb nymphomaniac and jones for Hudson, finds to wipe all the fire of their performances. Hudson, a good time, can not compete with all of these on-over-imaging; Bacall begins power but grows excessive, easy to plot only. No matter; with a series of strangled strokes in interesting hue, Sirk gives a lesson of how to turn a registered melodrama set in the paradise of lush 50 years of America. No one has ever done so well.
