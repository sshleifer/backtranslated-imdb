According to John Ford was shot by sound, the biopic of the life of Abraham Lincoln his great mistakes could be the difficulty with the woman able to play in "the worst way." Ford cameras have only a comment to congratulate the woman's life Lincoln. But why the film does not characterize the character makes for beauty and depth of vision. The best pieces of early films, which can be a series of very good frames, Ford has a unique eye to tell stories. Film plays the life of a young man with hope. Henry Fonda plays Lincoln's clever meditation and voluntary, one of its best responsibilities. <br /> <br /> The film involves two young people, brothers, for the murder case that they all claim to have done. In the form of angry people, the city decides to take right into their own hands and bring them back, until faithful believers enter into destruction. He likes them with his humor, telling them not to take his first big case, and that they are similar to lynched him as a lawyer for boys. That follows it seems to be the center of all court-murder courts after that, as Abe voluntarily interviews the witnesses with joy and humor of the judge, jury and the city before moving on the lost links. The film is done as many of John Ford's films do: A Americana spoon, a dash of average forecasts, a sense of fear that you don't know if you put it on recipes or like Ford made yourself. In addition to 'Hollywood' more than the feel of the film, and a great patriotic flag describing the future presidency of Lincoln, the film is very enjoyable and enjoyable, if you can take your game with salt.
