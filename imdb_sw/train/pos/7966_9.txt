As a child I thought this movie was good. It had animals, it had good music, and it was my famous actress: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this film, for different reasons. It has a good parasite that is placed in various queues and events that are best seen on the camera. It has a good, well-written music that is similar to the perfect events, as well as enhancing fast music and heart-stirring heart, which still makes me cry. Even when people reduce. And it has my famous actor, Michael J. Fox. According to the book, this is the story of three home pets, a modern, very reliable and human knowledge of the name of Shadow, ignorant and free-but still smart-scared of water called Sassy and a smart-shrewd road and a little neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's field when their family goes. They lost their appetite, the pets of the flock came out and planned a trip in the Sierra mountains for their journey of life. A wonderful journey. Why, maybe home is more than that mountain. But what if not? I advise Bound Upward for people who like the three amazing actors to give voice to the characters of the first animal, and to anyone else ... yeah, everyone will look at it.
