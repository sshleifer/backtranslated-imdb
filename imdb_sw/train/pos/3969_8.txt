What? Anyone has seen that James Earl Jones is a minister who serves when Hagarty's wife shows that she is pregnant when they are at a restaurant near the lake. I watched this film on a video I had filmed on television. As I looked at this area I thought that I realized the voice of Jones when the "hostess" laughed at the end. I rebuilt the tape and slowly came through the area as the camera drew back and showed the host. Listen closely as a waitress laughing when Hagarty looks up and tells him they will have a baby, then look closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows hostess, however, quickly.
