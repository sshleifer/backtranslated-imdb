I liked this film because I had a new release from Blockbuster and I had to grab something quickly, as the shop had prepared for the evening closing. A white color block and a very interesting head. I am (by saying) “old woman” and my son is a 30-year-old boy. My son, on the other hand, is a film student and enjoys foreign films, such as Bergman or Hertzog. We usually hate everyone's decisions, of course, we all looked at and we loved no movie! It was different from any film we can see before. We are human / private forms and we often expect movies when we watch them - but in this case we laughed and enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It is our opinion that if this film was promoted and displayed on the mainstream movies in U.S. it would have done very well.
