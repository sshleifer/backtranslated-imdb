Certainly can not be classic but it is one full of classic lines. One of the movies my friends and I quote from all time and this is fifteen years later (perhaps it was on Cinemax very often!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actors in this film - can't be seen to know how to play but surrounded by a strange cast who know exactly how to play this spoof. Looking for a film to comfort you? This is the only rental with friends - it will do better.
