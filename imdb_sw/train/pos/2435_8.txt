I have never thought of an old cartoon that tears tears in my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted to see the first picture of Casper's name The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, There is a Boos To-Night beautiful (1948), It made me break! I could not believe how sad and sad it was after seeing a Casper dog killed! I've never seen anything like that in other Casper cartoons! This is the most sad of all! It was very difficult, I couldn't look again. It's like seeing Lassie dying at the end of the movie. I know it's a classic, but it's a lot for us old fans cartoon handle like me! If I wanted to look at something old and old, I would rather look at something fun and interesting! But when I think about this Casper cartoon, I think about my cat!
