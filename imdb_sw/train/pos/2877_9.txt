I don't think I need to tell you a story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will only share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From that time I was a child of Disney in a good way. Animation now seems to be a young and old, but that's part of its charm now. Now, at the age of pictures of High School and Computer Music, it looks like people have forgotten the thought and magical essence of Disney movies early. Thanks I was born before so I was created for this ordinary. And apparently no matter what age I get, I turn back to the age of five looking on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.
