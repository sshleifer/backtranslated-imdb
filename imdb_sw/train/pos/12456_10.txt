This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies in that kind. The relationship between dignified and ethical characters is ode for chivalry and the principle of respect among thieves and police. It takes the theme as responsibility, guilt, word, deception and trust if a few films have done and, unfortunately, nothing I can remember since the 'sex' death at the end of the seventy years. The sequence is delicious, less important, living something out and thus leading the viewer to plot the right plot and the wrong without accessory eye and interesting scenes that are often needed in small types of forms to keep the audience awake. No such events exist or are required. Discussions are honest sand for the player; The most important assets in the species that are also often inaccurate through the illusion of viewers. No, this is not missed Marble ... The compliments of music are so that the movie will look and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
