It's a little trouble to have a character called Gig Young in the film ... played by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig got its name and also added a better job after playing a small part under another name. I will go against many views of the comments and say that I was very happy with this film, especially because of the good performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. He was so beautiful, angry, dangerous, caring, and brave like the third-largest woman whose mother died in Lytania, and whose father was killed at the time of Wai I. As a "man" of the house, Fiona standing for many years against solving his father's will that would allow Donald Trump's name Charles Barclay to find a family. But Fiona keeps secret because she hates Barclay. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle, flirty sister, married to an English man but she loses her little sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Stanwyck, this is not a miss.
