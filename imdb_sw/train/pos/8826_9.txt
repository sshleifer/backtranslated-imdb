If you are suffering from direct actions — these are logical in the private context, you will enjoy this 8-minute Spanish film. A woman enters a small café. The area seemed to be normal, but the players, customers, and two musicians seem to somehow fail. Suddenly, musicians play with one person begins to sing the song of the head, playing on the table tablets and the music comedy music. Customers, for the first time, may go for a short time (wrong but easily) with words from the song, read from the pieces of paper on their palms. On and off jump up and dancing (suddenly but harder) in the course of choreographed, as the singers preserve. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman wondered. The answer has been revealed as a real open jacket and sees what was put on his chest - just before the peak explosion ... Even if you do not capture the lyrics (maybe ironical) lyrics, the perfect-condition should give you grin and chuckle ... !
