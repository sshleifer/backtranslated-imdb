The title of this film is taken from the ceremony called "Seven Minutes in Heaven." The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, NY, and describes it as something like "Whatever-bottle," "Bringing the Heart," and other kissing games. According to the law, the name of the boy and the girl will be separated, and the elect will order to enter the dark closet together and stay there for seven minutes. At the same time, there will be tolerance among the guests of the party as if these two did not have the courage to hold hands, embrace, and / or kiss with the privacy of the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the game leader could say, "At the top" or knock on the door of the closet, and the couple will come out of the closet. After being visited by other visitors, the couple would have to accept what they did during the "Seven Minutes in Heaven." Then some couples will be chosen to enter the room until all the guests are involved. Couples who admit to do more will be players of the game. Such games have served as "ice breakers" for children and young people, but they can be embarrassed and scared to shy people. The movie has been given this title because it deals with the first experience of young people and weeds and romantic love.
