I got a bit of this concert on public TV and I knew I had it. Boys give everyone in Royal Albert the best, often exciting activities fill every way. Okay, too - not available, is not available lasers and strobes, no big door (with no surprise, sad, and acceptable listeners, all of whom have come out of their home bottles). <br /> <br /> is a fan of Cream (or if you just feel); if you're a fan of blues; if you are a fan of rock 'n' roll; you can't despair when you see and listen to this DVD. You will also lose this DVD because you can't pay anyone. (This DVD proves selfish! Ask them to find themselves!) It is very good and can also be overthrown; you will need to put it in easy access.
