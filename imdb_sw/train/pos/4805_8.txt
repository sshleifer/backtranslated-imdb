when I first heard about this film I thought it would be like Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of Young Victoria I knew this was not just a solid movie. Almost everything in this film is good, the dress is very amazing and the settings are also well-tasted. The only thing that has left me is the exhibition. Emily Blunt (Devil wearing Prada) is a film star, bringing to life Victoria and this movie shows that she is a good actor and maybe taking the first Oscar selection for her performance. Rupert's friend is close to bland as Prince Albert but has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also established as Lord Melbourne though I expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson all respond to work but can't forget. <br /> <br /> For me the film feels like not suitable. Perhaps the picture writers changed so many things into the script, I don't know but that's what I feel about the movie. But it's generally a great movie about the original years of Victoria and Great Performance from Emily Blunt.
