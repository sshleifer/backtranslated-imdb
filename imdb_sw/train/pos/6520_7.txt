DeMille's original movie was made in 1938 by Frederic March. Very good film. Hollywood's love of remakes brings us an interesting movie that attracts Yul Brynner. He undoubtedly was brilliant as he almost always appeared to be in all his movies. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was an elite stroke. However, the film was a long time in places. Not suitable for the version of 1938. However, it is an enjoyable movie that should appear at least once.
