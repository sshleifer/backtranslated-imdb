I say, I liked Point of Vanishing. I found the original, and this is a very good remake. Although it did not follow the original story (that's why I gave 8 out of 10), it was still good and this is probably the story of the best story. <br /> <br /> As a car, well the DJ's comments at the end of Challenger going 185 mph in bulldozers are pretty improbable (And if you look, the speedometer needle was talking 145-150), but though I don't see one in the engine in one to start the scenes where they show the engine, the original story was with Hemi supercharged, so it is possible. For those who say aerodynamics will not allow, the chrysler 300C of today's today may go to 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, go to the highway is like pushing the brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Plus, in the wind-wind test to create a air dam on Challenger would probably be aerodynamic.
