I have known Anne DeSalvo was a good actor, now I know she is a writer / director too. I have been a fan since I saw him first on the film "Perfect", "New Year Dear", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memory". <br /> <br /> It's hard to see Lee Grant these days in anything. He has been in the screen for too long. It is also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something else than sit-com. This is her best job since "Photo Gallery". Having grown up in the Italian American family you will love this movie. I had no expectations when I started watching this film, so I was very surprised when I liked this film. If you get a chance, see.
