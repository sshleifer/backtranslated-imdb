"Betty Notorious Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Guided by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Star: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, & David Strathairn <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating: "R" (for dirt, sexual content and some language) <br /> <br /> It seems that every popular person today gets biopic made about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now. "Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest release on DVD. It puts Gretchen Mol as a world-famous fashion model, Bettie Page and filmed a black and white film with some colored features. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line", and "Seeking Neverland", however, this film will not be one of looking at Oscars this year. This movie has no emotional deficiency shown in other biopics and more time in Bettie's life is completely ignored or simply proposed. This does not mean, however, is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an entertaining and fulfilling movie - a solid work of movies. This film focuses on the most exciting works of the Page and the narrow line between sex and sex. It has been done with care and care of Mary Harron takes a look and feel at the time when most filmmakers only mention. Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). If you know him as an icon ?? or a star of porn? You know her. She is a woman who had a profound effect on American culture only by revealing more skin than it seemed to be right then. Now, many people know him as one of the first signs of American sex - stories for many models, especially Playboy and other adult magazines. He lived at a time when showing only the inch of the body under the garbage could have been captured and the picture of a slave of fashion was just something to push the American public into a riot. In fact, the images launched a full screening ceremony on the most common and distinct films between non-violent and porn videos. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions in "The best Bettie page" is quite amazing and Gretchen Mol standing out. His performance as Bettie Page is just brilliant. I understand that, when announced by the role, many people were concerned. His name is not one that crosses my mind when I think of good performances. Now, it will be. He worked hard and took me to his difficult work and was still very involved. David Strathairn is a new "Night Beauty, and Good Luck" last year, where he gave the best performances of 2005. Here, he gives another good performance even though it is not used less. I was wondering how long the time of the screen was too small but the quality on the amount is always an important feature of any good movie. The only work I saw from Lili Taylor was in "The Haunting" (1999). While many people ignored the film, I found it a fun movie, if not quite, horrible and I have also thought that Taylor was quite sure if Nell was caused by emotion. Here, Taylor provides another reliable performance. He gives the best performance and gives the best performance to thank the Gretchen Mol. After everything that was said and done, I realized that the "Notorious Betest Page" cannot be compared with other biopics, such as "Get Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is impossible because it tells the story of the woman and her work, from beginning to end. His personal life is briefly described, but it is actually his effect on the world that becomes a high point. We look at the film knowing that Page will eventually produce all of it and we know the results that its decisions will have? But we are not often shown the effect that they will have on his personal life. She is a woman who did not look back and can inform herself regularly. After all, he was an adult style who became a Christian missionary. This movie is no longer available. It may include the false time of Page requesting hysterically and asking God to forgive him. It can be displayed Page and right for rain, trying to escape the old ghosts and still not recommended. "Betty Notorious Page" explains a simple story and that is a few things for today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite comforting. <br /> <br /> Last View: "Bettie Notorious page" is a relaxing movie with an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Total Rating: 9/10 (A)
