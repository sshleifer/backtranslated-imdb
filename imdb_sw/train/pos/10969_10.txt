I knew about but I've never seen Gray Gardens, before seeing the Broadway music of the same name. Friends warned me that if I didn't see movies, music could not be meaningful. It did, but also helped me to rent a movie. At first, I thought it was a collapse of the train, full of wonderful characters, shrieking, and it was very hard to watch. But be able to stop, dig and go back to make me realize why Gray Gardens are considered as a memorable memory. All Big Edie and Little Edie are not inevitable and their lack of personal awareness is worth witnessing. They both remain good despite their confused age. They have a relationship that will stand for any woman (and of course some of the men) and make you examine your own behavior with your mother. At a time when real television and movies are common, it is amazing to see the work of Mayleses from the past three decades, and to see how the film should be. What do I say other posters have said: They were allowed to enter the pastor as well as their families? But in addition, how can two people living in the 1970s escape the truth in such a perfect way? Or were they just thought to be mad? I would like to strongly recommend this and a commentary, which has given me more insight into the film.
