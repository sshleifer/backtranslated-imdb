I remember seeing this film on the West End in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The location of Dr. Carmus finds the coffin of the farmer, and the body to breathe in, was the worst part of the movie to me, just has grown to the dark film. I was also amazed at people living on trees at the end, until I realized the part of the film that the Blackwood family had been changed from Blackblood, due to the fact that in family history there was a character who was known for many of its various hangings. Mr. Thomas Blackwood appeared to get his kidnapped out of the death caused by his family. I also found that if Foster first enters the entrance to the cemetery, he is careful in identifying a large part of the gate, where he meets the end. I don't want to propose this film to scare the movie lovers.
