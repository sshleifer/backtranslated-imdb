Terrfic film and start a little bit - giving you the opportunity to start cooking. Story creates for interest and controversy. Artists and stories prevent expectations and cliche at all right. New York City's beautiful homes - false, real - is a wonderful drug for the purpose of the "Sex In City" business - in fact, the whole film is a HBO / Hollywood idea of ​​New York City, sex and relationships. It is a small film that takes its characters honestly and compassionately. Love IT! Very great and spectacular performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his love interest (forget his name!).
