It is highly recommended! A well-written, delightful film that will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humor !!! To give, it is good to see the UK's most independent of self-engaging studios with a great studio set up !! Surely the value of adding to any film collection. There are instances in this film that I am sure most people will handle. You will laugh loudly on antics and enjoy the main sounds. I especially enjoyed the Orb Vietnam version of Jimmy Cliff and the London tower to take Freebird. Do not give up.
