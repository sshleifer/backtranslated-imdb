After reading the book, I came to the DVD in Wal-Mart for 3 dollars and ideas, of course, what is hell ... I got a DVD and watched it last night. When I started looking, I looked at the flight time and was about 90 minutes. I thought, OK cool ... It seemed to run slowly, knowing the story and how much it was. When I reached the actual murder, I was like, "How long has this been?" Visited. "One minute? What is hell?" I felt very hateful, thinking that only the movie has gone through a third of the total story. But, I was glad to see that the DVD list of the selection area included part 1 and part 2. it had an hour and a half to go! Then I sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first. I agree that I haven't seen the original 1967 film (despite my desire to retire), I have yet to read novels and felt that this was a natural film, for two TV services, which are. I think waiting for the role of Perry there was quite a mistake and a slight variation to me, but it's still very good. The first half draws a little, while the second half is inserted more. I think they should have the same film as if Capote did his book: 1/3 before the murder, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the killers arrested. Instead, the film makes more than 1/2 before the killings, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after the arrest killers. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, under compelling time to make the first half entertaining and continuing ... Now I look back and realize I have made the same mistake on making things go and going, so I'll tie on hell. Go to watch the film and create your own mind! Nick Houston
