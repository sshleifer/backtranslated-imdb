This is a well-written psychological and well-held game. It's not really flick of fear so those looking for something like Ring or Grudge will be disappointed. What was really amazing about this film was the observation and careful attention in the plot and efforts made to be consistent. I also accepted the absence of Phil Philbababuri or regeneration of New Age. Instead of developing the agenda, filmmakers told the story, they told it well and let the viewer think about it. Few goals reminded them of Wyeth and amazing images with amazing. A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without a large studio, star actors, great name directors (this was better than many Hitchcock films), special effects or "clever" conspiracy spinning.
