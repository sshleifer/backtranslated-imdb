As a long fan of the red Market, I just needed to see the film. It was beautiful! While there may not be enough pictures to live from the Red Sox season of 2004, there were huge shots of my famous football players. When the movie is certainly poultry, it has enough pictures of baseball from an amazing 2004 Red Sox to make one of my top 10 movies at all times. I especially enjoyed the Sox Red fans that were part of Ben's baseball family. The place that Ben meets his friends on a day's draft to decide who will be seated for certain games is hilarious! You must see if you are looking for a good movie to watch with your partner, date, or other important ... especially if you're a fan of baseball ... and even more especially if you're a football fan!
