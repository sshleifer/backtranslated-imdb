This story has never been among my favorites at Christie's work so I was very surprised to enjoy this situation. The motif of the mouse was very effective if it was too small, the skeleton of the story is where the more emphasis is placed on the crime of 'previous crime'. All the pupils were exactly the same as I had thought, but his sympathy was not a global group - maybe three modifications were not allowed for it! I thought some of the worst risks were taken and imitated; maybe her because I have never learned that book but I seem to be obvious to me who the killer was from their appearance in some shots not to show earlier. <br /> <br /> Humor was very prevalent in these Early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I have found a lot of it instead of a heavy piece in this section (although I made a smile on the 'Lemon' line). However, getting into the series though not the best one.
