This film had no places that were hilarious, especially just an average of funny pieces, but it didn't have any bad part. The worst part was the voice of Sid. Its powerful slur was just too much for me. For about 5 minutes I was ill hearing. In addition to the sad voice of sound, the movie was good. There was a lot of joke that will make them make the best movie. This is a good movie for children. It has enough in it to put adult content and enough in it to entertain children. This is certainly worth the rental if you have children and want to watch the movie with them.
