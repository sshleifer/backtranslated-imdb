The original text that this movie has been installed is still one of the many heart books I have ever read. It says the amazing stories of the two sisters, all of whom have volunteered and honored to work well in their 70 years as a teacher and dentist, and then lived 30 years with respect. Ruby Dee stole the film and its performance as a "player" rebel Bessie, a dentist. He not only shows his anger, angst, and wisdom well; He lets you know exactly where they come from using the word economy. Diahnn Carroll feels the older sister, the teacher, the lowest, but I'm afraid she never did believe that she is over 100. No matter - the story is good to appreciate. Amy Madigan is very little and intrusive in acting prone to safe in the first half of the movie as the author of the Caucasian NY Times. This, too, is only limited density. The story, both true, is the attraction and although two or three are destroyed a little in translation, many of them do it in a good way. I recommend a book as a useful reading to all people I recommend to any books for. I can't but the film on this unusual air, but it certainly gets enough scent to be very useful for its right.
