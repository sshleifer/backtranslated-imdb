This is a good movie. The fun thing about looking at money is staggering, especially from the child's perspective. Take for what it is, a small movie of fun about a baby's dream will be true, and what a child can do with 1 million dollars. Don't like it, don't look at it. They make movies for observers, not people who have nothing better to do then complain in their lives.
