This is a unique and bold film. It is powerful, with highly developed characters. Very good displays. I love directors who are not afraid to ask listeners to think ... Bret Carr tries to look into, ask questions, and dig down the face. By the nature of the film, it is usually required that the viewer looks inside too. It can take courage to do so. I can see how some interested people can get this disturbing thing. However, I found it to stimulate thought, more than just entertainment. Bret Carr is a original, professional film manufacturer. I am eager to see what he will do in the future. Look at it.
