This movie is a good way to achieve success. Peter (a boy from Puppet Master III) has grown up and is now a Master of Puppet. Yes, this girl comes to destroy the lids and learn Toulon's secrets but instead hears stories about tablets. Most of this film is a picture from Puppet Master II, Master III, Master Teacher 4, Pastor Teacher 5, Master's Puppet Master, and Retro Teacher Puppy (sorry ... . Of course I want Puppet Master Vs. Demoni Toys will eventually be made but the way this film ends they say basically "This is the last movie in the series ..."
