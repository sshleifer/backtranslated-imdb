This was very popular with my childhood - I can remember to see it on television and exciting every time. Now that I have grown up with my own child, I wanted to take her to this classic film. We watched it last Friday, and she liked it. During the fight with Abu and the giant spider, my son's hand went and took him to mine - he was really afraid. "Will he be able to beat spiders, Poppa?" Just look, you'll see. They do not have a historical record of speaking (eight years old), so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid can also be Oz under Ozma. I think he loved exactly the amount of heroics and derring-do were made by the thief thief, and not the whole king. In fact, if you are building a little film, the king is a sidekick of a thief, not a hero at all - which should be very satisfying for skilled, brave boys. It is definitely a piece of period - I think that when eleven or twelve, my child will get a 'corny' or any next generation will use it at that time. The story of love is one-dimensional difficult - as a stupid friend said, "Why does Ahmad love Princess? Because the story says." The ability of Abu to put himself in danger (from time to time) for clueless, love-struck king has failed to be equal to the impossibility. But to defend themselves on such things is to accept horses of flying plants, fifty strongholds and foot and any Eye Temple that can be so bad. Verified by seeing fulfilled prophecy at the peak of the film is so great, such as the ultimate shot of Abu winning flying off his car (stolen), looking for "fun, and last adventure!"
