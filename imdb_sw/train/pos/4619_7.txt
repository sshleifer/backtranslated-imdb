First, I am a big fan of 80 movies, and Jennifer Conelly too. So yesterday, I went to a local book / movie shop that I found a copy of the VHS. I read back and said good and for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I took home and closed it on VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age now, I am talking more about movies like the End of the Night or the Fire of St.. Elmo, but I still remember how it was 15/16 and in love with an old man, etc.. we are small. And if it doesn't work, we are discouraged and we think we can't get more. But of course we do. Many times. It is that kind of sweet quality that I got from this film. The feeling of "Ooo! I remember when something like that happened to me ..." it is that way. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend to anyone who likes 80 movies, especially young movies, or anyone who wants to go back and remember a simple time in their lives.
