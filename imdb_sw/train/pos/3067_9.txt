What is an amazing treat to reach late television. If I could just read a campaign on the television list before watching the movie, I would like to pass. The idea of ​​a movie about a hit-a-lose-in-a-business-with-a-fall-in-love-voice. But the film works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that man carries a weight on his shoulders, before he even says a word. The appearance and feel of the film is perfect. dark, but not very clear. <br /> <br /> In addition to the hit-hit family feature that gives touch to the surgeon, Macy's behavior is facing his marriage, and his father's control. Macy depicts sadness, and her sleepy conversation with her young son is amazing. The little boy shows the skills of acting better than his years, and the interaction between the father and the child is very common, personal and loving. This is one of the best movies I have seen on time, and I can't believe I got an accident on a nightclub.
