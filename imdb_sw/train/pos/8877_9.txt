This story was one of the most powerful experiences I ever had. John Singleton certainly went up and more while putting together this educational masterpiece. Good performances for all cast, but the Epps and Rapaport turned into the most beautiful and most interesting work of a small star. However, as a college student himself, many things that Singleton toured are severely taken. For, when they are issues facing many college museums, they are not presented as large or outright if this film could believe one. In some cases, almost seemed to be ridiculous to think that something of this nature could happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a little more, the film was brilliant and left me surprised, can't talk, just think. One of the things from this picture I will remember forever, was a quote from the character of Lawrence Fishburn, "Knowledge is power, without skill, you can't see your abilities." Brilliant, brilliant.
