A good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. but the main point as if its films seem to be, the man is the best actor in the id and can turn the dust into gold. nana patekar. this can be its second performance after freezing (others can compete). though other movies are not back. one person who will never give you a desire. The beautiful movie though I think shahrukh was a luxury this film could be made without. you can see in his movies, others are struggling to reach his height and make out of their skin. but this person is something more. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool, music and direction are a good plot but play the screen and dialog again very nice. should look.
