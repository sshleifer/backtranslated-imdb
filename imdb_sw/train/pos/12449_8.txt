Finally there was a good movie of Blaise's Glory, which not only describes the story, but actually says the "true" story. I agree that it's a bad movie if you expect an exciting action, but if you stand on your song and remove all your expectations. Then you will see that it is a story that comes closer to the original by Peter O'Donnell. You have just a story story to tell about how gentle you were a good person he is. It's not an interesting movie for new fans, but the movies told a real story. Other things can be better, but when you can't forget the bad film from '66 then this is a very good movie. So you are a fan then sit down to relax and just enjoy that real story is there and just the story of the cover so you can tell her story.
