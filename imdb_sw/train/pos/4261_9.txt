I loved this film. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is in all German movies that count. But also because he is not the main actor. Leadership is taken by Barnaby Metschurat, who is the only reason for looking at Julietta's 2001, and who carries this movie on his shoulders. The family goes from Italy to Germany to search for "German dreams" (this is my own invention and surprising ...) of cheap work in the steel and coal industries. However, they opens to open a restaurant and a trip to the movie takes up this point alone is poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point on, the story told is mainly of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream that the filmmaker is threatened by an opponent and his brother and his mother's decision to return to Italy. The following is great - and not quite - see how life can be created by the choice you make. In the end, this film does not say what life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or complete or more interesting. It only gives us a satisfactory view of why it should be like looking for identity when two countries and minds are involved. and this look is not driven by bitterness or refusal of any country, which makes the same film for each country and tackles the migration caused by migration. The fact that director Fatih Akin migrated to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also gives this credit to his high level of loyalty and emotional accuracy. Icing on the cake is a wonderful exhibition for the whole cast, especially Metschurat and - this I need to emphasize - a little boy playing Gigi. The child's performance will be a difficult act to follow with anyone! Great movie, go see it.
