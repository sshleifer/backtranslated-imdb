This is what I will call "Pre-Fi Fi, Sci Fi" movie. It is not better than Lugosi / Karloff in this picture of a very strange motion. These two true artists are very good, as well as the story line. Karloff does an amazing job as a scientist who is found to be found in fraud, pride, and scientific competition. I had the idea of ​​looking at someone as he came to himself in three concepts mentioned earlier. I was sad and at the same time fascinated by two stars as they do themselves. <br /> This is a type of motion motion request for remake. This time put Harrison Ford on the part of Karloff and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as the role of Bela Lagosi. It is possible to do it almost entirely. This is one of the best that Hollywood EVER produced. As I said ... is not available. No.
