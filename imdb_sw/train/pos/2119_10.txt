"Shop next to the corner" is one of the best films from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to James Stewart's talent and Margaret Sullavan, it has been filled with a shocking shock of high actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. It is the kind of actors that Hollywood is no longer worth. In fact, the film itself is a kind of film that Hollywood does no longer. (The creators of "Let Letter" say their film to be remake, but that is not just something but a lot of interest.) However, if you have a romantic comedies of the 1940s, you will find "Shop next to the corner" to be something very strange. It is similar to the feedback. Enjoy!
