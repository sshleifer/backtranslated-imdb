William Powell is a Philo Vance in the "Criminal Investigation of the Kennel," the 1933 film by Maria Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. The dog publisher Philo entered into his Scottish Captain's Captain Terrier serves as the secret of the locked room and many suspects. Secret is very clever and denouement is hard and interesting. Since talkies are still very young, the function of the camera is a little static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job leading step. The best help is the best; The whole cast brings the film on laughter. Many of the actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played more (five times) and is better for the role - very relaxed but great at the same time. This was done before the "Black Man" made him more tolerant - he had taken 12 years in the film at the time, starting his career in 1912 at the age of 20. A wonderful man, the presence of screens and an amazing actress We are very fortunate to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Criminal Case" is a good story with an enjoyable film - don't waste it.
