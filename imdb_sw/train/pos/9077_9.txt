I enjoyed the pilote, it was wonderful as I expected it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a shock, though for the first time I thought I would not stand up to his behavior. He and Megy Prices had quite a little chemistry, but hope as the season continues to get more comfortable each other. It must be difficult for Megyn to go from being the star on her last show ["Defending For Life"] to be a co-star. Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem to be new to the whole of Sitcom, but I think for a while they will be better. David Spade's behavior, to my surprise, is not the goal of this test. The way to give his line is different from anyone else I have seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It serves him. <br /> <br /> I think that a couple, or even special, will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and be sure about your decisions, which this show is on. All the situations in which the characters are put in a sense of real life, not as sugar as they show more. I hope that all actors do CBS give them opportunities. This display has the potential to be one of the best series, if only given the opportunity and time.
