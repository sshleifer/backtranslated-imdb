Panda and the devil, such as Ang Lee's future Brokeback Mountain, is a film of historical and historical significance. Film lovers should see it twice as much as its artistic nuance deserves more to understand. <br /> <br /> The full piece of art, the amazing depth of humanity. I don't remember the other film war, it will collect, it will change your existing history of politics and politics, it will return your faith in humanity. After seeing a lot of killings, so many sufferings, you feel yourself, but sponsor the relationship between humans more. The performers' performances offend your heart, music gives your thoughts. Some stems, not just images, themselves change themselves, become a vision of the spirit. That's the real meaning of the film to be a kind of art. Movies like this does not need long-term comments or comments, everything that says only. Ovation for cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, a musician and music composer, is a success!
