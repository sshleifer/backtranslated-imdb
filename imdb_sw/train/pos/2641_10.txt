Green eyes are a good movie. In today's state of helping our soldiers, it is interesting this movie showed a lack of respect to the soldiers received by doing their work, this time. From a historical perspective, the end of the Vietnam War left us all with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this film, and deserved the qualities that he got from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I don't understand why this film doesn't show too often, or at all. This movie is a kind of movie that should be displayed on TV each year, as well as the wizard of Oz. One volunteer for his lost child is moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was glad to know him. Rocky
