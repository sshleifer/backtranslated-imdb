I saw this film first on the cable nearly 5 years ago and I couldn't stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed like click, story, characters, settings. In addition to the film I am worried I don't call this great movie but why it should be a wonderful one. It gets its meaning around. Sent is probably good if anyone puts it on a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not seen, I will give you a brief description: Four criminals have met in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend on a heist bank. However, when their friend was arrested by two soldiers who drove him from New Jersey, they are trying to figure out what is going on and all hell will disappear. The film is a great player of the bank and resembles the poor eleventh edition of the Sea, only four criminals who cannot stand, and in Montana instead of Las Vegas. All of them like to laugh will encourage you to see this film.
