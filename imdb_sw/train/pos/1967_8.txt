I do not understand why this film is very bad, unless I am away from my rock. I found that the patient, brilliant, misleading, and modern psychology. You can't get into the psychopath's mental intelligence in Hollywood film than this. It has buttons within the layers, the proportions made by stone, and the plot that will insist you even after you finish. People need to find the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and that Michael Douglas is not here. I predict that this film will hit the biggest on DVD once people will see themselves and stop attention to the professional drivel release of the drivel. Give a shot, you can have fun!
