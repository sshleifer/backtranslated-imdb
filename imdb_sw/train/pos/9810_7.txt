Albuquerque is a film that has all the components of the western class, except one: the story, which is actually a class B or C. That was accepted when the film was made, when people were very happy to see west of the color, but these days it looks just an old . However, for people who are enjoying the West, it is an entertainment, original color and sound stored in a recent DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good string, Chaney Lon is meant as always, and Randolph Scott is more happy than usual. In the film Albuquerque you hope to see something that can remind you of the city, but the city shown here can be anywhere.
