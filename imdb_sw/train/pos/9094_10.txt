I saw this free film when it was Philadelphia and it was a good surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so interesting was that it was the basis of a true-story story! It has other character actors in it too. The Minds Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved him in Austin's strength. Howard Hesseman is also strong. I remember from the Chief of the Class. I am tired of all the dark dark movies that keep getting. This is fun and light, and I can look at it with my family and not be embarrassed. I keep looking to see when it comes out of the DVD. I will surely buy it.
