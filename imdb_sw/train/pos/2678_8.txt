Hey now, I can't claim to see all of Jesse's videos (Jesus) Franco, and there certainly seems to be many of them, but this is one of the best (and amazing) lots of votes I have. I would like to say most likely he was behind seventy years / seventy years earlier and anything was soon a bit strange to me, and it takes a lot for me to announce it. Otherwise, this is like one of the worst dreams that its parts seem to fulfill in various points. This woman is a film actor or something, does in a sports stadium in Berlin where the "artificial torture" takes place in a delightful audience (?!) And seems to have this problem by germination. Acquiring what is real and what is not in this movie is definitely true things are a bright outlook and the objects of dreams are not. He appears to be in the form of a vice. I won't say this makes a lot of mind but it's good wild and weird and entertainment. Berlin's call makes it the only and most bitter place, so it increases the atmosphere. The end is very sudden, though the film has ceased and the tape became black, I think there is no need to let you know that it has arrived at that time. My text came from the Euro-Trash collection of Anchor Bay, and saying, give me more than a Euro-Trash, I can't find that enough. But it decorate well.
