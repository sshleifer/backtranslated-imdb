Many viewers have done something to remember that Pinjar is not like the film produced in the sound. Although this is true, sound films are generally targeted by special audiences and should be counted for completing their goals in this regard. However, Pinjar is the best film for those looking for a change from a typical sound film. Putting time between India and Pakistan, Pinjar considers a Punjabi girl who becomes a victim of social and cultural perspective on women's treatment at the time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between life and someone who has captured him with a temporary hope of life with his family back to Indian domination Punjab. Beyond the issue of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar addresses and defines the role of a woman as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike the common sound films in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes its audience reflect these issues during and after the film.
