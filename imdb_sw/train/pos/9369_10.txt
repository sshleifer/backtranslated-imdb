This movie is evidence that the film film is a durable style, and is worthy of a very survival. For me, he is the best example of film films from Chinatown. <br /> <br /> It will, unfortunately, never get recognized as well. It has never been promoted well when it was first released and had to create the image of fans through venues like Vanguard Cinema and rental rental terms. I recommend very much that people are looking for something more than unintelligent entertainment to rent this movie and delete it in its destructive plot.
