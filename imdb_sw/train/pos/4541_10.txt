I saw this film on the cable, it was true, from the police chief of the homosexual murder to the rough youth, jay leno and mr tags from the star of the baby's karate in this beautiful comedy about the car's model part. I compare this film with "RUSH HOUR" which the local warriors should cooperate with the local police officer to resolve the case. Expulsion through the farmers' market in the city of detroit brings memories. A fun, beautiful script, I give 10/10.
