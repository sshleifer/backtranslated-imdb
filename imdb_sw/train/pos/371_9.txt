I remember when the film went up for the Academy of the Academy and did not win in any category. For my life, I cannot remember what was against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg described the film did not convince you. In fact, it's about experiments with the suffering of a black woman while climbing from girl to woman. There are many things that are troubling and horrible, but they all need to see how this woman has endured. Along the way, we see other women who have to stick to their problems and walk with them for redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives its best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should also be found at least the nomination for his role in this film. And the most beautiful part of this film is that it takes its lessons to humanity, not like some freak sideshow shows as soon "Lovers" made. I encourage anyone of any color to see this film. 9/10
