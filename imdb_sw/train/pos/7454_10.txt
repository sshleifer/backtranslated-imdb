** Warning - this post may have heroes ** <br /> <br /> I just got Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought was James Bond, Agent Under Fire and Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I planned to get was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me it was better than two games I had. I say, he was right. I bought this for the HMV owner, and when I got home, I inserted it into my Cube and played for hours to the end. It was better than two other games, and there was more beautiful and more interesting stories. Graphics were some of the best I saw (but now being XBOX 360 out of, Farms Instant Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The story of the story was cunning; The male (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful woman (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, must destroy the train. The worst thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya boobs. Then you should avoid their plans and save the world. The biggest thing about this game is that they actually have characters that show characters, such as Cleese giving Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them are very long and cunning. Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sounds - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> I offer this game total of 90%
