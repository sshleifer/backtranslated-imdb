Okay, so the soldiers are not deep and meaningful as a refugee of Blade or as a big budget like Terminator 2 but generally I've enjoyed a lot. The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character is not speaking and being almost without emotionally made when his humanity broke through more poignant. I saw his beatings in an emotionally tense touch than Arnie in T-films (and before I received a comment I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was a human but the foundation laid by all the films was the same) The film itself, the wisdom of the US / Brit could make this story a little. Not really like Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so he couldn't decide whether I liked them or not. The colonialism was not true or a cult of love of peace / loss / fear that is not sought from getting to a group of stupid oppressors when it comes out of anxiety and lovers. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and different from other views I don't feel this will have a negative impact on his work (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has actually done his late father for fun to continue the Sci-Fi family of honor. And all others helped the body out of this skeptical band that makes a bad situation and not doing very badly. Seeing this on your TV schedule will recommend giving you a chance. I don't think you will be discouraged.
