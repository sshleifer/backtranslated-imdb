In Iran, women are not accepted in football games. The right is because they should avoid the language of the male character. But it's really about sex. Women are the lowest form of humanity. Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the field using different methods. They are found by the soldiers and hold the form of the castle, until the police come and take them. Even though bad conditions, this is a great humorous film. It also encourages you to see how people always find different ways to fight oppression. You get touched at the same time if you have lots of lots. Good work with Jafar Panahi director. This is in many ways comedy hero.
