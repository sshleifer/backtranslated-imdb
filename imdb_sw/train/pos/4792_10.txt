Accurate Stories is a multilevel examination of goodness and beauty of America. For one level slowly walk through the heartland, it is a good native, and a grain of amber, at another level on the old growing and remembering it is important (and fully forget what not). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that a lot can say quietly. A wonderful movie that will rest gently for the future.
