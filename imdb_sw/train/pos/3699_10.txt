"Who likes the sun" uses its way through the head-to-face issues and wit and the grace to keep the story not only to share, but often love it. It's been a while since I got a very, very interesting film. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful, drawing an eye with beautiful landscapes and a quiet theme. The image of peace varies with surprises and tension between the most serious, very guilty, and still very popular. Because of the best gave five players all are interesting and wonderful. I recommend "Who Likes the Sun." It is a really exciting movie that takes a poignant look on the pain that we can sue on each other, and the amazing hard process but equal to the payment of forgiveness.
