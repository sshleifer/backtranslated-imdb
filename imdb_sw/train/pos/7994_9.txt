I loved this film. it's dark, not bullet-dodging, car-run numb your movie action action. The most natural nature and motivation is vague, leaving the viewer to reach their own conclusions. it is advisable to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to create their imagination. At the end, motivated by love or revenge, or the desire to repent - does what he feels is "right". 'What! will God forgive us for what we have done? ' - not dead people can answer - so he does what he feels what he is doing, what motivates him, what he has been taught to do. Denzel washington is a good actor - honestly can't think of one bad movie he did - and he has great help to be used. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone.
