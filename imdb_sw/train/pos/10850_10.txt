What a good movie! Finally the picture reveals the unknown side of the rock: the illusion of popularity. The famous victims are old and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. What? Have you ever played on Bill Haley Rock? <br /> <br /> Still, Crazy is still the best movie on rock and spirit I have seen. They are still much better than the Spinal Ring for example. Why? Because at Still Crazy, people are mature. They have different views about rock, about love and about life. They want to capture their young men who are in need. Beyond the story itself, we see characters and their personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. Use the best time to watch this (listen to the amazing sounds!) and finally think of your own future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
