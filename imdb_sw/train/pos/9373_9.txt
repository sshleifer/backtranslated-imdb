If most of you are a big fan of real thing - 1940 movies - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us long ago. The word 'noo-noir' has often been misused in the last decade that has lost its meaning and its effects. On the other hand, John Dahl's film should be done as it is. Composing is perfect round and would have a home feeling for Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The program is very tight that you are restricted within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have accepted it. Most modern movies leave me to ask why they do not do it as they used, and I am not even old. Movies like Red Rock West give us a future hope when we pay taxes in the past.
