One of the ten best artists ever <br /> <br /> This looks comedy so happy and light that you sing. The Comedy of Keaton is _innerly, equally, ordered to mind, thought. Surprisingly, surprisingly, for the purpose and for innovation, the three stages must have a draft of the top fighters if I photographed one. The story of love three times would be good for the audience; I want to bring here this technique? Keaton's Comedy is like a Lang's DESTINY player ?? or or REBOURS. And the couple crossing the time and time of stone stone, in Rome and at Keaton? In the land of Mohammed, in the Italian Renaissance and in China. The device works in both movies, one, bad, eerie melodrama; - another, brightness, very powerful. For Keaton it is primarily a marriage; and maybe it's similar to Lang. A child who loved all Buster and Beery is good. I have had three well-written and wise years, without modern knowledge; The plot is essentially very POPEYE? if the child is a piece of furniture, only the boys are two boys? Keaton and Beery. Keaton's movie looks just so beautiful, and maybe the person being tempted to prove this looks like a proud pride? but not, but it's great fun, great joy, great joy. And Wallace Beery makes good nemesis.
