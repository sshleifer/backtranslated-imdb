This is the best movie. As a Canadian who grew up with rural life many of these are common, cold, canoeing, traps, hunting and so on. It is easy to take skills for the position but after watching this film a few times it has increased to me. Gray / Owl's story is widely known for most Canadian creditors for Attenborough director and photo author Nicholson for expanding stories. <br /> <br /> Brosnan shows good man hard, very good performance. Annie Galipeau is good at her first great role. The rest of the cast is solid.
