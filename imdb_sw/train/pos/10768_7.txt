I saw these years ago when I was young and I could not remember the title, until one day I was hitting through the film's John Candy films on the IMDb and I saw the name insertion "Once Crime ...". Something that banned the bell and played it, and after reading the summary of the plot brought many memories. <br /> <br /> I've found a very good age with the fact that it's not for anyone means "big comedy". It is, however, enjoyable and beautiful on the Hitchcock form of inappropriate and exciting identity around the world <br /> <br /> The movie has great big characters, among them a couple of American who get a female dog during a holiday in Europe and decided to bring him back for a prize - just get his body on arrival. From there the plot finds a crazier and silly and may run after the police think it is killers. <br /> <br /> Type of mix between "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a lightweight Hitchcock feature, this was led by Eugene Levy and was able to find some of his good friends - such as John Candy - for stars in it. The movie is more involved because of its cast, and ends it has a little funny twist which is not quite unpredictable but also a kind of unexpected.
