I do not have a lot of expert about acting or film information, but this film is very beat me. I don't think I'll ever forget. One particular part (I think anyone who has seen a movie will know who I am saying) is published on my brain. I also looked at the same 4-ever film (as previously known by the user). It was also very moving, but it is not exactly the same as to the point of cruelty. If you are interested in, or bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (the Angel of the Sun) can stay with you forever. This is a very difficult thing, but I think, No, I hope the film succeeds in bringing more attention. <br /> <br /> Many people need to see this film !!!!!!
