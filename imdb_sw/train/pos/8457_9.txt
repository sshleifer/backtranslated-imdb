The Gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime. Moving a little forward (especially around the center of the series), but on all enjoyable. Now before anyone jumps over my case and calls me "winger", I will admit that I have watched all of the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the MS Team of 08, and Gundam SEED. I will admit that there were fewer problems and stories to tell and a few characters could be seen as "sanctions" (ie Zechs Marquise on Gardam's original Gardam's), but this is another world to show according to the series The original, if it is SEED. If you would like to watch this series, make sure you look at the first Gundam first, and then know that you are watching the AU series.
