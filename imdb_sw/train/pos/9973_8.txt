I really liked this version of 'Break the Point' contrary to the 1971 edition. If I can rise in the middle of the movie a few times (as I did with the 1971 version) than I, it's not all good. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine during the 1971 issue. However, I have seen many remake, where I have loved the original and the oldest. I discovered that the 1997 edition of the version was more understandable and it was essentially a true fact without undermining the meaning of the 1971 edition.
