I must say that I wanted to see this film for a long time, and I have not been discouraged. Dominic Monaghan acting is just amazing. As part of the insomniac of myself, I can relate to how the story continues. I've never seen anything but some kind of eyes interfere with sleep and can be scary. It was a good film, worth every penny. I hope that one day I can work with Tess myself, it will be more dignified. I can recommend to everyone. Maybe not small children as they can be afraid. But if you are insomniac like me, you will understand the world, secret and fear. You will love it. F. />
