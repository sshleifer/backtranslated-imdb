This film was not developed here in Greece, although it had good actors, a beautiful script and a very beautiful picture was not a movie called "blockbuster" in My Country. The movie itself is so powerful, it's about the hardest time that the visitor had to return to his home after the opening of the prison of 5yo (medicine). beautiful and very sexy in a wonderful way and really Hatitsavvas is at the same time close to beauty ... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make that feeling!
