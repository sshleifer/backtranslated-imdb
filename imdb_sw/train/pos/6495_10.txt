The entire series is over 20 long periods, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a writer and says a wonderful story of war.

You must look at this at some point, even if it is a few events, even though you will continue to be beaten with this effect of the text means for those who were there they suffered and died in the name of war, in the world of war.
