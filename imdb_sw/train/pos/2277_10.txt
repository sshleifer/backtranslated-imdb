Although the film feels long at times, it is very appropriate. Gordon leads the style that reminds you of styles of writing Vonneguts. The respectful, thoughtful, amazing, wonderful, and dark, this is a film that will sit with you for a long time, asking for answers to the impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman, and Arkin are all wonderful. Sheryl Lee is also amazing, in the role that will remind us of Lynch's fans of Laura / Maddy's days. Don't miss this!
