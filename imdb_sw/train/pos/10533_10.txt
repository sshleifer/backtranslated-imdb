I strongly agree that "No" is a wonderful film! I am not too proud to watch movies for many years! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are amazing in this! they work well together! This film cannot appeal to other people (I can't say why without damaging it!) But each of you! I liked it and recommended it! <br /> <br /> Lead is great and some shots are very clever. It looks like they could have much fun during photography! Although there are only 2 characters in the film and not a lot of money administrators can manage and make the film enjoy watching.
