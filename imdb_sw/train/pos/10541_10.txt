I thought this was an amazing movie. The theme of the theme is sweet! :) However, the only thing that was so disturbing was that I was beginning, when everything should be normal. It was very strange and untrue. A large cable company is exactly what I'm talking about. In addition to this, the film was very creative. I think that all acting was well done, executives did their effectiveness. Everything works well. In fact it is a shame that they are not sounding sounds. That would be good! Because this is a Canadian film, and because it is one of my favorites, I give them 10 of 10!
