Distressed by the mystery, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) looks at redemption by changing the lives of seven people who do not know. Once his plan is set, nothing will stop him. At least she thinks. But Ben had no plans to fall in love with one of these people and he was the one who would finish making him. Will Smith will come back with Director Gabriele Muccino, after the movie's movie "Pursuit of Happiness". "The second seven" is another life-changing lifestyle of the film, which not only reminds them of their previous cooperation, tears, but encourages you with joy at the end. Will Smith, also a producer and some others. These movies are real, which show the life of an ordinary person & his struggle through life. The seven pieces may have time to get the real necessity, but after half an hour of the movie, all the movies are installed to control your heart. Also, this film has other changes around it, which enables viewers to keep considering. Director Gabriele Muccino is once again a winner in all the way, with his emotional still inspiring message. He makes all the characters of a very real movie, that people will certainly find themselves in a certain part of the movie. With the director, Will Smith is still another winner, with his great skill to act. Once again, the duo's director and actor acts as a charm. Also, there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part very well. Rosario Dawson, beauty and intelligence, so can be called. He looks good and does his part very well. Barry Pepper, offers great support to the movie & Woody Harrelson to do so, though Woody did not have time-time screens (it would have been nice if you had more). You can not forget this film easily. Watch this film and change your life. Top class movies!
