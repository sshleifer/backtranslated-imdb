Joel schumacher Made a heck of choice when he decided on this cast with this script. The story is well written and well-installed, and all this new 10 or 12 characters in the middle was quite brilliant. It seemed that there are 6 "leads" and almost half of the help, and now this is the best thing about film, new faces for tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood has touched the controversial films of the vietnam war, which says something to the "story that needs to be told" (as described by the schumacher) and the Tigerland countries during the same period of films. However it can not be called a war of war because it seemed to be the most fundamental of the human spirit of Bozz and others. I think anyone who just wants to see a good film and out of a special FX, but just a beautiful, digi-based act should go to see Tigerland, open Shumachers Best work in the last 8 years.
