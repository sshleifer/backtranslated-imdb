High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel say the fight against their classmates and arrange a terrible attack on their high school. When they start the deaths for their act of revenge, the two begins the diary of the video to express their feelings and memories of their messages. <br /> <br /> There is another movie like this, called "Elephant." Why do I bring this up? To compare two films, of course. I must say, although I loved "Elephant," this is the best film. What is the difference, you ask? In fact, for the first time, this is closed differently, largely on the line of "Cloverfield," "Blair's Wizard Project," and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the movie better because it is more realistic. <br /> <br /> But what won me is how the movie was ready to show "the other side of the story." You know these two callers, unlike "Elephant." I really cared for one of the gunmen and I can understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie really makes you feel compassion for these people and that's a good thing because it's not black and white always. <br /> <br /> Be honest, that's why I almost cried in this film. The characters are real and logical and the reasons for their actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people with caution. In general, this film is emotional and very offensive and better than "Elephant."
