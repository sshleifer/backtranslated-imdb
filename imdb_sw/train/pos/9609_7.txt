This was a very good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a good look at the bulimation and how it was not about the diet of food, it was about having a lot of pain so that they could find a way to cope with it and choose this. Beth was a very precise character and in the area where he tells his mother about an eating disorder you can see the pain in her and hear her voice and you know how much pain affects. Also I think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth explains the words, "It's not up to you." to his mother. The words were true and they were greatly enlarged in the film. I think that the area is definitely an important area in the same movie.
