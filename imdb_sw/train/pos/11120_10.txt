Wow. I loved the whole series, and I was surprised by the views of people who thought it was gone. It may be a little while during the 4 and 5 seasons, it was better than anything else on the TV. But 6 and exactly 6b were good permits on the landscapes made in the first muscles of the first muscles. It started with the same kind of silence and Janice often has a great understanding in a non-line family with a penalty about knowing Tony's horn to stay and watch. Anyone who missed the result of this entire series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort on the diagnosis of psychiatric illness and memory of the self-deception of animal and animal animals goes back to the first events of the series, say, and Tony's attack on ducks leaving the beach and joining and "bye" line for his grandchildren before fighting the grace of the last period (not going to the darkest humor of the Chase) <br /> <br /> I would like to continue, but I will only add that I thought the last festival - starting and the opening problems of Vanilla Fudge to provide shade shade ("Keep Keep Hangin 'On") at the end when Tony appears again to complain with his family to the toe or blast such as AJ's SUV or Phil's head were, completely, totally PERFECT . The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Good nice animals in the animal produces "jack-off fantasies" AJ says (and then within which he once subsidized). Pig tip of the pig to Mr. Chase.
