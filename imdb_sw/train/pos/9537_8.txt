Others may feel that the rating I was given is just kind, but why this film I think the directors have done a good job and that they got it, this is also a movie that is a delicious film! My fast thought was a direct relationship with the tribal films 'The Thing' ie political aliens from the outside space, which affects the human army as judge whenever possible! You can see how this film honors the film and some of the kind of fear / gore, however discreetly continues its own nature, well these things fight with one and then continue to eat then the fallen opponent! Just kill and pick up a man when it needs a new army! So take another battle with another infected host! And this film even gives us a story of love but I can't say it again or it gives away too far. <br /> <br /> GREEN! But as I said about the taste found, so don't be surprised if you do not like the film. It is the lowest budget and is the thirst for blood, and the organisms / objects that strike their organs within unethical weapons, crop titles, pipes, pieces and even abnormal guns for all but eliminates the opponent. I found myself cringing for what I was shown but at the same time glued on the screens wondering what is happening next! So if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a bit of love thrown somewhere, then you must recommend this film as you should see. I just want to come this early and I did it!
