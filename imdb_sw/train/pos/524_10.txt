I saw these years of films on a television night. Then it went to the head of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young man, I remember that I am so fascinated by stories and I am surprised by the results of the court case (those who have seen me know I am talking about). Such ideas! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is the same on top and great classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone and Wind. This movie has been widely counted by IMDB voters and certainly more than 51% voters voted 10 out of 10; more than 84% were 8 or more than ten. I was surprised that it was not listed in over 250 films until I found that few have seen / tested this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this film is opened on DVD to 1 Region (North America), so 1), I can buy it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
