I recently lost this doc, I remembered hearing it from IMDb.com and admiring the premise. I knew very little about one of these bands, but I remember hearing "It's not like You were the end of the world junk" and the years of Dandy Warhols ago and enjoy. What it said, this is my view on the doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found amazing about this film is no need to have any pre-optimal skills of those bands. The Director (Ondi Timoner) loses time to engage the audience and inform people in this film. I fell very fast for both Anton and Courtney with their band, Brian Jonestown Disasters and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of what makes this doc good, and what makes Ondi Timoner like a text document. <br /> <br /> I also liked how the "story" of these band was told. More than what you see is a band on tour. Both pieces come from playing small squares and they are trying to do so in the recording sector. In this film, each band strives to remain unique and unregulated and unusual. However this is what makes the two bands look the same, and so the brilliant view of how the two feather bands can go differently. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this to anyone who likes the film as a whole. You don't need to have some love for a document, or one of the bands. Appreciation for music helps, but music itself takes care of the relationship of love / hatred between the murder of Brian Jonestown and The Dandy Warhols.
