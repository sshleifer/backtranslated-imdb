The story is simple, and the anti-new and new themes are brought to the amazing in the first events. This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it was not of good characters and actors showing them. Older Elder, Teacher Liu, is a link to China's expansion days before. He runs the bathroom in the old neighborhood. Every single place placed in the swimming pool is a source of jelaousy for us who insisted out, unhappy people. Even worrying concerns can find any mistakes in this beautiful environment. Son of Master Liu's mind who had a disability Er Ming is the second of the real character in the movie, with his modern brother. The interaction between these three people, and the different visitors at the bathroom, is very strange and the heart feel, and some of the most incredible events are more than everything seen on movies. It is not only taken, but also released a little coverage. It may be unfortunate, but when the movie of this caliber is impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can not help find doubt. So enjoy the free speech and film world, buy, rent, copy this amazing film, and if you happen to have a DVD, if there is one, then share it!
