I saw this film tonight in NYC on Sunshine Land. I didn't know what to expect, I couldn't read much about it as I knew I would see no matter what. All in All, it's very good. He does not consider producing the words of "Warfare War", which to me, left politics out of it. The soldiers mentioned on their understanding of poisoning in their training in the boot camp, and how hard they returned to civil life. It was very good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia telling them the problem of living is not just a war, but to reject the return command when it did not resist personal values. Do not make a mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says it does not see or live with war scars in their souls.
