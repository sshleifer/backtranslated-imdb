This film was very good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but this is a movie made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. it is brought by talented actors and sports awareness. The plan was trusted, and I love the message. William Dear and the boys have made great movies. Most games of games run around real stories or events, and often do not work properly. But this film blows 10 on the level of accuracy, although there were minor mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
