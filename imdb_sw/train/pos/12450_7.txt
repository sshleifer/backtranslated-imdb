Found and watched this short work (<90 minutes). It is for the best treatment. Character, and we who love him, are kept in honor. The Spiegel direction was the best he has done so far, and the cast was very good. Alexandra Staden is almost entirely physically like the match of Jim Holdaway's original models. Find out for anyone who dismisses it! Raymond Cruz as Rafael Garcia was also the best. I hope that Tarantino & cooperation. will continue to do more in the series - I have a great desire to see who would choose that Willie Garvin impossible!
