Actually touch the story of camping jobs in the United States, where young people are ready for Vietnam's war. The human research always calls for me when the issue of the war of the war, because it is a personal interpretation, subjective views on war, as opposed to war action action where action, and technical data are being analyzed by the hatred of human reasons. <br /> <br /> The movie manages to put a new spin on the subject already past, and manages the distance itself from the usual battle movies, and especially considering the fight hero from a glance-point of the traditional standard. The movie faces the odds of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked by a misleading war machine, and refuses to give control over its fate and fight for something he does not believe, uses energy in finding a way to escape sent out, all for of himself and his comrades and the last issue on getting himself just the reason he finally went to war. Perfect nail. <br /> <br /> acting is really unique, and a documentary-style shot around makes you feel transposed in movies. Also the movie will provide food to think for those exhilarated and action in the usual war wars or war games enthusiasts, probably activate some generation ideas that luckily escaped the terrorist's preparedness.
