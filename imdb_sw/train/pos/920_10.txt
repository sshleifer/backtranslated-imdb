This cute animated features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is a boy, a little portly boy from artists who never speak. <br /> <br /> Well here she says she wants to get a puppy from Petty Boop shop, and when she leaves a shop - some hijinks of craft are used. Betty plays a song about pets, Henry fights with birds and monkeys, but everything works at the end.
