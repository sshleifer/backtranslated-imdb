Kolchak is very entertaining. Great stories and cast and nothing else to measure. Darren McGavin gives a powerful performance that attracts viewers with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt provides McGavin a kind of solid support which many leading actors can only dream of having. Some of the best visitors increase color and conscience for individual sessions - Erik Estrada in the Right to Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It is easy to see how a young man looking at Kolchak dismiss Chris Carter to create Files X. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
