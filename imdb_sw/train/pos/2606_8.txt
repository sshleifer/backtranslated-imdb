Maybe other people can focus on this small film. However, it is the same "triggering slow" which allows a very negative viewer. As an amazing first place: first, we can hear the voice; then, we are allowed to see the characters; finally, the camera slows down and side and we see another character, a young man sitting there, of course even hearing a conversation or, at least, not caring for the truth. The fact that this young man will be responsible for leading the film shows: allowing the character to develop and decide with the surrounding environment but not to mention more necessary points. People come and go, comes out of his life. Although many films follow him (and many of the characters who appear to be closer to him, are described in accordance with the affiliated relationship with him), we are believed to believe that we are having a goal, so the trick is touching the director.
