I have seen this film just once about 25 years ago, and even today I have told people probably the best movie that I have ever seen. Considering there was a conversation of words and just thinking the conversation I saw the film being amazing and I even found myself holding my breath so that it didn't make any sound. I would like to restore this film, I would be available on DVD.
