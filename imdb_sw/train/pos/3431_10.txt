It is the best Estonian film I have ever seen, although it is done by the Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a thriller of entertainment about a gang of robbers who are trying to steal large amounts of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a form of summary conditions for many Eastern European countries at the time. In the 90s of the Soviet Union collapsed into pieces and many countries, like Estonia, are independent. Now the situation can be better in many of those countries. But in the early 90s many of these new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as an inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least a certain level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a real-time film with trusted characters and well written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the famous Estonian actors, playing in Solaris of Tarkovski), playing with a young man who is slowly tired through his way of life. But the most amazing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child-playing child Terje, a young boy boy, whose presence is very important. (and its name is not mentioned in the IMDb credit list !!!) W <br /> <br /> There are not many films in the world that can be entertaining and art at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does it. Unfortunately other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of success. His first, Kotia päin was also fake and recent, History is made at night was just a wonderful mess.
