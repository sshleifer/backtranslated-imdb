A good film about three living sisters from Switzerland (often seen riding on the same clothes) who want to return their parents together (apparently mother still carrying the father lighting) - so they continue to go to New York to stop the father marrying a blonde gold-digger calls "Precious" ". The father has never seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) don't seem intelligent and think he is wonderful, and at the same time looks seems to lead a life especially to run with his mother surprise (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see her daughter marrying rich . Sisters find the idea of ​​pushing the value in a Hungarian way, spraying two-digging women into thinking that it is one of the richest Europeans. But an incorrect identification case makes girls think the calculation is very good Ray Milland, who goes along with the program because she has gone down to sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This film is fun, light fare. Barbara Read as Kay comes as sweet and beautiful, Ray Milland looks oh so small and beautiful here (though, unfortunately, it's given a little to do), Alice Brady is very good as a scheming mother - but it's Deanna Durbin, real charmer and cute as a button play a little sister Penny, who pretty much steals show. In a very good voice, he sings several songs on the film, although I would like to see them even more in this. The program in this film is a little silly, but nevertheless, I've got a film to be fun and fun.
