This film is one of those things with me and I never expected anyone else to "get" but I'm glad when I recommend and someone enjoys. My late father loved Arthur Askey but this film was one very happy with his enthusiastic enthusiasm for "Train of the Spirit" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" was transferred to me as a child. Years later, I watch it regularly, enjoy the skills. I am always wondering if it will not be the same but I have not been disappointed in it. There's a lot to enjoy. The sequence on the train has been revealed when Askey and Murdoch continue to convince the passengers of pride. Then the whole section in the center is surprisingly and largely should continue. Yes, it is dated and full of English war time for accents and conspiracy (according to the original play by Arnold Ridley of the popularity of Dad's Legion!) But full of wonderful characteristic displays - including Kathleen Harrison as dotty spinster . The sky is really as close as Arthur Askey's car can get. This is available for cheap as well as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself. It is a perfect morning of Saturday / Sunday or any day of lazy sand leisure. I thank you .... <br /> <br /> INSURANCE IN THE MOVIES!
