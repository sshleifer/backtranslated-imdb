Recently I received this film on TNT five minutes in it, during a vacation in Florida ... (hey there should be a little time at the hotel, right?) I started to wonder to see Melissa Joan Hart at any length of film feature on TNT . I mean "Drive Me Crazy" is not that old, ready? But I continued with that, and I was very surprised and fun. Melissa has her role as Jennifer's best psychotic. Hand-hand (Nick, former ex-boyfriend, Karen, his best friend, and his parents to control life) all added a substantial amount of credibility. The end left was a good closure to this story of a girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, look! <br /> <br />
