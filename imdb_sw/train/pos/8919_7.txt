Who would think "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) and Andy Griffith had movie Steve McQueen in the past? But that's just one of the most amazing and wonderful things on the last young-war-film films, which can be described as good as the Messiah because it meets God and knows what from the outside space. The priests are Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" was hit down slightly), just a good-looking boy just enough to be attractive; The most beautiful girl who doesn't understand is Corsaut Aneta mentioned earlier. It was very bad when their date was broken by the flames of fire, but it was too much during the encounter with gelatinous, the man who eats Who is the world's rider on fire - and begins to walk over the town's fair town and left. But the adults will believe them? Of course not, they know, they are just kids! <br /> <br /> The movie is teeny bopper in connecting him to the best teeny. The actors take a very independent script, and many look at each other, and "adults" who probably use "Children!" The third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of his creation, which is well thought of, has been done well, and is often able to produce an amazing rate of charge. And although it is clear on the cheap side (see those small sets, boys!), BLOB is actually a well-made film - and there is a limited theme of a well-chosen theme. A crowd of 40 people (I am also included) will enjoy the film as proud, but that can't stop them from getting along with all of their milk-and-white females, and the film will be a great choice for a movie or family night. more modern "adults" include. Do a lot of Jello cubes for film snacks! Gary F. Taylor, former GFT, Amazon Reviewer
