I liked this flick when it happened in 80 years and still doing it! I still mention common lines as "say again" and "you said you would like to hit my balls away from the master". Ron Leibman was bright and very funny! Although it was knocked down and rejected by MAD, I must say that this small gem will always be my treasure and movie that I could take with me if it was sent to an abandoned island! I just want someone to get a DVD because my VHS tape has been lost! If you like to stimulate the player, this is obvious to you and should be considered a tribal worship! It's a military humor for the best and worse! Use it if you can't own it!
