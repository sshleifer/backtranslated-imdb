Good film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we see real and real, and how these two can be very difficult to distinguish. He shot well and did, although David Niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his behavior claims to be. Enjoy seeing very little Richard Attenborough. This film made me think, when I was watching, and later.
