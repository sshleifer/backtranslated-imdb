I have read many comments on this site criticizing Blob for being cheesy or a campy. The movie has failed for the effects of amateurish with special effects. Can you expect from a group of people whose experiences have been in small budget production, produced locally (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell the most powerful critics that this film has not found itself all great. The fact should be clear from the music-free music-based music and silly songs played on the opening credit. For what it was, this film is better. I have seen a couple of recent recent budget attempts, Blair Witch's project was one of them, who have no value of entertainment or minded mind behind their plot. BWP was a fresh mix. Blob, on the other hand, was well taken, well taken, and very interesting. The area in which an older man comes to the meteorite and eliminates the inner crowd and the rod was highly effective and is really creepy. The situation in the doctor's office and Blob to slowly move down to the blanket on gurney when paid an old man was a movie of horror masterpiece. Below is, I love this film. I oppose anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00, inflated at the value of the dollar today, and make the film anywhere near or as entertaining or as successful as Blob. It can't just be done. PERIOD! Thank you for taking the time to read these reviews.
