I love so much this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you want more. It makes you think about what is happening in the next period, and the struggle to maintain their friendship for many years. After every time it opens, you choose a sweet taste in your mouth to know that: One - The show was good, you can't wait for the next section and it makes you think about what's happening to friends in twenty years. And two - the fact that the show is installed "on hiatus" and we can't see the finished show in its total. Fox obviously do not know what they did, they say they lose viewers in the category 18 - 49 who do not know what people want to see if they have lost a good show such as "Reunion". I have one question though I would add. If you would show back and continue to another season how would it work since every part done in the past year and the story is based on what happens during twenty years? Your answers are widely accepted. Bring Reunion! Bring Reunion!
