I loved this TV show because it was a private thing for a girl who is her sixteenth birthday that knows she is a witch and she lives with her home and they are also witches. Well this took him over a few weeks of use. When he used his authority for the first time it was very funny because it turned his enemy into pineapple. He had to turn back and repeat the day. This series is very cool and it is a series of young people but it is wearing thin when he came out of his house and on the apartment with his college friends and then it became boring and I stood watching. I loved Valerie and I hated Libby's enemies Librina was bad.
