The title of this film is close to me to look at. Not being a fan of Manchester United, just mentioning Beckham was too far to put it, but I put my hatred back and I'm glad I did. I did not have too many expectations for the film, but I was very surprised. The movie sped with me will never look at me and I enjoyed every second of the film. If you loved East is East then you would like this film. Well the storyline is not something new, and tribal stories are contained in the film but all have been done with great pleasure, and with the breath of fresh air. The film goes very fast and continues to hear the sound. The wonderful times of the time are a good chuckle and not a poor attempt in humor, and the best is a good comedy of the UK.
