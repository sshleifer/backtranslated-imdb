"It was in him" was perhaps one of the three most beautiful films I saw in my life. That did not defeat Oscar, I will not shed tears. This film is in its own class type, that winning Oscar would have prevented them from !!! My friend Anders (Nyberg), you have made real glory and your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation, and everyone contributing, all of you give the love gift to our world. Of the intervention of this world, then leave - you can truly say that you did it well! Individuals are grateful to my spirit for all of you, that you have brought valuable memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my youthful ideas and present existence was made up of a positive influence of Swedish, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessing for all of you.
