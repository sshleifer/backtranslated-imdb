I am away from the Sylvester Stallone fan and I think the only time I loved his appearance was in the French Taxi 3 film, which is a little about the role. However, I must admit that this film was not too bad, though I was scared. When Gabe (Stallone) cannot save a partner of one of his friends and he strikes his death from a height of 4000 mountain top of the mountain, he cannot own his own career as a mountain healer. For nearly a year he does not put food in the reserve, but than he returns. Once they return, they receive an emergency call from a group of fighters who have entered the snow storm. At least, that's how the rangers believe. In fact it is a group of thieves who fell by their plane in the mountains after their evil plan of stealing the full case of money from the flying government of the fly has failed. Events are spread throughout the reserve and they need professional help to take them ... <br /> <br /> That is not one of the most intelligent movies at any time, but in its kind it is fun. I really enjoyed John Lithgow as a bad attitude of the boss and the leader of the gang. I know him well from the TV series "Rock 3 from the Sun", but I enjoyed his performance in this movie too. Generally acting it was the same, it had many steps to give and of course also of one liners, but also provided a very beautiful decor. This movie was done in a beautiful natural environment. I loved mountains and snow hills, mountain streams and forests ... Maybe that's why I give this movie a higher score than what I usually give a movie / action adventure of this kind. I offer 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, this is a fun movie.
