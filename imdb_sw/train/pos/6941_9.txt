The western boundaries of the adults that succeeded in the 1950s try and monitor its nature for the film that removed the disease. In fact, we can return to the Red Howard River (1948) or more by John Darling in Darling Clementine (1946), but if we want to cling to this decade, then it must be one of several films made the first year of that era. One is the "Gun Gun Player," a very bad story of the famous gunslinger (Ringo) who faces his last shot. Another from the same year is "Winchester '73," and it is important to consider that Millard Mitchell looks for both as bad, evil, realistic. In Gunfighter, he is the city of the city which he expected to be arrested Ringo but once he climbed him into a criminal gang. In Winchester, he is a sidekick for Jimmy Stewart, a kind of Horatio for Hamlet Stewart in this epic / awesome story. The plan is sufficient: Stewart's lonesome hunting is winning Winchester's amazing shooting match, beating the most important western man (Stephen McNally), who is his own brother and causing the death of their father. The brother stole guns, Stewart and Mitchell follow him after he is in a cowboy cowboysey who takes them all along the frontier, meeting with criminals and all Indians. (In one wonderful star, two coming stars - Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis - play the Indian leader and the US horsemen - during a well-organized battle. Dan Duryea stole the entire show as a law leader, while Shelly Winters , before we gain weight, it is good for a shaded woman who connects all the plots together.
