It is a good thriller from Turkey that can be meaningful. First, I want to describe on the screen screen. For normal screen playing in most films from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best shots to say "perfect" .And also the transition parts are more beautiful. On the other hand, "Gen" has a great title that influences everyone. In particular, a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist specialist, has a mother who is a common rebellion. The main reason and psychological results are given to Genesis The only thing you have to do is to combine all ideas. There is a fascinating part of the Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar that made it possible.This functionality can be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". The last thing I say is "Look at this movie, you will get confused"
