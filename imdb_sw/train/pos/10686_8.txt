And I am the Nicole Kidman sand. I would like to pay to see him and hear him read the phone book of Moscow, which for all I know, may be doing Russian speaking in this film. All four principals are the best, but the movie itself is a beautiful picture and effective images done with anything. When one is ready to stop unbelief while watching the movie, this asks more than the viewer. It can be very interesting (which is part) or horrible (which is located in one location) but the director was not found to know the way to go.
