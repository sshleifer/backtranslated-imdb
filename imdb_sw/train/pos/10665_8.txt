As a barrier, I saw the film 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just noticed this music this week. This enabled me to judge the movie without dirt and what it was or was not in music (however, it despised me while watching music) :) I really believe Michael Douglas worked very well in that role, with Kasey. I think its 'Let me dance for you' area is one of the best parts of the movie, adding more value compared to music. Players and singing in the movies are much better than music, with a cast which is 10 times greater (easy to do in the course of course). Refusal, lighting, dancing, and singing are also the best in the film, which should be expected, and actually released. <br /> <br /> Songs similar to music are done well in the film, these new ones are very good, and the entire movie offers only more music in my opinion, especially compared to the music you have a few decors. One of the worst ways in the film is a clear reduction among the speakers who are speaking, and they are singing during the singing parts of some of the characters, but their play is not good, and the final product was more enjoyable than music
