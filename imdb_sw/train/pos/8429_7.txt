But even here, in this destruction of the destruction of the lost dreams and no future, which do not work, and to achieve something or someone to seek comfort and collaboration with, a simple act of love, rewards, even if it just now carries with the memory of recovery The old. Even though there is very little in the scourge of screens, this is a strict and brutal film about the sub-dominance of political (private and private) that does not make for easy entertainment. To clear according to play, and the small cast, the greater connection with the social and political environment generally would have helped the film to reach a broad audience.
