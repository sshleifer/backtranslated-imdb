Lion King II: The Pride of the Lion is BY FAR the best player for the video that Disney, or any other studio, has made an animation feature. It was entitled to the release of exhibitions. That can be said for this film. It has an original source, Elton John's songs, hilarious stories, exciting action, and time touch behavior. Everything you expect from this series. It's not a new story, but filling it with an extended background in Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What was very interesting, was the service taken in the animation. All of them often, short of Disney on the quality of their animation video and television effort. But here, they combine new animations and photos from the original film. Events have never been seen out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella join as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame, and Moira Kelly begin their work as Lion, Friend, and Nala, respectively. We even get a return visit with Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as a hyenas.There is a lot to laugh at this movie. So if you love the King Lion, you need this movie.
