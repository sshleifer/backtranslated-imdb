I've been buff Indian movie from the age of 4 but never in my life have watched such a moving movie and effect, especially as the Indian film. In the last few years, I was standing to watch the modern cinema of the Indian and turn to watch professionals (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Dictators, Mama India, Sholay, etc.) But this movie changed everything. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found it not just to be moving but also found to be very educated for someone who is the first generation Indian woman growing in America. It helped me understand my family history, which was always something unknown to me. But, to “see” it, to hear and understand it helped me to feel compassion and generations before me and the struggles that the people of India persevered. The film helped put more things for me, especially in view of current world events. I have never thought that the film could change the way I think like this before ... it did. The plan is wonderful, acting good and worthless. Body thumbs up!
