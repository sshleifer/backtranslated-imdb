The trailer of this movie did not make the film fair. And when the movie didn't know what it really wanted to cross, the first half of the movie being bright, the romantic comedy and the second having more romantic drama, the overall results were better than I thought it was. This film was more than a movie of the date, but the trailer made it more of the excitement that has never been true. Kidman, being one of my favorites, I am really enjoying it, but this film has proved to be lighter, sensitive, if it's a movie that was more suitable. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
