I saw "Brother's Shadow" in Tribeca Film Festival and I found myself thinking two days later. The story of the slick son (Scott Cohen) to return to the furniture furniture furniture of his family after the stint jail, gives all the necessary features of the whole game - characters are not remembered; intense dialogue; The sensitive use of cameras and filmmaker who thinks visually. But more than that, it provides something that is not too common in many days today: a vague vision of mature understanding. Talent's director of director Todd S. Yellin seems to be quite emerging, but we mean he (if the main character) has paid his payment. He knows how real people are struggling in this world, and knows how we long to see - or at least, to gain experience - efficiency. However, Yellin respects his audience with a lot of smoke smoke up to our last end. Finally, we see that Jake's victory does not live in the commission, or even in the respect of his family, but in the "work" that he could not stop if he tried. <br /> <br /> The key theme in the world (and especially the film industry) that cannot lift "on the foundation". This film deserves the audience.
