If you are going to play in the prison walls why don't you go to the top players William Shakespeare? And if you choose your cast from a lot of criminals who serve a long sentence for more serious crimes, you can be sure that there will be plenty of time to practice. At the Correctional Kentucky Corridor's project of confidence as this was done with amazing results. This film shows how it's all done? The practice of setting and dressing and Shakespeare's final play "The Tempest." It did not happen to me before but there is an example between playing and jail correction. In playing the lost characters the ships are locked on the island without contacting the outside world. Prison life is like that. With the backdrop of the seascape around the surroundings, the characters in the most enjoyable dresses line their line for the endorsed viewers, perhaps not as Shakespeare wanted but with a good heart and honest truth. More interesting than playing itself was a little comeos of everyone behind his behavior. One prisoner saw playing as a lesson in forgiving one another as the redemption of his sins. It was quite moving to see people wiping tears when they talked about murder, shooting and destruction. One had the impression that they would all like to rearrange the hour and rethink their actions. However (if someone said) the past passed, and now it was the beginning of a new future. At least the play gave them temporary relief from the deepest thought of past events. The prison authorities should clap to allow the play to happen. The event would put Kentucky on the map and indeed other prisons can follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone stands for the benefit of not just the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves need to find new faith and self-reliance and be ready for the day they leave.
