Well, it's a bit of a silly film, so if you're looking for oscar's performance, forget this ...... but, if you like John Candy's humor, this is a must-see. We lost Candy John before enough of his extraordinary play, and he is the best in one film: Bird, Trains, & Cars (with Steve Martin). Supports excellent performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best job as Sal DiPasquale hot. Also good to act with Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. You must see this anonymous and unpublished film if you are John Candy or Eugene Levy fan.
