I just saw the Prison last night and liked what I saw. It was a cool cool film.Dolph seemed to be very good at Bike. It also appeared well in this film compared to its latest movies. Now it's a very beautiful shape. The story was similar to other actors could also be approved I can't call this excellent film but it's still a good movie. But it also had its part of the Problems. The first thing was the way the bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were expelled from the area they missed the target. They should have shown ppl to shoot the shot in the best way. Another problem was the way the students swore. I do not know in a school where students can swear before their teacher and even in class. The third problem is that bad people were very few in number. There should be many bad people. The last problem was definitely the fact that the set was seen cheesy, but that was due to a small budget. Overall the film was a good Movie. I enjoyed it. P.S. Now DEAD has hit a soldier. (Some of the same liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
