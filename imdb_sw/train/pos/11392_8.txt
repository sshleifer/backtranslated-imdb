Paris is a place to enjoy beautiful art and music, and fall in deception in love - as in this film. The boy meets a girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way of eternal happiness, a classic story. George Gerschwin's amazing music plays with a great play with Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "America in Paris" is a beautiful, light, loving and worth-looking film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
