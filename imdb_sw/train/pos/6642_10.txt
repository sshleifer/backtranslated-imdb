All films made before 1912 are required to be viewed in time and place. In 1894, men of Lumiere's family (father: Antoine (1840-1911), have: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory that made paper and paper dishes. Not a small business; The factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social benefits - creativity at the time. It was in Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere to be interested in building Cinematagraph, in 1894, has yet to be clear with patience. My opinion is that the appearance of the organization of Edison's Edison (peep-show machine), in Paris during the collapse of 1894, provided a recipe. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, of Edison's staff, bought a motion picture camera on the size of a similar piano that had copyright in February 1893. It was used electronically (using power from a heavy storage battery. This great pumped film film film) (planned by the Eastman company) passed the lens in 40 per second (fps). It was solid, like something improbable, in the "Black Maria" (especially the first movie studio). Kinetescope machine showed the displays set (below one minute long) that have been done on this studio. /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere volunteered to create a moving camera. He decided that even during the 16 celluloid film, promotional The human eye / brain will be able to allow the normal course to be understood. His camera, called Cinematograph, was close to the size of a large shoe box and was released by a film that can be stored in A film enough to make a shot once a minute when it was opened the lens on the fps. <br /> <br /> Size and size of the camera, can be converted to a printer or projector by adding a source source that made it possible to can be taken anywhere to record the event (including there was enough sunlight.) In the spring of 1895, Louis was held: riding a boat; a house on fire and men of fire when they come and strengthen a building full of water; and other local events and around Lyon. With the Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a project and presented his films to scientists who gathered in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science. Photos were held on five-meter screens away from the lens. The mirror placed on the door between the two rooms. At a professional photographer, the same year, Louis chose delegates who came in the same evening and showed them pictures of arrival. <br /> <br /> For accolades from all scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of its discoveries at the end of the year. Since each of his films would be one minute long, he would need at least several films to present well. For one of these films he established his camera on the door of his factory, photographing the staff of the time to stop. <br /> <br /> Public section selected by Antoine - who gave himself as a "right barker" for Cinematograph - was India's Indies Grand Cafe at the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris. It was Saturday night on December 28th, 1895. As the first audience was seated, they were presented to the outward appearance of the Lumiere factory (and the doors closed.) Others were afraid they would just see the usual Slide show of Lumiere pictures. But the string on the camera / projector turned out with the movement started. Louis had an innate sense of taking a picture of motion. This movie has a beginning, middle and end. At first, the doors are opened and people start to leave their workplace; in the middle, people come out - and many are trying to ignore the camera, and the camera, because they seem to be happy to leave the day of work after them. At the end, the factory gates are closed. <br /> <br /> And this was the first film planned for public entertainment in general.
