This view is amazing. I thought two events that Paul died were very sad; I really cried. But the other shows was amazing; Kerry was my famous character, because he was "the dark side." I also thought that Bridget was good because she was well. I also thought that the boy playing Kyle was really good. I liked when Kerry made a silent conversation about everything. The boy who played Rory was good, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole TV version is free, and I would still show on TV. when they showed it on television, though, I watched it every time you were. Sometimes it shows, I will watch it regularly.
