Robert Stack never lost the Best Player of the Oscar Assistant for his role as Kyle in "Written on Wind" for the Minutes of Anthony Quinn's "Quest for Life." Ganda has a son of an alcoholic, who was an alcoholic tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of a friend who raised him, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both of them love the woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a slut of alcoholism who likes Mitch. Their story seems to be a glorious color under the good leadership of Douglas Sirk, who actually led the field of melodrama and some of the most amazing films, including "Life of Imitation," "All of Heaven allows," "Good Case, "and many others. br>> <br /> Do not make a mistake - this is a drainage, and Stack and Dorothy Malone are doing a lot of work, Malone winning Oscar's best support. There is one amazing place, which is described in another view, where he plays loudly as his father falls and dies on the staircase. We have been led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including a boy who avoids gas, because he likes Mitch. Mitch did not want anything to do with him. He likes to Lucy that, faithfully to Kyle, wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I am sure he would be concerned about getting there today no matter how much you love. Hudson and Bacall have less exciting roles here - Mitch Hudson is a good husband who has been purifying Kyle causes his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds himself in a dream when her husband starts drinking again after brain year. Sirk focuses on players who are very helpful. In the hands of Sirk, "Written in the Wind" is an effective film, and a large area towards the end in the house is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and though he had many impersonators, he did not have the same.
