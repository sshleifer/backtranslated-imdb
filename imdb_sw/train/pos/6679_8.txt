I only apologize to this film: there is far, far too far, close to the width, and if it stimulates more patience, just enough. They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so. But then I made a kind of truce and horror movies; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased. This is a very rich comedy destroyed easily. It is a hilarious, it is a beauty, a comic of all of the made made of useless, and yet Usher looks more towards its characters in a cool way, the eyes of the fish-HAS are very concerned - can submit to the heat. 'Men's Secret' is, not just funnier, not just clever, but also more, than anyone who seems to have paid credit to that. Jokes in Austin's movies, for example, as well as being less funny than jokes here, is also much more. Satire of 'Horses of Hidden Men' when there is something worthy to cry and blow gently when it does not exist. It is not enough anything of the past. Why, contrary to what others (I must see as unbelievers) the critics said, you have never thought. The 'super' hero is a fascinating group. Indeed, they are the second level, but not just the second level. Blue Rajah, for example, has nothing but throwing it on people, and it's not good there. On the other hand, also not too bad. He is the best in his small farm than most people, and he does hard. He is not buffoon, which makes the character of more funnier as he was. If Superman is Christ in the cape, Men Siri are small in the hills of Mount Olympus, in the capes. Great technician; also much more.
