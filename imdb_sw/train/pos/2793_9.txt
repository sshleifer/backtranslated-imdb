It is a disgrace because of its title this movie will be avoided by people who love soccer. Bend it If Beckham is the most enjoyable flick games. The story line is touching and intelligent without having soppy, joke laughs loud, and the characters are doing well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are as brilliant as young Jess and Jules, putting them in good performances and far away. Anupam Kher is as wonderful as Yess's father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, the worst in Panda and the Devil, 'comes very well with a good man at once, using his beautiful Irish voice! Even if you do not like football, go see this film. If anything makes you smile.
