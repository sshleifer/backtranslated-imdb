Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close did their work honestly, I just cried. Glenn's role as close as Ruth, showed her that she wanted to handle the situation, but was under her husband's rule. "Let's think about what he did," Robert Duvall's behavior, Joe, said quickly. The story showed the rural family dealing with the death of a man and his brother, called "The Stone Boy," meaning he had been so distressed and distressed by what he did, he became emotional paralysis. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, allowing a stranger, I had a strong heart for him, that I really thought some of the bad things I had done in my life. I have identified myself with his character. The duties of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs, did not add much film. I thought Frederick Forrest, who played with Ruth's brother, who opposed the mother, Andy, as a jerk who had nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played with Gail Youngs, made as a woman who beat Arnold close to her frustration with her own uncomfortable problems and accusing her of her problems. I could not feel compassion for these two. Although Lou tried to put his marriage together, he did not succeed. Both of them could not handle their problems effectively. In fact they had nothing for the film and were quite worried. Wilfred Brimley's small role as his father, touching as he is the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his responsibility should be explained. The players were doing just what they felt was enough and enough. However, I loved the last, I screamed and cried with tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so real.
