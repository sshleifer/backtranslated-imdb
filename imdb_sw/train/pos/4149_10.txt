Read some comments on the message boards here I was expecting this film to be a perfect barrier - but when I watched it I can't stop laughing! It's been my new movie of loved ones. <br /> <br /> I don't know what that hate here is over, maybe it's because the movie of this kind has never been quite close. I am losing another female name completely run. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in leadership, but there will be a lot to support male characters. This was almost all women - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and a short appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All traders gave very good performances (especially Missi Pyle) from the quirky and delightful script. The best of this film, to me, seems to be in her feminine message: accept who you are, the feminine achievement in the public sphere, the power of female friendship and breaking gender roles. However, the heart of light though, each of the leading actors face challenges as their experiments to be the 'more fun' crisis and their feminine values ​​and who knew themselves. Missi Pyle suggested that this film has disappeared from the exhibition because of the cast of all the women and the lack of a great actress to get a studio behind it, and agree. Everyone I suggested this film has loved and I think it's a shame that the comedy celebrating the female dorkiness was not widely accepted and succeeded. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or love comedy-centered centered.
