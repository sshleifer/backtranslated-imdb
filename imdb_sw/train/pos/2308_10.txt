I looked at this as an inspiration when passing through a movie shop and you could not be surprised again! Mother and I watched this film together, and we enjoyed it very much. It's not "normal-flick" of the usual story of sappy love and tears all through, but it definitely touches the courage in the last move. It's the end where, though unexpected and sad, the overall impact of the film is not available. I think Reese Witherspoon was a good actor even in this film, its beginning, and this is important to watch! I did not recognize many actors to help, but all play their important roles to help. "A person in the Moon" is a trusted story about a young boy who loves for the first time. Many women can definitely relate to everything - from the words of Witherspoon, his subtle eyes, and his emotions are not subtle (angry as a normal girl). While having a sense of confusion about love, she does not know if silly and child, which was highly appreciated based on many movies today.
