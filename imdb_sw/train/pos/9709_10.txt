I started getting into the Logi crash one night when I had a television: since then, I've never lost part. <br /> <br /> It is a very funny humor, like a cross between the social views of Brass Eye, the best of Show Show one liners, and a wonderful plot that seems to develop every week without going anywhere. The best example of this was the special elements of Hillary Briss - what was it about all? <br /> <br /> Humor will not attract all of them. Others will say it is very sick, and it is easy to see where they come from. However, try. If you don't like it, don't look at it, but if you do it you will be very happy you take my advice.
