I am usually exposed to television movies because of the many ways you know that TV movies have five seconds in the picture. This got my attention because of the common headache and its negative feelings, which was established since the beginning. While the current rains have confirmed my suspicions of non-caused stories (even if they claim to be installed in California, the film was shot near Vancouver, B.C.).
