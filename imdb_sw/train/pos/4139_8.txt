I wonder how this show in U.K. and the rest of Europe. KIWE KIWEKI CAN MAKE IT BE A BODY (especially white Americans). That may be a major cause of some toxicity and vitriol described here on this board. I love to show but it has a reservations and I see that it takes the easy way with Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Denying and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door on any hope of reviving the show unless her behavior flowed through the field in the middle of a field. Who knows? It was funny, raunchy and time, kinda show show.
