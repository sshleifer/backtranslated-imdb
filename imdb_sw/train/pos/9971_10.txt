This film was very good, I thought that one of the original was emotional stability. This however he got all the ingredients, the 1970s Hemi Challenger factory and 4-speed transmission that shows that Mama Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in the chrysler's sky every time Kowalski scored a great Hemi, and he certainly did so much :)
