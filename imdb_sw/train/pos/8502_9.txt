Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to see from time to time. Michael Keaton has been put in charge of the Japanese car company to come to his city and thereby create jobs for Hadleyville residents. What happens after that is one good time after another. Two cultures compete with Keaton to hold things together. See the best performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. They are all fully beat. Do not show the minimum number. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of Hadleyville was also used in the High Day. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
