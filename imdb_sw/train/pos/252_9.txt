The exhibition was very good, the dress made a special feeling for the period and became a historian of Muslims, I was impressed by the accuracy of weapons and attention to detail. I can't say you need any saga skills of Kelly to stay with the flow of this movie but understand the events and perspectives of the time you will need some basic historical knowledge. Don't expect him, like other ignorant people, all the characters have accent Auzzie as we know, it was, at that time, the country during pregnancy. Well, the story was some of the false things but these are needed for a comprehensive filming. Gregor Jordan said in an additional feature on the DVD that he wanted his film to 'promote interest', and that's what happened to me so this film gets toes here. Look at it and you can't have pity
