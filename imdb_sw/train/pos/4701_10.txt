"Roma Troy Moronie" is my opinion on the movie. What else to say? This attitude gives out moron in Moronie. Gangster tough and inability to pronounce inappropriate words, well, it seems that it would hurt to be tough and still can't express himself. The Roman Moronie will come down in the history of the film history as one of the greatest fruits. <br /> <br /> There is good pleasure among other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and also is Joe Piscipo. I just like the fact that Moronie put the movie from the "R" rating because he couldn't pronounce dirt.
