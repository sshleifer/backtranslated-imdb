After working in the city of Manhattan, and I often ate lunch at summer in the garden near the City City, I would like to see the mayor go and go. It was great to be able to go beyond the gates of the City Council and see what it looks like in the lobby and through out of the entire building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03', gave the best performance through the whole picture, and especially when he gave a speech to the African African Church for a young boy killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Jury Runaway", 03, was a dedicated servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to accomplish. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great responsibility to help. Finally, but not the least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played by the master of the group who had a very difficult choice to do towards the end of the picture! Great movies with beautiful pictures and photography in NYC!
