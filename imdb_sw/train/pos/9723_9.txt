In fact, I was glad to see this film! At first, when I saw his poster I thought it was another romantic comedy easy ... but it's more than this! I believe that this idea (that I am sure the good part of the audience was before seeing the movie) is still another important part of the great concept of this movie itself (or even its marketing strategy)! What it means: Nowadays we are slaves to the picture! For comments! I went to the cinema to see this film with a bad feeling, wrong expectations, and finally I felt how I could be! Proving comes with my mind sequence next to where Sidney buys a flight ticket to return to New York and if asked to 'give a autograph', the signing of a ticket, he believes that just because he got a television because of scandal in the prize is now a form of celebrity . And this is right, I believe, the peak of this great theme that the cinema refers to. Additionally, I believe the movie gives us a harmonious solution, shown in the cinema and Sidney's view: don't be too worried about yourself or about someone else ... "even the saints were people at the beginning" ... as Sophie said in movie. Current saints are stars. We give them an 'aura' of perfection, of eternal happiness, but the truth is much less than that. Even the saints of any religion are pictures, the best example of how to live and how to live your life. They were not even true ... they became "real" after death and we looked at them behind them. And that's a catch: we need our saints! we need our stars! We strive for them if it is not for them we will have nothing to strive for. And television and other media is a way to create and capture our controls. We need a lot of focus on testing ourselves. And that's how we got it in the movie to watch this movie in the first place: see if we can focus on the mark, or if the benchmark is small for us. This time was greater than we expected.
