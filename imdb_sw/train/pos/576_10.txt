The film was just a brilliant, creative, location, story, leadership, everyone was a good place to play, and you can imagine that there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now the director, Norman's father came from the same Island Scottish like myself, so I loved the truth had a real relationship with this film, the best words in all the film were good, it was just brilliant, so much that I bought the film just released in retail and would recommend everyone to watch, and fishing The fly was awesome, cried out at the end was very sad, and you know what they say when you cry on the film you must be good, and this was also obvious, with the congratulations to the two young men who played part of Norman and Paul were just brilliant, children often are left out of the list of praise I think, because the stars that are playing all of them live are a great picture of the whole film, but these kids are wonderful and they should be praised for what they did, don't you think? The whole story was very good because it was true and it was a person's life after all that was shared with us.
