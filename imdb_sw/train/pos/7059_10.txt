I was surprised and surprised by the positive views I had seen on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (with 3) is a good and wonderful thing for everyone - children and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. / I also get a very good film, it shows lessons on being true to you and following your heart. I thought it had a good animation, and the sound was very good; The songs made by Brooke Allison also. Since this film has been divided into three / story publications, which I liked most of the three, is the story of Jaq during the mouse, became a man for the day, thanks to the God of fairy and his magic.
