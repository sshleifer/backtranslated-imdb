This movie has taken many stickers. It was organized by critics when they came out and were judged for the destruction of the work of Nicolas Cage. Something that I think people find is that it doesn't mean to be an epic, Oscar contender of the movie, it's just some brilliant "bruck-buster" step for the better. Quick cars, quick editing and loud voice - makes exactly what it says on tin. Also, for anyone who loves clean treatments. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and Forget Eleanor! I think you would like to push hard to get the best movie, and personal, the best movie !! Then again maybe that's just me!
