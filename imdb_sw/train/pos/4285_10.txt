This "greed" written by the famous Serbian venue / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies made in the comedy community. However, his appearance of sports games has been changed to the featured film did not take anything of value. Exactly should not be seen (preferably with subtitles, and not mentioned). At the old bus on the way of Belgrade capital, the coming war will determine the passenger behavior. Two Gypsy musicians sing for their sad lives but they also know the coming catastrophe; The singing of them fragmented and merging action in this wonderful movie of the road (real life of Kostic brothers is an amateur actors, but with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who planted a road to provide real life performance). The perpetrators provide a picture of the community that faces war, understanding within the people of each nation: everyone knows that the war is about to start but they are trying to live their own better lives, hoping that ignorance can prevent the catastrophe. Using the simple language of the film, director Slobodan Sijan shows a photograph of a damaged society by the former warfare (World War I), but also shows personal photos and successes: the singer's typing, the experience of those who are married, the veteran of the war veteran by visiting his recent child, and a bad prediction from someone who seems to be a German player. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in his description, and memorable voice (especially Gispsy songs) and modification status, well photography and editing, this feature (first Sijan feature) was just the introduction of a series of directors of the warnings-good that will say the Serbian notes of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and my favorite director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
