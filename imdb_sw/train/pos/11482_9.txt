This movie has been shot in the hand held camera and actors in it. Somehow the way the text in other video video killers is complete because of the "Columbine" attack. When this movie does not answer all the major questions, it gives you insight on how easy it will be away from. Through the movie is shown how the executives were illegally abducted guns, they made pipe bombs and came up with a plan of action on "Zero Day". Vendors (if you can call those) were brilliant, they were actually borrowed from their own lives, but no action I found they were doing (Something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and the 911 end operator was bold, but I don't know if we need a very last location. In general though it's a very good movie on a very difficult topic.
