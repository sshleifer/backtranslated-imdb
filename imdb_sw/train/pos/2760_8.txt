Everyone we met has affected our thinking, changing our ways, little of this person looking for us. "The eighth day" takes this theme (Compare "Rain"). In this film Harry (Daniel Auteuil) a business expert in sales psychology meets Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child of Down's Syndrome riding. The winning success from all these actors gives this film its great power. The opening sequence is best where Georges tells his theory about the creation of the world and in the closing area we find what God created on the eighth day. There is some time in a story that is very exciting for Harry. For example, Georges who is completely restricted wants expensive shoes and they do not have enough money. It's a kind of event where you laugh through your tears. I liked the area where the Down Down Syndrome group on the art gallery runs on the bus and the gateway to lose Paradis fun park. More feelings of shame are the area where Harry and Georges ride horses-float on the highway, and look back, Georges gives the driver a bad greeting. But there are mild cases, especially the hands-on-hand use - feel the sun, wind and rain, hands reaching up, hands approaching and closing with love and friendship. This is a real video that touches the heart. There are very moving events where Georges suggests Nathalie, where Georges puts Harry's head in his hands, where Georges continues to call his beloved mother, where Georges tells Harry to laugh. (Do you know it sounds when you cut it?), High trees, bird songs, small insects - all the creation of miracles. They are all where they should enjoy if we are back (like Harry and Georges) around and listening to ...... beautiful film.
