This is an amazing movie from 1936. Although the first hour is not very good (for modern viewer), the 2036 best view comes after the words are made. However, do not plan on being able to understand all the talks - the quality of sound and accents (it is America - but the "1930 years" of the US) makes it difficult. Basically, the story extends over the last 100 years, looking for a US American city called "Everytown". It comes from the year 1936, when the war has been, to 2036, when technology comes forward and creates its own problems. The first hour is slow - although it's hard to tell the audience back then it would have been thought. Events, doubts and exhibitions are very important in today's issue. However, when you have a future, it's only fun to see. A big set and looking for a sci-fi retro of everything is hard to beat. When you have great listening ability, this film is hard to hear. I think I understood only 80% of the conversation. It can use closed captions. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, this is one of the kind of scholars and you must see it (well, at least after the first hour). For an average viewer, wait until there is a closed version version and then check if you're enjoying the current movies.
