I always have an honesty before watching the British film because often I get on a sluggish and stimulating screen (such as, for example, Vanity Fair or another Boleyn Girl), but with a great production pattern, European Themes and small British permits that make the film show the artistic value that they do not have. Fortunately, the best film The Victorian Victoria does not fall on the situation, and it deserves to be delighted with enthusiasm because of its amazing story, excellent performances from Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and clothing and places that would unexpectedly do A rich film with a view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I often pay attention to this information. "Victorian time" was (in my humble opinion) one of the most important aspects of modern civilization, and not just on the social aspect, but also in science, art and culture. I did not know about the very nature of the time, and perhaps because I have enjoyed this simple political and economic events that have made it possible for a very modern era. I also loved the way that Queen Victoria is shown, which is like a small and intelligent king whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions. I also saw an example of romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is similar to a delightful combination as well as in the emotional sense. The only failure I have found on this film is that the image writer Julian Fellowes used a clich√©s of romantic movies on a love story, something that feels a little out of place on his screen. I really loved Victoria very little, and I have taken a very good surprise with that. I hope that more films will follow the model of this film: dress and theme should work as a help of interesting stories, and not as its entry.
