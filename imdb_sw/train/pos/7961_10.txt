"Home planting: A wonderful journey" is one of the most amazing movies of pets. It deserves a place among the great movies of its kind and even the world of movies in general, with other animal movies like "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". This means it is more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> What! This can only be "remake"? It's very good to be "remake"! I know this with the heart, since my boyhood (when I was 12 years old) <br /> <br /> It's a precious family movie. It is emotional, exciting, fun, exciting, entertaining, pleasant, pleasant, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, hearty and sometimes wonderful. It is one of those movies to smile on the faces of those who enjoy this kind of film. <br /> <br /> This movie does not match. It has a well-thought story, enjoyable characters, beautiful sounds and fun of sounds, spectacular rocky landscapes of Sierra (in Oregon). Referring to vistas, not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, stoves, sun ... in conclusion, all natural wonders - a real panorama full. The main humanitarian characters are good, very good and are shown by the respective actors. Robert Hays is wonderful as a heart-kind father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is as good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is also good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is commonly like a young and beautiful Jamie (his appearance really reminds me of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benjamin Thall is as good as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our beaten pals, Shadow is a favorite. The shade is a faithful, wise, old man, good, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (spoke openly with Don Ameche). Possibly, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is not worried, stupid, patient, skeptic, ignorant, hilarious and loves to play (shown by talented Michael J. Fox). The only chance cannot stand still. Sassy is an image of a cat: elegant, self-confident, very confident and proud, with a common character of the cat but with a certain charm of feline. Sassy is a cat of Seal Point Himalayan, one of the most beautiful cat's cat. Sassy is shown by Sally Field, who also does a good job. Our friends with four sores are, themselves, "actors" chief by nature: Ben as shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. It is a supported movie, but it's normal for its own right. Its end is very clear. <br /> <br /> This should be about 250 top.
