I have seen the killings of "80 rubble" over the years, from the trash as "Terrorism on Tour" with the impeccable jewelery like "Terrorist Party 2". Somehow I managed to keep this off, which is strange because maybe it's more popular and also received one. Yes, I have finally been infected and is much better than this normal (but almost always interesting!). The program (which was highly promoted in the "Black Roses" film) includes a mixture called Eddie, who laughed with both in her secondary school for her taste in music. He likes 80 coins, especially his Sammi Curr image (played by Tony Fields over the weekend.) After Sammi was killed, Eddie's favorite radio radio DJ gives him the final recording of Sammi. Once Eddie has a past record, he finds it very difficult, and bad things begin to happen to those who despise him. What? Sammi Music? "Trick or Treat" is good with a total hoot. Special effects are surprising, although it does not include the normal laser 80 designs. I grew up in the 80's, and when I was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the story of the town about playing back to hear the voices of Satan worship. Haha! I also remember that I was told by my older brothers and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it is very exciting to see both of them making builders as an innocent radio DJ and a rock priest. If only I had seen this film as a child! While the film seems to enjoy the popular connectivity in the 80's between the alleged fraud and heavy metal, the observer has not found out why Sammi Curr has risen from the dead and led to killing and killing anyone who finds his way. This is the weakest stage of the film, but if you can stop it, it's loads of fun.
