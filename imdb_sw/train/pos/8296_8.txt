Everything is wrong in Suburbia when a small family comes in, as a father got a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would have been perfect without his snake. Wonderful things happen as a family holds a country club without a husband, because it is confidential. The father is not a participant, but the pressure is upon him to join, as everyone who is nothing in the neighborhood and work is delegates. Robert Urich's best player is very young, but Joanna Cassidy is a good housewife who turns the bad szzles. A powerful and effective player with Susan Lucci as the chairman of the club. Look for a favorite devotion to Michael Berryman in a little part like valet. The movie takes a sense of paranoia and the last special effect is worth waiting. I have seen this film very rarely.
