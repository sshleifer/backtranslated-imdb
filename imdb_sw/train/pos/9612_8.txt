Good Thing about this movie: Concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think about your little things in life that can affect someone else's life without you knowing it. His small country and this small movie shows us. Thing bad: There are many characters and difficult to tell who the main character but is still a good movie. It is a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia that I have not seen. Not counted --- I would like to test PG -13 for short violence, other languages ​​and gender conditions.
