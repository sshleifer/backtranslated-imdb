This is a comedy of morality, so the constant touch of the gentleness of grief occurs, but the wind slows down all the speed of fear and hurts until all of a sudden will slow your heart and change everything. , written with skill and directed, is a perfect gem, and it works well for all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is as good as usual, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and glowing, which should not be lost. True film!
