The only fact that I still think of the movie ten years later is what he really talks about about the film. To me this confirms the Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another. I really believe that before the Crash of the film was the Grand Canyon. The main difference between two films in my opinion is the time of their release. I can't say who is better, but I will argue that they are sharing the message. I would like to hear from those who have opinions on this issue. I will start the comments you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to send any other topic about movies that we can share, because I have a real love for film.
