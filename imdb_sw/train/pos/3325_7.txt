Okay, I can't watch the brother's Farrelly film. I can't remember looking at one. I also did not remember watching Jimmy Fallon's movie. In fact, I looked at the taxi, but I said the crime and forgiveness for that error. But, this film was with Drew Barrymore and I just think he is something to cut. I don't know what it is about it, but I just smile at all I am looking at it. He just loves me that way. I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see him in the first 50 Dates. What is that sad? This is not the biggest movie of baseball - it has not been. It was a love story about a sad puppy put into the only thing that he would not even let down until he found something worth giving it. It had a predictable end, but there was so much in the way that it made it worth.
