ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it has introduced me to Ramones. I was very sandy when the band between the 70s heyday knew so much, though I had an old cousin who was a big fan at that time. Finally I saw RNRHS on one television in the mid-80's when I was fifteen years old, and laughing all the way. (Isn't every dream of a high school child digging school and hitting it, all in a rockin sound?) I wrote a tracking film for a year or two later and looking at the Ramones concert again and again, thinking, "Man, these people beat the donkeys! I need to look at their albums!" Others are history. Twenty years, Ramones LPs / cassettes / CDs, thirteen Ramones shows later, is still one of all my favorite bands and RNRHS still delivering every time I look. Now Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have abandoned us (R.I.P. all) at least we have this movie with tons of good music to remember.
