This movie has so many great things! The first performance of Reese Witherspoon is, of course, wonderful, but also its chemistry by Jason London. The mark is wonderful, warm and clean. James Newton Howard enhances the quality of any film he builds for ten times. He also seems to have a knack for the lost-day-of-the-day movies, making sure to get his score soon "Peter Pan" and the music of the Gothic smell of "Village." I saw this film first at 13 or 14 and now it's not just a cry, I give them tears or two for pride. Show this film to your daughters. It will be the end of the film's comfort of life.
