This was a wonderful introduction to talent and beauty of Marion Davies. He is not only a good but a masterpiece in this film. (I believe that Lucille's ball might be the future work of Davies, which can be called "the beauty of the animal".) Vidor's direction is slow but it is the right foot, the story is a real chest but acting is modern, modern and featured. to watch the stars for the time of silence, and many members, increases the overall joy. It combines the features of the slapstick and the adult festival with beautiful good old romance. For all filmmakers who have a knee response to silent movies, sit through this and can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
