This film is amazing as it explores the story and fantasy through which the child would be, for adults. The idea of ​​the baby's drawings to a place to visit physically and to have influence on it is amazing. At the same time you can find a child psychologist all about it and say that he is trying to explore his understanding, as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. Little gives me the pimples when his father is in a paper house, and dismiss him. The only thing that I can stand is that it was sold as a horror film ... it's not true. If you want to see something of a British with many stories that allow you to think without a lot of cheaply used movies, then look at Paperhouse.
