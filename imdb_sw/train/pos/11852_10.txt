Spirit is a unique and original look in western life from the view of wild horses, and native Americans. The film focuses on friendship and dangers that wild horses, the Spirit, meet during his life. It is done well in the presentation, using technology available today to provide amazing illustrations that are very interesting and authentic. The music is amazing, and the songs of Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who also played the role of the most popular music from hit Disney 1994, The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not too deep but the fact is not as deep as some movies don't see my views completely from the film. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that I enjoyed so much, and that's suitable for the whole family. Not one of missing. (10/10)
