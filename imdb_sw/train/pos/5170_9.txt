I lost this film when it came out of the video tape and was very useful. I had the opportunity to buy on DVD a few weeks ago and I have watched it several times since. I would like to agree with others when they said Indian Summer was a nostalgic film. When I look at it I would like to be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like the film somewhat. We always want that we can improve our lives as wise children / adults. Isn't it good to have your friends / parents to be young again? So that you don't worry about your work, be a parent etc ... ??? I know that I would like to jump on De Lorean and go back. When I enjoyed this very popular film of my campaign though it is Meatballs and Bill Murray. I wish they could make a version of the Indian Summer.
