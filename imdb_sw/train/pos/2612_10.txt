This is a very good film. I had heard a mixed review when you were in production and I've been waiting for release! He loves the director and all actors. That help gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this on. As everyone here says, the last part of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy did her work with her behavior, since she had not done much work when this film was made. He has a work in front of him. I was amazed at his performance. I really enjoyed the film, I questioned my values ​​in life and priorities, and is the best person for it! A great message in the film. Unlock it so all can enjoy!
