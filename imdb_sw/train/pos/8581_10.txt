This is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. All of you who are watching this film as shs t totally don't mind enough to understand all of the tricks of the trick that this film should give. It shows us that real life and action "amazing" can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most sensible ways for two people to find each other. My name is another movie where you can see it all along with Donald Sutherland singing a song like "Going to get your Anus on Mount Mars."
