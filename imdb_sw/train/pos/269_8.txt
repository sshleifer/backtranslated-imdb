I am a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the most beautiful. All the performances were very strong and there were feelings that I didn't see coming before each business. For me it was kind of Medium meets CSI. Does anyone else think that in a particular light, the daughter looks like a little Nicole Kidman? What? Are they connected in any way? I would like to look at agin or rent if it comes to video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was good. He did not see her in many things and did her work with a very persuasive influence. <br /> <br /> If you are entering a TV movie, watch this if you have a chance.
