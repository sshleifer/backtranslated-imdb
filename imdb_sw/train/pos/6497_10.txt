I must have seen this several times over the years. I was around fifteen when I first saw the B&W at the local PBS center. I bought a DVD for children to see, and I made them look at it. They do not teach history in the School, and this describes the most important event of the 20th century. It emphasizes their important ideas. By discrimination, along with all the participants to explain in their own words what they did and why, it explains what leads to war and real war. <br /> <br /> Buy for your children, including Alistair Cooke. Watch with them, and make them understand. You will be very happy you did.
