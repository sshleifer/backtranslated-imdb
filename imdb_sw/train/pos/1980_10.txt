One of the last 60 years music. I was 7 years old I first saw this film, and has always been a favorite since then. All music numbers are remembered. In the 60th century people who were sent to music had musical talent (unlike the CERTAIN Academy's chosen music class in the central city center). All the major works were smoothly ... Ron Moody shines as Fagin, such as Shani Wallis like Nancy. Oliver Reed was Bill Sikes who was very standing (who doesn't appreciate the music numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were too. Mark Lester comes as an innocent waif, what Dickens wanted when he wrote a book! Then, of course there are many of the players who make "strive for yourself," "I would do anything" "Who will buy it" and "go back," many of whom were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
