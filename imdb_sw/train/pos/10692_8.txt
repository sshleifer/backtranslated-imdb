Beautiful, funny, straight story, the best Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movie he is). This was a good "car" for someone who is involved in comedy and drama since there are both things. Romantic comedy closed two stories of crime, the main lines of closure. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in the other beautiful, but not recommended romantic comedy ("Really about Pats & Dogs"). Maybe they are also not available. Ebert did not even comment for this. The main pieces of "screwball" were completely invisible ("Bringing a Child", etc.). If you have seen a single comedy, you have seen them all? Or maybe people are already moving from the 1930s. Weird. The girl of birth is a movie I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be a "killer app" for home video.
