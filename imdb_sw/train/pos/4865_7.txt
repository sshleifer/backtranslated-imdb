I couldn't wait my hands on this, when I read about Fred Astaire with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script with P.G. Wodehouse and music by Gershwins. It is obvious to see, but it has no quality of the cooperation of Fred and Ginger movies. It would be better to read in the Wodehouse book, where humor comes better. Some acting it is sad to look (especially a little boy and girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance has more value than many movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could play, but the boy does this in this film. What? Have you ever tried to remain standing at one of those records around the funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in the heels! He stands for a wonderful and Astaire and adds a lot of image quality. Several beautiful songs, especially fun is a good job if you can get a little mouth. Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and look again at the funhouse dance once the credit was over.
