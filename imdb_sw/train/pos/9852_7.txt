No day passes without a new movie released by the computer, so now we have a chance to see more of the good effects. After looking at the Ice Age I felt it was not a big deal for me than other films. But because I am a Great Boy now, and I'm sure this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). The story is very simple, and "actors" are funny in a good way, without any humor or bad. Even "evil" is delightful, a very large cat with its lovely teeth. And the story has the end of joy, which was a little disappointment to me (knowing that most of the main characters should be lost in a sad way) but the big thing for children. And apart from other fights no one dies (even when it gets beaten with mammoth several times), which made the feelings of cartoony. Part of the computer animation is good but there is nothing special, apart from some very good to enjoy the event, when you feel like you're walking in a beautiful painting or pages of comics. [That means a lot of work, however!] The story. <br /> <br /> Overall is a good movie, but it is in a beautiful world-and-fluffy-animal-to-disney cliche. If you do not hate cute animals to make funny things, check at least once.
