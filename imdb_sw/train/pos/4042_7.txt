AHA! He is given a choice by other military boys who seem to be very cold: We can give you until we have made sure that you have died YOU can walk through this door and take anything that can be in front of you. ”Says yes 2, and then the real story begins. br>> He wakes up in different types of cell (high and very high technology), where he finds another cell partner, who has also been able to live with boogie electricity. it happens in this room.He hears a little suspicion, but two men agree: What do you do? What do you do? These two men do not know that they have been put together, so that they can stimulate an inner desire to kill them. usually unknown scientists in the history p ** s away until they decide that they should kill each other. A strange voice? Indeed, but there are more important purposes than all of these. it will be revealed, and it will remain open. But don't be afraid, it is not known that you love the viewer to look beyond this pseudo-action film, before it has a completely different way to the question: How long can you stand up with someone who is SOB and you can kill him to get freedom? The first hour is basically trying to activate your interests, it comes without you actually knowing. It then becomes a flight run of the balls and events to combat matrix events like personal touch to respect the comic book which the film stands. <br /> <br /> The movie is very real, so special that ordinary movies will not look under normal circumstances. However, the story is amazing, music is amazing, and artists are doing less (more than others) making movies to be unique. <br /> <br /> If you should be fortunate that your movies or your video shop has, looking at, and enjoying the fact that not everyone is trying to make the most common movies earn a lot of money. <br /> <br />
