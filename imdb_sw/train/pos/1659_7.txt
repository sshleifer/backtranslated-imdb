A piece of life of one of the first female singers to achieve the historical reputation, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the little Italian girl to be used with artistic skills and vicissitudes she meets. The film has a high cost and it puts and throws and performs. However, it is a barrier to his attempt to describe the esoterics of art and time and is not encouraged in its representation of the artist's desire as painted on the canvas and explored through his cooperation with men. A good film for those who want to paint painting or film.
