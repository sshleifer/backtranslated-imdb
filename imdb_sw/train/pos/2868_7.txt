First of all I need to say that I am Portuguese and seldom use my time to watch Portuguese movies, maybe one year or even even ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is the closest idea among the people of Portuguese that national pictures are bad, almost completely and worse! However, in the last decade, it begins to bother me when we return to the funny 40-year time "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best world when they, and movies like "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula", from director Fernando Fragata and also with other participants and music in common. This is also good, not the same kind because it is not a real comedy; In fact it is a drama game, a woman's game has an extraordinary part of the world, the reason for the exciting characters or subtle things that they do for them, as a trip to the Caribbean to put it on. <br /> <br /> This function works and may announce us a few times; artists are beautiful, common places as symbols; but the truth is that they are all wise, then we can count it as a good effort for national movies, which seems to be starting from ashes as phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese movie, you can certainly take the best option, but it is still being tested.
