Dick Tracy was the first book of comic created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a genocide investigator who monitors criminals, starting all sorts of original characters such as Flattop and Blank for Big Boy Caprice. (These Jews emerged in the 40th century that Warner Bros built their own inheritance for Tracy characters in such cartoons as Daffy Duck) Tracy's heads were known for their use of gunplay freedom and development of up-to-date technology (especially a wristwatch conversation, which got their share of the right time on the screen on this excellent film. The music took place with amazement by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were fascinating, but it was not the highest issue of his career. It is amazing because when you watch the film and see when you insist, the film feels like Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound for its pieces. I love a tough child, Pacino Actor like Big Mvanyana Caprice (with chin!), Madonna takes villainy, and movies and movies are not worth it. This film was made professionally and shows tons of famous actors who were known as the main actors for the time before this film (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke) ). The film was led by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It was almost like Beatty felt like Tracy in an old life or something because she was quite suitable part. I was supposed to give this film 8/10 for everything that was brought to a movie that was not disliked (for any reason). There have been tons of disagreement about the rating of this movie on IMD, and I still don't understand why. The characters were the first and most powerful, as was the set of sets, lights, lights, and everything in this film. Go buy today. You will not have mercy.
