I have been fascinated by this film for some time, because for a very high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 and over 300 votes give a high score of any silent film found! What? What did I have about this film before this site? Well, you can't always believe testing. That is a very good film, very well kept if the VHS transfer that I have rented is any sign - better to act for chiefs, especially William Haines as Brown, and a good work area in Cambridge with a beautiful picture of action in Harvard's high / A soccer - but the story must seem chestnut of hoary even in 1926. Bad guys, independent and charismatic to go to school and gets put in place, being in a friend's relationship, caring, dedicated; I assure people in 1926 found a lot that was really exciting in a few few reels, the reason to predict is high. However, it starts well, and it certainly deserves to be remembered, if it is not in heaven. Perhaps more than 350 voter voters are Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> WEBSITE Now 600+ voters and scores have increased to 9.2! By and large, people, there are lots-voting in here - I despise anyone to explain why this is a better film than "Metropolis" or "Great"!
