Tom Hanks has been on movies such as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and Green Mile. For the most part, his roles have been good people who are happy. On the road to lose, his character Michael Sullivanis is a little different. Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in the movie novel by Max Allan Collins, shows the story of man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this small road trip is that Sullivan is a man-conflicting man who is now being chased by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his son, Sullivan's Connor (Daniel Craig). After the work was done in the wrong way because of Connor, the only witness to his error was Sullivan and his son who should not have been there. So Connor tries to take Sullivan and his family, but gets only a wife and another child Peter. Sullivan out of the house hit and run to get Michael Jr. sitting a table ... sitting just. With his wife and child who died, Sullivan takes the road to find answers. The story follows two as Sullivan tries to do things well in the memory of his wife and child, and for Michael who feels like he is blamed for all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin is doing the job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also the feeling of being young. His loss of crime is good to walk when he moves from city to city, leaving anything behind him. The original hit of Mendes was the American Beauty that got five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. This film did not do very well in Oscars only win one prize for the best movies but to receive another five selection for music, sound, and the best actor in Supporting Paul Newman Support. This photo is a good story that takes you through the Midwest and on the story of Mike Sullivan: husband, hit-man, and a dedicated father. This movie is a sleepy film that should be observed for years to come.
