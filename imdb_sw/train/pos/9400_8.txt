If the Man in White Monitoring is done in America, you can't see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying to Sidney Stratton's Alec Guinness in size? This is one of the best Alec films of Guinness and the best one that Ealing Studios in the UK has happened. It is fully effective within the time of the new Labor and Social Work that was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis and work can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness This little schnook gentle person is experiencing the idea that it can produce clothes that will never need to clean up, that actually repels all kinds of foreign matter a minute touches the garment. He / she is an ongoing debate and succeeds. Of course it has not been thought through the kind of clothing of the same effect that will have the community. Finally everyone dismisses as they were refugees, like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is a great film of the comedy film that such an explosive situation as described in some of the great films I have described can be played for laughing. Guinness's bad suit is not only white and it produces color, but it shines like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker like another emperor, Joan Greenwood as a daughter of siren and Ernest Thesiger a great manufacturer of clothing in the UK> <br /> <br /> Come to think , How much to borrow a suit from Ealing and give John Travolta to Fever Night Night?
