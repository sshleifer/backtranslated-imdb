For those who think it's a humor of potty and maturity, you are really without mind. While the show has a part of the potty joke which also has many satirical devices and enjoys social problems, color barriers, discrimination barriers, restrictions etc.. You just need to read in some of its little more things. <br /> <br /> I also liked that not everything is punchline. For those who are expecting a fate like friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you will not find it here. Instead Sarah uses the situation and other ways to achieve her humor which is more realistic. We don't walk around the world and have a magic punchlines for everything that says, which is in many comedies. Instead, the Silverman Program of Sarah makes it more realistic in this sense. So don't take it as an unintelligent sense because it is much more than that.
