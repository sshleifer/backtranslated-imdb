You just saw this film today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and enjoyed it completely. It is a good writing and leadership, the best and reliable interaction between cast, and the best time of comic as well. <br /> This movie touches the theme that belongs to the whole family and separates. As a result, I can see European, Asian, and American viewers all seeing the similarities between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all was not enough, this has the ability to become the best underground movie of the year ... someone distributes this USA, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you Maria Flom! True is a good film.
