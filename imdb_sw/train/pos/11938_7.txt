I enjoy movies like this with their spirit, no planned pun. It's a good movie, clean on a baseball team that fell back, and a little fan wants to win, since his dead father said it was the only way he could return to him. The Spirit shines in two ways: cast funny by Danny Glover and the young man Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the heavenly Heavenly presenter, to take the form of power of Christopher Lloyd. It's a powerful movie. It is interesting to you, and it involves you very much in the game. <br /> <br /> There is my lie. The one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that allow you to be an unexpected fan for the team. There is nothing wrong with that. I find it strange that I must get from the movie to think the Angel is a powerful team, cool, when my basic trust, like it, has a lie with Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, in fact. If it's just a movie about the children's team, then it's ok.
