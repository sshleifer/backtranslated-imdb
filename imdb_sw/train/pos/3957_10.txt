Three Stooges has always been some of the most actors that I love. I like almost every one that they have done. I love all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All shorts are hilarious and also many many actors and actors who most of them were in short shorts! In my opinion The Three Stooges are some of the most actors ever and are the whole team of comies! One of my favorite shorts is Shemp is none other than Men Beware! All visible in this short is beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates, and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offers a beautiful display here! There are many funny places here. This is too short. There's another third-party stooges like this called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
