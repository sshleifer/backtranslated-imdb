Careless Phillips puts in one hell of functionality, both of a fun and wonderful. Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show. It was a good touch after they were going to smoke, a movie star from Busy, which was not very good. If Busy does not get any selection for this film will be a catastrophe. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, look at the home room.
