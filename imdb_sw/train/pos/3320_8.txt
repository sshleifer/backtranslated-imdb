I loved this film, beautiful and beautiful. I saw this film as a good family film. The most dirty part of this film was when you recorded it in New York Yankees. You should be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Enjoy saying this to Yankee's fans. love to do what, but movies make it all the time of the slapstick.Show show of some time about how the national Sox Red (in Fenway Park) how the fans felt 86 years of Sox always decreased during the end of the season and how the Sox and love with someone else goes by hand.
