Henry Fool is the best film. But this is the perfect way to track film like 'Henry Fool.' Take Henry very seriously, his 'lie' with his amazing aura. Even the opening of 'Henry Fool' when Simon puts his ear down as Henry coming up the hill is quite clear through 'Fay Grim.' The high-top joke, which is more than meta-joke (about film writing and jokes themselves), is good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. Hartley also uses the horn of the Netherlands in all the film is jarring, yes, it is intended, but it feels compelled to be used more, goes beyond the jarring and, what I'd like to call it, offensive. It is a lost film, but it must look at any Hartley fan or 'Henry Fool'. Do not listen to a stupid review, this series unless you have seen the first film. Complexity, satire and wit of this movie are completely lost if you haven't seen Henry Fool. It's good. That's dumb.
