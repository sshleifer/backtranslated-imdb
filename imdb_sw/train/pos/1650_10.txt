A good series, which worked well and led, but did not like (I am told) by Mr Deighton and has been removed from him after one presentation. Now it appears only in private collections, and through the UK Film Institute for special request. Undoubtedly, if the Ian Holm show of Bernard's fatigue-but-determined is very good; one of its best displays. Support, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, is advisable. And Mel Martin plays a confused and stubborn wife, and Michael Degen as an angry Werner, the story is faced with bad and bad human consequences.
