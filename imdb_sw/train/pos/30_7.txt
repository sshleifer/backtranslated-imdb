The old family story told to two young girls and their grandfather is raised 16 years later as he predicted. People get killed and blood is reduced and mice are rounding up and naked bodies have fun. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is a suspect, but we know she is not a killer. What is Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? What is Evelyn returning from death to take revenge? What? Is the plot to steal the inheritance? Paint is very beautiful in this excitement from Emilio Miraglia, who made just another Giallo, as I knew. The only thing that destroyed the film was to see that several frames were cut. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they try to save Kitty.
