This is a very strange film - and that's not a bad thing. It is a mix of neo-true film about homeless and story story. I am sure that others can get this film very little, but I liked it. Once again, this director brings together an amazing cast of everyday people (not executives) and finds the full functionality. Although it is not nearly as sad as Umberto D, both movies are very relevant - this only makes it so incredible. To stop special effects of cheesy - after all, it was done in the early 1950s with special effects not so important anyway (or at least should not be in the film). Instead, just sit back and enjoy a wonderful journey. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you will have a ball. The way, since I first reviewed this film, I have seen another film directed by DeSica which is absolutely necessary to see and that is CHILDREN MARAVERS. While it's not fantasy or light in the spirit as MODA IN MILAN, the big film however.
