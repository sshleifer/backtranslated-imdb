I started looking at Learner over 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I liked it very much. The first thing that comes to you is that is a complicated structure, which though it is similar to many other things that happen on its foundation, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is amazing as hosted by the chief judge of the show too. The revolutionary cast by intelligent people who seem to be good are beaten as fighters appreciate it too. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of his time but his care of the movie is best if he makes NYC look like a character for itself. The Jazz tunes with the great function of the camera makes New York seem attractive. <br /> <br /> The student will have to constantly make my performances of about 3 times of all time (Wonderful race not 1, however). But if this amazing race this show is always better to look for the volume. If you continue to watch it for a while when the show of the show will close quickly (such as TAR) .Star World, the country's broadcasters, worked through the image. The first three times were shown in a series, then after 2 years the next two years were shown, which saved this concept. In conclusion, you will like this show, especially the first season 2. However if you continue to watch the show regularly, then its charm will close with FAST.
