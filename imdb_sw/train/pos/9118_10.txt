I saw this film and a special study of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It is very interesting where this person came from. Now she may be the world's largest independent film manufacturer. And I'm not talking about the black film writers I am talking about the filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea as anything proves different from the different types of African themes, and its film 500 years later is the African issue. But The Way is not recommended that mold. It shows different art. The film is all Africa released but the topic is a human topic that most of us can incorporate. I just love the strong comedy in it. And the Korah of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it's really a gem of art.
