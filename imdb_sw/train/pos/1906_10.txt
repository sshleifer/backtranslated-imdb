Sadly, the Code 8 Easy, for dating my little daughter, was the last sitcom that John Ritter began to work after his terrible death in 2003. He was one of all my beloved actors. He had all, who could (who could forget the Third Company) but was also a very good actor (he had no excuse to watch TV TV) I liked all the other members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was a star, was the main reason I was attracted to the show in the first place, and it was his full comedic delivery that was able to break me every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show was not all sweet of sugar (as I liked The Cosby Show, coming up, were very good for every lol lol) showed the family usually dynamics with care. It was really enough what and all the competition of the brothers and debate between parents, but still put it funny. Many things in America are trying and filling the exhibition completely with values ​​and not, and this show did not. Yes, there were some, like dealing with important issues, like drugs and abuse, but they did not try and become anything except the comedy of a fun family. The way they wrote John's death to the Exhibition was done carefully, I will do it as a child every time I see it. You can feel the shade that was during the most beautiful events. <br /> <br /> I'm sad show was allowed, I still enjoy enjoying bombs, and I've never been tired. John Ritter, you will always be remembered for you the hilarious direction on this on the protective father, who could tie his daughters up in their room than having a boy date =) You rock Ritter !!!
