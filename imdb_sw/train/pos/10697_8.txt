Modern, original, romantic stories. The best acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. Miss Kidman is doing a good job in following Russian inspiration. Ben Chaplin is also as good as a good, swift clerk. For men (and other women): miss Kidman looks amazing and is very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It is not hard to imagine that John loves him. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for doubt. Although I expected to end up happy, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise to me. Conclusion: A good movie. Bas-Bas: eight points.
