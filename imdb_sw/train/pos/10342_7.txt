Melvyn Douglas sometimes gives the police performance which, this time, lives in the role of detective who cannot put love before the duty and adventure, and Joan Blondell is very happy (who, far from writing, if one inspector suggested, wrote a novel about His early life is as enjoyable as ever as his good player. It's almost comedy screwball, almost movie Thin Man-type, almost a series, I think, that not quite do it sequel. It does not reach the standard, but it has all 85 minutes of fun and a script of a series but a safe, good character, and a trend that keeps it fast enough for you to see that Williams (Douglas) is not Columbo exactly when it comes to exploring. I would like to have more films like this.
