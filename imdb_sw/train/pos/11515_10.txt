It has been many years since I saw this but I feel compelled to defend this gem against those who isolate themselves. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and unusual to explore different views here. That's what you think I think. It's a view. It is possible to hit the bone through your amazing bone in 60,000 volts or leave you cold and you wonder why you have given him time. This picture has some of the best British actors who put together in a story that is quiet and meaningless and the result is wonders. Talk with visual comedy is best delivered by two leads (Cleese and Lowe) are superb together. This was given to them. I can't say again unless I ask you to get this and look at it. You cannot move away from the world without a genteel humor, this is a contemporary piece of the comedic beauty.
