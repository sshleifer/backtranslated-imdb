Why do people call information on this film and not about bad movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the largest movie of the 21st century. By acting great, leading, effects, music and generally everything. This movie has always been ignored by all because some day some people said they did not like it any more because so many worlds decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this film. All I can say is that this film, not just the largest Oscar movie of all time, a lot of money ever made and sad one of the most hit movies I ever seen. Apart from that is really the best movie. The only approximate movies are like all Star stars and Lord of trousers or anything of Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but no match to James Cameron TITANIC masterpiece.
