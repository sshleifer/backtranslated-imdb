Okay, so I've come for a long time from Houston, but whenever I see this movie, I'm sent to a little cowgirl dream for one day on Gilley. (It was burned before I was in the age of drinking.) If you grew up in East Texas, then you know this film is a proper manifestation of modern life at the time. If you no longer believe and see the film. You will also join many who love it (and at the same time very surprising), or at the very least, you can hate the red stick. (There are many audio tools.) This movie doesn't try to be P.C. (what was in the 80's) or to hide a white waste matter and is faithful to time and place. <br /> <br /> Gotta be 10 for me!
