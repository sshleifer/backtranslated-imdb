King Cove was one of the best Friday night nights displayed. I asked the author please please write a long series and make it on Life, SOON. Anyone was very interesting and did a good job with their lines to make that plot occurred. However, the movie needs to continue for a long time. I would like to see the child of Bianca and Jake grow up and get a great role in the movie, with a new grandfather's grandfather and grandfather for his future education. Also, return kathy to see her boyfriend and help raise her life. It was good to see grandparents talking about their problems, but the family business had to be restored to work, and let's see how Jake and Bianca live through marriage.
