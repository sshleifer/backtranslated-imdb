* July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) are attacked when they sleep with killed brutally on the head with steel pipes at their home 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Susan just keeps living. <br /> <br /> Defendant General: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former porn king, owner of 30 cm long dick, and now can not be hopeless. Observers, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), investigate the case and try to deny it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John at least was involved in the murder, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's partner, and trying to get a report from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), a 19-year-old girl of Holmes and Susan, who sadly missed anything more than shadows about the night's head was facing finally, with Eddie Nash's name ( Eric Bogosian), the chief of drug addicts (who is always around women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes clear as the planner of the Wonderland murder / <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, could know that? 'Wonderland' is a teaching, exciting edge, the story of desperate love and the story of a man's depravity; there is the clever use of 'Rashomon' tactics (we see the events of the day and the worst night for David, John, Dawn, Susan (even less) and Sharon), a good direction with a great script, but it's more compelling to performances, especially Kilmer, who takes intermediate steps with Holmes, sometimes a child, sometimes a newborn, who Launius is a fortunate surprise, Sharon and Dauwn innocent of Kudrow. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
