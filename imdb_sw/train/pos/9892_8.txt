This modern is good. A group of people are locked up in a abandoned school. They begin to be killed, they know they are being beaten, so what do they do? One girl decides to bathe, another decides to cheat her husband (who is also present) and an old boy so somehow get a bed (in an old school left?) And go there. And it comes through a year with T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / social perspective. Where the 80s of the slasher is reflecting on how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people, or as Hollywood sees the whole country this is a unique perspective. This is a British film made to become a American player. It is keen to see many British actors who are trying to speak "America" ​​unintentionally interfering with their UK accents. <br /> <br /> If you like 80 slashers (like pieces) then you will like this.
