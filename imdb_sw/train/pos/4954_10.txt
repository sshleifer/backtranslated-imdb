Great movie, funny, sweet and Morgan Freeman (who struggles himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while doing an independent film research. I was very skeptical about the film for the first ten minutes but once in the shop I started to enjoy the film. It shows how a good view can change anything. It has no complex plots and it is easy to follow but it will raise a sad state and make you smile all the way without the need for a romance minimal. It includes several events in a way that makes you keep up with your laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
