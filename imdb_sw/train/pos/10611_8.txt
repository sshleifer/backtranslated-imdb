What another critic says the lack of behavioral development, I call a call. The movie did not bash one on the head with more details or backstory without a necessity. Yes, there were many informal stories that we saw only, but this was especially a one-day photograph in the event that changed the life of the characters. Henry Thomas's work was a very interesting lesson in the power of responding to responses rather than action. Good rental.
