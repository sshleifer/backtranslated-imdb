This movie has a beautiful star in their previous years: Ingor Stevens never had a very good; Yul Brynner was a very influential Jean LaFitte, disagreeing about his piracy and wishing to keep up with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job as Andrew Jackson, but some time were slightly stilted. In fact it is a good flavor for students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that the end of happiness did not include a consensus of lovers - sometimes the end of happiness is that they go and find the same background partners will understand them better. I have watched it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love her every time!
