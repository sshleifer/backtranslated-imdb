to watch this as a child. Although I will probably get worse - God now, it was kind of spiritual things if I was just seven. I also remember working on the Saturday and afternoon puzzle when I look, so I wasn't very careful. However, the incident with boulders has changed in my mind ever since. I have asked many people if they have seen this flick but without benefits. 12 years ago, one said that, perhaps, he had seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; fanciful piffle like wind. It's not a dream, my friend. No germination now. Again, I haven't seen it since then, but I can't wait to get copies and items into my VCR. Anything that can stay in my mind's eye for 23 years is worth 10 '.
