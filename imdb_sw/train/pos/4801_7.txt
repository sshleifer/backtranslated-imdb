I watched this with all my family as a 9-year-old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father saying that "this is how it was possible - Adam and Eve." I remember very clearly when Adam saw Eve, his eyes were beaten. I asked my father why his eyes were black and told him because he was tired and hungry. While you have not seen this period in 45 years, I still remember well - TV is sent back and forth with a home planet, bombings of earthquake bombs, and the last two walking places, Adam carrying his packet with Eve to follow. It may not be an art work of art, but it really left me feeling all these years.
