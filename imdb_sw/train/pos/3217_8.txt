Kurt Russell is so reliable and so non-stop that it takes to think about it later to realize that there was a guilt-to-goodness theme necessary to overcome the fear of the Stranger, learning to climb on the early conditions, the power that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the story. This is very rare to 'flick action action' that even I [who thinks more A / A is a cruel pap] loved the film and encouraged it for everyone I know ..... is this shame not ignored because that right would be one of them The big office of practical-adventure boats - has something for everyone without strengthening the reputation or losing a short time. I am afraid that the answer is not false in the fact that adults did not go to see it. Anyone under 20 has probably not seen more violent action on their video games but probably would not have access to a multi-layered beauty, beauty or careless about it. This film can change anyone who avoids A / A as senseless violence. If a boy takes his wife [or gives it or sees it in a cable list] to see this film he will be more likely to take her to another stage of walking.
