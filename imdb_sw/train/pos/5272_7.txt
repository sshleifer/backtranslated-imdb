Deodato brings us a wonderful time with a mild movie that hasn't taken too much. Fully classic in its own kind kind of way. This film provides interesting attention to concerns. If you get a chance to see this film do it. You will have a smile on your face many times. Not because it's funny or anything else like that but because it's so bad it goes out in another way and it becomes good, though maybe it's not clean, fun.
