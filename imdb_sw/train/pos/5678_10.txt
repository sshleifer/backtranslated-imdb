We can still use Black Adder even today. Consider Rowan Atkinson starting again the role of assistant prime minister playing with Hugh Laurie. Hugh is wondering if Prince George and Edmund are very few. I like the places where the stars of the visitors Kenneth Connor as the UK's spinning. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two Thespians make a little act of neglect to remove evil spirits. It's the funniest things you will see. Of course, no this knowledge and political beauty can not be with Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who is also behind the film as True Love, The Blue Line Thin, Michaano Four and Funeral. Black Adder is funny and very close to television. Humor can be smart, sexy, and funny all for one. I had hope last night on Saturday to live that Hugh Laurie would respect her history in British humor. If the SNL group did research, they would know what resources it was to have Hugh Laurie the grace of their action.
