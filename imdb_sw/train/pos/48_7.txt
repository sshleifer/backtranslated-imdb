I am from Belgium and so my English text is poor, sorry for it ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most rare movies on television and which seem to be damaged in thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS collection and I saw this title, I looked at it and had an IMDb score of over 7/10, that's very good. <br /> <br /> I must admit that it's very good to put together a movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director ...? What? How did he come to have no more movies after this more beautiful ...? A person with great potential should be compelled to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see that he takes his action together and makes another good film like this, please .....
