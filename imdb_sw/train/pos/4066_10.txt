Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), beyond any of Hayao Miyazaki movies, brings joy to the story to the audience. It's a kind of movie that makes someone feel like a child again; it's just magical. It was a mistake that took a long time to be given in the states, but now it is here! And cling to the original language; dub changed my opinion of some characters, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in the translation of the film (or book, nothing.).
