I am a great fan of films where people get camping, and the House of Games is almost the 'film that people find.' In short, it is a unique thriller that puts you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters and many levels, and never exposing what is happening, when throwing in many twists and surprises to completely destroy what you've seen. Movies have many listeners, and in spite of this we know this; it's still hard to guess where it goes, and every move comes out as a surprise. As mentioned, I am a great fan of fun in the movies and this plot follows a woman of a female mind who accepts a patient with a huge debt owing to her fellow gambling. Then it goes to gambling for an attempt to help her patient, and on the way is available on the art of reading people to overcome the con. <br /> <br /> The Sports House breathes at least around, and David Mamet is doing well in setting up its filming at the lowest levels of the city. The film has also been done, along with all those involved to bring life and believe in their characters and much more knowledge. Joe Mantegna star as a good man in the middle of the film, and although his performance is slightly less active, he is always stable and reliable as a villain of a piece. Lindsay Crouse stars with him as a psychiatrist made by his work, and again believed in his role. He may not look more, but at least he can act. The way the film makes the star is the main star of the show, however, and of course you will be amazed at how often the film can surprise and deceive the viewer. Sometimes it's almost as we are in thick of action and have conned with con people in the film. Another thing that is good about this film is a way that shows the audience how to pull a certain cons, which is important if you are interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, the color house is the first trip to the first level.
