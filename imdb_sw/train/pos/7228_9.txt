The undefined view of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. On the other hand angry and very sad. Does anyone do better than O'Toole? I don't think so. It is a very good face that man has! The story is very unusual and exciting and emotionally in place (especially towards the end) but it also touches in an unusual way and succeeds in many levels. However, I heard the film essentially compared to Peter O'Toole's performance and I am sure I had no fun even if I didn't have it.
