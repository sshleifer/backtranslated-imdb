Hayao Miyazaki's name has become popular with Spitied Away, however what is often ignored is the efforts of the first film director. Who remembers that Spielberg led Duel or George Lucas to lead THX 1138? I remember seeing the pieces of this movie - almost 45 minutes ago at the end of the 80's and what was lost and I was a shadow of sight and animation. So when I got a copy at a Â£ 9 shop I didn't resist but I bought it. The amazing thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie don't care about my memory (memory is so fantastic). <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now with all the acquisition skills of artists' portfolios how they like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some artwork is. I can only assume influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu gets a fallen girl (Sheeta) her adventure begins - the effort of Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's neglected part of the Gulliver Journey. For good reference to Jules Verne is a good base against bad films after the last part to become the last warriors of Laputa. This is the most solid part in my memory - 'pastoral' feature of Laputa's environment returned to nature - a mass of hidden robots under a huge tree. This is, in my opinion, the show of the film - the view of the face of Laputa, as opposed to groundwater. Though this is a dichotomy of this movie - show that even the technology can not win nature - the irony of the last robot waiting for the garden and animals. The End of Silent Silence is almost the same. It is very strange, I can't say 'blowing' - very good and organic with a large amount of depth in buildings, aircraft and design and watch over everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese. Buy this film and save it.
