Sylvester Stallone's choice to make the main character and Renny Harlin is recommended since Stallone is a kind of hard man and craggy who had done earlier with the necessary decision for the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing a series of Die Hard with Cliffhanger is a very thoughtful idea. The opening opening area opens the audience with anxiety, anxiety and preference that will bring them into bloody and dangerous blood to meet criminals. Higher transfer and high scope of hard money in suit cases from one flight to another is not done before. <br /> <br /> The summer heat of the Alps and the ongoing deception and lies among the opponents forces make one trouble with fear. An amazing adventure of massacres and massacres kill the last run. The best movies are not made every year and people do not get eyes to watch every time. In addition to the bad language / dialogue that makes the excitement of copper during certain events, the movie can be seen as one that cannot refuse to appeal to it even after many years.
