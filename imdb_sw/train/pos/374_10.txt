Testing "10/10" Pastor's many years ago, I have heard Spielberg's comments that he could turn to the film here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this film - with a schindler list - is better for you. Even Oprah does well in this! <br /> <br /> I found more is the reality of the story and the game. Such things happened and are still happening in the world.
