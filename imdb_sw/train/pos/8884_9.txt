I was very excited about 60 years. It is not that generation (I am trying to "80 years") was interesting to see a unique four-hour story. <br /> <br /> One major problem in the movie, however, was how unequal films was in the family photo. According to promos I saw the movie on NBC, the story was especially about two families involved in the American issues of 1960. Now, I would have lost something, but I think we have learned more about a white family than an African family. I think that 60 uses music to describe the best events than any conversation that may come out of the administrator's lips (all of which are very talented.) This appears at the end of the first part (about two hours in ) The mini series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
