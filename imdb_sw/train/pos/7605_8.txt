Lost is a very good TV series about some people who are lost on the island. there is a lot of change and it turns out that you can't decide who is the most loved one, one minute he is doing something so it's so cool then he does a thing to do something so that he is colder and then the emphasis builds and as it is around to lose that time and your end like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week to see the next section but it's worth waiting. Charging, action, romance, humor gets all away from the top girls but that's good for it means that you can really focus on more stories and stories what this all about. so if you love good news and if you insist this is good but 24 I think it's probably better (I have a comment on that too that you can check out.) I would give you lost 8 out of 10 especially for its unpredictable, you won't know what will happen next.
