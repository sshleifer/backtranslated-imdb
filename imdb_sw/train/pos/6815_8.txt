Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue a fourteen-year-old girl who lost her mother and finds it difficult to communicate with her father, until one day in her apartment house gets a magic elevator that takes her back to the late 18th century she meets and two other children who lost their father and faced povertyâ€¦ I was investigating through channels and I found this. I read the synopsis and suddenly I saw Elisha Cuthbert ... he had made the film before .... 'The Door Next Door and 24' Elisa provides satisfactory performance, the plot is a little cheesy but the film works. It's amazing how this little girl was the most beautiful child in Hollywood!
