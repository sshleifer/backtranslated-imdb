Interesting Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being inserted by a special bike. He is worried about the truth and his striker knows his address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the striker strives to go to Marjorie's home and thank him for being scared. Marjorie was beaten and killed, he can get a high hand over his attacker, knocking the faces of life out of the jerk and giving him unhappy thanks to an anesthetic and throat. Hog is bound to defend himself, Joe is trying to express himself to Marjorie's colleagues (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There is almost a taste of mercy, but it did not come from Marjorie. Should he give his own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and bad language makes R rating. Fawcett is completely out of the responsibility of the tsunts that could last his career forever. Kudos for director Robert M. Young.
