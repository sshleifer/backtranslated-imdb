Western interesting from the director who had a few of the peers in that kind. As well as other images of Anthony Mann, the Far Country combines a potato boiling pot with a skilled environmental impact. All who play between some of the peccadilloes of Mann as respect, perfection, betrayal and of course, death! The story consists of the hunting partners of Jeff Webster [James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} to travel to Oregon and a group of animals. They knew the gold-boom increase, they plan to make a good profit of selling cattle in the town of Klondike. When they got to Skagway they found a judge appointed Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet the right for Webster because of Webster after breaking the law, all because it was true, on the way. With Gannon's punishment they take their partners from them, but they steal and return to the Canadian border with Dawson-and Gannon and his men by following the fire. Here the beautiful women and the beautiful and lawless city will fill out the proposals of all involved. Interesting from the beginning to the end, the Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart's hero fighting and waiting with Mann The best direction of the Borden Chase script. The exhibitions from William H. Daniels are very good, they did not benefit from the current DVD buttons, and the film has a little surprise and "will he do it?" The basis of discovering the audience in. To pay dividends on the re-track of fans of hard colors, it is still something to look at for the first timers to come into the wonderful world, but dark, Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
