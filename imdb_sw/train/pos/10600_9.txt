This is an amazing Ealing comedy for the mid-London community who, through unusual circumstances, finds that it is not English, but is an appendix to the French region of Bourgogne. The title of comic film actor Stanley Holloway (known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), with other players of the past artists of this period. <br /> <br /> The story was based on the news of the time, when the Canadian government "officially" provided a hotel room for a European member of the royal visit. The idea really reminds me of the real life of the Hutt River Region in Western Australia, where the landowner is "bound" from the Australian Government for a cotton crisis. (It has never been accepted by Western Australia or Australia governments). This is a great script that has many political and economic issues, such as the TV show "Yes Minister"; as well as a small piece of piece as well.
