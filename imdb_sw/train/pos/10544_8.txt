Well, "Cube" (1997), the first Vincenzo movie, was one of the most interesting and cunning ideas that I have ever seen when talking about movies. They had only one theme, a group of actors and plot. Therefore, what made it so special is a good trend, good conversation and a wonderful situation in which the characters had to deal like a mouse on the labyrinth. His second movie, "Cypher" (2002), was all about his story, but it was not as good as "Cube" but here the characters are tempted as a mouse again. "No" is a very strange thing and finds Vincenzo to come back to 'Cube' days, fasting again characters in a very different space without playing once again with characters like playing with a mouse in an experienced room . But instead of an exciting sci-fi (even some of the promotional teasers and bad trailers seemed like that), "No" is a free comedy and light that can actually be called satire about our society and also on the world without doubt we live . Once again Vicenzo gives us a great idea in a very small kind of thing. The 2 actors and the whiteness of the blind, that's all you have for most of the time and you need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" combines, "No" is quite the opposite but at the same time it also loses. This video proves again that a meaningful idea means more than just a million budget. Of course the movie fails sometimes, but its basic idea means a lot and causes any mistakes. Nothing else can say about this film because everything is a great surprise and quite different experience I had in the movie since "Cube".
