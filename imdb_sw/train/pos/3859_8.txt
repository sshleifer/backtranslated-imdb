Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (Fourth) is one of the most exciting experiences I've ever seen. In fact it was a good surprise. The story is about the sex writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), since he was fascinated by the good pastor Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in the mistaken ideas of Gerard there may be more stories. Verhoeven and cinematographer cinema Jan De Bont makes a beautiful and thick atmosphere with surreal and sexually touching pictures, this attracts you to the story, you don't want to look, but you can't quit. This is the best film of Verhoeven (maybe just second for Robocop). Really the Fourth person is not for everyone, some of them are sexually free (just ignore them, but believe me, if you look at at least ten minutes you will be cooked. This is one of those films you need to know how it ends, who is the real in the Hitchcock tradition, forcing, confusing and exciting. And even as a model of spiders.
