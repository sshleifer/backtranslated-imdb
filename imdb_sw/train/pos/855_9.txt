This film is amazing. Finally, well-written letters can be good for both good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is a flat-out hysterical in this independent role. I think it's his best thing that has been done. She has done other tasks that showed the shades of this kind of perfect work, but eventually this role gave her the opportunity to run with it. I was about to die when he passed through a hotel lobby in his underwear and shoes. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple of aspiring as well, as actors like too. Kinnear is very happy that at the end of the end is very happy. You give good actors a good job to play with them and give us something more.
