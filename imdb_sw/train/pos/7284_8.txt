When I was young I saw a very small film. My parents in all their wisdom have hired this. I was very worried about what the film was about, I really wasn't even allowed to look at it. My brother and sister went without a doubt and this was very angry with me. So what did I do? Nighttime I used VCR! He chose a TV screen and was called police and information on the vandals. I was arrested for sure, I could not get my foot from the television before the police arrived. I was just given to talk and send him home. My parents undoubtedly emphasized me and made me work on paying TV and VCR debts. This has taken me away, the work of slaves really believe me, but I had to do it. All work around the house. What happened at the end? We have a great TV screen, a DVD player and sound surround system for my work. How did I get money? Easy to make my movies and sell Disney! Do you remember to get the Word? Yes, I wrote the movie and made my gold fish in their fish tanks! They rewrite the plan and did it for CGI because they could not make it a real picture of life as I did! Finally I did not see the film that did not die and the rating I gave is the standard of my life! It does well!
