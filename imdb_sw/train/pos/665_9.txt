"And All Through the House" is a special part of the crypt not only because it is from the first season, but this part was the first I saw! I remember as a young man on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in the hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this part and I was buried on Crypt right and forever! I was a fan of a series of worries and fears and liked the monster movies, and with this series started with HBO I again had a horrible pleasure. This is the first time I have seen it in my memory and one of my favorites, is very happy and beautiful. "And All Through the House" has a very good environment on Christmas Christmas, which is the perfect way to get you relaxed and renting a holiday! Well, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who is in the way he plays in several warning brothers, from time to time) as a silly wife with a debate who keeps her hub while trying to make money with a new romance. It is like many of the series of fears that turn to the worst and worst people to get what they deserve. The barriers were hit when the maniac was wearing Santa flying from the inside house of the nut, doing a holiday at the end of Christmas day! As from the old studies of E.C., you learn bad people to get what they explain! This story ends with a perfect speech! Also this story was in the 1972 movie and shows Joan Collins, this of course one of my favorites and maybe one of the classic crypt episodes of all time!
