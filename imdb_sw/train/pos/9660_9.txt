Just after some meditation I decided that I loved this movie. And after reading the comments from all other posters here, and thinking about it more, I decided that I liked it very much. I love American movies - perhaps because it's a story. They often have a beginning, middle, and end. "Almost," on the other hand, makes the attempt. I disagree with other claims that are also 'too much.' In every way, this film means removing your mental memory. Very often in the film you feel like you are there ... you feel the summer sun, wind, heat, cold winter, corporate, solitude, etc., etc.. In every way, the director connects to the life of the characters - that's why many people feel so strongly that the movie broke them. When I finished checking, I felt the same. But by meditating on some, I realized that this is how the film is supposed to be: the story 'is not a story, it's a feeling you (viewer) feels. The lights, landscape, and camera angles bring you into events - they are rich, beautiful, and live in detail and nuance. Although I usually can't see a film without a continuous plot (after all, it's not a movie 'thought' to tell stories), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
