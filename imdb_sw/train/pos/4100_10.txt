"La Bête" and Walerian Borowczyk depends on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. close. It is a fabled that the former housewife (Sirpa Lane) once had sex against the creature and Lucy finds herself in the dream of the event. "Animal" is a combination of the gallery of fear of surreal, clear sleeve and porno. There is a romantic testimony, assault and perversion in the priesthood, ejaculate a fake lie on the breasts of the bared, masturbation and rose, and beyond everything, of a fun animal with a very incredible phallus. However this really interesting film is photographed and unpleasant. The women here are very beautiful and naked over time. Every "La Bête" is a feel feast. Even if it is from a fetishistic precaution and information, or an exhibition based on information, the Borowczyk interpreter should be carefully considered and prioritized. You must see for fans of the European cult movies.
