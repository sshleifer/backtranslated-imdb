Mysterious mysterious .... this has all: deception, good fighting events, gore, action, explosions etc. It also has a beautiful star of Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as another inspector said - although Olga returns to Ingrid later in the film (you will need to watch to see what I mean). I will not bother to go into a story if it's too long standing and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and his brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is amazing - look at the fabric to steal the area to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fight of the fight was very good and then destroyed by some really shoddy fact that the effects that were seen were made by a team that made the City of Dead Walkers (that is, an unusual color of blood coming out of the wounds the neck. I would like to advise the fans of low-budget waste to check if they can track the copy - although it is very rare and I did not see anyone bothering it again so you'll have to be more mature in a few years. <br /> <br /> However I just recommend it for Belinda Mayne's great nude scenes! The woman is a fox!
