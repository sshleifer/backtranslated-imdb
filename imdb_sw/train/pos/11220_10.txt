Aim for Top! Gunbuster is one of the series of anime that has classic written everywhere. I really liked this series, and to this day, it's still my favorite anime. And when it was not the first product of Gainax, it was their first OVA series. Starting as a game of the 1970s game Ace Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster takes steam as a huge drama towards the end of part 2, while Noriko Takaya has to raise the death of the father his, who was killed during the encounter with the human race and the human race is in battle. It is because of the death of his father that Noriko wants to be an attempt to fight. But his lack of self-confidence shows that it goes in a way sometimes and decreases. His friend, Kazumi Amano, even has a doubt about Noriko being appointed as a pilot. However, Noriko coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in him. And he has done his own work to see that he is successful as a winner, because he was the winner of the battle where Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, Russian anti-attempts to serve with the Noriko and Kazumi squad of Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who has been killed in their departure, with Kimiko Higuchi, a friend of Noriko's childhood. Kimiko's participation is also of interest, while Noriko is far away, Kimiko sits back in the world to live a normal life. And because of the long-term actions, the old Kimiko size for the World when Noriko is the same age and when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is 18 years old when Kimiko is in the middle of 50 years. For all, this is the best series of anime watching if you're a fan of big mecha and Gainax animation animation. If you like other Hideaki Anno performances, or a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto, then show this position. It will grow on you.
