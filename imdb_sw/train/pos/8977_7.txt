If this film has a little 4-bit but for the film's 1940 fans, it is almost a must-see with 9 levels as different show! I was attracted to this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) who plays Colonel responsible for the event. What is surprising is the wonderful performance of Doris's Day. Out of 'Calamity Jane', I have never seen him put on a better song than he does here. Randolph Scott also did not remember him, even if he does not see the time of multiple screens. It has been time since I saw the movies but I was sure that Humphrey Bogart has put in appearance. For many familiar faces, it is difficult to keep track. If it turns to a television station near you, make sure you get a Doris Day, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
