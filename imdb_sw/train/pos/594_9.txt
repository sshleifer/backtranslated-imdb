The 13th day of Glory describes the traditional story and mercy towards the Mexican opinion. The main problem in this movie is that when the cowboy actress James Arness played part of Jim Bowie persuasively, other actors in Brian Keith's planned (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were very old. Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna for grace and respect for professional guards who after all won the war. The area where he charges his officers for failing to strengthen the guards and the sortee is one of the authors who did not understand. Failure to monitor is a major military force. Santa Anna was in his ability to become angry. Raul Julia dealt with the poor text through the area. Kathleen York was very beautiful Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be reminded of her courage. However, Kathleen York could be reminded that if Dickinsons hailed from Pennsylvania prefer to dis not sound too much Southron.
