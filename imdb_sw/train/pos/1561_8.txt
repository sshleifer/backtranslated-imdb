I enjoyed this part. See Flash, Cyborg, Red Cursor, and Aquaman (though all he did was swimming) made my eyes expand. To see many of the founders of the League of Justice try to try to bring Lex Luthor what I have been waiting for. This seems a little away from the topic, but making the live action of the Justice League right will definitely have a reason to push everything that I usually do during the week under just running a single look. This is the joy I have received from watching this section. I wish they made this piece for a long time, like two special hours, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League is not enough. Now before promoting you (unless you already ran) I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. It's a kind of losing touch when the show started focusing on Lana. But I am sure the authors will only fall into that hole of the loop. :( Please enjoy this period.Who knows what a good time it will come out on this Thursday, February 22, if you have lost first.
