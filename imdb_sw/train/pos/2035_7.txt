Well, I'll go against the grain on this film so it seems. Being a horrible fan I have witnessed sitting under this I do not know exactly what to expect. After two or three hundred years I found myself afraid (very rare). The film has a small budget and has been set up around the cross-stations but the movies don't underestimate the story. Yes the story is very small and not well-known but CREEP is a class act and keeps slashing and breaking anything that comes. MESSAGE FOR MONEY !!! There are parts of PHILIP that you want to make your sores in the world in the world in your future! you will understand when you see. <br /> <br /> All in all beautiful films and makes a change to see a beautiful movie of the slasher which really scary
