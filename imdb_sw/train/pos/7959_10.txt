This is a realistic movie! I remember the first time when I was very young and I was watching all the time as once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Bound Homeward is very funny and it's very cool how they teach animals to do all these things. The parts of the movie are sad though (such as Sassy, ​​cats, fall under the waterfall, and when the Shadow is in the hole at the end.) I have witnessed the second Second Homeward but I see it not as good as first. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedi, or animals to talk. This is one of my top ten movies to love!
