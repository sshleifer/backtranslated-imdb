This movie is very fun to watch if you like films of a sort of crime. Those who are looking for a criminal film with charismatic leadership and dreaming of taking the wrong way may have little desire and how this film goes on. It is a pleasure to enjoy a less than criminals yet you don't know Hong Kong movies, then you might be surprised at this. I was disgraced by some of the choices made by the wisdom of the story but generally a good criminal film. Other things were not meaningful but it seems to be common with Eastern films. People are doing things for us regardless of how their lives were put before. It is a small example of widespread despair even in this film.
