Tintin was one of my famous heroes as a child. I used to borrow books from the school library every chance I got. I liked it very much the "Red Sea" - many steps and humor. This document was a great commentary of Herge's history and its development of Tintin. The personal experience of the filmmaker when interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the influence of Chan's behavior was moving very much. A great talent of a very talented artist and very popular. A great example of a man who has been known internationally, has brought the happiness of millions of children (and young hearts) around the world.
