This was one of the highlights of ST: the second season of TNG, before 'growing' or growing on their own third season and more. This was not just to show to the top people and members like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it is also continuing to search for data for its 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. It is still one of my favorite sessions. To remember, I am disappointed that there is no loan for an actor whose Okona character was close to trying (after Teri Hatcher's behavior) before being interrupted by rudely by Lt Worf. I remember watching this part 'first run' in my friends' shop on the day and we all would think she could be a perfect girl of Gray Jean / Marvel. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful woman is actually ...
