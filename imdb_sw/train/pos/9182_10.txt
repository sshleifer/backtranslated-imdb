Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do (it's my favorite all the time, and I'll read it at least once a year) I will love this edition. Timothy Dalton is also very good to be Mr. Rochester, but moreover, he does a wonderful job showing the master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may be too young to play Jane, 18, but when I watch this movie, I don't think about the age of the characters. Discussion from the film is taken next to the words from the book, which was very good. Indeed, this film can be seen for a long time, but it is the only version that I have said that comprises part 3 of the story. I wish the people who made this film were included in the new Zeferelili version, as it would have helped to become a mess of the film. I realized the last time I watched this video which Judy Cornwell has "Aunt Reed"! He is so mixed that I didn't recognize him. She plays Daisy in Considering Appearance, and also played Mrs Musgrove in the Influence of 1995 (another positive pass). UPDATE: You got a DVD this week, and it's amazing to see the original version of the original. There is much more at the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and For Lowood.) And lastly, they have brought back many things, (I always wondered why St. John had an intervention paper when he revealed who knows who Jane is - because the part where she dropped from His painting was altered out of the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in her ... she was completely cut off by VHS. As far as I could say, they had no part of Timothy Dalton's parts, so there is nothing new there, but it's good to see the whole service in full after all the years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, the BBC (PS ... I can pay more for a special edition of DVD ... and maybe interviews with stars ... or perform the performances)
