The basic story here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is a spoiled child of Millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in the eyes of Ishwar his son Aditya cannot do anything wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring her son to the way before the delay, for Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and has only 9 months of life, when her child is giving and marrying Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar forgives Aditya easily, but when a happy couple Aditya and Mitali comes back from by day, Mitali is pregnant, and this has caused Ishwar to capture Aditya out of the house to make her more responsible, Aditya does not know her father has lung cancer, and also does not know that her father has run out of the hose to make her more responsible , Ishwar cannot pretend to Aditya long that she is about to die, and a hungry and pregnant wife. it's running over time so Aditya does all he can to prove to her father, and the peak comes when Aditya gets a great break in the film industry and her father tells her that she will die. <br /> This movie is quite brilliant, this is a success in Indian movies which was needed for the sound industry, Shah's leadership is almost innocent, but which film is not wrong? The best part like this movie is a dad father relationship which is tears. The interactive song is only set at a good time, the environment is good, the only place where this movie fails is the place where jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav jokes are very long and after a little sad, but generally this is a brilliant movie, I advise anyone to read this review to go and watch it regardless of other views. 9/10
