Wow, this film was quite brilliant. I don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought that speed was perfect. The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks and perfection who is a kind of hit-man / killer works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). She loves this job but she does it because Rooney paid her home and helped her financially. He had something and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, his children do not know that this is his job, and when someone who witnessed the bloody murder, he is placed in an extraordinary position. And when the shock comes, it goes with her son and is responsible for revenge. They carry loads and much more to build a bond. They are a perfect team. Hanks performs a good job as always with Jude Law who plays his role to be completed in full. These drawings are highly recommended as they show good news and show how the 1930s were.
