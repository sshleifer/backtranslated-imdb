I've never seen Barbara Steele the movie that I didn't like, and have always sucker for a good haunted house story (especially for a wonderful picture such as "Legend of Hell House" and previous versions of "Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill "), so I was feeling that" Castle of blood "would be right on my farm. And the boy, it was forever! This French-Italian coproduction, when perhaps not the classic that Steele's first filming trail, "Black Sunday," to this day, is however much atmosphere, a great entry into Ghana spook. Other in black and white, so that expresses sincerely creepy miasma. The film refers to a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and a writer named Edgar Allen Poe could spend the night in the Blackwood fortress of the Night of All Saints, while the souls of those killed in the castle drown their fate. The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they are very good, for the most part. The film does not really send shivers up the spine, and in the uncut DVD that I have watched - thanks to fine folks in Synapse - even an amazing topless scene with some terrific grinding! And Barbara is amazing in this film; Its other beauty of the world is made for the benefit of playing the specter of compassion. His unique presence will come into the story of creepy spirit in something that is certainly remembered. It is not because he is called "Queen of Terror."
