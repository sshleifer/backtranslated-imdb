I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role for the innovation and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is taken to a strict step to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being denied by the police he knows he is alone. Then one day when he was home alone the visitor entered his home and encouraged him again. Not contacting the police or expelling him is forced to blind his eyes and put him in prison. I think there is a need to raise the laws of the country. They are very easy for these criminals. It's time for the most severe punishment.
