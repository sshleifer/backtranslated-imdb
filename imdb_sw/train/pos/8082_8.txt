It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. Now I hunt hunting copies. Bakshi's work is absolutely true for the original work. Exhibitions are engrosing and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Object? From time to time, the movie is confused or solved. There is once or twice where the storyline decreases by crawling. But, in general - buy this film. It is good for children, adults and collectors.
