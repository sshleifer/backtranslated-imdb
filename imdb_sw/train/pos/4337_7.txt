I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use too much dirt for any reason. Maybe that's his idea of ​​"adult" film, many bad words and humor of the bathroom cast? I thought better with him and I think under him for this film. The Falk Act and other humorous moments with some important possible themes are what made me give this high amount. <Br /> <br /> This may be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh on their own people and their foibles. But the lack of consideration for the families of the listener greatly undermines what can be a family film but fails. Certainly not worth spending money, though it may be worth looking for free on television.
