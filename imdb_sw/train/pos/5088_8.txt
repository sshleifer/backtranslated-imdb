I have never had inkling when I look at a movie that meant the idiot box. I always thought that this was a very good movie of the achievements of the late 90s. The thing that applies to me is the length. I felt that one in one local battle must be removed if it was not absolutely necessary. Also, it started to pull to the end as it looks like an adventure has never ended. On the other hand, there is a strong, very interesting and interesting plot and good performances for everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze appeared a little haggard. I also heard that Gogool, who seemed to complain, turned to stupidity in certain instances. I was happy with the beautiful African landscape. Also, the first half of the film would have made it to this movie 9. However, its great film for television. 8 out of 10.
