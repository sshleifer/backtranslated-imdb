This is a very common western west, which is made especially original because of its story which revolves around the unique and advanced guns of Winchester 1873 and all those who can put it at one time or another in the movie. > <br /> It is especially a movie of entertainment to watch but without being still real west too. The film has been made of '40's /' 50 style of making the western genre, so lovers of the kind should not turn off its basic size size. <br /> <br /> Because the gun is actually a great device of a movie, it allows the story to follow many characters in the movie, all of which are connected without doubt and the story makes a perfect circle at the end. Without this film it would be very frightening, since the information often jumps from one dangerous event to another, and different characters are quite involved. It's amazing how they could even put Wyatt Earp in all of this. But not to reject the truth. I liked that the film and his story was original and how the movie seemed to shift from one event to another. Give them a little movie feeling of adventure and entertainment. It is also a very good movie looking at. I liked the movie settings used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the first director of Anthony Mann. Fortunately he would continue to orient further west, which also often would be the star James Stewart in the main direction to the top of the principal. He is one of the most watchful and respectful actors, so throwing him as a tough gunslinger looks like a little extraordinary option. But Stewart is amazingly awesome as a tough guy and shows how blending and really capable as an actor he really had. It also has other amazing actors in the film, which is not often connected to this type. Shelley Winters leads the female and later known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis are seen in other small roles. Evening real and also a lot of actions and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
