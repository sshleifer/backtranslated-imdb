Miriam Hopkins is a "mother with red hair" in this 1940 biopic of Ms. Leslie Carter which also starring Claude Plants like David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a good player of helping players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. Miriam Hopkins and the Rain of Claude provides good performances. Hopkins was a good actor who makes us feel at Mrs. Carter. Rain is as good as the composer, author / actor / journalist David Belasco, one of the main titles in the theater. Although Mrs. Carter's second wife, Lou Payne, has served as an adviser on this film, is a poor representation of Mrs Carter's real life. Actually, there was a well-known and painful divorce, and of course he seemed to be a scandal character for being an actor. However, he had a guarantee of his son Dudley, so there was no war. Once broke with Belasco, he did not return to him and, in fact, began to work in the vaudeville and actually made several films towards the end of his life. She actually took Lou, and she became her leading man in many crops. Mrs. Carter's power at the beginning of this film also retains her baby's storage, but eventually she knows that in her time away from her, she is completely bound by her father. In the film also (and I do not know if it was true in real life) he traveled with his mother and lived in an exhibition board, which gives a film that has added an interesting atmosphere. It is not a bad movie, maybe not the image of Carter's or Belasco. One of the most popular moments of Mrs. Carter was in Maryland's heart, where she was wearing a wig and six-foot tresses. Off-stage, fans hit his hair as he hung 35 feet on the clutching point of the bell in order to leave it from ringing. Unseen.
