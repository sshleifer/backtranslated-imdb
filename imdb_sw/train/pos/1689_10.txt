This movie is a Halloween in which the story of "Christmas" consisting of christmas is both Christmas: both are a small budget, not a big-name-star film types ... and both are the great and funniest movies available, both season CLASSICS! !! "The invaders who refused" come out from the beginning with the warmth and humor and good inspiration of the characters ... All five Martians, Klembecker Realtor, Russell's deputy, Vern in "depot to send oil" and much more! You only need to see this film to believe, and, like "Christmas stories", it just keeps getting better and better by looking at each other, and you take many small things every time !! IN TEN TRAINING!
