Neil Simon's stupid player who gives an impression from beginning to end. Last Walter Matthau is a former grouchy player who has joined his former boyfriend (winner of Oscar George Burns) for the final show of cooperation on stage. Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and two have chemicals such as Matthau and Burns. I love the behavior of grumpy matches - he is the same as he is always, and is still very different. Fire, like a person who is not interested, is like Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Tales: Want crackers? I have had coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burning: What about a cracker open? Matthau: I am not clear. I have had coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burning: Similar <br /> <br /> Matters: They inside the kitchen cabinets. <br /> <br /> Burning: Maybe later. Why / why about this: When I was black, whites knew what I said! You have to see it on the film to understand it! All in all, interesting, pleasant, hearty, warm, attractive and appealing and some quotes that are not always remembered. <br /> <br /> Never get again like this again! When all new comedies lack, young and ignorant, this relies on the basis of the tender of the comedy does really - delightful characters, smart and wonderful conversation, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best girls of all time, above and "Birds, Trains and Cars," "Lethal Weapons," and "Good Way." You can have a hard time getting this by renting or on TV, but you believe me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> star 4.5 / 5 <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
