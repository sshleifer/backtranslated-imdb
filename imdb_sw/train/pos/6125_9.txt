Okay, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought myself, this looks attractive. I hire and I take home. The boy was right, it's interesting. They put the soul of a common killer in a dream, in a dead walk and within every machine of the day. But this should be the only place to put the soul of the serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I loved all the pictures of snow-shaped scenarios, the owner of the alcohol, the world of snow, etc.. I love the actor who played Jack, he was happy with the killer who had never seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's the same "cool" level. I would like some of the effects of the puppet were better, the movement of the mouth could fit well. But I find myself up to a small budget. Sent there a great job, there are some great and awesome liners to make any fan of horror fly. All and all, great stories, good effect, good talk and cast. I HAVE JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
