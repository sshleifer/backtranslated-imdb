When my daughter's old school was in school, these services were seen in A & E from 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I made a contract that we could not lose in the minutes of Jane Eyre and our children had been late for school early each week. Good choice. I would never forget how I loved this movie until I came out of my old VHS copy soon. Timothy Dalton is very good, but it's still perfect as Rochester. The face of the dark, craggy, the odds that had humor and gentleness were the same from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little bit, I couldn't sit through the stars to deal with the wimpy William Hurt or Ciaran Hinds of grumpy. Magic here is that women love Dalton and are found in romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what of Zelah Clarke. He died like Jane, quiet, formal, saying much but to look. Shining in his eyes gives observers a strong view of the spirit and nature of the spirit that has helped Jane to live the harassment of youth. The advice of its performance as "timber" is lost. An employee in a good English household could have a similar attitude, but he speaks enthusiastically while feeling. Unlike many other Janes screen, it seems clear that Jane is still pretty enough to allow the audience to buy the Rochester attraction to him. The Bronte dialogue is a great part of why the book continues the script continues very much of this stable. Dalton and Clarke take the cooperation between Jane and Rochester in balance and stability. Although Jane seems to be clear and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to fear the dark, blustery Rochester. They both play each other in beauty. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect match of the best novel romance ever.
