This is not a bad movie. It follows a new meeting of modern fear, which is a movie in the movie, a well-known actor who runs his life in the first place. This movie takes over an old psychologist contracting free, and manages to do something new, and attract it. It is also good to see Molly Ringwald back to attack. So this can be an example of what the genre has been. Cut cut all the symbols, and really scary a part. I liked I gave him eight.
