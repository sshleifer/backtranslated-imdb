Since this film was the basis of a true story of a woman who had two children and was not healthy, it was just awesome how true it was! Acting is what gave you a film that comes in size. Diane Keaton demonstrated the main character, Patsy McCartle who had two sons who distracted. His performance is what made the real story of life on the television screen. It was very difficult to watch some events since they were as real as what happens when someone becomes addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just look at this mother very loving from sweet and not caring at all it was difficult, but it's true. I know people who have gone to cancel and it was similar to what happened in this film, from what I remember. I also thought it was too dangerous for the director to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. However it was done well. I praise the director of this film. I recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has been addicted to drugs or just learned what might happen to you if you become addicted to them.
