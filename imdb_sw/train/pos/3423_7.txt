Do not expect the "true" sign. However, these accounts of these veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. The great power of the film is that it clearly shows the words and wounds of these vets and their post-war battles to rebuild a certain standard of life and performance in their lives. My major films are two: it is one side and emphasizes anti-war activism but nothing more to fix the major deficiencies of military and Veterans 'forces for helping those who' ve suffering and still faced the trouble of war. These are not bad films. As an old man, I know that after the horror of war is real, and these young men and young women describe very well. These vets describe the physical and mental pain and suffering which many of the former veteran experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the fear of all wars is surprising and offensive.
