Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just watched seven pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. The man explains a lot of human feelings. This movie was skillful and well done. It is not available to get humanity as sharp today in Hollywood. I would like to compare with "Lost in front" and "Crash" off to show light and darkness in such a raw form. Certainly includes you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and enthusiasm on movies like this. It is not one of the "bad end" but instead of a true seeker involving feelings, raw life and something more than an infinite shortage. So I don't care about a little pain at the end. It is true for life that no one always ends up happy. Sometimes his justice is not the end you think you should be. Many people were able to live a happy life while the love and life of one was lost. If you are a person who looks much deeper than others you like this movie!
