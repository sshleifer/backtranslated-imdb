First of all I am a bed, a white white male. But even with this disability I like this movie. It's about real people. Real time and place. And in fact, New York City in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in eight years and one thing about them being always accepted is their courage to live their lives as they wanted to live. No matter what results. That's courage. You need to love it. This is a good film, look at and find what it was like to be a colored African or Spanish Gay in New York's nineties. It's a real life. Below is the real life.
