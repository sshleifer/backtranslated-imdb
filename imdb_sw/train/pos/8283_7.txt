B solid B. <br /> <br /> I love Jake Weber. Its low delivery is comforting during the top performances. I loved the relationship between father and son. I loved family dynamics. Wendigo looks for ignorance, but it is a representation of a kid's kid and a dead animal. Is such a solidarity, see? This is a psychological story, not Freddy who gives him the money to promote it on the spot. Look and reflect on your inner child and what movie can be with you and you will be well. <br /> <br /> Good work.
