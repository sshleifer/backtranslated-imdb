I saw this by running with U.S and I was a little worried as a few people said there were many characters inside that you didn't know any of them. However I have not found this. The film is fast, but this comes from the situation of the director and star. Monitoring events are ideal and can be predictable but not true of many films. The main villain is a bit of cuts, Christopher Eccelston is not as persuasive as he could have, but he said yet a good film.
