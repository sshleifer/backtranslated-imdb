<br /> <br /> This movie is off one of my favorites. I saw it at the university in the early 90s, and when I could not recognize and thirty in the film, I felt that stories, characters, and films were generally high scores. For people who said badly of the Indian Summer, feel free to connect with your many movies of Armageddon and leave the movies and beautiful stories, for those who can appreciate them.
