This movie is a perfect picture of Nutcracker; The dance is amazing, the back setting was excellent, and I liked to decorate BED. Oh, and dress ... I really liked Marzipan, the suit was so interesting. Special effects were done well (e.g. tree, bed, etc.), and I enjoyed the mouse. I like how they did not make them afraid, but they are interesting and pleasant. Except for the king, I think. <br /> <br /> If you are a complete man, you will not enjoy this, but this is a very good movie that is good for all ages - not all levels of testosterone. But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why were they supposed to put a girl of fairy Plum in those bad tights? It would be difficult to make a difference if you were naked naked! And second .. why on the country were supposed to do the dress of Culkin's PINK?
