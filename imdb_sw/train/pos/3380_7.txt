I've seen false tons of science from the 70s; some of the worst worries, and others thought they were provoking and fearing the truth. Green Green fits in the last category. Yes, sometimes it's a little college, and yes, the furniture is good for a player or two, but some films seem to be very strange. Here we have a film, 9 years prior to the Blade Eater, which tries to imagine the future as a dark, scary, and nihilistic somthing. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are traveling better than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's suicide area is characterized by Kevorkian and its ilk. Among the perspectives are dated (you can think the film manufacturer leaves with "women like furniture" fancy in our 90-oh-politics-correct?), But it's pleased to get a film from the Decade Me which can really make you think. This is one I would like to see on the big screen, because even in the mirror setting, I don't think the overall scope of this film will get its payment. See.
