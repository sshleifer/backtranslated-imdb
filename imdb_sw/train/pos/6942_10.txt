In fifty years old Brazilian age restrictions were the following: no obstruction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. and usually see western sanctions for less than 18. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think this describes very well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart was fighting against his brother who killed their father. He was seeking to take revenge and seemed to be in trouble, away from the good man. Anthony Mann tried differently on this kind of behavior in the following films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading woman was far from good, continued to follow a man with a gun. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those adult offenders who will always remember. The story of the film, which follows every person who sits with the gun, is one of the best in the west. It was done by Fritz Lang's film, which did not come through. When it was given to Mann made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything to be prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different pregnancy in the west, but still keeps all his traditions. Winchester is still a good film to see again and again, but nothing will be similar to the feeling made by those who saw it when it was originally released.
