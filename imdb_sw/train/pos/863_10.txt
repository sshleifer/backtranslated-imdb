I took part in this film from first to last minute. It is shot, with lots of interesting and original cameras and hired methods. The plan is around a blind woman who is taken by friends and colleagues alike. He employs an assistant, and his true intent is to find love. He is an old man and is benefiting from him for revenge on those who hurt him. In return he must help him with a heist that requires his reading skills to remove it. The film goes through a white film film, with beautiful realistic events, and even more. The real beauty of this film comes from the beneficiary of the leading behaviors of leading behavior. The use of voice makes the tension stabilized, and the change from silence to noise continues to pump blood, indeed. The throwing of a little comedy and a small black sexual abuse has a good film mark. It's a kind of Hollywood film really wants to do, but it can't.
