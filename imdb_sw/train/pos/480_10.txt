The basic feature of this film that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. Many people have seen this film and do not get it, and I don't understand why. While watching this film I was taken on a private journey that surrounded me. I will try to explain this without any damage, but show, I will talk about things happening in the film. **** Spoilers possible **** Enabled! **** <br /> <br /> He is a life of "great action" against "small steps". She chooses Natalia to be her Queen, and she and she acts as much as her aunt first described the King and Queen and their action when she told Chess as a young man. Listen closely to these details. When someone asks him a question, he stimulates in the past as through previous steps. (Flashbacks are very good, by the way.) Flashbacks are very interesting too, because they are not only his opinion as a child, but the attitude of another character as well. It's amazing. The various actors become his assistants or his enemies, pawns, bishops and contractors, whose actions allow you to continue. Even their placement is important to understand what's going on. Well done. I will not comment more on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope that this will highlight what happens next. <br /> <br /> This film works frequently on many levels, that's why I approve it. It was a treat and happy look. <br /> <br /> If you like this film I would like to recommend a film called Fresh. The only way these films are the same is the use of chess and characters used as pieces. <br /> <br />
