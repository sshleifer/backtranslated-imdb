Be honest and say that I haven't seen many independent films, but I thought this had done well. The trends and movies were emerging without trouble. Horns, settings, and lights used efficiently created the night of the night where the main character is closed. Many haunting pictures and memorable from the film stick in your mind long after the top (always a sign of a good director).
