I thought this was one of the best movies I have seen for so long. It was a line of great stories and showed that people are hard at all kinds of different ways. You suggested to all my friends! I always enjoy the good story line and this film has one of the best I've ever seen. I felt I had a daughter and did things like Natalie did to find out more about her life and love. It showed how we are not just living with our families; but we also have a part of our lives that we do not share with - as it may be legitimate to know all the details of what we do not boast about. I hope the other film, and I will keep my eyes out.
