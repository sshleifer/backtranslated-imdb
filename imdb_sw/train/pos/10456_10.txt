This movie is not about entertainment, or even the movies you want to see when. This movie is actually showing true love that can only come from God. One cannot help but touch deeply by watching this film. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the love of the God of God that has been shown well. The love of God reduces the heart and mind and endures and is eternal. There is love in marriage. When the main character faces his wife's disease, he knows through God's love that he loves his wife more than he could think. He knows that he and his wife are one and they can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of the child and the parent. Children in the family come together and realize that there is nothing else except that love overcomes fear. Beloved, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love is useless unless you are given another. I am asking this movie to encourage and change the life of everyone who sees it. Amina !!
