This is a real character and story driven by a story at a very low level of what we see on TV. I was attracted from the beginning. Do not remove if it is not a sci sci nut (if I ...) This may be happening in the world, the fact that in the other galaxy makes it only to show it more interesting. No shipping of space or laser guns (No, however) I have now seen up to s01 e04 and I have been asked what will happen next if there is too much. <br /> <br /> Sent to play there roles and pasion. Eric stoltz is very powerful. <br /> <br /> This show really stands alone well, no matter if you look at BSG or not, it's really quite different. I have read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected a small player and more visitors with guns but I would tell them to ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a good start of the show. Hope that they do not want after 1 or 2 season as usual they do for the best performances these days.
