I would like to restore this film to everyone. Not only for Luciano Ligabue fans, but for all of the films. Because it is true, moving, funny and real. Because Ligabue is a storyteller and lover of film, and each image of his film is made in love and service. Because its characters loved and asked to be loved. Because many of the first Italian movies are beautiful and this, made by a stranger, is a real pleasure to watch and listen. Because Stephen Accorsi is good and he reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, as a freccia, good and talented and beautiful and lost his life because of heroin, which Ligabue shows whether it is, without beauty and bad, without engaging in simple values. Because it is a film that speaks with our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived on FM radio experience and it was the same. Thank you, Luciano!
