It has never watched this film and enjoy singing and playing with Cagney and other members organized: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great voice with Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney has a role as Chester Kent who writes music and eventually comes to produce Prologues which is displayed among the films featured on the movie movies during the 1930s. This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and a lot of laugh. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great responsibility to help who was too young and beautiful. Dick Powell was as good as a singer and player and just started with his long and successful career of the screen. Enjoy.
