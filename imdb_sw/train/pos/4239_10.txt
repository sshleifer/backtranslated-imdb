My investigation: After the war. Tom Drake and Agogo from "Meet me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton good as always; The smallest part of the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington the prettier way, also with the needs of a small perky missing nose and Hamilton. Part of the tent to the end and the old boy who was near his house was hilarious. As a two-year-old Army, he seemed to be a good and inexperienced young man when I looked at his eyes. I was working in a department store, and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, it has disappeared and the fall into the tranquility. We were famous for the great show windows used to lose passers into the shop, to give them to buy all these beautiful products. <br /> <br /> 10/10
