This is one of those movies you want to see before - so you can see them again "for the first time". Van Dine's books still bring pleasure - but they are known as many flowers and many. This film is much better to deal with the film's works. William Powell is William Powell - don't say more. The plan is tough. The story goes very fast, because you want to be the end. Enjoy.
