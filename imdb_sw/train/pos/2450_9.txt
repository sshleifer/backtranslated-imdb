I've been watching this show since I was 14 years old and I have loved it since then. I love this show because it's very easy! You will enjoy this show because it shows you something new and funnier every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has his last comment on George after a punchline on his head a big fat * laughs * I laugh and I'd like to watch with my friends at home it would be like we were looking at a beautiful but short movie. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, interesting. This is a series of cool-funny-family-friendly comedy for everyone and you will enjoy it all - I did it! And if you look at I still advise you to start watching because you don't want to stop watching. Even though there are no new signs of new events I still enjoy running. It's still funny. Never put it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
