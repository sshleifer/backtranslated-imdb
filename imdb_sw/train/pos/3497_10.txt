One more of the intellectual young men who went out and struggled to make a boy film (would I call it? - it would have asked the devil out of his fans) on a small budget but it was full of such flavor, feeling and maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve the most interesting and respectful. These are once again to show the power that is located in the "industry" that the exhibition can be closed under the toilet. One place, a few of the rich characters, a low budget, a good acting (and also amateurs), a beautiful lighting - the true worshipers of the indie movies should look beyond this and stop watching ... well ... you know what.
