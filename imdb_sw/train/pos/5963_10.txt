This movie is awesome, but you should see it because of it. I'm not here to discuss the whole film, just monitor the location of an eternity. When Eddie refuses milk on Tim, he gets out of the hallway. Eddie places restrictions on joining the bad results (like the right trumpet player, buying a DVD and looking at it). The best obstacle is a string of bulk in which one jock jumps up but continues to move down the door. But when it slides the slides takes speed so they refuse physics (especially friction); but what is behind the door is great. The stairestest case in any school ever, which this jock continues to appear in the air. In fact he would have died in a broken neck. Not only does he ignore all the true ideas, makes the funniest noise ever done in that situation. Go and buy this. Believe me this place is worth your money 6.
