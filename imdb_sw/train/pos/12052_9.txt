I saw this on the TV a long time ago that I can't remember when it was, but it still seems to be one of the most horrible films, which are not available. At the same time the fear of the strongest but very powerful and the woman with the black color of the shape, is not quite clear, so as to make it (like the hero of the counsel), don't be sure if it is her mind or not. It is also one of the few films that have helped me so much to fear. "Production ethics" is posted, a good film is about the ability of the director to create the atmosphere by using film, actors, places / sets, music, attention and notes, and ... ideas. The real Gem.
