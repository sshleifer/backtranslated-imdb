I did not read through all comments, but at least one poster explained that the 30-minute version could be closed. I testify about myself because the future parts of the film were not very important to me even when I gave them again. 30 minutes seems to be very short for film in 1917 as well. "The richest little girl" which was the second Tourneur film is 65 minutes long and "Family Glory" which was its original feature was 84 minutes long. So I am tired of seeing that I was not mad, it should be part of this film not available and that's why the resolution did not make sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to go through or comment on a movie that you can only see half of ... but I would like to recommend this film however with a very interesting view that gives us the insides of the East Coast studio studio . It is the first film I saw personally that depends on the film industry itself. The main character is a film star played by Robert Warwick, who was later a popular Hollywood actress and appeared near all the Preston Sturges' films. He plays the western actor perhaps correctly describing William S. Hart, whose Warwick is somewhat similar. After a very interesting series on the studio we see them at the shooting area where she gets a girl of the country (Doris Kenyon) and persuades her to come to New Jersey for a screening screen that is very progressive. After that the film appears to be no part of the form we have now. Again, I would like to recommend to anyone who wants the history of the film for the value of the document, but for the form it is not very useful as a movie and not a very good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
