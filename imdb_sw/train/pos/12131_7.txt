The film refers to Philip (Leslie Howard) he is a student of the drug but has a disability. He falls in love with an unkind, hateful servant named Mildred (Bette Davis). At the same time he is rumana with other heroes (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but he turns back into something that is damaged. The first and first of many films of the novels of Somerset Maugham novels. Bette Davis as a strong cockney striker with another wonderful victory and a breathtaking and breathing experience, with a complete feeling in his slave account that happens from beginning to end. improper woman will be repeated several times after work. Leslie Howard as a good and respectful student who destroys it provides excellent performance and combination. He was an amazing actor (He went with the wind) instead of a producer and writer and he died of a plane crash during WWII. Both will begin playing again in (Forestry (1936). The sky film has been restored in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio. He joined 1946 by Edmund Goulding, and Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and 1964 by Ken Hughes and Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The motion of the motion will like buffs of ordinary movies. Rating: Very good but slightly.
