Insert Inside was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was funny on many levels from crazy dress to hilarious conditions. Acting was good. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all others did amazing work. Because it is an independent film written by the author of the first time, it does not clich√©s which are expected from other girls, which was a pardon. It was unique and interesting and you love with love and characters with a heart-stirring story. Did I hear it was the basis of a true story? If so, then that's hilarious (and amazing!). I strongly recommend this film.
