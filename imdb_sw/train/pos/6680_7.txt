This was different, that's true. Just look cast! Talk about oddballs. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were stars, although a group of actors almost participated in the victory, in this area about superheroes. More fraudsters played by Paul Reubens of the popularity of "Pee Wee Herman." There is a lot of humor, color color and column. It is a delightful, irregular fun but the goofy characters, all who want to be heroes for Superman, Batman, Spiderman, your name. They have talent in wonderful places, however, that real heroes do not (and do not want!). It's silly, but you know that it continues. <br /> <br /> It is also a film that you can watch in the cyclic phase and do not miss any promotions. It's a long movie for one, so take a break here and there's the same. Language was so bad that children could enjoy this, too. In fact, I do not remember any swear here, except the guy in the playground next to me who kept saying, "What dumb, f-movie." I thought it was fun at two but I would like to look at the DVD and take a few breaks.
