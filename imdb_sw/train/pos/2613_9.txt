This film would probably get 7 or 8 from me to tell you if I have seen trailers or I had any kind of knowledge of what the film is about. Since it was close to all the surprise it was a good place of edgy entertainment which gets 9 power from me. I read through some comments briefly and saw that someone else had the same experience as me and she just advised to look at it. It was good advice. Read others for your risk of damage. Eva Mendez has a powerful TV player, successful and hungry who took a dragon made by a co-worker when thought of the TV program to stimulate the brain about Russian Roulette seriously. The story follows her in the text style on her movements to make it happen.
