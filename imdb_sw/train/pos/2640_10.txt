In fact, not many people have seen this film, because no one presents any more comments. This is not a lost movie. After all, it has won George Peabody Award and Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should win awards for his amazing performance in this film. Eugene Logan who was a collaborator of this partnership made for TV movies also was part of another movie on humanity, or lost, to become a technical consultant of the movie Truman Capote of Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will send another letter describing how Eugene Logan was a technical adviser to the movie of an amazing person like Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will find a way to see these two movies.
