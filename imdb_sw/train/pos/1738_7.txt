This is a hilarious film. Burt Reynolds is a star NASCAR who signifies a warranty contract with Nick Beatty's Nick Beatty restaurants. The contract has all kinds of stress in it, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) the general contractor. Lon Anderson (oh, yes!) Offered by Beatty to keep Reynolds loyal and connected to the contract. This is a wonderful film that Burt proves that he is not very proud. I wish!
