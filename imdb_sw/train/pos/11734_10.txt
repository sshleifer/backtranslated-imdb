This should be one of my favorite flicks, unlike the weak 'Elvira Haunted Hills' ... however I love how the movie is a story Goth / com 'Wizard of Oz' <br /> <br /> Elvira is Goth Dorothy who is bound in the unknown city after the death of the Good Witch (Elviras Aunt Morgana) ... she inherited the "Ruby" which is very powerful and is sought by the worst Warlock (her uncle). He likes four friends who he helps to grow in the movie all the time with the dog in tow. There is a show down with his uncle (the evil witch of the West) where Elvira knows that he has power in it and ends up defeating him. At last he was chased away by the townspeople after winning their hearts and eventually he gets to Las Vegas (the home of Dorothy in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references made to the witch of oz movie ... he and all his uncle say verses relating to their characters alike. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be uncle Remus .... There's no place at home, no place like home!" Bad uncle Vinny: "I'll find you my pretty, and your little dog too!" There is a sign that Elvira passes the first time on his way to the road to Kansas. <Br> But apart from this, the fact that one of the series he "rejected off, um ... I mean he was inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you do not roll around when his pastor at the end of "very 80" Las Vegas show then you have no bone of the camp in your body ... this movie is a cult group / camp
