This was a very exciting film, especially in 1973. At the time it was a great success of the box office. After the 1970s it seemed to have been forgotten, but its main message was very important to disappear completely. euthanasia did not always bring you. Specific settings and effects can be short-lived, but great money for sci fi films was a game of games at that time. If you are looking closely you will see everything in common. This is a message of the message, not for fans of star wars that are not available for one minute of stimulating ideas unless it has a million bucks with an explosion. <br /> <br /> This was also a beautiful Hestons film last, the end of sci fi its most famous dystopian. After that they were all full of disaster disaster and a large group of delightful budget. That may not be more interesting than two hours of the movie made, and the latter may be interesting and depression, but it is difficult to find any film producer and guts again who could deal with this issue.
