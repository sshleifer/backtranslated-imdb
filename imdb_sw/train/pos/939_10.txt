Okay, there are tons of reviews here, how can I add? I will try it anyway. <br /> <br /> This reason is my favorite Scrooge is because of everything. Sets, outdoor places, clothing is beautiful and realistic. Music is sweet. Support support has been done well. One of my favorites is the author and nephew, who played with Roger Rees. His infinite loyalty is touch and his voice is a Christmas voice to me. David Warner is also a reliable Bob Cratchit. He is a difficult life, but he keeps good and respectful. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course - is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his image is also bad. I couldn't agree more. Its mixture at the beginning of winter or bright, was not out of character. He is a very disappointed person whose heart has been tough and vicissitudes of life and his own desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> At the time of change, it is obvious that not everyone is doing it. This is when we see that there is hope for him. If she had gone completely, her boyfriend Marley did not want to come for her for the first time. And after all, we are not one of us hope. I think that's a great part of what Dickens tried to say. While Scrooge appears on his dance to his employer and Belle, you smile to him because he tells Belle in a flashback that will come through life "and grin on my face." Clive Donner was wise as a director to allow this time on the film. Sometimes they get left on the floor of the editing room. And finally, its conversion is a perfect joy that makes me cry tears of joy every time I see it. Apologizing to his girlfriend Fred, so sincerely, so moving, is not just a Christmas spirit, but of humanity itself. Joy he brings to Fred, to his wife is very clear. And the verse that you find me always, "God forgive me for the time I lost." <br /> <br /> Test!
