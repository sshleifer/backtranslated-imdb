Japan is in great trouble. The Babylonians are affected by Edo, taking possession of the world and making it for their unjust pleasure. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the Queen of demons, is near. The only thing that stands on this great threat is the Dens of Demon, a group of terrorist fighters, who can be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took a playground instead of being killed by a demon after an accident to kill an innocent child (In a war that reminds the area of ​​the bar from Dusk to Dawn) ). One night to meet the opportunity he met a beautiful and wonderful woman named Tsubaki. Their luck includes (they) and are bound to eventually become lovers of enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this looks like your typical Japanese fantasy / Swordplay epic, you would be wrong. In fact, there is nothing unusual about Ashura. It's a hodge-podge of many kinds of film types. Only those listed, with comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) struggles with respect to spelling (Although, the comedy seems obliged in some cases) and the final result is ridiculous, but it's fun of popcorn movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are errors in the film. Some humor appears to be affected, and out of place. And acting is not greater. But with weight, do you watch a fantasy film / Swordplay / Comedy for good performances? No, we look at them with the actions and pictures of CG things, which Ashura has in Spades. It is not misleading, the film is not all the steps, but it is generously generated enough for many swordplay and green buckets to keep the viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Below the bottom; These films are wrong and not martial arts epic, but it does not have to have an impressive and beautiful picture swordplay action. Because the film has worked for me is that you have not considered it too much and if the viewer does it, they are certainly enjoying with this flicky and fun point of fantasy action. <br /> <br /> My Rating 7 out of 10. Happy popcorn movie.
