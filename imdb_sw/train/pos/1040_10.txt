The best 1943 film by Paul Lukas to perform Oscar's work as his family head to bring America from Europe as a Nazi hazard. <br /> <br /> Bright Davis continues its reputation here and for the change it was not selected for the best actor for this film or any 1943. film. He knows he must return to Europe on a secret message and he returns. Davis again removes all items and spills the eyes of Katharine Hepburn when they should divide. Resolute, knows that his oldest son, must follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film depicting American propaganda against the worst enemy.
