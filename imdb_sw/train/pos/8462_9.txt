I have recently taken a collection of one of this wonderful series and even after just looking at three pieces, I am still mesmerised with styling styling of animation and slower action, but thinking of story-telling. I'm still a fan ..... with a little pain. Though this unit on the Gundam saga is very cool and has the previous series you had a stylish way to tell about war crimes and not let go for the need to have control or power over everything (familiar voice?), I say that this gets a little mellow-big on continuously describing the life of the main characters and their incessant needs for the abdomen on everything that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group to achieve their plans (especially character called Wufei ... I mean he is more than the American character in the soap opera. The consultant, will it be?) Apart from the widespread game (I think that actually comes from dubbing of English actors), this series is still exciting and you will beat me again. I mean it may be worse. It can be like a recent phase, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about a great mix ... I'll talk about it later.
