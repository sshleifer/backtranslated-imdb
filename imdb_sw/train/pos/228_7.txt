"Honest" is the third act of films. All the dialogue and cooperation of the behavior that occurs in it comes from the long wind of south south. And, by extension, the life of its main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). This is the first cooperation of Peter Masterson's director and author Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked together on "Traveling Gifts", a film that looks almost a similar step. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is very difficult on this side enough. Slow speed leaves a lot of space for the movie film Toyomichi Kurita, who protects the film only with the proper sense of light and volatile temperatures. For this reason it is basically an emerging game, in a small way to edit or guide the ability, it all comes to acting. Besides I'm concerned there is no mistake here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are quite real, not interested in anything rather than live. Lukas Haas, the youngest actor I knew and "Agreement" and "Witness", plays a very characteristic role like other original roles. He is quiet, removed, afraid of little and sad, somehow. These are attributes that appear to be natural from him. <br /> <br /> Maybe the title "Honest" is safe for this film. The title, along with the opening area, appears to create a picture of the most advanced type of western type. If the slower production measures did not think much, you will need to pass this too. Otherwise, this may be a particular film you want to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
