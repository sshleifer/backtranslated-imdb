Well, this was one of the films I had found enough time, and it was good for me to record when it showed the next time ... If, like me, you are interested in many 80 francs found with branches from the usual (ie not just glut another of the generic sequels then I think you can enjoy this. When the wicked man returns to the man, surely he was not what I expected to see! All in all, I will not leave your way for this, but if you love the genre, then look if it comes and you have an hour and a half to kill, I think. I would like to give 6.5 out of 10.
