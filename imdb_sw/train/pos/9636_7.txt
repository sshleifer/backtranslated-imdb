Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) a French boy who is sad (Jeremie Elkaim) during the summer holidays, meets with a love for Cedric (beautiful Stephane Rideau). We are slow and this is a very exciting movie. On the one hand, I was getting into it and I felt two boys. On the other hand I was angry - the film is always around from the past to now with no rhyme or reason. It is very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN !!! There are also tons of plot holes - Mathieu, at the same time, doing something that ends in the hospital. What - we were not told! Then he breaks Cedric and tells everyone who lives with him. Why? We don't mention. Then he takes an unreasonable step with another person at the end. Why? No description. Obviously Cedric likes Mathieu and Mathieu live in the same city ... But it is a tribute to the film that cares so much about the characters. If things were simply explained! Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, good and has a good body - but he can't act. His concept of acting is sitting around and looking blank on his face - at all times. Rideau, on the other hand, is good. He is very good, he has a very good body and is one of the actress. It also has a magnetism of strange sex on it. There is a brave male front, lots of kissing and a sexually explicit area in a great movie - many movies forget to show men's love events. This is not and helps to see how the characters care and feel. So, a frustrated but worth-seeing film - especially with the exception of Rideau discrimination - that is, if you like good young people! <br /> <br />
