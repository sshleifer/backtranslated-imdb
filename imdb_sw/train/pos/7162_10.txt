This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and I liked it, but this film grows on everything that the book is known. Acting is amazing, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Sir Sir, very bad behavior. This film has some way to write a story that lets you talk everywhere, to the end where everything is kept together for a long time. I also love how this way is directed, to stimulate back and forth between modern days and stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story has been made for the film, and Andrew Davis does a good job of leading it. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.
