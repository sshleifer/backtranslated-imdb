This film should be viewed in the right mental image. First, between the father and man makes it clear that the film was intended to prequel for his film Wong Fei Hung "Drunken Teacher" (ideas from this film back to "Drunk Teacher II"), and not "Little Teacher" ; that Chan joined the program and mentioned the name of the characters shows that he himself was not sure that the material came together well, and in fact, the film shows a sense of imperfection, for example, a romantic relationship around half of the plot turns out completely. executed at the end of the film. "Teacher Player", from the same time, also feels that he has not received, but at least all of his middle fibers are fitted together at the end. or the budget. Or maybe the film is high-talented. This is important to turn the film into the work of Chan, because it sets itself up for development of the main character over all other issues - that's why there is no kung fu in all films . Chan wants to make a historical romantic comedy which just happens to have kung fu in it. But the historical aspect and the romantic aspect comes as a little more than losing the plot. <br /> <br /> That leaves us comedy. Since the concern of Chan is the development of character, the comedy is largely driven by the character - as in conflict between the character of Chan and his best friend, move on the girl. But there's a lot of slapstick too. In fact, I see amusing comedy enough to forgive the deficit of the plot. This film represents the part of Chan's quest to find a suitable form that he can use and develop for a while. It does not work at all, and Chan would only find that formula after leaving the historical elements of its original films, making the modern "Police Story". But to come back to see this film is still very informative about how Chan did his way through historical forms, and perhaps why he left it.
