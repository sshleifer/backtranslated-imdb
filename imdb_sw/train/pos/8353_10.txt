I can remember to see this film as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show up at night when they were the only pay-off movie center. Back to the back was UNRATED and it was the only movie of its kind that was displayed on television pay ... especially back then. I would like to see it now as an adult where I will be more able to understand adult themes. It is probably the closest thing I saw in pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Fortunately I had stupid stupid children and party members at the weekend. Many of my memories of this film were the odds of the male sex. Break into the house to blow the underwear, feed the alien milk on the public bus, and abuse in the cab at the request of one of their female studies were just a few lost lost. A very racy film of '70s early. Until I look at IMD, I did not know that the following film. Many people I speak have never heard of.
