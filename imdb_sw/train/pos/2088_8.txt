From the top of the classic Classic books, comes this highly skilled story written by Pearl Buck. Book as the film is called "Good World." It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) a simple Chinese farmer who starts his day with a 'big house' where he took a slave woman named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, she begins to deal with her kindness by saving a small peach seed and preparing it next to her new home. In the following years, O-Lan proves its value by working hard for her husband's work, difficulty and changing luck. Through the years, they bring the family to look at their usual home weather as a feast and hunger. Indeed, it is in the lowest condition in their life that each finds the value of fellowship, trust and love. Over time, their growing families are assisted and threatened by friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly) who is scoundrel and charlatan, but is being sympathetic. Wang has his 'Elders' (Charley Grapewin) to advise and remind him of the nature of desire and life. The two famous actors who perform amazing performances in this film are Keye Luke who plays Wang Wang and Phillip Ahn's older son who plays national soldiers. The film is black and white and is celebrated with novels. It is highly recommended for all viewers. ****
