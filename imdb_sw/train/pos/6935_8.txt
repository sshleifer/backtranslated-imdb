James Stewart star in the western story of revenge retaliation which relates to the fate of another star of Winchester Rifle. Stewart goes without saying that better add a lot of cool obsession to his typical cowboy set back. The story follows the fate of the Winchester gun and its owners after winning the competition with our hero and stealing with a hunter. We meet a spacious selection, gun gunmen, Indian traders and bank employers as we follow guns through India, heist banks, etc. All support is established by Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean player of live weapons and fingerprint. Also as a trivia symbol appear very early from Rock Hudson as the Indian leader. The end of the war is the most common battles of guns that have fought long and close to the rock. Throw in the good old western stage, fist fight, shootout and horse expulsion makes for adllicking the western adventure. 8/10
