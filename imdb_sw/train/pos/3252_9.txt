The Story of "Woman From All Place" is very simple and very beautiful taken out of Westernwood Spaghetti West: A strange visitor enters a city without law and run with a mountain. Even the opening and music features are with spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone will be proud. Interestingly, the visitor is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on Harley, and the area is in the city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this executive, there is a lot of gunplay, some of it is good, some predictable, and other ads somewhat hokey, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko holds his guns with faith and aplomb and gives them strokes. It was not a lot of challenges for her as it was a physical challenge, but she did things very well. She demonstrates her ability to work more like Otsu at the NHK ceremony, "Musashi." <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend a film if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (and I am adoringly am) and / or "gun girls" fan of the film and hold regular viewing. For me, there is something big and insufficient attraction about "gunmen girls" movies like "La Femme Nikita" and "Long Kiss Goodnight." And having a beautiful gal as Ryoko star in it is also just a string of icing on the cake.
