This movie was very good. If you are the one who likes to watch awesome movies, I recommend. Acting was very good though I thought Julie's actor was more likely to feel behind his lines. Allan was very good and I thought the movie was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat all the time when my friends were free to shout. It was a perfect achievement for my opinion and it would have made it with great screens. I give two thumbs on! I certainly would say that if you've never seen then then you're going to hire. If you have seen it and does not like to go and view it again because there are places that are not quite available. I also loved how many films were played around and at my school's school.
