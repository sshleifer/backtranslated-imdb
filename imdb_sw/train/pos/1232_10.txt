Very good film. Classic film funny Eddie Murphy of 80 years. I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory. Irony's most common Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well. Murphy in the 80's made many films of action that represented his way of joke on everything that was dangerous. The result can only be counted by some films but ii from 1986 to date has changed. The atmosphere of the film at that time is good and special effects are good for the film period. A good modern to see and enjoy the taste of Murphy's absent, the actress who has recently lost. The last part is anthologies, a good actor who plays part of the Monk of Tibetani. That's right.
