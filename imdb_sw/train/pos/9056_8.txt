So we have refused. This was a very interesting film, I loved the direction of art (felt more "real" than many children's movies), and the dress was not chaotic. Children's actors were not bad to watch (adult cheesy presentations). It was good that they showed how an abusive child is offensive to others as children stand up to abuse. I don't know how many princes would like to see this, but it's a great movie to take a child. And since "Barnyard" was attended by 100+ children at the same time, I am sure we chose to attend a small amount to show "germs" instead.
