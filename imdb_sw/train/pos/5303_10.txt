John Water ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is a good movie I saw on time. It offers a surreal viewer of life in Baltimore (I live near Washington, DC), and the use of Warhol-like colors, a pleasant motion and feeling. Pecker becomes much larger than his city can handle, and he is split with his loved ones (including Ricci sexy) and his loving artist. The picture has remained a delicious taste in my mouth - like a kind of ice cream of the sun on a hot summer day - and though this taste was rather flat and simple, it has made one more big and important thing. It is a celebration of life, freedom, and the right to bear arms ... and everything else this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
