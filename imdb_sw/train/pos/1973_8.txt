I never believe anyone's opinion on the film. That goes to critics too. Indeed, if it gets a good idea it is the same, but many films that find the most important ones I hate. I enjoyed this film why it was, a entertainment film. It takes you out of your life for a few hours and in a false character ... to be Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, as well as was in the first. Anyone who says that it is bad in this film should have seen the same as the first b / c he is back to act in the same way he did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is her and she plays it in full. Its one liner is good, as in the first. Who can forget in the first film when he tells the authors, "If you keep me doing that ... otherwise you get f ** k here!" Great event, and believe me, does it again in this. I liked him. His lids, how he smoked his cigarettes, believe it, is worth the price just to see the performance of the Stone. I can't wait for this film to be opened on the DVD, not, because I can just imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are lots of lots, like in the first, including the end!
