Richard Widmark is a bad character in this film. She is a professional pickpocket. He has been in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is the most widely used body to sell information almost everyone. Jean Peters is wonderful as a burning girl with Widmark. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of time during McCarthy era where Red Scare ruled politics and is working on this very well plot. It is a common thing about this film that Peters & Ritter are all victims of violence when women rarely have sex objects in the film. That is what makes this film like women often find different roles in this type of film. It is only 87 minutes long and it was obvious by Fox as a card under two elements in the playground. The sets indicate that it is a small film budget. Script made J Edgar Hoover mad because the hostility is given a short shrift. Hoover wanted to be changed. Instead, it was B under the picture of a card that was a fall asleep in 1953. The document and work in it is better than any other great character was the year.
