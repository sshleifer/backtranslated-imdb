This is one of the very few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin's Martian - and the dog's space called K-9 is also included. This part of Looney Tunes is very interesting, has a good cartoon animation (Marvin animation made well) and the plot has been done well. The latter is so amazing, so be prepared for it, it's a little boring. Martian's Martian has been sent to the earth to capture the earth and return to Mars. For his dog dog K-9, Marvin puts out and soon finds other rabbits songs but Bugs Bunny! He welcomes them to treat them, thinking that they are cunning or actors in their clothing. Does he not know that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... I recommend this section to anyone who loves Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian and Looney Tunes in general. In addition to the beginning and middle of this period is a concern, you may be able to love this. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! : -) \ t
