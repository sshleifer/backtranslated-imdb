The fun of a small film, comedy and spying, romance and drama music like Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) is dedicated to her daughter Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and her role as strong as a detective. <br /> This hodge park cannot be appealed to all viewers today, but in its day, it had something to give each member of the family going to the film, and the resolution of hearing-to-answer the answer is original and enjoyable, and you have to wait. "Mr. Williams's wonderful" has what should be between the many blind days of pride in the history of the film, and its bright references eliminates. When he was very troubled, Melvyn Douglas announced the most beautiful line: "I would like to walk on the Great Street to the Turkish fabric before I left any woman to control my life!" And Joan Blondell convincingly causes them to cut into pieces: "Sorry! It looks like my aunt Nellie!" The crime solution here is the standard rate, though fine fines for character actors help bring the material alive. From this point today, "Mr. Wonderful Williams" is probably the most interesting for his clarity about gender as social building, all used for its seemingly stable borders. it takes place in a high sexual warfare, sometimes it is a trick and enter, not just playing in a brief description of the film, but in a kind of war that reaches its end in the final area.
