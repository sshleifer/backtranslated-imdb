After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very interesting film that had a positive speech. It was not one of the best shows of Jim Carrey, but he was still the same. Morgan Freeman was just the same as God. Jennifer Aniston had a good time. I lost Steve Correll on "ALL WONS!" <br /> <br /> I love Tom Shadyac's choice of movies. It also made LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and SPECIALIST. In all three and Bruce General, he takes a great star of comedy and tells a human story with him. The director who knows the comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can describe a meaningful and intellectual story to find it difficult to find. My biggest complaint is that they should use more biblical reference. I just remember three Bible texts and were three parts of the funniest of the entire movie. I think it was that the first screenshots had more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers feared the people who were prosecuting. That is very bad because I thought it was a lack of space. <br /> <br /> My bridge: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
