Common songs in the 1940s had a form - and if you are reading a film you know what I'm talking about - some long-term achievement, which was great on the face but didn't have real characteristics of the characters. this one is different - and lighter years and suitable for the selection of a beautiful picture of 1945 (although he had no chance to beat the final winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> Gene> Kelly was perhaps in the best position of his career - yes I know about "America in Paris" and "Singing In Rain". This is different. In fact he enters into his behavior of "thinking of the sea of ​​the wolf" (first) that "picking up any girl during departure" is nothing more than a lark. And if you would like to create a "story" to find him - so be it - until. Type as a Man of Music when he gets "his foot found in the door". The great end of the film occurs mainly from his new attempt by Sin (new Sinatra) to make a "good story" so that "get a girl" that HERE and unexpectedly loves. You need to see the movie to see what I have meant. Besides this there are a lot of great films in this, it's a tribal boy story, considering when WWII was close (the war ended about a month after the release film), realizing that the man who A lot of laughter in life can know that he is a good man, great songs and probably it's a few other things of a typical film that I can't imagine now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? Near the end - around 2/2 starts to feel for a long time. There is a small number of ballet which Gene Kelly does so must have a feeling in 1945 but it looks on and feels like it's just adding minutes now. But in general, these are the winners of each level.
