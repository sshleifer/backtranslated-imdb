Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn, and Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is very good in this kind of role, where she must show a character which her values ​​are, for the first time, uncertain for the audience. As is the case with Sutherland characters, we must ask "Is he a villian [in this case, a little], or a hero?" This is a disturbing story, told in mind, about the lack of skill and bureaucratic civilization in the Soviet Union which prevented the efforts of the most capable people. As Sutherland's behavior clearly says, "The level of management is its ability to make a distinct difference". "Committee meeting" (between Rea and Sutherland characters) after perestroika is fulfilled, with its revelations, has a profound emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of volunteers who worked in the system. Fewer posts displayed to members of the family of the victims increase emotional freedom for storytelling. This is rarely a feature of the film and this epidemic, but effectively reminds us that the victims had life, and were loved. This is a sad, but very important film, which deserved to show on the Canadian TV.
