In all the soccer movies I watched, this is one of the best 2. Other to have flu. But Hero is on the world cup ever ever and for this reason it is also the greatest player who has ever played in the world cup, Diego Maradona. This story stands next to him and also surrounds the other heroes of the game at that time. The music mark is evocative and the images are powerful. Michael Caine's question is safe and also quiet. This story is not about the personal cup of the world cup; rather it is more about the feelings of players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Interesting games like France and Brazil (one of the greatest games at all) were covered in the same line. Argentina's last v W Germany was also in the same line. was highly recommended. A classic football world. watch frequently, esp if you're a fan of Maradona.
