This can be difficult for some people to enter, using Hollywood production styles. The tracking was not followed, it seems to be simply publishing a picture of the action point, and the quality of the sound is bad here and there (the redemption of people's clothes is often competing with their voices, etc.). friends and I start looking without knowing what to expect, and the first place almost put us off. It looked very much and cheesy. Then we took the content of the content, and we started to have fun. It is very funny, despite some input. Definitely provide opportunities if you appreciate a great dialog. Also, Helena Bonham Carter enjoys, of course.
