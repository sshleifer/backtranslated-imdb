When will people learn that movies are made for fun and not out of changing the world? If you are aware of this then you expect to have fun designs while looking at "Bill and Ted's false trips." This is a movie that is a fun to watch, Keanu and Alex performs well on a screen team facing their characters from the “Best Bill of Bill and Ted” and more of 'style' then they had a movie. to laugh, the characters become very as-able and the line of the story being so radical you have to laugh. Don't expect 'deep-and-meaning' just expecting fun!
