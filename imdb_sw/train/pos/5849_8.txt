Stand straight ..... this show was kick ass back to the day and still continues beyond the cartoons today. I can't wait under DVD to share with my little boy and see the same in his eyes. I've been introducing him to Voltron (5 strokes, not 15 cars) and laughing at the head when he told me one day. <br /> <br /> Come to the picture of Hollywood, this one dust and give it an attempt to survive. Could not be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 has been very good so far for summer movies. Well, I will leave now <br /> <br> Cheers
