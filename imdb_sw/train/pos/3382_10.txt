Not often I had the feeling of a movie could be a glance. But clearly this film has an original seed. We should not have alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our current mood. But, didn't we say this "1984"? Was James Orwell known that the Internet became a reality without long after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he may have to re-write his story in the way he did. Check the search. It does not matter. What's the matter is that we often see ourselves being better than our environment but actually being emotional about "apple love" when you should knock our door. An example of ourselves in old age. Whatever the time line will be for us, I know we actually didn't see the beginning of it. <br /> <br />
