Although it is a fascinating young man when I first see the series of Gundam Wing, after looking at the same series, I have assured my belief that this series is not just a lot of beauty, but a plot, a structure of weapons, design of character, and characteristic behavior is beautifully murdered. At first appear to be a young band of a kind, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can be counted with the beauty of the beautiful art, and personal characteristics distinguish between the characters. Therefore, it is very easy to be drawn to any character. Personally, I loved Heero because of his stoic personality. Although I may be interested in the cohesion of this feeling for my childhood, I can clearly say that Gundam Wing speaks deep questions of war and life in general (how can we find peace?) When we offer many battles in big robot suits, which, to say the least , it is better.
