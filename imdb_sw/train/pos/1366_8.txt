What? I am the only one who has seen the relationship between camus 'discussion of sisyphus' story and mary's life? in the dictionary version one is sentenced to spend his time with a big boulder that must have a hill. unfortunately every time it ends on the boulder decreases and ends back down to start. there may be buzzard pecking in his eyes, I don't know right now. In the movie mary uses her life struggling to get her life together, unfortunately every time she gets any benefits she falls and lose everything. The case at the stage would be the party he gives us where he eats, dislikes his partner's falafel, and is affected by liev schrieber. if you are looking for this theory, see how this place ends with him trying to climb the stars when the books come off and stop his progress until he finally passes. The morning morning when he wakes up he is still on the level, he has never come up.
