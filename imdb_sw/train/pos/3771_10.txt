1991 saw the release of two sequels of all time: THE KING OF 2: THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Of the two, I've always loved BOGUS BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY little better. TERMINATOR 2: DAY OF HUMAN is best done, but nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to imagine the great duo of comedic than Bill and Ted. They are the same kind of type. <br /> <br /> It seems to be affected by the OC National Lampoon. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were made by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two skilled writers who made duo when they were at the L.A. back behind the 1980s. Those two began to quickly write a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, which was released in 1987 and released in 1989, became a great achievement of the box office and the cult of religious services. It was not long working before work began. Stephen Herek, director of 'ADCENTENT EXCELLENT' did not intend to work for sequel since he found it very powerful and unlike the first so Peter Hewitt, making his first film film, brought the sequel lead. He could not be the best director of work. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY dominated by surprise. It is filled with its unique style and energy that cannot be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequels ever is that when it's blacker than the original, it's just as fun. It does not exchange characters as many sequels do. Bill and Ted are the best characters who were in the first film. This is because it is written by the original authors. Many sequels were not written by the same authors as the first, but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY' was shared by the same authors of the same image, it was perfect as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' if not better. Just like the first, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is a completely hilarious, well written, happy, and above all, the original. It is full of extraordinary special effects and amazing performances of Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves, and William Sadler. It's 'impossible' journey. 10/10
