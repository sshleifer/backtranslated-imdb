I don't know what an old viewer was looking at but I think what it's technically is, personal taste. Failed in this film was deep, very detailed film, multiple array of emotions, affecting. The lack of unconditional love because of the submission of social beliefs, time constraints and classes, unhealthy competition of equality, guilt, desire, hatred, frustration, emotional stress I thought, under the skin, you have to submit to their location , a run-out movie, not slow as described earlier, take off the film flow, the emotions will show themselves, the characters reveal their mistakes, their bad insides, better and really brutal!
