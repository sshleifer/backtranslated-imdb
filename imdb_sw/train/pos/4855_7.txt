The question of whether someone likes this version of the "Train of Spirit" film always depends on one thing and one thing alone: ​​your response to Arthur Askey's performance.

But somehow everything goes on to the character of Tommy Gander of Askey. I love myself for the film, and even as Askey to the standard. I often seem to put it on the vcr for these unusual hours of the morning when I can't sleep and really can't get the power to see anything else. There is something about looking at old b / w movies in the dawn of the early dawn of which I have appealed ....
