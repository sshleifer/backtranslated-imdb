one season and only you have given here in Australia and I thought it was quite brilliant! i love it! All the lines of the story are very good! and his true opinion about the life of the young man and the family today. but it still put the strong family values ​​together and be there for each other. their problems were real, and really attracted to the show. The show is basically about this family called 'day' and their lives. The family had Abby Day (Mum), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (daughter of games), Cooper Day (outdoor child), and Nathan Day (boy boy). each episodes the day of their lives, in conjunction with the perspective on all things in it. I liked to share his knowledge through out of the show was very good. she was off my favorite character. it ended with many things that could go on, I'm sad the other season was not done. it was a good show I will leave you.
