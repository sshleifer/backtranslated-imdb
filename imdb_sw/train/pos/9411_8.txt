Sidney Stratton has trouble keeping the work in various textile industries because of its experiment in the clothing lab. Stratton is trying to form a new fabric that can create the last fabric, which is not found dirty, never comes out, or comes out. While Stratton builds a fabric he builds enemies for all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and owners (who will lose money from one mill have special rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most beaten man in England. Film is good and Ealing alone can be so. The performance of Guiness (with great support such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction makes the film a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, a good satire in business and industry and extra drama, romance, and stopped. Testing, 8.
