I have already loved "How Grinch prohibited Christmas" when it was released and still I love it now, 5 years later. Many people still seem to disagree with my views and this film has never received great love when you came out. Of course, the movie is high and camping but at the same time it is also why this movie is very interesting and enjoys watching. All the pieces, dress and characters are held perfectly on top with fun, without having really ridicule. It is an interesting movie to watch. It's a very successful movie! Director Ron Howard really surprised with this fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie is working and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as Grinch. It really carries the movie and its good and fun activity. Indeed it is assisted by convincing decisions, which were also awarded the Academy. Of course if you are Jim Carrey, you should even think about watching this film. This movie is his real movie and he performs all the fun and very fun watching. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as little Grinch. <br /> <br /> Movie has good values ​​but it's all sappy to me. Maybe it's because I am a Dutch and celebrating Christmas that is a passion and great here, like in the United States or UK. For me the film was fun and entertaining and morals just left me very cold to be honest. The music mark by James Horner is good and fun, although it is your daily average of Horner, it still works effectively for the film and helps you to do some work on the scene. <br /> <br /> The full Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
