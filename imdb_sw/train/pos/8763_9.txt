This movie is cool, it has no reality. We often think "oh no, that won't happen to me." But it can. Drug migration is a big money and people often do not know (or are deceived) to do things for travelers. The story of these two girls is a story of many young people who like them, just wanted a foreign holiday - which turned into a dream. People need to know that these incidents are not possible or spread - this is a big problem in today's society. I would like to recommend this movie to the great audience because of the understanding you need to appreciate this movie. It's emotional and raw. Such value check and certainly stays in your memory.
