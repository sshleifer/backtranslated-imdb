'Ned Kelly' is an honorary Australian film that honors the Australian hero. We are taken into the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and other members of Kelly Gang, as the film describes and perhaps proves Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is a unique cast, which all offers stellar displays, which brings the film to life. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was as strange as Joe, with the role of a quiet, very faithful woman. I was honored at this time. For a while I nearly believed the Gang would win the war in Glenrowan, alas, was not there. Some of the features of the film are false, and as a partner of Ned Kelly bright (and assistant), it was a little disappointed with this. Perhaps also the film would have taken a long time, to achieve more than Kelly's life / Ned - I felt enough was covered. Regardless of a few tips, this is a moving film, which emphasizes all kinds of emotions. (And he, I'd like to take this film would be better look rather than Mick Jagger trying to show Ned ...)
