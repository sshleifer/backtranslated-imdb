If you would like Star Wars / Trek, come to see where all their ideas and movie devices. It is my top 2 movies of all time, one-world-future and psychologically. The scope of the root material (Shakespeare of "Rain") is not required by whizbang gimmickry (later Lucas). And just because it was done in 1956, do not think you can 'see the conditions' making a flying plate. This was the first movie where you take care of. The miracle was done at the "A-movie" level, the economy and flavor at that time was very much against him. And the 'hit' of the former Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". Until I looked at him, I thought 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym to a director who was already or later became popular, but at that time he did not want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly "B" type in the past. This was a very productive production, or very "hard" error for people who pirate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are huge mattes for live action around microscopically incorporated that Lucas used in large quantities. There is an intelligent machine that eliminates the common interface 'interface'; "computers", such as have been done more later in future work. The Star Trek's 'Provider' is there, with eyes, close to closure and Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the technobabble of Trek / Wars prevents you, the scientific records of FP are not excessive and correct, even today. The "ship" set is deep, with the wind of truth, it is as good as anything you have seen since then, and more than to influence anything 'Trek' has made, for TV or film. We couldn't spend a lot of time there as I liked. If you have ever wondered how the films went into the space effectively, check FP will describe all of that. It is obviously not 'Join Stars'.
