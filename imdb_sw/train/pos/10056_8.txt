We looked at this in the Women's Health Women's class to describe how women are regarded as inferior to men in many communities, and I really liked this film. I have a plan on trying to get its own copy look. The story is very touching and I would recommend to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is the film I will show to my children. Our class professor meant that the film is also about women, but this film was more than that. It is one of those movies that will be totally in my mind and will be popular.
