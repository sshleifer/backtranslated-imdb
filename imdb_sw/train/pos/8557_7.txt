I should give them to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. "Direct to DVD" usually is similar to cheap, non-affordable officers. However last year I was so surprised when I found myself enjoying the next DVD "The Naked Mile". The film staff used the opportunity to give a terrible opportunity, but very strange. This year they give preference, "Beta House". This is a true fact, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies appear as "Little help". This is not a blocked, unsupported treasure, of a loud laugh. Indeed, the story is small thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we are presented to all the main characters, new supporters, to find a few of the powerful buttons, to meet criminals, and to set up a regular line. With all of these outdoor, the movie becomes a journey of boundaries. Gags are a lot, and are NOT back in this. I'm talking about male semen, urine, shoes, chicks and dicks, sex and sheep, female orgasm, and much more. Not to mention the fact that it is not a minute goes without a boobs or a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Turning from "Eternal Naked" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (the same supporting role as the last few movies). Sent whole to do a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has great energy and screens. I am telling good things for him. The film is also full of films for those who keep their eyes open. The greatest laughter of my film was the "Deerhunter method". Classic. The bottom line is, if you are a fan of the series, you will feel at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but the latter is pretty funny funny.
