There was a stylish way of this film on the part of the director Vincenzo Natali and the impressive angle of camera and close efficiency. It was also enjoyable to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu with the responsibility of leading and expanding their scope as artists. This film also included one of the most "escape" events in recent years. The efforts of the director and executives were linked to an exciting stimulus. Although the film program was caused, the story continued very well as the corporate heroes and skullduggery were revealed. In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future will dominate the brutal government, which would control the mind and reduce human freedom. It was surprising that in this amazing future film, it was not the government, but it was a corporate world that governed and strengthened the humanitarian worker.
