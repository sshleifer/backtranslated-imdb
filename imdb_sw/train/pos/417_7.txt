This film has Bill Bill Hickok, Cover Jane, Buffalo Bill and Custer General all together. Gary Cooper plays Easter Bill with Jean Arthur plays Then Jane and Charles Bickford are a bad guy who sells weapons to Indians and you can't recognize him. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together with the next film that was done the same as the time set. This movie begins with the murder of Lincoln and also deals with the war of India. Then Jane likes a marriage bill and Buffalo is married and now wants to stay at home. This movie also deals with the last stand of Custer and is far away from the correct. Gary Cooper is as good as normal and not as common as Jean Arthur but I have loved him here.
