I haven't seen this film! At least not in full. I have seen some haunting parts that have left me to see them all. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. Birds (very interesting) rotate the dark side of the moon. The test provides a flash device to photograph hidden under it. The moon shines on possibilities. . . . and for a few seconds there is. The parallel line, the square, possible. Then the light decreases and the shortness of ... what ... you have passed and it's time to return to the earth. Wonderful. I have seen other places but would like to love the full movie.
