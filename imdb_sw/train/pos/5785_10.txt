While reading for comments left for this show, I could not help but beware that a large percentage of viewers did not really watch any of the show's channels through all or at their own discretion. Something about Kerching! is that it is a children's show, for children if it seems that your elders will seem happy, forced, and maybe ignorant. I saw one person saying the sets were ignorant, but I remember when I was eight years old I wondered why Taj had a molding of icecube on his wall, and he was also surprised if my parents left me to mine in the mine (they didn't). Yes, it may be angry, acting can be better and some of the characters do very good things with their hair, but as children are shown, I am more than 10/10. Compared to things that make air today, well, just say I would like to be redesigned. DVD release, anyone?
