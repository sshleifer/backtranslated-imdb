This is one of the films that make better trailers than long-term films. The concept was really cool and different, humor was unique, I just felt there were available opportunities to put "punch" on this film. Many lines and gags were left to hang for a long time, without a definite end and they did not stop laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were good. The Sykes Wanda was less used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to expand its character in more time screens. 7 out of 10 to me, more than a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for a kind of music to feel good during the last credit, something that has become a trademark for these exciting romantic films, something about Mary, Meet Parents but again, I was left to hear a little cheat of the fact that it would have a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It felt like it was RUSHED on the movie.
