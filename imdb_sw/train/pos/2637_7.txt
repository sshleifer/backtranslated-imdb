This is a direct-video movie, so it must go without saying that does not like the first rival of Simba, but said, this was very good. My children liked this, but that's been given, they love anything that is a cartoon. The biggest shock was that I * also liked, was laughing loudly in a certain place (even a fart * joke), with lots of creative ideas instead of the first movie, and even a joke that needed to be older (but not as dangerous as Shrek ["you think he pays for something?"]). <br /> <br /> Special information on fart jokes, I was surprised to see that no joke was just a toilet sound (in fact there was no voice / photo, memory was trick), in fact there was a configuration / punchline / etc., and were close to good taste. I would like my kids to think that there is more humidity than going to the bathroom, and this movie is good at those things. What is another hmm? Music was so-so, not as close as creative as in the first or second movie, but much fun for children. No time is very bad, which was a blessing to me. A little bit but nothing terrible (NIMH Secret gave my children pain, not G's sure it was right for it ...) <br /> <br /> All in all I would like to say this is a great movie for kids any age, one of which is 100% safe enable them to watch (I'm trying not to be more sensitive but I have been jumping up and turning off the TV during small movies that were more inappropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room at this time. I would like to say a stick around yet, you can find that you like too :)
