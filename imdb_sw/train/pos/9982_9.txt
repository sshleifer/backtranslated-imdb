I saw this movie last night after the age and waiting time to be opened here in Canada (still for a little release). It was worth waiting and then some. I am a very strong reader of Margaret Laurence and I was glad to see that this novel was being transformed into a film. I really liked the movie better than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character was a little bit, and that seems to have more than a story of love between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life which more moving forward. Disadvantages seemed to be stable. Hagar was not much recommended on the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a professional in this role. He was Hagar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and had more things ahead than I am sure. Her exhibition and Cole Hauser were selective. I would like to keep on going, a total of 9 * between 10. Good and can't wait to get out of the DVD, it must be myself for my collection!
