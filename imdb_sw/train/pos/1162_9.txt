Like many people, I saw Jason Priestley on television and I think he's good. But I did not know that she had a sister! Justine Priestley is just a "mah" that is as attractive as another woman who has despised it. Good music, preference, and death location involving Amanda's revenge for an abusive doctor will stay with you for a week. I'll leave you there. Kudos.
