Valientes are supported in a kind of human movie, but it reduces its roots thanks to the best cast, deep connection between its direction, and beautiful pictures. Diego Peretti's material as Dr Silverstein, who loses a shot with Diaz's investigator (Luis Luque), who has been tasked with the murder of two hoods that appear to be involved in weapons weapons. Diaz has been suspended from duty, but is the best man of work and must have professional psychological support to be returned. Silverstein and Diaz have recently found themselves in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and uranium, and the film separates them from an important point that allows Silverstein to develop interesting skills to attract themselves. Peretti and Luque are excellent as well as reminding the team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as good as Hill. Surprisingly, even around two-hour Tiempo de Valientes is not available to welcome, and in fact the author of the author Damian Szifron puts the most likely in an interesting film coda. All in all, the incredible comedy and entertaining action comedy that no panders typically common denominator usually does not curse your mind.
