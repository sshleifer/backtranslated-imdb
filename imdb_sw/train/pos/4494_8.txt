Like Bolton's origin, this film has an appeal to me. Shots of the area are surprisingly and Bolton shows very much in transition - there are several cases to clear the obvious but this applies to show the city built again - with the idea that the past must make a new way is right in the heart of this film. James Mason said a little leads in enjoying stories about the debate about livestock that comes in a full generation crisis, then a happy schmaltzy solution. Although I am too young to remember fully, Lancashire's life in all 60 years here: paid up to Friday, piano songs, Sunday Community, good neighbor, fear of relationship, great importance for self-esteem, and I was glad to see Naughton's lines The funniest from the left left. There is no doubt that this film should be available on the DVD - it is well suited and most displays are well recognized.
