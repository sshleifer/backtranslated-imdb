I began to be forced to attend with my wife if she was attracted to the Royal British family and their history, and she could not go to the movies without me. Although viewers should not expect to have electricity, this film has been made well and the visual feature is second and no. In many ways it helps to remove the story that Victoria was a woman who was not suffering and dumpy often seen in the picture. He was very intelligent and according to the history of his early years, a happy and happy woman. Albert's love was the foundation of true love, and even if you only count the number of children she gave (9), they must have a passionate relationship. All this is well shown in the film. To this end, cast to the well selected with Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend to provide sound displays like Victoria and Albert. (SPOILER PRODUCTION) Historical accuracy is the amount of doubt when no Prince Albert get shot while protecting Victoria. There is at least one attempt to kill when they were together, but no one was shot. I found it strange that little was done to extend the close relationship between Victoria's mother and Sir John Conroy. It is very likely that this relationship was the true cause of Victoria's problem with her mother and Conroy. I also found that there was an attempt to show the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as a romantic mistake, or at least being able to be romantic. He was already 50 years old when Victoria came to the throne, and when marriage between older men and young women were common at that time, the movie shows Melbourne as being something 30 with an opponent and Prince Albert. There were rivals for Albert, but he could not get married even less than his center in life, and Albert was one of the few who would be accepted in any case. Use the worst times in movies, and the brownie points and my wife can not be a bad thing.
