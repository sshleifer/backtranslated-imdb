I loved this masterpiece and, in fact, I have also found Mary Poppins (although I would like Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be silly and sacrine-sweet. Angela Lansbury has her character in full and I don't know why people think of this film as a misleading. It was magical and it was great fun to see. Each area had a certain charm if you should know the best characters. You see how this little cast of collective family learning relationship with each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were being developed well, especially Charles who was in the "Age of Not Believe". Mary Poppins can be more popular and respected by others but this small gem will be one that I always love and love.
