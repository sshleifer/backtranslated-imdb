A modern modern house in a wealthy area seems to be the reason for each of its remarkable inhabitants (and death) behavior. Or at least the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy, says. After a series of deaths in a nearby inn, Col knows something appropriate. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is also a star as a creative architect. <br /> <br /> My view: The Working House because of Lara Flynn Boyle and places (beautiful houses) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actor, not to mention quite stunning. He brings loyalty to his character and makes the film interesting. Without it, it would have failed. "It's alive" announces the prospective buyer pointing to the house. Yes, it is alive. But the story is not too much. To prevent Boyle's presence, not much happening here, as much of the movie is used to watch or wait to see how the house will affect its current owners. Results can be predictable. But I loved it yet. Movie theaters attract the movie to watch. 8/10 for Boyle, Cluster of bad modern modern houses, places and movies, and decorating and decorating tablets.
