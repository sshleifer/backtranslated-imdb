This highly-made film is (me) it's good to write in the movie must be all. Kasdan takes search for meaning in our lives and puts out for all to see and wonder. The movie is about split people build defensive themselves from violence and hatred and hardness of everyday life. We are asked a question after a question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself 'Do I do a fighter film (and with our relaxing extension) causing violence in the community?' Claire asks "What kind of world gives us something worthwhile as a human life?" Mack is not immune as he asks' Do you? Is it possible to pass the limits of the race and (even more difficult) financial? This is actually not mentioned in the film, but in general. Others ask their questions too, and being honest raises more than answers. We are trying our whole life to find answers to questions that we will not answer at all, and in some cases to make responses to us. We are happy with questions that we cannot answer. For some answers it is true. Claire and Mack know that even if they can take the easy road and allow the government to give the child, they find it to be the responsibility of their lives in their hands. Davis 'sees a spell' and decides to make a stupid film, but the next day returns and dismisses his epiphany as under his art. We all are looking for answers. The movie does not respond to them, just reminds them to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
