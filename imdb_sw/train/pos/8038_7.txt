Two snipers travel widely in the forest to find their goals; Slimy master of drug abuse in South America and head chief. <br /> <br /> To succeed in creating a state of speaking, Sniper is for a lot of very exciting accounts, taking time, establishing characters and their problems and growing in good practice. Director Llosa is not always succeeding in maintaining a sombre situation and can be closed a certain story; Some detors here do not look up to the volume. But this film is better than Stallone / Stone Travesty Expert. Billy Zane, usually winning, surprises as well as a sniper who has never had an experience with Berenger's veteran. For Berenger this film proved to be its last good budget operating Hollywood. He can perform these roles in his sleep and is very persuasive here, assuming twice as much responsibility directly on the DVD column.
