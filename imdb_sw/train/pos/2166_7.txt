It's not a big fan of Tim Matheson but I must admit I liked this film. It was dark and slightly shaking with some little events, I don't know they would design this film for a little SF and a little bit frightened. I saw this at 2:00 or more on my local channel there was nothing else so I decided to look at it. If you have not seen this film, it suggests that it is not too bad, it is enough for the participants, but they did not fully reflect all their potential. I don't know if this film went to the movie but it was shown if it was made for TV or go directly to the video, i for someone could buy this if it was a good fit on DVD and my movie type and has a small X-Files encrypted with it. Government activities or non-power organizations involved in dodgy shade activities. Usually a good film.
