This unknown gem was the foundation of French - which shows, and I mean that as excitement. Caroline (Lee) is led by a wealthy Argentina (Roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline has already been married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived on a plane and launches once on a reminiscence directed to viewers at the end of the time Caroline decided to love with another person: dilettante-ish (Gardiner) painter. Film shows the story of Anthony's strategy in connecting Caroline from his actor, and how the experience has helped him and his Argentina. Overall: Ronald Colman is in its modern and fascinating position, Reginald Gardiner is at its most amazing time, Gilbert Roland is a very wonderful hour, and Anna Lee is just a pleasure. The film is headed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); All production feels like a work of love. There is a wonderful touch, such as a collage to break the Colman and handle the camera, and the unique use of the cabinet door of the sliding council. It is a sin that has never been released on a DVD - this is a kind of film that can stimulate interest in a common film.
