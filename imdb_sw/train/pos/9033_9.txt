I watched this film without knowing anything about it and I found it similar to them to Billy Elliott (2000). These two films depend on the relationship of the father / husband concerned. In the two films, the son does not want to follow his father under the mines and dreams of a better life from their home city. All men are faced with shock by their classmates and all have a female model that teaches them. The biggest difference that I found among the film was that October Sky was the most attractive and touching film. Laura Dern puts the move to Chris Cooper so much to the father as he continued to do in America's beauty (1999). Joe Johnston was amazed at his subtle tactics, very different from his alternate features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
