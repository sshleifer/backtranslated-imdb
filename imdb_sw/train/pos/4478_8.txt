In general this is beautiful, lighter, romantic, comedy music. I think small cases can be made for the movie to be long. But I don't know you would like to cut. Sing that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. Play for the wonderful which Kelly does? No. When the movie takes to develop a line of story and develop the relationship of the characters? No (which seems to be the most common complaint that the most recent movies are not going on the characters). Some of the views that Iturbi did not bring much to the film but this gives us the opportunity to see and hear good talent from 1040s. Why would he not be an actor? He was an important part of the movie as the primary plot was to get Grayson's decision with him. Home Katherine Grayson wanted to become a star of opera. Louis B. Mayer brought him to the MGM for a screening feature involving aria. During his observation in the movie there is a bronze shot of MGM of copper and exciting. You can imagine it was like that when he made a real screen test before. <br /> <br /> This game is full of life is hard to hit all the important things. Major use was made by color and lighting in the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became a star he did. The most beautiful feature of the cinema is how Sinatra (a man of the women however) played the role of wanting to get only a date on leave. You will feel good after watching this film. 7/10
