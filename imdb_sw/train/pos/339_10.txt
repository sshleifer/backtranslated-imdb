I read the book of Schneebaum (the same title as this film) when it was first published and played by its ability to see many ways of "others" (yourself and the Amazon people who lived and loved) through living a good life. His subsequent books were not strong, but showed his ongoing effort. His description of his sexual relationship with men of the tribe was the way before his early 60's, but his loyalty and his transparency on him were welcome. This modernization easily sends everything to the greatness and generosity of the person, but it also provides an inexhaustible detail of innocence (which is not moral values, in this case) that occurs when men "civilized" intervene in traditional communities. However, Schneebaum himself has moved into a state of lack of excellence that shows the possibility of saving humanity from its own destruction.
