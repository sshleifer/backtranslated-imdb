These Hong Kong are written on multiple packages on melodrama more than the week's 'Young & The Restless' value. This is more than the loss of 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than the D'Amato grade. Lee Lee (Emy Wong) gets a wonderful change from a nurse to a fire-to-trot walker. The future expert of Italy / politician, Illona Staller, who was later named Ciccolina (and having sex with HIV John Holmes) plays Emy. Exotic areas have some smooth-core scenes all around this one outside. It is recommended for original 'Emmanuelle' fans, which I am one!
