I saw this film at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was displayed by connecting to Red Balloon. All these films are the same in their quality of dreams. Most of the films involve fish swimming happily in her bowl when her new owner, a young boy, is away from school. Cat enters the room where the fish and its bowl are, and begins with the power of his "mouse". The boy starts walking home from school, and the observer asks if he will come in time to save his fish friend. Fish are cleaned by the presence of the cat, and finally jumps out of the bowl! Kaka goes quickly to the fish, gently takes her with her rows, and brings her back to her bowl. The boy returns joyfully to his fish, no one wise. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing in all its bitterness and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director might have wiped out technical and back in 1959 - it seems more than a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, see - you can't despair! And if you * can get it, let me know so I can get a copy, too!
