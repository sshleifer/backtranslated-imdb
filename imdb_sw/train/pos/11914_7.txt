You know, this film is not good, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels to help the baseball team. I have seen the line of conspiracy to be a way of a trick, the father of the child says he will take him as an angel to win pennant (because he knows they will not be) Kid pleads to his false god to help the angels to win, God helps all the time (through angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) and at the end, his father never took him back and ran to his motorcycle for sure that the children were faced. is hilarious until Danny Glover adopts me and is a friend. <br /> <br /> I think the side is that the old woman is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories. The real conqueror here, though, is a god. Because later he got a job as a writer for a lot of prank displays. <br /> <br /> As a children's movie, it gets 7. As a movie about blind secrets, stupid faith, and the nature of "god," gets 10.
