If you "get", it's very good. <br /> <br /> If you don't, it's good. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting" does not mean you have gone through the school bullet. There is much more to this film which, sometimes, the school shooting becomes useless. Above all, it's a movie about acceptance, both - for a terrible event, but also for people who are different for any reason. It is also a movie about unknown pain, and how different people end up. In this case, the difference between Alicia's anger and Deanna's quarrels builds a state of concern such as through the movie we are wondering how the director can win the last happiness of his hat. Interestingly, viewers are given a loan for humanity; Our mind is not satisfied with the foot, implausibly moralistic ending. Over and above, I try to keep the head on the movies being false and all. However I must admit, I cried as a lost child during this movie. There were some things about that which hit * a lot near the house and opened the old wounds that were not completely healed. But that's not a bad thing.
