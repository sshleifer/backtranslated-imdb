This story is a complex and mysterious story of the final harem of the Ottoman Kingdom, which we have been told to convince us to see the works of the world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed stories, characters, acting and events. Few events arising from quick editing and small names sometimes disappear very quickly, otherwise a good piece. Safiya The main character is played by Marie Gillain who is happy to say she did a wonderful job without doing that. The exhibition with him and Alex Descas (Nadir) is interesting and interesting. I recommend this film to anyone who looks at looking at something less than Hollywood and more realistic to their evolving world.
