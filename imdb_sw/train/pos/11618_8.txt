Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Fantasy Team. This is one of the most exciting in 2005. A good plot. From the very. The big eye of the eye. This is one of the largest movies of Wes Craven except "Right" and "Elm Street". This may be better. The program is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) hotel manager struggles, the late Board of Red Eye to return LA. What? She knows that she is followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack Ripper (Murphy). They have a few drinks and end up sitting on the plane. Later he tells him that he is a murderer who was sent to kill Secreteary of State Security who lives in Lisa's hotel. And this has to do with Lisa. In fact, he will have an upper room in the top shape so that they can beat a bomb, if he has no Ripner to be killed by his father (Brian Cox). Moving and bringing to the story actually provides additional ingredients and side-by-side characters and a further joke. In general, one of the most beautiful of the year 2005 is certainly worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
