Usually the best way to undermine me in the film includes a certain reference to Orson Welles. But here's a sci-fi comedy quoting War of worlds advertising .... and it's gold! The very idea of ​​a small group of lesser, more aggressive and ignorant strangers as children in Halloween dress is very beautiful. Don't show for the idea that because it looks like a children's movie is too bad - otherwise, there are many hidden treasures… Gem!
