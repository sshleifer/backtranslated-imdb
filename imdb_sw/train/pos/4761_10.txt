The best films with beautiful performances from Zack & Lochley. Many in their anger (and mine) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All the respect for Jerry Doyle but in the 4th & 5th season I lost sympathy for the character.) It didn't take long to start accusing Zack (whom I love the best in the show) and take payment. I'm sure Zack could cope. Soulhunter's plot is interesting, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack. Humor adds good. 10/10
