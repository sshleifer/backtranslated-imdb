It's hard to imitate the film - maybe it's a thriller of avant garde? Mama Night is a very good novel of Vonnegut, and certainly one of her simple novels to change the film's length. Changing the film is very reliable for the original book. The "indie" method of how this film was made is more likely than having a great Hollywood film. Nowadays, I doubt that the novel of the mind as Mama Night could get green light from the great Hollywood ponds. And that's usually very bad, but it's not in this case. The mother of the night has a sharp focus and thrown firmly. Nick Nolte who seems to have the best roles as he grows up, still has "everyone" persona that allows him to go to different characters. Sheryl Lee is good and beautiful as always. I always thought he was more eligible than he got out of the entertainment industry. I think doing your first as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) and a little bit of air is not a good job, even if the TV show becomes a small thing. However this film is very enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, due to the modern geographical reality, the novels of the novel can be seen on the date, and other small-skilled viewers of history will be totally confused with the events taking place (I speak to you, fellow Americans who are students and shut down to The industry in geography, history, and master knows what other subjects!).
