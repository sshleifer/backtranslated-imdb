This is an unfamiliar film for me, as after a good film from a new film manufacturer (FAR OUT and Phil Mucci), another author / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and watch his film, THE CURE. I don't usually explore the film this way, but what heck - I like shorts and couldn't wait to see another. It's amazing, when it turned out I liked CURE, I wasn't happy and then let Jafri know. On his loan, he encouraged me to re-examine - by giving my credibility my loyalty. The film has a great style and away from the Jafri's direction, it is unique - especially for this non-skilled film (it's its first film). The combination of unique choices, colors and music is very suitable for the film that created a beautiful atmosphere of the atmosphere. The truth is made on film and that is the credit for the effectiveness of the film. However, what I didn't like was some text. When the basic idea was great, the end was very easy to see. I certainly would like to end that came as a surprise or there is an unexpected absence. However, taking into account that this film is from a person who cannot be able to make such a professional film from his experience, it serves well for the future. Good work.
