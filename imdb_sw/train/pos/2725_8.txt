"In cold blood", changed by director Richard Brooks from the famous Truman Capote novel, deals with brutal and meaningful family killings and four criminals. The film is increasingly as a study of the behavior of the killers, especially the man walking Perry Smith (Robert Blake). Sent / include a few well-known names but yet brings stories to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are better together as two criminals with different characteristics. They work hard when Blake also gets many opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasies of her character. Some of the cast are just average and not worth mentioning. Richard Brooks received Oscar's selection for all his script and its direction. In my opinion, both were better, although the script does not miscalculate with some consultation complaints at a late stage. Oscar-selected movie by Conrad Hall is also a top-score, as well as a editor. He is also worthy of note is a jazzy symbol and Quincy Jones which has taken the last four selection of Oscar film. Unlike many criminal films, this should not be violent. Brooks returns the killers to be sympathetic characters instead of judging them hard. If you agree with the idea the film shows an interesting alternative to the usual way of mobile. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the technical issues that are being addressed.
