This is religious. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this film. It's very funny and very dry. I have seen several times these arguments and are still unhappy. If you have enjoyed "Morons out of space" you will like this. Play great on world wars. I love the Rampage of Red to find visitors, bug in hood, DOD, Search Annihilator of Tracks, Mine Mine, Red Camo, break the speed limit to 1800Mph! "I'll get a bucket!" Interesting. I would love this to come on DVD! Forget the wrong instructions to see yourself!
