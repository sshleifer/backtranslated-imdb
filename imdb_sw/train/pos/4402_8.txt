After seeing Jesse all, Quantrill, jayhawkers, etc. The film in 50 years, is very happy to see this film with a new view and director Ang Lee. The Lawrence attack area, Kansas is amazing. The sexual relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is as good as a bad person. At all times this film makes you afraid of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will come to the next hours. Certainly worth seeing.
