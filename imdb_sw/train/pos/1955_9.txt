The only kind of film I like. Some very good British actors with Sharon Stone one and only. Catherine Tramell (Stone) cautiously incorporates a large group of life education people, playing with their weaknesses to gather the experience of writing a secret book. He plays the psychopath of the female very well when he has enough sex to show it by convincing which can be considered to be one of the last widows of Black. Tramell is used in dark areas within the community and becomes independent in sadomasochistic events in 'never to visit the dark side' of the city. From the beginning, there is nothing short of R rating here from alone alone. The stone can also be described as a woman Hannibal Lecter, a senseless woman who kills without a food plan.
