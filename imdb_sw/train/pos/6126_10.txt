I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 in my local store and I thought it looked good for a small movie budget so I bought it and I was right. At the beginning this film is about a snowman striker so it's something to laugh and how it looks funny compared to snowman on the lid. That work was the same as Jack Frost's lines said I was laughing "I just stirred you with the smoke" and "Many animals used away from snow" how funny and camping? The story was originally very good and ignorant too "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack beat his eyes and the sticks of candles". If you are looking for the B-Movie Comedy fear that is full of puns then check out Jack Frost out. 10/10
