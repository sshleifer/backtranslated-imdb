Modern actually has a good story, but it comes to several important places. It's almost like the director hit the movie together without taking the time to reduce the key in the film. Dennis Quaid does a very good job in his role ... but something is clear from several important events. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hour movie can be reduced to 2 hours of the movie. And maybe it would be a very good film if it didn't feel like it was thrown together. <br /> <br />
