This movie is undoubtedly perfect 10/10 .. for all people out there who are rating this film below the class because it has no "good plot" or something like that, that's worried, saying movie Jackie Chan is bad because of the plot it's like saying movie porn is bad because it doesn't plot! you look at Jackie Chan for your tutorial, for her point not to concentrate on the good news or something like that, if you look at how she is filming and comparing the other American movies from that time and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movie was on top of events and it is not good when the American films had good plots but shitty events compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is looking for porn, Jackie Chan is looking for ACTION, I think you are a rating is bad because there is no plot because you think that's how smart movie critic without a good movie but the way I see it is a good movie is a movie that can put me welcome . The point of the middle of the film was horrible, BORING, but put this way to rest which all of the practical events and stunts greatly pay for all of that. This has changed how American films were made, having stolen images from this film. If you want a real person, a real singer then watch this film and beyond Jackie Chan's, hes fresh in every way. He makes American movies look like walking in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American movies depend heavily on the special effects and security and double-ringing and much more. Police story and many other Jackie Chan movies are pieces of work of a real singer who goes out and is very talented in what he can do. The masterpiece
