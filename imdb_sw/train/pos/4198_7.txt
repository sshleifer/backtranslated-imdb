From the opening area of ​​the train full of people who do bad work (RICHARD WIDMARK) to steal from a woman's bag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP TO STREET STREET is not happy to see. On the other hand it is because the solid firms have grown from the entire adult, the picture of B&W is crisp and adds to the story of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts on leagues similar to biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston . In fact, it has the same efficiency as the Huston film on a heist that goes wrong - but the payoff is not quite strong. JEAN PETERS is as good as a hard-edged girl who Widmark describes as "knocking around a lot". He gives a great appeal of energy and sex to his role of a woman is not very violent who carried a small film in his loan to his girlfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something that FBI already knows. They are on its choice when theft occurs. THELMA RITTER adds realistic to his woman's photo “Moe” who buys and sells anything to make a profit and finish paying for her life. He deals mainly with his last situation with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This has been confirmed to keep your thoughts through an hour and twenty minutes. Beautiful good from Fox and known for Widmark, Peters and Ritter presentations.
