I would like to give this good series more than 10 votes if Claudia Black did not proceed into it! His inclusion as Vela 'silly brought him down in my estimates. Bringing him on a regular basis simultaneously with Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake. Unfortunately we were coming from losing 'Jack' and really didn't need this great series has turned into new 'Farscape' events. I was a great fan of the film "Stargate" and when the series was announced that I had reservations that could live up to the film, but after looking at the first part that I must admit I was beaten. I have been interested in new events in anticipation
