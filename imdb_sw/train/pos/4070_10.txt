I know Anime. I've been in it a long time before being a national thing; I loved Ranma before many people did not know what Dragonball Z was even. And so you just know I did not exalt myself, I would say this: out of all the creatures I have seen, the Castle in the heavens is the best one. The obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I disagree completely. Most people only know the movie for the Acedmy Prize; this is not expanding - I have shown Princess Mononoke and the Castle in heaven for people who could only see Spirited Away, and agree that the second end is the head of the three. Personally, I could never think that anything could compare with Princess Mononoke, until finally I saw the Castle in the Sky. I still think that before it's better than two, but the Castle in the Sky looks easily with it; in many ways, Castle has great things that Mononoke did not exist. In any case, if you have seen only Spirited Away, and think that is the best movie of Miyazaki, be ready to tremble your ground.
