I have two copies of these two classic Movies where Robert blake is a very good actor where over the 1967 movie Blake is shown more by a jail window describing his childhood life where it makes since he was killed by the Futter Family does not show much at the top of what went really not Who made the murder but it is a very big catcher if you look at the 1996 movie In the cool blood of the classic makes more yarn.
