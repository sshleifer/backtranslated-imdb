A true story of a gang of junkies stealing a businessman is not honest of drugs, ornaments, guns, and money. Some would say this is a bad story of America in the last eight years where on the peace and love of the sixties they had fallen into drugs and AIDS. In fact, this is ordinary people who have no purpose of life living around and decide to steal someone who is kind. What is the second part of their main plan? Once you have the items ... they will sit next to get again. Good plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no doubt in this film and no surprise. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of heroes out of these characters, and party events and montage to lose them, are weak and insulting. The story was better and more straightforward approach. As is the case, this is just a sad story of the long-term drug traffickers killed by big long-term businessmen. The great story, by way more than one, is John Holmes. He is the middle of this story yet. This movie should be all about him, his life. He was one in the garden, with wonders on cancellation. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it is not official, Boogie Nights is the best version of Holmes's life. Not quite true, but it's more fun.
