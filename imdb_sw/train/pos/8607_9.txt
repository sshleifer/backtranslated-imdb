He has never understood why MacDonald-Eddy swan has been worried - not just for their rebels but almost everyone. For me, "I married the Angels" is much more interesting and more thoughtful than any more exhibition than the duo. Set and dress is as interesting as there can be found in the MGM music, the script is for Anita Loos's credibility ("San Francisco," "Women," "Lords prefer Blondes," etc.), Rodgers and Hart Tunes (though it has been slightly modified. regularly MacDonald-Eddy Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given Heavenly treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner of the "Wizard of Oz"), and better, "beautiful song" looks at their modern attire and seem to be have fun with wonderful events. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" for today which is unknown and may have a hard time staying yet, but this is enough, a fantasy of quick should be fun.
