For this movie, it's all about fashion, atmosphere, and acting. Actually, I did not believe all the events of the plot, but it does not matter - the hard work, the unintended fruit, and the strange thing has healed me, and I took it on a journey, and I had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a good actor but a master of accents, and he reaffirms the feelings of Georgia's emotional feelings. Surrounded by many talents in support of roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz from Schindler's list and fall, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall) that I was just beaten. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I've never bored. Only one of the most beautiful of the year. If you ignore this movie (and the chance you have), then I recommend you look.
