It has retired * - also, my text was incorrect. Everyone writes every satire satire in the definition of society and economic comparison - how real. But for me, I see this film more than that. I love the image of this guy in a white suit. There is a lot of confusion and dirt around the world, but it will not work. Alec Guiness was the perfect boy to play this - his boyfriend and the curiousity of eternity is very accurate: <br /> <br /> "That is ingenious - can you tell me, what is the proportion of ink for gasoline?" <Br /> <br /> The only minutes of failure is when he knows that his invention has not worked after all - standing there almost naked. However, more than embarrassment is a simple desire that "did not work." He has never been threatened by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to strengthen it too." You often wonder before you leave to try again. What? Does he show any sign of the agony of the rebellion that must be caused? No is also the responsibility of Dapne. He is sick and tired with money and power. He thinks he finally found love, out of his father's company. At first she doesn't care about Sidney anymore than anyone else. But at the time when he fell off his car and went back to see if he had killed him - and still thinks of the beauty of his invention. Finally he found out what he thinks is worth living. The interesting thing is that even romance. It is a friendship, but with such a typical ephemeral which the title is virtually not recommended. It's more complimentary, and maybe even inspiring. <br /> <br /> On his discovery that Michael has no real love for him, and that his father can not really take care of him, he offers doubt and tries temp Sidney. Fortunately he finds that there are actually people in the world who live more powerful, money and desire. What comfort: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. If you were 'yes' I think I would like to encourage you." <br /> <br /> I love the last time, when all this amazing stuff seems to have not come. But then, screaming, shouting from start with Sidney leaves, his line of tune: dauntless. Where is Daphne? We don't know the truth - but they were not in love and was not a scientist. He got help to run and he got "shot at the hand of hope." (Pollyanna) The problem of the problem would be good, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I would have hope ..."
