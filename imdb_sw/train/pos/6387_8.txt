I thought this movie was installed very well. Sounds were also good. I loved how they overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was worth the time and money to look at. Atlantis has comic events that made me laugh. Other events made me sad. And others were happy. It is any movie you can enjoy. Since then Milo is a "teacher" of things or until he collects workers for a wonderful journey under the sea. After watching the film, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie gives you the best pictures in your mind. It's just like a book. But go ahead and watch this film!
