I have a bad part of the movie was the first half hour. I was very worried about who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the men came to the camp, there was a character like Bill Paxson, but it wasn't. Where did I tell Bill Paxson? Then, there was a boy and his girlfriend. She said she was 21 years old. Later, the same girl was talking and talking about her camp experience. That didn't make sense. He would be one year old. That said, the movie turned out to be very good. Kevin Pollak was a good boy who was always deceived. One boy had a perfect narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful partner. Alan Arkin was fascinated as the director of an old camp, who admits that he has grown up without the modern youth. The best part was that none of those who were older were successful in life. No one had a great job. This seemed a very real life. Movie was compared to Big Chill. Somehow it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning did not promise, the film ended to be very good.
