This secret of Sica provides products. And it is said that "the meek shall inherit the earth." This story of classes on the face but in fact it is typical for all homeless people who Europe residents after a great war. They do not have a home but for joy, in the community as well as the poor and self-care for them, to recognize the feet of Italian breeders. de Sica chooses to tell them as a story story, Cinderella's story. I have not read a book based on so I can't succeed if the deus ex machina is the reconstruction of the author or Vittorio. It begins with the words, "Once upon a time ..." to show an unfamiliar example of his story, for the story can be put everywhere and everywhere. The color of the aristocracy color that breaks the bone, the nature of the homeless especially when they begin to give their wishes and the end from the image of Spielberg makes this boulange happy for all. Deica's image is also one of the best. To give the neo-ulemme loyalty, he worked long-term among the old and beautiful films, creating a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fills with the desire of hope that one needs to continue to leave the world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
