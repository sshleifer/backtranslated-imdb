Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote a screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a hard, brutal, effective on pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who undoubtedly incorporates the microfilm of the top secret and becomes a target of spypi agents. It is also known as Jean Peters as a widespread e-mail that is used as an e-mail with his former boyfriend Richard Kiley. It is the best-black film and although the performances are very good actor of its character Thelma Ritter who stole the movie. As Moe who lost the road to the neck of the neck (and who also sells the news) he is sharp in the role that brought another Oscar selection. Surprisingly, Miss Ritter was chosen six times for the Academy Academy Award and she never won. This would have been the role that it struck for him!
