Kristine Watts (Weekly Molie) is broken off, missing her boyfriend; he can not win his love for him who has lost in the past. He employs a visitor (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes for things to fix. But when it cannot be corrected and sometimes the pain treatment is the end of a terrible. The first interesting point in "Treatment" is a stylish black and white film and color. The bright and bright screenplay is able to develop a bad and delightful story of love and an unexpected action of the final plot at the end of eight minutes. The sound is good but the sound is small and it is associated with the fact that English is not my native language, sometimes I had to repeat some of the words mentioned by the author. An unknown actor performs great performance and is very good. I hope you have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the beginning of director and author Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
