Written Love, Norma, has been revealed as a fraud in the media but this argument does not give her a good opportunity to delete her name. But it continues and returns he takes the text writer in an amazing way. What a sick woman! I loved this movie. I have not read a book but just have a good review and I have gone to see the rainy day. The journey of this film takes you to a wise, interesting and completely interactive.
