This is one of the few movies I can watch from time to time. If you have never seen it, make a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are amazing as well as though the movie is very encouraging, it reminds me of losing time for Julia. It is a great opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international controversy which is so great for us at this time of fear and fear.
