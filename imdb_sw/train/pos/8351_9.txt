I remember running fast for Spain for 25 years, and lifting from, what happened to be, two fleeing Italian pigs. They were doing a lot out of the law, but from the other side taking a little picture of Jesus in the pocket for their protection ... Just right, good and bad, crime and right where here in a new mix, out of the groups I knew. 'Les Valseuses' gives me, though it is a film and not a real life, a picture near my own experience: the consistency of every minute as soon as you leave 'back' and go in a very special way, whatever comes your way, it's another mental state and also 'risk' of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and want to harass you for 'stealing' and so onâ€¦ This film touches 'values', it's a story about 'what is and right': values. It is the resurrection of an individual who fights himself against "false values" and focus on ... There is a danger in all the way, because, how far can you go with your "freedom" and cross your own moral boundaries and others? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot you for things you do, like "stealing" gasoline from an international oil company for your fifth car? Les Valseuses raises these questions in me, because the values, contrary to the usual media message, are very difficult ...
