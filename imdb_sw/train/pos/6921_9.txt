Remember I am a fan of kind but recently we saw this film for the first time. How I ignored all this time is wonderful to me. For me it is the best film and that is the best "High Day". It is very west with the best acting and good news. The DVD is beautiful black and white and excellent movies. If you like west or James Stewart this film is not recommended.
