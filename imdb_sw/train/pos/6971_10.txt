In fact, the fan of "Sci-Fi" of the Gallactica War of the Fan will hate this. It makes me happy. I do not like those cheesy sci-fi displays especially the star of the Gallactica war and that's why I love this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show got a lot of heat to do this (non-standard-way way) and it was worth it. I read to the Week that they wanted to appeal to everyone including women and not just sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> It may seem to be a promised show since Lost. It has the most interesting, clever, and comprehensive script of any show at a certain time and is unique. What I like most about the show is that kind of looks like great Anime! From youngsters riding around with gun guns, and with a well-balanced and complicated script, robots remind me of something that came from Japan except a little bit more.
