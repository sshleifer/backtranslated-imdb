A fantastic fantastic film with enough coins to sack the pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a loving, dangerous, loving mother who can or cannot be what she sees. The story is very language in the cheek, and the conversation of the skills created. Points of humor and preference, neither are they too strong. Support support is stellar. Obstacle? This film requires your full attention, close to leaving the film and writing. Posey has more sexual appeals to raise her eye than many actors with the whole body. He appreciates your time, even if you don't know the denouement.
