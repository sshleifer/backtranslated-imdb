This is one of my loved ones forever. They do not want to endorse the non-fascinating life of his hero, but to be taken for what is worth and not to reduce the pressure, the movie is just very fun. It describes the impossible story of a permanent, innocent 40-year-old man named Arthur who has been given a great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, elected because the family thinks he can do something. Arthur suggests, but then falls carefully to Linda, waitress and a little thief. Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most fascinating drunk in the world, who antics are laughing a minute. True, Moore is Arthur and I agree with those who can think no other actor in the role. The women of the piece are also well shown. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and she on the screen of the screen and Moore is beautiful. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, a rich and more accurate woman chosen by Arthur. However, this film has actually been done by Sir John Gielgud, who shows Arthur's fianc√© but moral, Hobson. It is clear that these two have had a great love during the work of Hobson for a long time. Hobson is the best friend of Arthur and purveyor of unsolicited explanations and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's love yet, but his unusual relationship with the ignorant servant and of course he refuses. It is a pastor who will remember better after the completion of the credit.
