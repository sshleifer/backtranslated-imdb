I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies from the beginning. It's amazing to think about, and Bryan Fuller has a better idea of ​​this show. It is not possible for how much TV has been demanding, original show as Pushing Daisies. It is a great aid to see the show, that's different from the others, where if, if compared to some of the new exhibitions, such as Scrubs and House, you will see a similarity, and makes it worse when you see the closer to identity. <br /> <br /> For good cast, beautiful script, and hilarity in every section, Pushing Daisies is, by far, one of the most amazing displays on your television.
