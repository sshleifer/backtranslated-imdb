This movie feared to lose me! I admit that I used many movies to watch through my fingers but what I saw was awesome. I shouted two or three voices during the show. The words of wisdom my love issues were sounds and photographs. The voice was so loud and the environment was so wonderful. I read somewhere that it was the husband's husband and wife who had made it. For some reason that makes this even a stranger to me. If you like to enjoy the jitters of awesome movies than this is yours! Very suspenseful and great movie rental with a group of friends who love to watch the movies on the sofa to shout like little girls!
