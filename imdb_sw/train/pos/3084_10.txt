O man, why? "Degrees six" is a show about this known theory that we are all linked to someone. If you focus on the life of the group and the results of their actions. When I got the first news of this show, it did not pay attention to it. It seemed too normal, in fact. Then, I saw some periods ... and love! First of all, characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is a beer that has lost alcohol, a woman who hates her husband, a woman who has lost her husband, a driver who has a concerned brother and so on. Great! Most loved ones are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then, cast. They are all the best. Jay Hernandez, from the "Hostel", shows here his ability to act with more 3D behavior than his original work as Paxton. Some offer good performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> When I came to IMD, after checking other sessions, I don't believe it's deleted. To a large extent, I can understand the minimum. <br /> <br /> It is very bad he did not have more than one season. It's really a good show to follow!
