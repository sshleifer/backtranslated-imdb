This movie is good. Just. It is rare that you get comedy and standards, and this is a good example of such a beautiful blood. When I saw this film first, if the loan was locked, a friend and I looked at someone else and asked ... 'Did you just take it?' For those concerned, see the standards. See the comparison between Vick and people in the club, DNA! Look at the different characters, each jostling for the position, and if you don't see anything else, look at the relationship between Vick's therapy and through the film. ALL EVERYTHING IN THE WORK OF WORK! The opening line about the world of Vick. The closing section with the camera that comes into the head of Vick, and inside, the whole world! Fully used, wonderful groups of cartoon, beautiful, pleasant, pleasant!
