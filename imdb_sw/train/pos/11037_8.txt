Now, I know the French prisoners are unlikely to read Lovecraft (and that proves my conviction that his text should be taught in school, perhaps as a different subject), but they thought something that looked like a "ftagn yog sototh" could possibly cause any good? The movie is being held in a prison where four very unlikely cell groups are found on a magical book that can, if it reads it right, to remove it. If in prison they go, the cell was quite uncertain, so it made it difficult for me to get into the environment. It also goes slowly, which can cause people. But moreover, this is a sense of feeling, combining "hell" is "other people" with the story of Lovecraft / Barker, and making it a success for success. Under / below: take time to watch this. That means not doing when you are going to work or sleeping or when you are doing something else. This is a film that works best if you are inserted into it. Learning lessons: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
