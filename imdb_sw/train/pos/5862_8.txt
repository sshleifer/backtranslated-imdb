There is not much progress in this story - only two men use very different ways to handle Vietnam records. But what was not there for the premise, it is more to do with the act and authenticity. It's a quiet film on friendship bonds and shared experiences. We even get romance (not freeous - just another very real piece of this story). It's good to see.
