Few Few Caution! <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie ... very good movie. And I'm surprised to say that myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the name of the director Deran Serafian means bad news. Most of his films are under the average practical works like Warrant Death and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and perhaps he would have to continue making awesome movies instead of action. This movie was very interesting to me. Good effectiveness, seeing the prominent participants and the big budget involved. It's really a story that lets you focus. Specific fans of the original Dracula story will be satisfied. Sarafian highlights another feature of the famous Bram Stoker story and continues to be honest and true. It describes the life of Roemenian Dracula and how he feared the Turkish army away and beat the corpse in front of his fortress. Of course, that's where the truth and "according to the true story" stops. Drinking blood and all the substances originated from Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, the calculation (Vlad Teppish) migrates to America with tons of woman. And they're all good girls, I'll give it to him. In general, good acting and unidentified surfaces, enough blood and gore to satisfy many fearful fans and interesting stories. This film is unknown and was hidden in the black shelves on my video. But it's certainly worth cleaning the dust on the lid and putting it on the VCR. Heck, is better than the famous movie Nicole Kidman with the same title. These two films are nothing else, but I blast the movie by stealing away from this beautiful picture. See ... my opinion of humility on the death of = 8.5 / 10
