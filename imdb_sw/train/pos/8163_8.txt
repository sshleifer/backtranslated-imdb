Corbin Bernsen offers a very bright performance and riveting as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a successful dentist Beverly Hills who has taken care of perfection. When he finds that his good wife of the blonde match has been cheating on him and the IRS begins to persuade him about tariff problems, Feinstone park under pressure and goes rough around the bend. Director Brian Yuzna, who works from a suitable, magic and crafty and Stuart Gordon script, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch, demonstrates a strong neurosis and diving under a clean manicured clean face of an honorable American valued value and bad taste. In addition, Yuzna most of the ingredients on going grisly up and feeling the loss of losing the black pitch tree humor. Bernsen shines as Dr Feinstone; he is making the best realistic projects that are right under the Feinstone stability of the fraud and the certainty. The support is also ideal: Linda Hoffman as a pastor of Feinstone, loyal wife Brooke, Earl Boen as hard, IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as Jessica, Patty Toy as perky Karen assistant, Jan Hoag as office assistant Candy Candy, Virginya Keehne as a good boy, Sarah's age, Ken Foree as good, no-nonsense Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as a good good partner of Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as a purebred muffin fresh Matt, and Mark Ruffalo as the sleazeball act Steve Owners. The first level of pretend f / x is everything like gory, substantial and reducing as they should be. The movie's film movies by Levie Isaaks responds to many corners of the camera and a few tiny zoom-around cameras. The Alan Howarth mark of shuddery also affects the spot of walking meat. Lovely pleasant.
