Thanks to the Warner Store, I can see again this kind of mammoth type that gives us everything but the kitchen sink. (The bath, however it is.) This film provides screen time for everyone who was under the contract for the Warners at that time. If some artists seem to be unaware of others, it is because they were great in quiet days, and many died with the popularity of talkies. There are some really amazing artists from the era of vaudeville too. You will be attracted to Winnie Lightner, who makes two numbers. There is also the French star, Irene Bordoni who believes the love song through sexy. Perhaps one of the most important things is Technicolor two-strip "Chinese Fantasy," which has been restored to this version. It is very good and is star Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a great finale "Lady Luck" going on for nearly a quarter hour. This is a real epic of the first talkie era. Any old movie-movie will like this.
