Our words are a wonderful example of passion, making films in its beautiful beauty. In fact, it's amazing wonder of the movie; A delightful skillful work that describes the life of the three Heights, Brooklyn during their summer in their lives when the controversial life of their life will encourage everyone to make a difficult number, life changing a decision that will describe each of them, together and how they will continue to interact with each other for years to come. Jim McKay's message of leadership / leadership is of grace and color. No sappy, the feeling of freedom has never been a solution to the image in this film. What we see here seems, sometimes, to have a broken heart. There is a natural - trust, if you will be in our Words that comes from what is great in this type, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> A great loan for the spirit of the film goes to its code administrators. The presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) are very powerful. It would be easy - and, in fact, clearly want - to refuse, as others seem, to show these three as uncomfortable or disloyal. In fact, their charm of stability, their sense of glory and their wisdom, sometimes odd, in the film, is completely riveting. A person needs to be "out of touch" and, or quite differently, the behavior of young people to lose legitimacy in what these three young women bring to the screen. In addition, support, especially Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, congratulates the work of three girls and the sound of the film. Our words are a film that shouldn't - and anyone of any age.
