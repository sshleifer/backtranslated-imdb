Coming soon before the placing of ethical principles that prevented the spirit of writers, directors and executives, the revision of the first "Human Bondage" of Somerset Maugham referred to many films. It has no value for shock today, very good acting. Even though the cast is better, this is the first responsibility of Bette Davis and one of the best Leslie Howard exhibitions. Howard is an English wannabe artist Paris Carey who has spoken gently and firmly that they do not have any talent and that her dedication is not an alternative to true scholars. Take a lesson to the heart he returns to London and register at a medical college (one, by the way, which seems to be no female-time students would have at least a few. Perhaps the author / doctor Maugham did not take the attention of distaff drugs) <br / > <br /> Have a tea one day Carey is inserted by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a role as a moral and very wrong farrago. Her cockney spells are bright like Eliza Doolittle. His regular attempts to communicate with him are greeted with a low response of enthusiasm, "I don't care," a sure sign for anyone who has a direct head burning that he drives deep. Mildred's Maugham added the tips of his staff and walked the old way of walking on the street, something that was not addressed here. Carey exercises serve the Rogers the wrong needs of financial support. He is very fond of him who plays with him as a church member of the Sunday church without trying to hit his instrument. No sex here. Knowing that she has not found any place, she begins a clean relationship with Norah, a woman who wishes. Re-enter Mildred, full of baby, and in his normal maintenance needs. Toka Norah was broken. Another split from Mildred and Carey begins long-term friendship with Sally, devoutly devoted to her father who seems to see the last marriage as a good thing for two young people and a chance to be removed. of one of his nine children. <br /> <br /> The movie is good but not quite follow the best novel Maugham. Careard's Howard is ridiculous and is dangerous and with a large amount of his eyes his sad eyes reminds one of the dots facing a shotgun twice. Mildred is the worst, the worst of the worst, he is involved in his own needs without hiding when he tries to run Carey and thin patina of love words (and offers - when one promises that he will do "anything [he] wants," a statement cheat time and one that I have a very thorough listeners. <br /> <br /> Before the Code can be but broken by Mildred's fast-march would have satisfied the Catholic League's decision. The end is normal - sin loses, victory The main principle. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell made a good show from his two major stars, one well established, one of which was largely created because of this film. br>> <br /> Available on DVD. /> <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard displays)
