A true American story of young people who are interested in launching their rocket in West Virginia's coal town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Through experiments, suffering and perseverance of faith, they are finally the ability to achieve their goals. Jake Gyllenhaal, as a group leader, is the best in the head position. As his teacher of science to encourage, Laura Linney is very good but her southern scope is higher. It is a stand-by-standing stand with Chris Cooper, a pedestrian, who wants his son to follow in the footsteps, but gradually comes close to the end of the film. What makes this film unusual for our times is that there are no bed events and no dirt. It is a matter of American story that has been well done. In addition to the angle of science, we have the problem of father-man, soccer victory as a way to avoid coal mining, and the love of family love. Why is it not a picture like this most recognized during the award?
