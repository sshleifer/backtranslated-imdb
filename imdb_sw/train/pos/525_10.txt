Only after the end of WWII's Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to heal great promotions between Britain and the United States. At that time there was a lot of "more paid, more sex and more here" of comments. Somehow they came with this jewel. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. It has everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, festive and very quirky. I can never explain exactly why, but it blows all the rights that are right and though I've seen it hundreds (yes, really) I'm still sure to have tears in many points around. <br /> <br /> Was it a good acting, beautiful set, guided script? Who knows. But * DO * see and you'll see what I'm saying.
