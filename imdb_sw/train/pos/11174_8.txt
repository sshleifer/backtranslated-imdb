Probably the most appropriate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprisingly, since the King himself wrote screenplay. The story follows the family of believers to move to the beautiful house of Maine. One of the other residents is Jud, a good old man who knows a little about the area. One is the highway run in front of them. Another is the way leading to the Pet Semetari, where children for decades have been buried by animals killed by the highway. Recently, the Ellie Creed cathedral, the Church, is found dead. Luckily, this happens when the family, except Louis (father), is off to Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis on another burial ground, more than the Semetary of the Pet, where the Church causes it. Later, Louis is greeted (not gently) with the Church. He came back, apparently having examined his way out of the bag buried. Perhaps he was buried alive. Maybe not. There is nothing I can say without damaging the story. All King's settings have seen this will be the most horrible. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert is doing a good job leading the case. The crime is topped up in the film, due to part of the plot development. The area where Gage is killed will be a stick in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have a conclusion. Easy to decide what will happen, but Lambert takes away some time of terrible, and sometimes frustrated. Overall, this is a good and very good film. If you would like to be scared and do not worry that haunted and other pictures that feed regularly then "Pet Sematary" is what you are looking for. Unresponsive fans will want to avoid this.
