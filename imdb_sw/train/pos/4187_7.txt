This is a very good example of film films. The arrangement is 50 years and the Communists are trying to steal the secret of weapons from the US Government. Richard Widmark is a suave tool without damage. It gives a very good performance but nothing A-List on it. Interestingly, it was not just a hero to resist but through many films, the hero to fight the shape. That's not very common. Jean Peters gave good performance like a hooker and a heart of gold. The well-known executive Thelma Ritter shines like a bucket of bucket. The plan had its own right to lose and return, talk and difficult discussion. There is a fighting area near the end of the film (on the subway station) that was good and exciting. I think ordinary fans (like me) will enjoy this film. For non-traditional viewers, it may seem dated a bit and something around Commie tad overdone.
