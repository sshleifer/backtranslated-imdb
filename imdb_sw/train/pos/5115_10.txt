I haven't seen this film in the theater. I agree with Vinnie Barbarino's preference. What? Who is John Travolta who made the movie? I remember Oscar's announcement that year, with Travolta watching quite while he did not win. What? How can he, when there were "real" actors in the race? Sorry John, you should win. Having infected this film in the past years of the cable, I have loved the entire movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all have done well. I, too, I never say I do it when I open the station. I'm stopping and looking. For many years, I have learned to do a lot of talks, dance and my fingers in my waist, and learn to know more Travolta. The only thing to be disappointed to me is to watch, in a voice, of some music from Urban Cowboy. "Seeking love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was stuck full of scholars who did not make it sound. Should be two CD ........
