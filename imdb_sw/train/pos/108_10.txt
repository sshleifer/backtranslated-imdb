'Europa' (or, if also known, 'Zentropa') is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. The combination of grayscale and color of the image is almost seamless ... a real feast for the eyes. The picture was hard for the Golden Palm of 1991 in Canners. Award went to Barton Fink (and brother of Coen); film stylistically similar to Zentropa. Here is an exercise in the class: rent both films and become a judge to yourself.
