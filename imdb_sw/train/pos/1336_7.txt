This is the most beautiful movie, with good news, popular actors and great songs. The movie was badly unfortunate. One of the weakest points of the film is an exciting series of circles published from the Pretty Woman. Why? What? Does it hurt to try some nature, Abbas? Mustan? Any body? <br /> <br /> Movies are about new couples, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya is not pregnant after the accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and finally decided to use a dedicated mother, who will take her baby. They choose Madhubala, a bad pastor who played with Preity Zinta. Movies are not really true, I mean, not easy to pass? And even if they tell a girl, does it mean that someone sleeps with her? What? Did you feel about importing? However, I think if the authors heard about all of this, the film has not been made, so the concept is obvious. Salman is doing very well. It is good to see him playing bad habits. But his behavior is faced with unnecessary and cheap discussions about his great love for his wife and how he feels it is difficult to sleep with another woman. Come, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is almost just the same; he is effective and tries to do something for the role but gets quite a shadow with Preity Zinta. The video is of Preity, who stole the show in a great way with its improper performance. He makes a change from a great prostitute to a woman who is easily and usually. He lives in a film, gives and makes you love and praise him at the same time, because of his role, because of his magnetic and positive personality. This is one of his performances. No doubt he is more talented than his modern industry. He has to do more tasks. The end of the film shows just what I said above. It is tears of bursting, exciting and well done. See Description. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for Preity!
