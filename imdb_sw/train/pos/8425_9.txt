Finally I watched these events in 2008 and I had to go back and prove when they were found. They are very frightening to have made a spot for the fun of what will be future. Perhaps Parker and Stone lived in Texas and felt the idiocy of Gov Bush or they are respectable, brave people who are considering things. Boo, scary! The Bros of the Frats of Bush invaded the White House dressed as Arabs riding a gun? Bush 'accident' to make someone? (No, patience. He did such a kind as gov.) This may seem to fail as a sitcom at the time, but must now be considered as a brilliant, as a spooky, prescience.
