De Sica is being one of my favorite directors, but this was a hit-miss-miss for me. A young teenager who is a leader of a non-lawless community in another area outside Milano. It is a detailed and fascinating story of the innocent, perfect and evil people of the evil and happy police forces, but slowly changing the fantasy story, as a wondrous boy Toto grows an unlimited power of superhero. I was here with Toto exciting after 10 minutes, and when the magic took it, I was left in the dust. There were many amazing shots, many good characters among the residents, that I kept thinking it was a waste of the movie was not so bad and its accessories. Compilation of bias and fantasy comes more like a "watch-what-we-have-do-mum-kind" type than a full / active job.
