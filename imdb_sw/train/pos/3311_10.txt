We learn at the end what brought everyone to Kangwon Province and we learn how they are connected. For those who want a Glam film and for the film to give them a definitive answer, this film will not be worthy. But for those who want a movie that stops them thinking, wondering, and affecting them for many years, this movie will be more desperate.
