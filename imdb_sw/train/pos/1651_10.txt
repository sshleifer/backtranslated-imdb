I watched this presentation on PBS in U.S. when it started in 1988 (?). If the services were available on the DVD I bought the first versions of all three books last year. Since then I have been looking for a series of web sites. Today I've found this website. I will leave preference. <br /> <br /> I also would like to buy this perfect - episodes 26 - miniseries. After purchasing DVDs I would like to read each book, then check out the events of this book. That is what I did with John LeCarre's trila of Karla trila and trilogy of visitors to Larry McMurty's Texas. Is there anyone who has any suggestions for a lot of books or a series of books that were good for television or film services - now available on DVD?
