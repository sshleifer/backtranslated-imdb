Seeing "Moonstruck" after many years is a fun way of feeling and a pleasant feeling this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who has ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents nor Norman Jewison director. The only flat word in this beautiful work is "When the Moon Seeks Your Eye As Pie Big Pizza, That is Amore," a song that has often played in the movie (once already ready) and which continued to be long after life in popular music. Cher is - forgive me - feel like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and shouldn't have love with a groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) recommends recommending, giving her a pinball ring instead of a co-ring, and then runs to Sicily to have her dead mother. She charges Loretta and sees that her brother, a visitor, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta has grown up Ronny and quickly loves her. At the same time, his father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats his mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta finds an accident when Ronny is invited to the Metropolitan Opera. Everything works at the end, as it does in this kind of films. At the same time, all actors find themselves in beauty and the audience enjoys. Through it, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be better: the entertainment of rollicking without any social meaning. If they only lost "That's Amore" on the way, it would be perfect.
