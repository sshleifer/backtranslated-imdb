This is the best film on characters in the adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and cooperation with each other. It should be managed to distribute as much as it is better than similar films from the great outdoor studio at the same time. The swimming teacher is close to the Olympic, reduced teaching of adult basic subjects, and often aimed to walk from his female students. He tries, more or less, to avoid, with different results. Students / students are the most common U.S.A.A. teachers, police, college students and retired people, all of whom have not learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationship, including friends, relatives and romantic triumphs through class. Some young people offer unhealthy food, including a divorce teacher, high school students, a girl who is only in school to meet boys. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie of the date, or just one look at when you're in a romantic role and overtones of reality.
