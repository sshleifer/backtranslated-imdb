I watched this film on DVD several times now, the first time, I watched the second half hour and then I came back the first time. an entertaining film, thanking God without a knightley line in it, comforting and gives us real insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choice she had to make. There is nothing wrong about the movie completely, no bad language or anything of sexual origin that can hurt by looking at the family. It can convince children to explore little about victoria victoria himself and maybe known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
