A woman left alone after her husband's death finds herself attracted to her son's friend and a good man. In a little misleading story, a woman begins to sleep with a good man for the effort to raise herself. A distorted section? A good man is also his daughter and away from the interests of love. If this was not enough, the mother could fall to this person and when her daughter was found out, she was just an unemployed relationship but her life had also appeared to her poor mother. Even though you may think negatively of this woman, the truth is a movie that can show her with good light. You played well with Anne Reid, this attitude has a direction and shows a great feeling. The true brilliant performance and enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
