This movie deals with one of the most frightening diseases among aging today. If a person who has met several families who are experiencing Alzheimer's ability or who is in the process of creating, I would like to advise that every health care provider suggests this film to any family facing this problem. The movie is designed mainly to talk to the patient's family and reach into the heart of the struggle. Composing is the best and wonderful pictures are ideal for the line of command orders.
