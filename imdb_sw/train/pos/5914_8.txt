MPAA: Measured R for abuse, language, dirt and minor drug use. Quebec Rating: 13 + Rating of Canadian User Notes: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw the Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz Cat, I wanted to see more of the films Bashki I saw Cool World and I think it was mediocre and I saw this. The first opening, the film was very controversial. It seemed that the racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, even leading the protest outside the hall where the film was playing. The film was only released on VHS under the title "Fighting Street". Now it is considered to be a cult-classic film and celebrities of Africa-America such as player Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and a group of rap District Wu-Tang is said to have enjoyed this film. I myself thought Fritz Cat is the best film but this is very fun too. Look for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation movies. The film combines the work of life with animation like a film that put Roger Rabbit.I like to love it with a perfect but white animation. Then the film begins with a pastor and another person tries to rescue two friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, an old man tells the story of three people he knew. The film takes the animation structure, we see three black people who bought their home for this person. They decide to make their own names in Harlem. So the leader, the black rabbit, kills the great player in Harlem and he becomes a big shadow. Phil continues as the Italian mafia wants him out. Mafia involves godfather, his three sons who are gay and Italian clown. An enjoyable film worth watching, if you can find it.
