This movie is the first of six films of Guinea Gogo pigs and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and realistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who was captured and tortured in many ways. The man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and includes a video of the manga, which shows suffering. Men who capture him weigh the limits of man before he dies. Other events are amazing, such as the eye area and others should not be like a girl being beaten 100 times, because you see a punch next to every movie. This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to 17 or more people. <br /> <br /> 9/10
