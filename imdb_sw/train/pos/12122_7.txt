Movie can be beautiful. I looked at it last night, but I don't feel honored because I read the book first. The book is better than the movie I had found the heart and the film. If you plan to watch the "Human Bondage," do not read the book before. On the other hand, this book is very good, and much more detailed than Phillip's love with Mildred, you can continue to enjoy after watching the movie. I don't make these claims gently. I have an average reading book every 4 days, and read authors as different as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato, and Shakespeare. "In Human Bondage" receives my vote as one of the top ten novels written.
