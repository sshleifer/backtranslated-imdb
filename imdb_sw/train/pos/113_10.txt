I haven't seen this film in 5 years, but I am still attracted to it. When asked about my proposed films, this is what I seem to always mention first. There are some films (art works like this film, "Dark City", and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch the place in you, the places that have been saved and hidden and are still sensitive, that makes a sense of life for the viewer, not different and a life-changing event, like the end of a great relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "called me" when I first saw it. It has left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
