I love this film, but I can't find what's in this film that doesn't like it. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe that it's Mr. Carrey behind all the makeup. And I'm sure that many of the actors and filmmakers in the film have made a film before this. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Nani. As you open, Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes from hiding. And it causes some fun for those who are in Whoville. Sicne we know who loves Christmas. When Grinch does not like Christmas. And even says Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The movie was led by Ron Howard. And the voice of narrtor has been made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets from Space) is beaten as the mayor of whoville. Who does not like to talk near Grinch next to Christmas time.
