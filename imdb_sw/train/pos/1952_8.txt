I had to see the film "On the Ice Playing" on TV in India. I must say the movie was done well, and actually revealed my backs. . <br /> <br /> however, I felt that Diane Keaton was the best ... the place where she has a desire, and begins to go back to her home with cocaine ... was better ... two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what good practices he is .... Script is good if it's movies and patterns .. and throw it / / <br /> You must look at the movie ..... for everyone
