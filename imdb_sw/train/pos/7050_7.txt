I don't want to spend too long here running about a plot - you have seen a trailer, and if you don't have a network. I do not recommend seeing it - it was well done and did not put any pack or magic from the film. So those who avoid this film due to its lousy trailer should give this opportunity. It's really funny. I was beaten with cunning and nature in this film. The first 40 minutes were with me on the floor in wonder - my only problem was that it was not necessary to enter the films of Austin at the end of 20. This, however, is one of the few films that the end of the campy did not make me to love other films ( is usually the case. Everyone offers good performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there is a very big time. I myself plan to see again when you come out - just get all the details I was laughing at the first look!
