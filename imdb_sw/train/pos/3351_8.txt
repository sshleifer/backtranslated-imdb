Very beautiful west. This was the first time the author Richard Wilson inspired the film, also this was the first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It's pleased to see Angie Dickinson very little and beautiful as a girl of the saloon. Robert Mitchum comes to this town headed by criminals and is employed as a tamer of the city, but people are worried that he will go too far, also about the consequences he will do in the city's business. There are other things in the story and the "Warlock" made in 1959. This film continues to be very fast and exciting, it puts you on the edge.
