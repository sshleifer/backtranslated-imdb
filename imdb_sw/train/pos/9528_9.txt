In fact, this film has gone over many heads of its murder. <br /> <br /> The loss of lost (lost) is salvation (saved) and this movie is one of the very few to deal with those two concepts. Movie also examines the love and desires that attend the father-child relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are fashionable. <br /> <br /> The premise is that the father in the argument, the man-collision Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his criminal boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their children and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's child Connor is worse than others. He kills one of the loyal Rooney soldiers to cover his robbery from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's baby Michael saw it, he wrongly killed another son of Sullivan (and Sullivan's wife) for an attempt to witness to the witnesses. Sullivan decides he wants to take revenge for any price, even at a very high price. Rooney, who in the same area condemns Connor's birth, is reluctant to give up his son Connor and Sullivan, and employs a co-ordinator named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on a lost road. <br /> <br /> With the remaining movie, accompanied by his young son Michael, Sullivan follows Connor Rooney under the Road to Perdition, and Maguire follows Sullivan. When Sullivan runs to Rooney in the Church's rank, and asks to release Connor because Connor was killed by his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only killers in this room, .., and there is only one bond, none of us will see Heaven." If the film is approaching, largely, one character is preserved and one character is sensitive. I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but it makes an outdoor play playing Sullivan man who is persuasive, giving the craft performance and cone. Newman does well as an old Irish Rooney group, with a hard edge in his face and in his manner, his eyes lost with Connor's mistakes. Jude Law makes Maguire the right way. Tyler Hoechlin has Young Michael unusual and without effect. <br /> <br /> The movie continues to play light from darkness, pointing to the theme of salvation and destruction. The camera came from a weekly palette and grays. Grays belong to the father and the landscapes of the era of depression in Illinois. The electricity was for young children and that in rural areas. Thomas Newman's new, arrogant and fragrant music was very faint with the Irish bow and played in Copland's settings. The sets were real urban-urban industries, churches. Houses were made of wood. The beauty of the film is in its own generation of unique emotions from its detailed themes, unique actors, and music developing and movies. The only bad way was to fight a guns against the screens on the screen screen, just a round of film with political accuracy. <br /> <br /> I offer this 10 film out of 10; for the time it will be considered as a good film.
