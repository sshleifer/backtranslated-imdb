PETOOT expert, with a star Michel Serrault, is a brutal story of a brutal man. The doctor who heals the sick in France took over, even if their ability to pay compensation does not exist. However, he tries to be the weakest among the people. Exhibitions and movies are best, and give extra macabre credit to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Build and unwise, intelligent and caring, count and kill. Some time should not be forgotten soon with the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, to show him.
