Someone who wrote a review "enough to sweat and spit" already does not know what culture, literature, or psychology. He exposes Zikazi's interpretations because they are not visible "in line" and what the director wanted earlier. So? The importance of the objective of the director (or author) is not important in the critical theory. This is known as "False Lie" and must be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy Text or movie can be analyzed through several theories, many who disagree with one another, and also totally ignore the intent of the author. This is the most basic idea of ​​the most important theory. Because of this, anyone who wrote that the text wall was lost a lot of time and effort to insult Zikhali. In fact, anyone who is exploring the theory will immediately dismiss this teen's suggestion (I suggest you should also) if it is too far away. It is said ... If you are interested in Freudian, Laconia's speech, or Kristevia, this movie is a must. It combines these theories with the popular film, making it easier and more enjoyable than just reading or thinking about them.
