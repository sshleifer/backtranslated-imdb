Don't think of these films as just a movie of other children - the whole family can enjoy. Its amazing mix of films, as it seems to have a movie in it, but at least it has a sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It gives you all the elements of the film (good plot, good characters - it's also star Muppets, a list of small celebs * which films can scream for what) It's amazing, it's the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sadness, some heart, some funny and some great - it's all makes a family of fun family that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * Celebs in the film are really high stars of the day but there is only one true star film and no one sends Miss Piggy !!!!
