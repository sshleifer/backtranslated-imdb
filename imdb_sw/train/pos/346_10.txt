What an amazing movie! It was terrible, good acting, well written, lost good plot, interesting characters, very good direction, and the end of surprise that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is one flick one that can not be attracted to the fearless fans, but still (however) one of the most beautiful out there today! I strongly recommend the only fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The type of fear / something / something that is placed in it. ********************* **** ***************** PS-I am sick with I am tired of people comparing this, with other modern awesome movies, and SCREAM. To know what, they didn't want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they wrote the SCREAM!". Well, if I am wrong, SCREAM also copied other movies too! In fact, almost every awesome movie has published one original. SCREAM, however, was a good film. But, still ... stand up to compare and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> Go with this one! <br /> <br />
