Apole slowly (somehow like the movie Sofia Coppola) but still a very interesting film about sex discovery and three young girls. The magic of the film is in its ability to restore many memories of how they felt it was their age. The combination and anxiety is shown in a simple way but so true to life. Music is perfect and acting is amazing. Camera works well too. I strongly recommend those who are not afraid to look back at this life time when we discover our sexual impulses and desires. I would also like to say that it is a good film for young people who go through that period. Many movies have been done on adolescence but this actually takes a realistic view of the entire world of romance and its problems.
