Of life in (some) universities. Of course there were some artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film is going on in universities. I went to universities in Southern California where many communities depend on themselves. It's funny because these are schools that require unity of society, equity etc. and I can honestly say, that there is there. But the thing is when the class is leaving, or when they are waiting outside the class, they (pupils) seem to rely solely on people of their race or ethnicity. Is it bad? Not true. Everyone needs a sense of wealth. But if the school's one-school school I attended immediately wrote about it, "we should all try to deal with other ethnic groups and try to know them." Otherwise you create your own discrimination. Indeed discrimination was in one of the schools I attended. Immediately a man placed a leaflet next to the campus talking about the glory of Aryan Race and had a mark of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened as an event in a movie where a young man of Caucasi went and started shooting at a collection of culture. I can just hope and pray that nothing like that will happen. <Br /> <br /> So is "Teaching Top" to a large extent? Increased? Maybe. What is the way "away from the mark?" It depends on where you went or went to school. The issue of the race that the tribe is close to their own IN. To stimulate Hollywood shortage, the race is being played near the house for me.
