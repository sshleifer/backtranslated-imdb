This movie is very complicated that can be given any details and still continues with it. you have a safe, uncomfortable and attractive attitude (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who has been beaten between two women (no, three). we listen to his social udiosyncrasies, philosophy and values ​​in monologues that are not possible, we see him doing his magic work around the three women who love. this can be a premise for the flight of the airplane, full of difficult, cool, uncomfortable definition. but director Jean Eustache can keep it clean, amazing and wonderful. being a long-term movie, one can not but burst in laugh when, after 2 hours of speaking gently, Jean-Pierre Léaud screams suddenly on the phone while remembering the cheesy line from the film. This type of situation is unique to movies and cannot be fully restored in the definition. neither can anyone restore a good monologue and pain of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours with worthing every minute.
