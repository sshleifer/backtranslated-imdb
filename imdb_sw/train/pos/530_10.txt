Many of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger's talent are seen in their "Life and Death" features. It was part of a recent tax for Mr. Powell who played in Walter Reade in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from it, or any other era. The “Life and Death issue” has a talented movie with Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to do wonders for the camera. Particularly surprising is the distinction of monochromatic tones provided in the heavenly events, and those who paint when the stage returns to the earth. This was quite a revolution, and well before its times. The black and white sequence involving a long staircase where Peter and the Trainer are talking must be one of the most amazing things in any film. Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our opinion will be on Powell and Pressberger who works out of the famous, well-known people, who responded to the guidance of directors. David Niven is Peter, whose flight has hit and the best friend dies as a result. This film showed one of the highlights of the work of Mr. Niven. He was the best actor of the film as he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is as wonderful as June, a woman who spoke to Peter as his flight fell from heaven. If it finally had it, Peter and June love to love first. Some of the best British artists enjoy this film and their presence. Robert Coote, it's Bob, someone who is brought to heaven, but surprised his friend Peter did not make a trip with him. The best stars turn to Marius Goring, who as a 71-person steals the film. Mr. Goring, who had worked with directors, is one of the most beautiful things in the movie. Also, Roger Livesey, like Dr. Frank Reeves, one of his career, with Raymond Massey, who looks like Abraham Farlan. "Life and Death issue" is a non-fiction film that will appear every time for thanks to its creators.
