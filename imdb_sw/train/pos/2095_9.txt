Let's remove any discussion about the use of non-Asian actors who perform Asian responsibilities. The movie is 67 years old. In the 1937 studio heads believed that any actor could / could have any responsibility. Employees were under contracts, and did not always have a choice about what role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a true epic story of love, personal rights, class stick, and men / women issues. The main part of the film is two beautiful Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (Rainer). From the outset, he treated her with respect, while women seemed more helpful than employees. Without a lot of films, it passes on high ties, and even though the story can be done at the end of the 19th century / early 20th century, the story and a lot of their feelings, seemingly reliable. <Br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that the movie is 5-10 minutes more than needed, and displays of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are 1930 characters of the cartoon, this is a very good movie that, unfortunately has become a victim of political accuracy.
