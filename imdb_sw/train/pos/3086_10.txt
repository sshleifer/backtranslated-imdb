Here in Italy (I am writing from Venice). Why canceled? The ABC should give them an opportunity to create audience. Sent (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) are one of the best I have seen recently. We need to show more like this which makes the audience feel like they are intellectual people with drones. I hope that ABC will re-examine its decision or another facility will take.
