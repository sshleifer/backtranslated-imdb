I loved him, after being a fan of the previous series, I always wondered what the previous story would be - was not able to please him. I also love the fact that away from Eric Stoltz I did not recognize one person - this is comforting, such as BSG. Notified by the full wealth of the new talents - you can't wait for the start to start. It has done by Ronald D. Moore and the team - a good job. Special effects, discussions and acting were everywhere, and I felt emotionally tied in the story. I know there are consequences out there that may not agree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was far more than many Sci-Fi items produced in the last decade.
