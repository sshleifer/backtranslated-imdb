A good film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan with beautiful performances from UK and Irish players. The film is very well related to the thorny issue, and effectively takes the appetite and bad conditions of the 1970s Belfast. It is truly amazing, it is worth nothing to honor any side in this war. On the one hand, it shows a little Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting into trouble. On the other hand, it is associated with the Loyalist group which is committed to spreading violence. Very interesting and, thanks, entertainment. Don't expect any laugh, though. 7 out of 10.
