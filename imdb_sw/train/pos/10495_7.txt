Saving Grace is a good movie to watch the good afternoon, when you are looking for something different with ordinary labels and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is the same evil! It was the first movie I watched with this theme (drug / marijuana) which is not rejecting the truth, just making jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow, living in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide because she was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who thought that some money had been saved for her, finds that she needs to pay all the pounds of her husband for debt loss of all her things, especially her home that she loves so much. He has never worked before, and he is in a bad situation until Matthew, his farmer who is very common with a pot of cigarettes, decides to cooperate with him in a large-scale sale.
