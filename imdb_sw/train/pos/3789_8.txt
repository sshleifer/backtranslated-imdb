Bravo for Czech, their once powerful film industry seems to awaken from the aftermath of the Communist. <br /> <br /> Audience is a comedy done with all the features you would like to see in the modern “hollywood” production down trash that seem to be connected to a variety of years ago. Sounds of good voice, excellent editing, beautiful city of Prague, mention but few. Stories are actually a few small stories that are often interacting and interacting, it is the essence of deliberately integrating, fates, lust ... It follows a group of urban-middle-group youth through various situations from everyday life and leisure activities to work with obsessions. And it's hillarious. In fact there is a point in the movie that the entire sports field I had (nearly 100 people in a small art gallery) was cut without stopping for 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience this experience with modern hollywood production? Although all of the main cast is better (especially the Macedonian Star Labina Mitevska in the role of the migrator is experiencing all the common problems) you need to export Jiri Machacek to his trustworthy image of Jakub, who is a stylish bohemian whose brain is affected very much and things that pull the smell of a strange situation. <br /> <br /> Conclusion miss this one! It has a lot to offer.
