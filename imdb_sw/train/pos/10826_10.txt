I have never been seen by watching a film with a feeling of warmth and happiness. I felt like I had very good friends and I had a good time! I enjoyed this film. Acting was very good, although I would like to mention without it exactly as to give the perfect performance. Bill is the best actor and would like to see him in more films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy nail are also recommended and always like to see them do the same performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, very good. It was a good performance from all involved. This exciting experience to see a well-written film, good and beautiful.
