This animation has dropped so much my socks. Anime at first opened, I heard that it is very slow; The story was not moving, and Shirou was a completely male guide. Once you learn more about the track, and learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story goes out and you can see many parts of moving together. It was wonderful. Additionally, I heard that the ways in which the characters developed were real to form and how real people grow, in the real world. There was no clear stupidity going on; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to look at, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their particular behavior was just interesting to look at everything on it. A few of the "surprise" people who show (Gilgamesh?) Seemed too special to all others who were thrown in one way or another, for we didn't have a "Bad Generic Bump" that was changed by "Generic B bad B" when he died . <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved music. The opening music was hit, and the final theme from the last part ... Great pushing the front part of the last part even more. Good work, MOON Type!
