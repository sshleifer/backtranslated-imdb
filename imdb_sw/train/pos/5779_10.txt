At the beginning, I didn't even know about this show since one year or because of the web. I have never seen on TV before my country, and many people don't know about this show. It's sympathetic though, because this is a very simple and original animation that I have witnessed in years. <br /> <br /> I do not give 10 points a lot, but this is one show that really deserves all 10 Points. Even though at first glance this can be seen as an ordinary cartoon but remember that this is not children-show though. When the full story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep story, and a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story depends largely on the spirit of the spirit, the ancient Indians believe that it has been preserved for many years. This gives a moving show of nature that you can't find often in animation displays. <br /> <br /> The overall structure is also very different. Sometimes it resembles a little spawn to the question of creative creation, and sometimes it takes more than a cartoony. I believe Emergency David who also created and led the part of the Cow and Chicken animation in the show (as he drew the part on the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show-twisting show, show that it takes various subjects like reality, suicide, spiritual, life, then this is something you should miss. As soon as you start looking, you will probably look at the end. One little truth may be that the show takes a little material from comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains, where is the DVD?
