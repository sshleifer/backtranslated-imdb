The author / director John Hughes has laid down all the basics (as usual) and this bitter family's "April April" bitterness. "Curly Sue" is sweet, heavy orphaned, caring since "Child". The two live away from their wits when they are going to the mainstream of A. Hatma is similar to the "very good" lawyer of yuppie, and others are expected. Children will love this film, as they can relate to the heroine, who played with 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who continued to be "you girl!" of Pepsi's advertising). Characteristics should be about 6 or 7, since he is encouraged to consider going to school. Some of his vocabulary suggests that he is every 9 or more day. Just like "Home alone", there are many stickers hanging with a little fist to clap with big fat blows. Again, this is a "form" of making a film, aimed at a young audience. Entertainment and heart. Don't look at any surprise, but be ready to cry or two.
