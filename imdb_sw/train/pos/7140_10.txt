20 out of 10 This is a true story about the evacuee of the war with the team Tom Tom. The boy (William Beech) has been given by Tom and immediately appears to have big issues when he is playing his bed the first night. William is unable to read and be afraid but in the same way both find comfort for each other. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as an arrogant counselor in an exciting interpretation of Jerusalem. William is a friend of Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish youth from London and with Tom and Zechariah, finally learning to read and write and feel part of this small neighborhood. As she sits, William is reminded of London and her mother, and here we see why she is dead. Her mother is obviously mentally ill and when Tom hears from William, he travels to London to find her. He finally finds her taken her sister's baby who is bound in the cellar. After the hospital period, Tom knows he must take her and take her home. This period is the end of bitterness and sweetness when William is told that he will be taken by Tom, at the same time, learning his friend Zacharias has been killed during a flight in London. For me, one of the most moving events is when Tom spoke to an officer from the Home Office. <br /> <br /> I love 'im,' why it's important, I think he loves me too '. Not only does it get that?
