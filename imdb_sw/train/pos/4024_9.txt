I liked this film very much. I continued to think until before the very end what would happen. One of the best movies about what I have seen. Urmila Matondkar is also good. This is one of the most private and low films that I have seen in the distribution. It's a little bit less than a gadar, and it's really emotional roller coaster where you start with one view of what's going on, and coming one quite another side. This is not typical of the bollywood, but rather the art of film type. The best part of this movie is that it is not appropriate on one side of the dispute of time to focus on another story. It is not blameless or innocent but it allows you to implement your conclusion about matters.
