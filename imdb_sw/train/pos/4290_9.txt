I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the world's best artists. I can't understand why other people say he isn't. Boring .... ??? Maybe the one who said it is boring is because he is boring. She is a good actress and movie was excellent. It has many good ideas and very good artists. The trend was good. I am engaging in French and sophistication environment with spices, flowers, churches, problems, etc.. When he goes to the sister's store is just amazing. Everything good. We have a very good actor, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love him more than his next movie SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
