The characters of Somerset Maugham brings in RKO's "Human Bondage"; but the movie is also a skeletal version of the novel, and the performance of Bette Davis star when you lose all energy. Otherwise, it's a story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); he dreamed of being a painter, but he is told they have no talent of art. As the film goes on, Mr. Howard's efforts, instead, become a doctor. His efforts seem to reflect bad advice on art; although he succeeded in medicine, his paintings seemed easy - too, look at his example of disability, "club foot" (explained in the film). The way (once, in this edition), Howard is investigated by the Davis servant (like Mildred Rogers). The character of Davis's "Mildred" is amazing, completing an interesting speech, when he tells Howard, among other things, that he had "WIPA MOUTH MY!" after kissing. Howard also does well, but the story can not define the long-term love and love for Davis; thus, their exhibition is lost. <br /> <br /> Still, the film looking for acting, including other support players. Bette Davis's character was famous for promoting "writing" campaigns for the Academy's "Best Actress" awards. The result was: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened to One Night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "Barretts of Wimpole Address" Bette Davis - "of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Human Bondage (6 / 28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
