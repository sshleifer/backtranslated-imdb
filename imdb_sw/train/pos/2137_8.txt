This is far more than a fascinating story of a middle-aged man to discover the fun of playing football (although it is similar too). It is the story of one person learning to love life again, pushing all the problems of work and money to discover happiness again. Bonus in this film is a fascinating insights into the modernization of the modern Japanese trend towards everything from playing football to physical contact. There are cases that will make you laugh loudly ... few where you want to wake up with cucumber ... and many others where you'll just hear well. This is a great introduction to the modern films of Japanese film for those who may be under the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and are not available. <br /> <br />
