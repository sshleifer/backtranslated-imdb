First of all, there is no substantial change as the book, especially when it deals with the great author like Tolkien. This amazing mix combines the world of Tolkien for 90 years of psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - painting and painting of nature is sometimes a "bad" little in its technical implementation but it is good no less, and it is very evocative to provide "unique place" unique to each image. The most unique in the picture is the perfect voice that works - acting which is FAR better than acting in new live action movies. And when the animation of the cell may not be a technical animation "skill" it deals very much on the body's and facial expressions at the same time without forgetting to be careful and inappropriate. Natural painting differs from the traditional "fantasy" motif, quite clearly, but the printed changes are always encouraged by the information and contribute greatly to the film's theme. If you are a person who should have a great computer in the movie so that everything will be shown to you then I will see how you might not like this film but if you like the best photos, transcendental pictures, and JRR Tolkien then this film must see.
