Financial expert Lindsay Crouse has just published his first novel and feels a sense of his professionalism that he will not hope to help his patients. The little gambler junkie asks him to pay his debts if he wants to help him get better. Here he cooperates with Joe Mantegna. Unlocking any of the conspiracy would damage one of the fun and 'House of Games' could be a better movie that I have seen. David Mamet wrote and guided this gem which is filled with snappy talk, one big linner, and twist enough to make you think the end. Crouse is perfect as a psychiatrist specialist who needs a change and Mantegna tells him as a stupid fool. And unless unfortunately in the last quarter of the film, the film is in viewers of the audience; and we love con. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
