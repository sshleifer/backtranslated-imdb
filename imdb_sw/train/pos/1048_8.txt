For Muslim women in western Africa, married life in the hands of men who may be abused can be very difficult. The community cannot openly approve such behavior, but evenly, they are not yet ready to view it as a crime, a view that actually enables it to continue. Fortunately, Cameroon's letter of law promotes equality for all, and this document monitors the true use of female actors in Cameroon's legal system when they are trying to get justice for women and children. What is called (except the story of lift) is how, despite their knowledge, the court is modern development, if the case is actually purchased. The program also provides an interesting insight into the whole life of Cameroon, which (apart from the serious crimes committed in the case of visible cases) appears amazingly emotional and fun compared to the benefit of the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And when I agree that these views can betray naivet√© on my part, this view seems to be confined to the impressive English-speaking pidgin. In general, this is a very small film, and more fun to look than you can think.
