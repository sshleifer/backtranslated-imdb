In fact, the best five films of John Garfield's movies should be the Marine Pride. It is a true privacy story of Al Schmid who at the expense of his own eyes, when the injury appeared in the Japanese army of interesting on Guadalcanal. A very good story in three sections, Al Schmid's home life where he is a very hard job with a woman who does not like something better than his night bowling. Pearl's park is a bomb and he is far from the battle as millions of others were. The second part is Guadalcanal and we see a part of the act where he is in a fired gun gun, closing Japanese forces. His action prevented the seats of the sea from increased, but the grenade sees it in his eyes. And in fact the third part of it is a restructuring of the bitterness of civil life and assuring that people are not just caring for him in mercy, more than all the girl was seeing Eleanor Parker. This video was advertised on TCM on John Garfield's birthday and there was a document on Garfield headed by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said Garfield was the most trusted actress in the working class and having a coalition card. <br /> <br /> In that respect he was fortunate to have made land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to get the standard rate in the gangster's roles in the traditional label, Garfield was severe in these areas because of his history, because he came from a kind of life Al Schmid was, except behind the Garfield of the Jews. In this way he was perfect to play part of the work class hero as Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility of protecting his country. No heroes up here, just a boy who would like to be back in Philadelphia, but he did a job that was done. <br /> <br /> It's a great place for Garfield. It's a film that should not be missing. I wonder though anything happened to Al Schmid real.
