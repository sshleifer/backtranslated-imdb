The desperate boy is trying to hit a beautiful girl in the bus. He rejects him, but when he visits someone who tries to steal his pocket, they get together. And there it begins - a relationship that has been ruined slightly by the fact that he is jealous and neurotic superhero. It cannot be a mystery that things between them will be difficult. In short, a story that can promise to grow in a cool film. With IMO, it succeeds to be a good film. It's not a trick, but it was tears from laughing for more than just one - two characters to guide each other to each other in the fest love of love which is, even with something superhero going, reliable. > So. Good story, but it worked out the truth and so it was suitable for movies. 7 out of 10 broken hearts
