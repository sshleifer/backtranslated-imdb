Natalia Emily Watson is the most romantic and romantic style I've ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, was he sent to the king? Put within the chess games and family problems control, power, and victory are wonderful. Like the chess farmers in the films they do, the director plays many games at the same time with our thoughts at once, but they all wear in big or small patterns. The period, clothing, and images of the 20th century of the Italian territory were widely taken. No single square space has been destroyed. Most brilliant art is full, I can't express it all. I recommend planning a budget at the right time to watch this film twice, maybe a week away, because you can't capture all the poems within the 64 square system that is still in the same situation. I've never read the book of Nabakov, but try my own example, what I read to remind me of another film-like-game competition, The Natural Barry Levinson. It completely rejected the demolition of Bernard Malamud's fuel for the romantic feeling that was unique to America. In fact, the director made it better to comply with Russian and Italian values ​​without having fun and increasingly enlightening. The true story here is that games are zero-general; there is a winner and a loser, except all competitors. But, in life, and especially in the context of our eternal soul, we are only limited to these constraints and gatherings of life to the extent we leave others to break our spirit. Pure love, if you are made by Emily Watson of Natalia, can adopt and allow all of us to be enhanced by her gifts at the same time. The only constraints created by our fears can reject us. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie (10/10).
