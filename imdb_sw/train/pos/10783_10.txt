I enjoyed this film. He had never seen Andy Griffith for many years and felt that he was fully functional. I've associated with comedy but I'm glad to see that he is a mix. I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" might have no words from a special mental book. There are zillions of any phobias and neuroses, and these can take a variety of quantities and quality. He is obviously sensitive to additional hearing powers as understood by the Indian Indians but not with any Anglos. It is not surprising that this behavior is affected and known as eccentric. Although this is considered to be a light "movie movie", it is actually more modern than it seems. Also, Hiram's end finally came as a wonderful surprise to me and has closed all the previous steps together in the passage. It is a pleasure to contemplate the possibility of this spiritual leadership.
