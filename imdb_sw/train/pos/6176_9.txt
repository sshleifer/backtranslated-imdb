The 1986 TV's Movie TV was a test for a possible series. However, the creator of the Spirit Will Eisner did not like the film and therefore no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) of comic and modern twist. Sorry did not come into the series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect Spirit. Nana's viewer was Ellen Dolan beautiful and of course he could continue with Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of a great version of Frank Miller's Spirit, many people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history. It seems that when Hollywood makes a film from a character originated or an idea, someone will look for the original versions of the property and open it to a video to make a few dollars. While Antonio Banderas gave Zorro's mask, we have been able to get the earlier versions of the hero who was hit on DVD, such as the great edition of Alain Delon of the 1970s (although all the copies I have seen have been changed badly). Here there is hope that someone will announce the TV adventure to DVD soon.
