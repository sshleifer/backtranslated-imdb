This is a spiritual spiritual story. I showed it to my friends on my movie club, and saved spellbound to the end! There is no blood or gore-only good old solidarity. It starts well from the beginning, and builds and builds. The latter is a real twist which caught me without knowing. It has been properly directed and used properly. It is also a "piece of period" - set in the 1920s - added to the atmosphere. I was so surprised that I found the book with Susan Hill from Amazon. The movie follows the book rather than close. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing not available on DVD. My text is VHS. This with "Haunted" is probably two of the best stories of the Spirit that I have been in. Which goes just to show that a little invention of creativity "in your face" becomes any day!
