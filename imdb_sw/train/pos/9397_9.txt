To precisely remember west west of 1940, as the "Treasure of Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed, and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is down and out, but honest, young man from Texas who goes to the west to find work and money. He sees both, but not the way he expected. <br /> <br /> Photo of the film has a lot of surprises and conspiracy efforts. Movie theaters, adroit film, and western western music increases tension and stress. The vast expansion of the atmosphere of the atmosphere provides a good environment. And acting between good and good, and good performances from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. The Dwight song of Yoakam of the country / western song provides the film with a powerful finale. It is written correctly as a neo-noir, "Red Rock West" attacks like something else, too. The program is full of interactive and inappropriate time, so that others can focus on the screenplay if it is wrong. Naturally, I would agree. In this case, however, including the weather, and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems to be close to normal daily life, cooperation and impossible time suggests that, more than "noirish", it is. .. surreal. It is almost as if it deliberately interferes with incompetent events in order to force Michael to come into contact with himself. From this point of view, coincide is not an error of the script altogether. They are the key points of the plot in the story of the young night who must fight with his own demons ... hiding as other characters. Everything we need here is Rod Serling, in postcript, explaining, in his known voice always, that ... boy, searching for himself, stops in a small town, close to a thousand miles away from anywhere. It is its last alover on the journey to go ... the evening belt.
