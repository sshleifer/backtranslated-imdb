If you like Puri Pure, you will enjoy this beautiful film with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about a very rocky group back in the 70's, Wonderful Fruit, and decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be any problem during their concerts. Jimmy nail and Bill Nighy are good, and the song "Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You should look at it.
