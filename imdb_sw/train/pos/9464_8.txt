Dan Burns's widow's family (Steve Carell) writes a column of "Dan in Real Life" to advise the family in The New Jersey Standard and to raise his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Kidonge), an old man, has only got his license to drive but Dan has not allowed him to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has lost on his high school Marty; and Lily's younger (Marlene Lawston) has lost her mother. When Dan and his daughters go to Rhode Island for meeting with the family, they meet Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and spend hours talking. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a call and takes Dan off, giving her her first phone number. Dan once loved by Marie, but when he returns to his home, he sees that Marie is the girl's brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who also loves him. During the weekend, the attraction between Dan and Marie has an increase and they need to take a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise with a pleasant movie, with comedy, romance and drama. Gorgeous Chemistry Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell are amazing and it's very easy to know why everyone likes Marie. Pill Allison, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are wonderful and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. Screenplay is wonderful and the performers of talented actors and actors are wonderful, with the real character of the family meeting. Follow the advice of Dani's column and the surprise and fellowship of the Burns family. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada" ("I, My Brother and Our Girl")
