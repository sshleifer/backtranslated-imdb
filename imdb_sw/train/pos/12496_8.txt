Over the years we have been looking at every terrible movie that comes out, from the strong wind of Hollywood like Saw 2, for the unfortunate delivery of indie which is not recognized ... we suffer through all the bad films in hopes of getting small gems like "Darkness". We were able to get this film review in Shriekfest 2005. The audience liked it and I believe it ended the award winning film for the best film. Though it cannot be a budget or a star studio power studio, it takes a great punch in the creepy environment and a horrible community. Acting with movies is a high picture, but it is the direction that makes this film a comment. Myths and characters develop rapidly to provide fantastic feelings. <br /> <br /> Editing and fx abbreviations are also a high score. And while many awesome films do not use music for their own benefit, the "Darkness of" Darkness adds to its shortage. <br /> <br /> I know the film has shown at a party meeting, but nothing has been around me, so I can't wait to hear when it finally comes out of the DVD. Believe me, even if you are sick of the current movie scary, do this try ... you can't regret it!
