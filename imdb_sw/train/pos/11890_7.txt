This is a very lightweight movie. A well-locked and realistic exhibition is really very good from Depardieu as a cad and a bad boy with the realities of places and exhibitions of the gallery, fails because the director does not have a place, stand up or important comment on the topic he says. One of France's most honorable and ordinary partner in the film and Depardieu - I believe they are doing together - Pialat cannot share. It seems to be an example of why women fall to a bad boy who will hurt when they have a caring partner and a good husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays a non-discriminating player offers answers to the protest as "I don't know"; "I love his weapons"; "I love a way that makes love" to her husband who asks her who tries to run out of the house but voting and checking because ... I think she loves him. So what does he accept and hope? That he will one day wake up and come with his mind. Such things are not answered in the form of engaging in dancing and Pialat and long-term negotiations with long-term events that do not add. I know the answers do not add but please get up. Jules and Jim, this is not. The last shot as cold as the movie we watched is the heart pain and only headaches for more forgiveness.
