I have loved this film very much, I have never been sick to look at it. The only line I can't bear in this is when Riff calls himself a boy of lobotomy but more so, everything else perfectly. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and did not help you hear that he did not even know Ramones who were there until he beat this film, but I can ignore his little face for the most part. Most people who watch regularly are Ramones fans and really. That's the only reason I like it very much. I've never been tired of seeing DeeDee destroying its pizza lines or Joey to delete the name of the teacher regularly, haha. One of the best parts of the film is to see they sing you want to play, under the high school hall. DVD's special version has a beautiful retrospective, amazing PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe he was working on another project * laugh * However, a good film, even better if you are a Ramones fan.
