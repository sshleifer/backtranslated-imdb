"Unusual marriage" is one of those movies that are increasingly characterized by it. All people know, they are singing the theme, they complain to live with "Oscar" or unhappy "Felix" ... but they use the film without knowing. This is not just about a good man who lives with a shrewd person; is a picture of two friends to help each other through the pain of divorce. It is also funny from beginning to end, but it is a kind of comedy that comes from the truth, insist, and only a very serious situation. Therefore, some viewers have seen the film not disturbing, but I think its loyalty is its strength. Besides, the bulldog of Matthau is only fading! My favorite comedy, and miles of country.
