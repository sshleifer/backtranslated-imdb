This is a real trilogy of three stories of Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which is 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years Albert Foreman has been removed from the church because he cannot read or write. So what does he do? Opens the tobacco shop, of course! The second is Mr. Know-All which was indeed the story I read at school 6 years ago and once forgotten, until I heard the original introduction. 15 minutes, and also very good. It worked better in the film than in my book, but maybe that's because I had only 14 times last, after that. <br /> <br /> The 3 is about to allow. Almost an hour in length, just pulls you. Not all bad, but not fast and fast as the last 2. I watched the first quarter of that hour and then went down at the end of the last hour, and I found that it was still important and I really missed something! I generally give 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.
