Good stories and best animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Conan Carpenter or dungeons of the game with Dragons should enjoy it. The war between good and evil is cut open though it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Often in the fantastic Elves films are shown to have white skin and red hair and goblins and orcs have black skin and hair. Anyone who knows the work of Frazetta, Bakshi, or even Tolkien's work knows that it is not color. Any person who enjoys the fantasy movies of the fantasy should love this film. Not for young children due to violence and sex. Searching was good and events and music is the first level. I hope someone puts this good on DVD soon. I feel privileged to have a copy of the VHS in good condition.
