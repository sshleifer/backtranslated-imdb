It is not easy to watch the film - it's more than three and a half hours long and is composed entirely of the conversation. But it's so incredibly compelling and cruel observation of human behavior, that is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is greedy, stupid and brutal. (If you want something uplifting, see Jacques Rivette's amazing Céline and Julie Go Boating, which was released almost one time). It shows the splendor of the 1960s and is something different from the community that is trying to change it / it. It involves allegiance of the ménage-a-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud). , Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). However Alexandre is shown to be a chauvinistic and jealous as anyone else. Women are shown to be honestly present and define their feminine through male eyes. This film is the end at the end of a lot of French New Wave. This movement was one of the most important movements in the history of the film and had a great impact on movies as we know. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the main characters of New Wave, after the move (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) and Francois Truffaut as a rebel youth. Director Jean Eustache is unknown as other directors from the Wave Wave, but it should be. It is no preference (unlike John Cassavetes films similar to the American developed) and the discussion is based on real-life conversations. The film seems to have an Eustache personal experience. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former Eustache partner. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 with a real person of life that Marie's behavior was according to, so too. All anger and bitterness reach into a powerful monologue of Veronika released directly to the audience, breaking the cool nature of the entire film. This exciting, personal, and honest films are one of the most popular films of human nature.
