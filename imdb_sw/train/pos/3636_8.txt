This is a very good film, about one person's dream and drive or push them to know. It's a good and powerful film. Why do some people try and find fault with every movie that comes out, especially the best ones. Dennis Quaid offers a good performance in this real story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and a high school baseball coach who is prompted by his team to take one more shot in a professional baseball career. With a great contribution to helping, including Brian Cox, as an old navy officer who has allowed his child's success to go without his help. It was good to see him as something other than a man in the film. If I have one complaint and this film is this: Don't let Royce Applegate sign a national sign again. To a large extent, this film is a few of the biggest baseball films like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." It reduces the top two fingers and the big "made well."
