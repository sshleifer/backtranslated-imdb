Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and star Binnie Barnes in the "Divorce of Lady X," 1938 comedy based on play. Olivier has a little player, Everard Logan who allows Oberon to sleep at night in his hotel room, while London's mist is very sensitive to visitors to the football ball home. The next day, his friend, Mr Mere (Richardson), says his wife (Barnes) slept at night with someone else in the same hotel, and wants to betray him. Believing a woman to be Oberon, afraid of Olivier. Oberon, a widow and grandson of the judge, pretends that she is a woman who asked, Lady Mere, when she is actually Leslie Steele. We have seen this plot or its variations for a number of times. For this cast, it is pleasant. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, the biggest team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is very good and does a good job with comedy as she shows uptight, barrister nerves. Oberon gives his role to touch the right. He looks too small here, full of face, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and very different hair for him. She is wearing beautiful street clothes, although her first coat looks like a birthday cake, and in one coat she tries, and these hair-makes, is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is as happy as a real Lady. <br /> <br /> The color in this is a mess, and if others have said, it can use true restoration. Certainly worth seeing.
