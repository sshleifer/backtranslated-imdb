Yes, I call this full movie. Not one of the second most interesting, the wonderful cast of artists and the most unknown actors, many of the best-known and well-intentioned characters who can understand, full lights, black and white pictures, sound sounds, intelligent design The proportion of the design and story that shares and works. It is one of the best quality pictures that each of Hollywood's pride should rest, everyone should strive to achieve. Barbara Stanwyck is just amazing. There was nothing that the actor could do, and he was going easy on the melodramatic section. There is no hysterical crop with this woman - I always thought she was a better actor than screenshots like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time send true emotions. It is right to add that she also has many beautiful parts during her long career, and this is by far the most attractive. <br /> <br /> Title fits this movie very well. It's about lust, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be changing in this film, all actors are working with inspiration, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact is that more often than it causes problems it makes for the great content that I won't go here. I liked what this film says about young people, about growth and about the importance of stopping. The movie that I am more involved with this is the Shadow of Alfred Hitchcock's course, it creates a similar idealized situation and simultaneously of South American cities. The story has some similarities with Fritz Lang's Clash of the most extreme movie and Night, made a year earlier, where Stanywck stars have the same parts. I can also recommend.
