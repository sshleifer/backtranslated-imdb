After reading some of the negative views of this film, I did not know whether I should give money to rent. However, it was a good surprise. I haven't seen the original film, but if it's better than this, I would like to heaven. Tom Cruise offers a sharp performance like David who seems to be unstable, assuring me that he is more than a smile on his feet (for the third time in his career - some examples was Magnolia and Born on Fourth July ). Penelope Cruz is a little lighter but fills the claim of her role, such as Diaz. The only desire is Kurt Russell little. In the movie, however, is not something that is very interesting - it's a film to make a film. Cameron Crowe adds more to the role of the director, emerging to change the speed of speed from his normal schtick. Increasingly in the film is fully performed by Crowe (a short chain of which Cruise goes for long-term Square Square is very good). Sound sound (the distinctive feature of Crowe's movie) is also good. You will be surprised and challenged as a viewer. The plan seems to have emerged but the issues raised behind it are always discussed. The movie is not perfect, but its rapid transformation of Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on the Gloss Hollywood food, should be revealed.
