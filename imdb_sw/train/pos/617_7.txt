Greetings again from the darkness. This will be likened to the "Shepherd of the King" and though not identical to that classic, it is very entertaining and well done for its own right. The story line is odd and the whole of the wall is not fully explained, but the implementation is best, even to build a great celebration. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls into a bad girl (Sienna Miller), and admits to take a fallen star ... who plays playing with Claire Danes. It is not too difficult about what is happening with these two, but part of the concern comes with the evil wizard playing with Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince of King Peter O'Toole looking at our ruby ​​"star" necklace. The evil of chasing good. <br /> <br /> On the way, encounter a wonderful pirate you will see (including any from the Carribean). Robert Deniro has Captain Shakespeare - tough inside, and we will say by contacting his female side. Another meeting involves Ricky Gervais wise as a quick-talking businessman and that's good for a couple of years. <br /> <br /> It is not your usual match, coming to age, or a fantasy film, but the director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") is worth the audience. With sad marketing campaign poor will probably prevent it by making any money. I think I will find great success in the video.
