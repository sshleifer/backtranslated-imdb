I just watched this movie and said, I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has a lot of time that will make you fly out of the chair! I had to smoke several “emergency” cigarettes along the way to stretch my nerves! If I had to complain, I would say that if anything, there was too much time to fly. It reached a point where each new area was locked and jumped and this gradually put on an amazing effect, because you are a new type of what has come. Although it has almost all kinds of spirits, they were all done very well to maintain a horrible thing of fear. It had Lighting features, Word 6 and Changes (especially the sound of the voice reminded me of Changeling). I would like to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good awesome!
