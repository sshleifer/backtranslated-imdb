CitizenX (1995) is a world-growing answer to Silence of the Lambs. Where 'Silence' ruined our peace of mind, 'Men' are full and insistent on our behalf. This statue of the Chikatilo trial is well translated, because of Western friendship between two Rostov fighters who have the same. CitizenX can also compete against (!) the death penalty better than Kevin Spacey's Life of David Gayle (2002). People are machiavellian mammals, under the limbic intellectual mind (cycles-logic). Why did the two children, who knew better, the stone of death of the children who had gone? Why do women 's blood say' li-cry 'in OBSCENE acts? - My own mouth for this is a 'limbic rule', a quiz-logic of wanting to dominate the 'enemy'. If you have the words 'enemy' / 'revenge' in your vocabulary, you have the ability to 'limbic rule'. In the 1980s of WWII destruction, Rostov (located at the mouth of Don near the Black Sea), nothing was reduced by Andrei Chikatilo to emphasize the 'limbic regime' due to its civilization . The simplicity of the Katatnist (Jeffrey DeMunn) was with the poor, usually children, who climbed the eternal train for fun, because they could not afford anything else. CitizenX reminds us that the denial of Soviet spreads the cost of the life of such a `52 'sheep. The Rostov ceremony walked for free for almost 7 years in police were arrested and allowed him to go. Crime crime policy is dangerous for police forces everywhere. Although police often face bribes around the world, in the west, voting for politicians can establish long-term competitions, writing more responses to crimes. In the Soviet Union of CitizenX, however, the Killer Department of Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) was facing a bureaucratic bureaucracy. Geoffrey DeMunn is playing for the absence of psychological sex without the authority but the full access point. In real life, too, Chikatilo had a life experience to intervene and avoid capture. On the other hand, who follows, sets out as a strange bird, given to unrestricted chaos, without delight. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a wonderful performance as the chief observer of Burakov. The Russian Rea emphasis is not interrupted; and Burakov does not recommend it and is interesting, with everyone concerned. So Donald Sutherland goes with the picture. Col. Sutherland of Fetisov, the master of Burakov, and for the first time his assistant alone, is a patient patient, whose pride car gives a witness for decades of monopoly care. His resurrection as a logical, yet logical error becomes the basic idealism of the film. Joss Ackland does the other side as bad apparatchik, Secretary of the Communist Department of Communist Bondarchuk, looking at the investigation. Normally, he completed the arrest of the main suspect, Communist, in 1984, a man carrying a rope and a knife in his pocket, going home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Recently, he took Burakov and another apparatchik Moscow, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), saying that the investigation now considers 'gay'. The funniest part of this sad film, sadly comes when the abuse of Bondarchuk & Gorbunov of the institution: one stupid person writes hard, 'If I think, his colleague, is fornication. I have made drawings - 'rejection of laughter. 5yrs after the body began to strengthen, in 1987, the police finally tried to apply for criminal information. The Soviet psychiatrist alone was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called the UNSUB `CitizenX '. Later he also saw Fetisov & Burakov being "... together you make a wonderful man." We agree. The distance is set, it has spread over a decade, catches fully inertia of Glasnost - `upenness' - which was not. Unlike Perestroika -'restructuring '- it couldn't be more for that case. Although Katatiko was still missing the railway stations, police programs were about to bear fruit. In 1990, Col.Fetisov was developed as a whole. His Nemesis Bondarchuk has disappeared away from the area, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Employees, communications, broadcast - suddenly all were available. In just one night of telephone calls, Fetisov got its deficit of the Serial Murder Task Force's FBI leadership in Quantico, where, Fetisov discovered, workers have been repeatedly overturned in serial murder cases to prevent similar psychological damage. for consultants. <Br >> <br /> Fetisov advises its former leaders of modern leadership, now 'Colonel' Burakov, of all these changes in confession of crimes that become a powerful area of ​​powerful film. Fetisov is the most forgiving bidding I've ever seen on the film: 'Recently, I am giving you more forgiveness for you and your wife. I hope that one day you can forgive my ignorance ', he says almost. <br /> <br /> The production of HBO, CitizenX is the highest caliber film. Not only is it that foreign animals seem to be cautious (the only shot in the most beautiful Budapest runaways), but the voice of Randy Edelman's voice is very surprising - and only our wind is just because of brutal violence. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize many Hungarian accents and praise. The actual killings of the Episcopal killings are portrayed as pain, the misconduct of the born-born parents of character and ignorance in the same world. This makes the killings seem not-quite-the-place-but actually they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, 'we all appreciate the privacy of our children'. <br /> <br /> CitizenX is fully communicating that killings are more grisly and more dirty than any fantasy of revenge can imply. Tribal militants are raping; ordinary killers kill the lead. So the other soldiers. These 'limbic' rulers make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the greatest killer of the well-known world. He was sentenced, killed in 1992 through all the death sentences of the Soviet Union: one shot, behind the head. Corruption, these methods undermine any possibility of learning brain lost after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best results are to prevent murder, not their charges. Implementation ensures only the failure of the community to learn from the tragic death of the victims when we witness even the old evidence of how / WHY died. Neither the killers do not know if they have died. <br /> <br /> Revenge is not given to victims. Giving blood to the killer is not much better than contradictory controls - once it is too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge on behalf of mourning is not fair for the dead - it is an appeal to the living. / 10)
