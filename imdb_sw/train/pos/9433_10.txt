The impressive film of four people of the city's crisis in the Appalachia crisis has been similar to rural destruction. Each of the four businessmen is faced with their dark fears when faced with a challenge of white water, on the river to be replaced by a pond. While the locals on the way decide to "have their way" and participants lead to several deaths and burdens for the victims. Each of the travelers is better, although the scope provides more powerful performance. The rural and cultural environments are used well, including a banjos respiratory chain. I saw this on the date it came out, not exactly the perfect movie (though we all enjoyed it). I kind of remember this as a whole performance performance for Burt, Voight has already been created. It is not a kind of film you can watch every week but it has a strong punch and beautified.
