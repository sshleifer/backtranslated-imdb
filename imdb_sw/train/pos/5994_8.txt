I was delighted to watch a short film "The Cure", for the first time director Ryan Jafri. What is most interesting is the function of camera and music. <br /> <br /> I think many movie managers (if I am one of them) will have a hard time with movies when you just start making indie. We see the output is not exactly what we think or under our will. But this film, the beginning of the leader from the small director, was done very well on the screen. The camera motion, color, lighting, mixing everything contributes to the story and the feelings of the film. And music, as an important feature of the film language, helps too much. It is difficult to show a woman's heart, her desire, her fears, especially for a short time. But still, I must admit it's not a fan of v / o (notes), especially when the film goes on with details, rather than shots and cuts. My personal feeling for some part of the story is, I think my author had tried a little too hard. So energy pushes the audience from the film's impression. Overall, it's a short film made well, I can see input from the director. The way to go, Ryan! Greetings from China, you look forward to the next. Tim
