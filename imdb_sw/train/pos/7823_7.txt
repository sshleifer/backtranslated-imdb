To describe more, but to force friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is more powerful when we see the bond made between the two men, and how they support each other, but the second half cannot be stable, because of ending Biko's behavior. Still, his compulsory film with the best performances and Kline and Washington, in the final films on the map. Washington was also selected for the best actor for the first time. In general, a well-designed film can be reduced. 7/10.
