I have only seen this classic for the first few weeks ago. Made almost 30 years ago I thought a terrible time would be tame. The boy was wrong. There are some good moments that sent trouble under my back. Even the act was good, Jamie Lee Curtis was wonderful and Donald Pleasance was good. <br /> <br /> In the lower case can be slow start but once it goes there is no stop. It makes all copies, e.g. Fantasy on Elm Street, Scream look very tame. I can't say it is better than disabled because I haven't seen so many of them, only I remember it's Starman (I think he did). Halloween is a success of crown of fear.
