The female pastor (played with sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has a good job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all men on the line of death before meeting her partner. And what way to go. Lucky this film is not true, or we would like to have more people in the world here on the death line. It starts slowly. Low light and bad acting, like many films (B). It gets well as it passes along. And ended with a bang. I would measure the highest rate at low cost, sexy movies over 90 years. You must immediately see your children away or in bed.
