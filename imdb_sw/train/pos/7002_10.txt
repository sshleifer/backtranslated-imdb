Will Smith will again give the film about a person who has a world-class on his shoulders and his right-to-face mistakes in a way that will touch even the most difficult hearts !!! Author Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together to form a masterpiece that I strongly recommend to buy and continue in your film collection if you can't grow tired of watching / hearing this film! I have a high respect for Will Smith if he is not just a wise Doctor but one can say that he has true love for people and life that no doubt made him perfect for character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) played in this film. You will find yourself to hear his pain and anger, trouble over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who in a way was as unusual as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also star in this film's Top Notch. I find it very difficult to write these reviews without giving key points to the ... All I can say is, Look and when you make sure you don't have anything to stop you, take a hook call, sit back and get ready to try to get rid of an amazing and old life IRS Registrar of Thomas Thomas ... Thank you Will Smith for another great film !!!
