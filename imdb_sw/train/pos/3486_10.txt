Any fan of anti-war should consider this Wrestlemania to be one, if not the best at all. Filled with excitement and surprise. One of the greatest matches was always among Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin and Mike Tyson's special visitor. The show that Michaels wear was strange, especially considering the shape of her back and that this was her last match.
