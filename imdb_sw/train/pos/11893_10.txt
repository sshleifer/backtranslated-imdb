The next two sequences of this previous series were less than missing. In the end times a tragedy has contributed to a short period of life. Maybe if the dung was made after the first season it would have received the following worship. <br /> <br /> Besides, the first season was hilarious! Witches, clever and beautiful writings were promising. The first season of the best season had proper links - characters / actors, story stories and so on. Plus comedy about the author of the paparazzi was original for boot. Nora and his colleagues "photographers" on the trip, night after night, day after day by themselves. Many things don't mean to me. As this shows, and my other fav - Gross Pointe never "done". If only the first time of the Truth of the Past, and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please anyone out there?
