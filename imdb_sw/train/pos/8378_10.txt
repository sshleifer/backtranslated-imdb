It's a good film. The concept of nations sending people to fight for big robots is tacky. Finally it is not just the right, it is the most inspiring. <br /> But I'm attracted to the characters. It is a pity we never saw the relationship of Achilles and Athena further developed over several kisses and fear Athena for Achilles security. Their love is very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
