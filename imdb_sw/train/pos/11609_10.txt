I saw this when it congratulated and just looking back at the IFC again. This is a great news of many possible stories about the number of people who were joining the farms who came to Hawai'i to work on sugarcane farms in the early 1900s. My parents were born on the farm of Kohala (Big Island) during the time of films. I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for more than 30 years. I have heard many stories from aunt and aunt who were children growing on farms. This movie helps to create stories and records of these types. This story is the most historical document than the romantic movie derived from the plot. It leaves me to read my review as ccthemovieman's. Some people don't get. I don't remember that Youki Kudoh had a role of star, which did a wonderful job. I remember his great exhibition in Jim Jarmusch's "Quiz" and Australian film, cooperation with Russell Crowe, "Burning Heaven". Tamlyn Tomita did a good job with her English pidgin, especially for someone who did not grow in the Islands. I forgot that Toshiro Mifune had a responsibility to come as a writer of moving pictures. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had a non-stop, non-speaking part of the farm workers during the paid area. I was sad to know that the director and author of cooperation, Kayo Hatta, died in a crash in 2005. <br /> <br /> There are other foreign films that glass this experience : "Gaijin" about migrant workers in Brazil (mostly Japanese) at the same time; and "Sugar Cane Alley" about plant experience in Africa. The end is still available, but "Gaijin", sadly, doesn't seem to have been shown for a long time. Another great movie about Asia's first experience in America when migrants were more like slaves are "Thousands of gold". This was installed on the participation of Chinese workers in the construction of railway, Rosalind Chao star, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dun.
