I started to hear about this film about 20 years ago when I was a child at primary school (!), So just happened that I was walking through encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entrance of movies (or movies, I don't remember), had sticks several different movies from size to experiments, and one of them shown on the page was still on Off. I was so impressed, because it stood on the page (it was still from the local film with eye and other features on it). 18 years or more later, the public library here where I lived was found to track the entire 4-DVD movie "Film Movies Treasury" released by the National Film Foundation Foundation . So as I was reading the notes on DVD cases for setting, I was very surprised to see that OffOn was on one record. After all these years, I could see the film! After looking at it, it was little I was expecting to be (it seemed to be the most visible film, not that it was a bad thing, but I expected to have more electrical testing), but it was still an interesting film, IMHO, based on Scott Bartlett's approach. he used to make the film, including the hand copying of the film itself, and using video equipment for some film events (hidden for video tracking), giving more look, checking status. Do not do wrong, the techniques used in this film were completely broken in 1972. That's why it's still one of my short / experimental films, and my creative inspiration too ...
