This movie is a journey through the imagination of the screens of the screen found in its human philosophy. He searches any question that I am 'who I am' and 'who is it?' It is a bold and stimulating business. There is a transportation of beautiful pictures, with a dream of dreams, parcherxes of the Escher-like reminding hand to draw itself, or rather, pull out. More and more we follow the author in his pain about what to say and what about the film, we see him calling with his wife who came from Peru, leaving him to care for their child, the work he does with little attention until he gets so much in his trouble that he cannot look at the child again. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys her information and helps her go over the last barrier until she gets herself. Interspersed with beautiful eyes and me-destruction images, stories are especially philosophical. It's about the Maya, the world of deception. Unlike the movie however, it's that it requires a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. During more than two hours of stimulating beauty and quick filming of the film has made me a long time for silence or a short movie. If that was the purpose of the manufacturer, he was successful.
