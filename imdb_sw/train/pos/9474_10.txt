I had to see this film for preview and it was displayed. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I can't remember a great laugh for the film and still transferred to it. Laughter is not here - it is an inquiry, a sense of recognition, a little shock of "Ooo, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt it!" I will not give away a conspiracy, which is more than a "Guy loves for his brother's partner." The whole family has a part in the relationship here. Probably the best mix of laughter and heat since "When You Were Sleep." Steve Carell goes much more than he went before, and for the first time I loved him. Sent is amazing, a list of former theater actors who I like in other roles, but they combine to make a family of influence. Dianne Wiest is as good as a mother, Juliette Binoche is a bright and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), And even the revived Dals Cook provides warm performance, stability, affecting. The voice of Sondre Lerche is a good boost, and I will be able to buy a second CD available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this.
