The history of the FBI, as described from Agent Stewart's view through photography, interacting with his life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are very good, like Hamilton's hard work. The problem is that the nature of the story button makes it difficult to share. It's like looking at pieces and pieces of several different movies when we get the details of who was thrown into gangsters. Some of these events are very long, some very short, and some look out of place (the school's daughter of Stewart). In general, it continues for too long. However, it is worth looking for its positive production standards.
