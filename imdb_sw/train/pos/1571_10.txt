Not since Spongebob Squarepants have seen a great cartoon on TV. Color is beautiful, the sound can not be better, the characters are natural, very good cartoon. Hope Nickolodean keeps developing this cartoon. Hope DVD's season comes soon !!! I love cartoons like this and I hope many people are trying to see this great set. It is very difficult to find a DVD of the season, so if someone gets a shop that buys please please know. The only catscratch products available at Nick's Shop are a great look at the look, but it's very expensive! If you like Spongebob; and who? you will like Catscratch too!
