Best display. Instead of looking at the old style of sitcom shows where it is another thing of the past, the "star" just different, this enjoyable show has provided a recreational view of office conditions. We have been away from watching any TV for 2 years and after the return, of all the exhibitions available we hope to watch this show on W. Shame on Global by connecting plug in this. I thought this would be the winner. Let's have the truth about things, a few of Canadian SHOWS do that. Everyone who speaks is enjoying this show and I believe it was the folly of Global to walk away. I think they want to strengthen and common sense numbing shows from the United States instead of pull back to Canada showed a show that she had many promises. Don't make a mistake, I'm enjoying many movies on television, but, get to the people, let's keep up different types. This unique version shows a positive view of the true side of office life and relationships, with unique characters who do not see on any modern or old sitcoms. It is not wrong that the world should say no to this, a foolish error.
