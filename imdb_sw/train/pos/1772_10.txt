is an excuse to know I am not thinking this app! The summary from the client is good. I also remember to get a haunting thing and not exactly a family look, I must have been 10/11 when I watched it. I think for a girl that the age of attraction was the direction of red hair, and its permanent condition. The theme was played in the whistle I remember - although I can't remember how it went. I think the intro showed him to play - or maybe he played flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Perhaps I have been prepared to know how it ended or see a piece of picture or hear the sound, but at least I now know not only me.
