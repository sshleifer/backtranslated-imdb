William Powell's final end as Philo Vance occurs in the Case of the Kennel Case where the dog killing of championship leads to two more killings and one human attempt. It's all in focus on such a way leads to whom and why. Philo Vance is killed by SS Van Dine were popular at the time and clever Mr. Van Dine decided to go to sell his one book at a time for the most advanced studio artist. This is why you see many Philo Vances and many studios that put them out. If Bill Powell had no great reputation with MGM as Nick Charles of Thin Man's series, he would be known as the head of Philo Vances. It is changing that Powell had gone to his little Captain in the same race where the killed dog entered and then another opponent's owner became the first victim of the murder. As usual Powell shows Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose most significant contribution in the case was to use his bulk to break into the inner door where the first door of the murder was found. inside and was a top story so it was to make sure how. Powell has a group of suspects, as deep as what is common in the mystery of the Holy Man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, fill up their work. Warner Brothers liked this version to a large extent that they actually rebuilt it in Three by James Stephenson in his one and only out as Philo Vance. It doesn't have a candle for this. <br /> <br /> If this is the only Philo Vance which is out of VHS or DVD in all ways see this or get it if you can.
