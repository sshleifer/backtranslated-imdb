Anyone who loves Rheostatics music will enjoy this film. I have little complaints, especially about the fight against the creation of certain actors (not Maury) who have no real influence in their roles, but I have no time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or is looking at this film as a CBC TV presented in Canada: The air version of the CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- look at it. Reduces all scenes and small items (as much as you can) from the film. The CBC, which provides many non-recognized films, took half of the beat out of WHALE MUSIC. I don't know why. It is a horrible thing they did on the film. Use the video or watch it in the theater, but don't look at the CBC TV.
