and it's a combo. The giant star of the two-century singers together in this music set. He writes music, writes lyrics, and both works for Basil Rathbone who cannot write either because his wife has died (in fact he has found fat!). Excellent location is a shop shop number where Bing plays impromptu number when the swing band gets their outdoor instruments. It's very strange. And this is a rare star story for Broadway story, Mary Martin, and she is very good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again manic pianist), Charles Lane, and Helen Bertram star-star. And who knew Rathbone could be funny?
