We should not lose this film, this is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more common) and the movie is one of the most amazing of new information. Jean Eustache is no longer here on earth, we just have these black and white pictures to remember one of the most French and many directors. You should only love this masterpiece. I can't forget. <br /> <br /> P.S: sorry for English language ...
