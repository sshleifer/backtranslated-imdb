Nicolas Roeg's projects are different to say a little, but not less interesting. "Important" is obvious, first and foremost, a modified step: is a word of words and 'pretty-bound'. But, it pays to watch this film more than once: the basic theme has not been presented more and, moreover, it takes time to fix juxtaposition and change the role of four characters: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe, and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein has been convicted of Hiroshima yet shows that the simplicity of sexual relations with Munro; Munro is sick to appear as a bimbo and wants to mind credence; McCarthy Senator is about its magic hunting but it is improper sleazebag; DiMaggio is safe on celebrity, engaging, and dealing with violence. Each of them has the seeds of their own destruction. Each character is concerned, violence / violence past and worried. Gradually, we see that perseverance itself is a great theme. America's deficit and its cultural icons after war and visa; The rebellion of the perpetrators for something that no one can have: peace-of-mind and / or happiness. Compared to the theory of reconciliation, the proposed theory of the field and in fact, the cosmos itself, all expectations and cooperation of Roeg characters seem to be worthless. However, these things of the physical world (it's all quantum, depend on me!) It affects us when we are used in the development of destructive ways. Monroe's view of the neutron bomb principle (without mentioning it as such) is not an acronism for se, but it can be understood by modern viewers. Indeed, all records within the script are only available for an experienced viewer: one or fait and '50 events / human events and how they affect the 21st century. very clever, or very opaque and wise. Finally, however, perhaps not necessary. <br /> <br /> live long and prosper :)
