Every time people ask me the name of the worst movie I ever seen, I have always answered "Black Day" and to date no one has ever heard. I looked at it alone 30 years ago when I was 13 years old when my parents were gone in the evening. Besides I know that it has been shown only once in the UK and sadly not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can track a copy please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I look again now it can be a great disappointment but it is always stuck in my memory as a little amazing movie!
