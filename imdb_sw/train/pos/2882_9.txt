Cinderella was one of the first movies I saw, and for me it is timeless. It's a good film to watch, with good animation. My favorite animation is a local dress- I just love those mice. That song is also good, not as good as Snow White, but it's fun to sing, and it's to remember Tchaikovsky. Dreams are disappointed and so this is love? it's safe. The characters are also happy. Cinderella is idealistic and stable, and mice gave good aid to comic. Managers were also well done, along with Lucifer. But I loved your best mother, she was so bad, in comparison with the good character in the name of God of fairy. It's true, the movie draws a bit, and the antics of the mouse, but they were really true, so I don't care. I don't think it has been inserted, is not reduced? It rarely plays on television, but the worst sequel makes on Cinemagic on a regular basis. If you want a great change of Cinderella, try wonderful Ever After, or an interesting Slipper with Rose, which is not good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I am wrong to possess, because you will save me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
