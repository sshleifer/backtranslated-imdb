I enjoyed this film because there was a real cleanliness in acting. The writing was high. James Arness is a good actor and demonstrated here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and anyone could play Davy but Fess Parker? Another great actor in this argument was Raul Julia, who gave a great deal to Santa Anna, a useless and tough man who led Mexico through tough times. While others may think that the movie was slow, it took the battle as revealed, lots of votes followed by several hours of horrible fears. I was so impressed with this film that it made you think about the reasons and how other people die because of believers. On this day and age when no one stands for anything, I have found it interesting to think that there was a time when people died freely, no matter how you feel about the politics of that time.
