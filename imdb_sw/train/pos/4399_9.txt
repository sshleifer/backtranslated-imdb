The best way to explain the ride and the devil has only one word: legitimacy. I will not prepare what is already being said about this amazing film, but I would like to say how much of historical and careful research of the members who undoubtedly passed it was proposed by this film writer. Like a well-known historian and paste with this film, I must say that this production is one of the worst films about "Kansas bleeding". Yes there was freedom taken on real events, as all fiction is able to do. But the overall feel of the film is true. True things, realistic views (no PC looking here) even executives seem to be true. The few I spoke to have expressed their concern about the dialogue made. They cannot believe that 19th-century farmers will "speak as poets". What they do not know is that at this age of insulting words, the American public of the 19th century was an amazing learning and good group. These people were raised in Shakespeare with the King James version of the Bible. The authors of the photographs fashioned these styles of these people, based on the time documentation. The only created conversation adds magical to the film. But in addition to the historical document, this film works on visceral level as well. The beauty was photographed and carried out, making harkens back to the western western days. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, carried out many times before in many films, a small film is displayed by a sense of urgency that puts the viewer between the steps. It is a movie that has everything called moviegoer. In the year that was led by more litter like the American Beauty, this great artwork was buried with a non-studio system. But I am sure that Riders and the devil will be given for years to come. Please rent this film. Not eligible.
