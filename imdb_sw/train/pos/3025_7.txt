Bacall does well here - especially considering this only his 2 film. This often overshadows the shadow because it falls between two major achievements: "Have Been Not" (1944) and "Large sleeping" (1945), all of which The two collaborated with Humphrey Bogart. This has certainly not come to other movies but I think through its own fault. I think there was some miscasting for that she shows a British woman on the net. No feeling. I think all the wonderful accents were surprising - Boyer was not Spanish. It was difficult to make sure the people of the country were from. <br /> <br /> I loved black and white movies. Mood is used to affect very much - I liked the mist area. Lights also do a great job of increasing evil and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is very good. Boyer is not only suitable romantic direction to lead me - so he and Bacall together were very strange. It's not a great chemistry - and of course no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still loved this photo. There is great tension and goes along well. I must say I have found a little girl murdered for this film. Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as help cast. Paxinou as a hotel protector is hosted by the evil in his appearance. One part where he laughs carefully as Mr. Muckerji leaves after revealing him as a child killer. Lorre also makes it very well in his slimy, visible snake of Conteras - the last wild wolf. Wanda Bendrix also does very well in showing another child - especially considering this was his first picture and had only 16 time (though it looked very young). He returns later married married Auie Murphy which has proved to be a short time, a strong marriage.
