This movie is a movie that must be seen by all. Congress should see this documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in America. The original auditor has completely missed the point - the thing is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who are only living in the "enemy" area, and what makes for the soldier. We should support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY, before someone else was killed or injured. This also shows that the government does not help its veterans, those who have been mentally injured, and ptsd-post-traumatic, or physical, disorder. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
