In the seemingly endless effort to get well, he made the horrible films, it's all-too rare to find one that even comes to the far and hits the mark. Of course, I was very happy when I fell on "Burned Stake" on the U.S. cable web. when I was on the way. Cluster is very simple. In 1692, little Ann Putnam (Swift) is the greatest witness of witches against the witches, and measuring unfounded charges against anyone who finds his anger. Catch him for himself is Pastor Parris (Peters) who also leads as a court guide on matters concerning magic and Satan. Things become hard when Ann starts to accuse members of the Goode family of magic. Salem (of 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played with Swift) begins to have an unusual vision shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A wonderful man in the seventeenth century is trying to take him there with the building. He continues to tell her when extraordinary events start to involve more and more. Recently, it seems that he becomes the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, more commentary gets more involved and you will give it away too far. Although the film does not act and may be of interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in many sound films appears to be very interesting. Production values ​​are stable with possible discrimination of some special effects. In the note-side, the technical consultant of the film was Laurie Cabot, the official magician of Salem. A viewers who appreciate the well-made film, the atmosphere, but the lowest fears can understand this. The author / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction and is known for his work on many "worms" films and similar years earlier.
