This is on my list of all the time films! It is a wonderful and wise film. It was a historic and beautiful look! I thought acting from Emily Blunt was strange and Friend Rupert was a beautiful Albert, the best actor was elected to Albert. The dress was very beautiful and the settings and events like the opera house, were both amazing and deep. I just liked it, all of it! I loved childhood events he was experiencing 'abuse' by John Conroy. And where his mother says she walks the ladder and the adult. One longer writers have done! They produced this wonderful script! It is absolutely worth the prize they got. (Oscar and BAFTA wining Sandy Powell, for design clothing. BAFTA for the best make-up and hair, Oscar in Best Achievements in Art Instructions, Best Achievements in Costume Design, Best Success in Makeup. The best Emily Blunt CDG's Excellence in Design Costume for the Period of the Film. Blunt.) Total 10 achievements and 11 appointments! That's very good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Have a look at yourself, it's very interesting! Rupert's personal friend should be awarded.
