I was at the end of the low-speed cable routes one night and ran on this movie from 10 to 10 minutes - every time I thought to go to bed, something that kept telling me to keep looking at it even though it was my way to sleep. <br /> <br /> This movie can be another simple film of slam dunk fight gun, but instead chose to explore the results of shootings. And even better, a continuous film and real life - just when you think they will go the easy and clear way made, the problem comes with changing the whole view of the film. This film is not just following a form, it shows how other events are going on constantly and / or affecting what happens next. I just want the creators of the film to consider more anti-depressant drug issues - children from Columnbine who shot were on them for years and it was awesome to look at how Deanna's way happened at any time of the start of the dream . Until recently they were giving things like candy and now only they begin to understand what long-term effects that drugs contain. It was very interesting to see that the story of the story was given to the film, to have a brother who has a mental illness, I can say that the movie was dead nuts in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo for the director and author who actually did their homework on these issues. And for those who think some things could not come out of the hospital (I don't want to tell them any details), you have been badly wrong on that too - I've been there. The script was realistic. <br /> <br /> Go buy this movie and show your young children before delayed. One day they will thank you for that.
