One was saying, about Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failure was more interesting than his success. I believe that similar views can be similar to the images of McDonald-Eddy. And especially this. It seems to have many features of a failed movie: it's kitsch, script, because of the controls, it seems unlikely? However, this film also has a good talent: a good music for Rodgers-Hart ("I was married to an angel", "Tira tira tira"), beautiful with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. However, if you don't like it, you can't forget it. This amazing moment leaves a lot of power, when it comes out like a dream, feeling, and you are more likely to put it in mind for a day, maybe a week. Why? In the thirty years and the beginning of thirty years, movies have no more meaning than today: it aims to, like a dream, to turn the public so that it can forget the difficult situation. In all the films of the dream that were made, at the time, this seems to be powerful. In short, let's say that the best way to appreciate this film, is to look at it without striving whether it's good or bad. To look at it, if you look at a dream.
