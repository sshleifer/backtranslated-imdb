I saw five or ten minutes of the last film in 1998 or 1999 one night when I was driving before bed, and I liked what I saw. Since then I have been watching, hitting a TV list, passing through a DVD / VHS racks in the mall, but I did not get a copy until recently when I got some other web stores. Then, being a barrier to the world class, I did not instruct them. Finally, I used a DVD copy in Circuit City when I visited Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then I just took about a month after returning home before sitting down and looking at it. <br /> <br /> So, what do I think about the film? It's good. It's not as good as I remembered and hoped, but it's still worth $ 9.99 it's my cost. After seeing all the film for the first time I tested it as 7/10, and the possibility of 8/10. I'll have less sleep then, and have a better sound system to avoid restoring to get some conversation.
