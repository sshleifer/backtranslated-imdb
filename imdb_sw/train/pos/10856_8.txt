British comedies tend to have one type of two main: stability, introduction, often learning romantic and social satire. The settings, characters, and concepts vary but some features place a large number of shows in one of the two categories. Butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type. These words are many words, including the long-term monologues and the main character Ria, a happy but uncomfortable home wife feels about what she could lose when she started a normal life . When he meets a successful but bold businessman (who makes his enthusiasm very clear), he plays with the idea of ​​finding another way that can provide. <br /> <br /> Acting with texts is always on the money, which makes a person's response to the show almost completely personal: I am not beaten off and do not turn off. My mother, on the other hand, stressed this show. I think the level that identifies you and Ria's problem is the most important thing in identifying someone's responses to Butterflies.
