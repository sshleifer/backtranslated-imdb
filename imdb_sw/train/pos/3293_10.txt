If I have been asked to remember a song from the last film, then it will be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" in the sense of it, how it plays with Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and mention a photograph of photography while the ship's boat comes out against the black nature and the bright stars. Others must be "Chalte Chalte." Pakeezah was the last Meena Kumari film before the death and the amount of time that was taken can be seen on the screen. In each of the songs shown, it looks young but after it doesn't. But one actor who did not change in his image was late Raj Kumar, who loves him and his feet in particular, after an accident to go to his train cabin and when he saw them, he leaves details explaining how good Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story , as far as possible should be viewed on large screens for photography and cinematic songs. Meena stars star, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and are dominated by Kamal Amrohi. Kamal's son Amrohi has now started to revive his father's studio by making a movie of the comedy.
