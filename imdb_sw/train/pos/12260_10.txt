This is the best start of the work of Mickey Rooney. His talents here show that the long work is before him. Car and truck eviction is exciting for the 1937s. This beginning of the series of Andy Hardy is the US treasure in my book. The performance of Byington's Spring is as good as usual. Please Mr. Rooney or the copyright holders, get a chance and be reproduced on DVD. I think it will be the winner.
