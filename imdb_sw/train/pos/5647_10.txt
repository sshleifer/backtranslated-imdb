I don't want to reproduce everyone by repeating what they said, but this is one of the best series! It was a great shame when it was deleted, and I hope someone will have a good sense to take it and start over again. The good news is that it's on DVD! I ran to the shop and took a copy and I am glad to say that it is as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a dark and strange character, and all participants were very good. It is embarrassing that the network did not continue. Shaun Cassidy, this is a jewel. Anyone who enjoys that type and who has not seen, must do so. Not eligible. My daughter who was too young to see it on television (20 years old) is very impressed, and will soon become a fan. He finds it "very misleading" and has enjoyed the events he has seen. I can't wait to watch the sessions that were not shown. <br /> <br /> This shows stones!
