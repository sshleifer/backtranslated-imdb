The new publisher of "Zabriskie Point" takes place in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It is during the full review of the film. Let us hope that the new publication means that the DVD with "more insight" will be out of the future. I remember watching ZP when it came out and thinking it was bearing. At this time I was very surprised and put it as a "close-miss" head. The first part of the cinema is the term of the late 6060's Los Angeles, I lived there, and Antonion did a good job of receiving the essence of the place. Kudos for the producer of producer Dean Tavoularis who found amazing places and did a good job. <br /> <br /> Published what I see at 1 50 minutes. It is prohibited for those under 16 (or 18, I can't remember). I witness there is a small part of this magazine. SPOILER - I wonder how the desert area was cut off. What appears today seems to be tame and current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no sound-sounding music for about an hour on the film. Before hearing the outside noise like radio announcements, etc. Antononi was very brave to do this. I remember how much was done during the lack of knowledge of the act of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette didn't bother me. Halprin is weak but gradually improves as the film continues. Most posts of an opponent's student look like my stock photos. One call is in a different aspect ratio & damaged with wide screens. Of course, there are realistic pictures, but not many. <br /> <br /> I am still trying to find out how Antonioni did some of the shots of Frechette flying birds. It seems as if he did some jump - no blue or double screen in some shots. I hope to return to see the second film. It was highly recommended for all Antonons fans.
