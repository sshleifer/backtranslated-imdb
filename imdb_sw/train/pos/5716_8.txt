Not seen any Japanese film, but I am very happy with this. I rarely are served during watching the movie. I can fly, if the effects and sounds are surprising, but the fear of the film is normal to me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything when I looked at it. I did not expect to be afraid. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you, apparently, is love or hate. Many people seem to compare it to Japanese films, but although I haven't seen them, I believe it's not right to compare any film, in fact. This film stands on it. The story is weak, many people say. I disagree. The story is very small, and it has been done for a purpose. Methods of telling stories - a broken time for example - has been done perfectly. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe he got his vision in the way he wanted. I donated this film 8 of 10. It's a film you will enjoy watching, or hating. It's as simple as that.
