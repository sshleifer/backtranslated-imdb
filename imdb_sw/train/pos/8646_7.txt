In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a television series to die when they all played one part of the area they are doing in California. I have no doubt what caused the photography on this great screen film. Kalapi finds a writer who loves David Duchovny and his girlfriend, a photographer of Michelle Forbes on a kind of relationship for a kind of Duchovny quarrel by writing a book and entering the mind and soul of usually. In fact he has an unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go to the country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes broke the flat. Justice enters in more ways than money and the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of wonderful southern forms that agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country. It turns out that Pitt is a festive killer and decides to do a little research alone, thinking in the mind of someone who has been attracted to discrimination. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not a type of film I usually go to, but in fact the ability to act with Brad Pitt's charisma works on a large scale. Pitt is the definition of a walk of Gothic refugees from the Release. But better than he is Juliette Lewis who also plays these forms of self-esteem which he seems to do well. Look at its location for Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and beautiful life. Lewis's negotiations and Forbes presentations should be displayed in the course of the course in the country. <br /> <br /> For those who love their slasher, they have no better than California.
