Although I can understand the bad things one can say about this movie, I still find it very strange. It will touch you, and unless your gossip is searching into the obstacles and failure of every movie, or you just be touched by anything, it's worth seeing. Do not enter into an anticipated film, just have a tissue box with an open mind. It is good and acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, in spite of that she still plays another sad person, is wonderful. I believe a good actor is a person who can express the feelings and emotions that we all have in our worst / best condition in a way that meets you and makes you feel bad. And that's exactly what this film does. Give a chance.
