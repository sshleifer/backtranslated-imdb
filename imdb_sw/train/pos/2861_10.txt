I love this show with my 11-year-old daughter and I love to look at it together. It teaches good old morals in a fun, fun and entertaining way (with a predictable story). It is also fun enjoyable ... you know, rewind and insert your own discussion, rather than actors'. I have my DVR set up to record all the events and I have come to catch the end of the segment (just before the next start ... so I don't know what it was) but there was a complete error tracking TERRIBLE! Adam had given Sheri Coffee a small problem of "skin", which was broken from an illegal coat when he tried to make his obstruction, I think. Well, Roy came to have a coat, so he put it on his desk and put the right swatch where it was broken. The swatch was rectangular rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to break from a piece of skin (after 1950 Naugahyde? Yes .. skin? I don't think so). Well, the swatch created fully and the mystery was solved. It's not 10 seconds later, we see the coat again, still on Roy's desk. But this time the swatch is similar to the shape of North Carolina and is now in a different place for the coat (but still fully closed with a hole in the coat) and the seam (which was blowing in the middle of the swatch) has now gone ... like a seam in the coat . My daughter enjoyed the good laughter when we played the shortest time! It's best for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love to show even though the sequencing errors make it a lot of fun!
