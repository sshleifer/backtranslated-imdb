It has never heard of this film, seen it on DVD. This great film, a perfect example of a film that took every member to work. There is no more planned movie of Hollywood and former characters who have overhyped.There is no current quotation of "A" of the actor has removed any functionality in this film. Refer to the memory of my own post Vietnam war experience.It concentrated on The people who were sent to fight.As displayed by the characters who were afraid and feeling even though some volunteer service. They were ordinary people, others were not excluded for military life, and I remember a few in my experience - to put it gently not to cope with military-but-life but I never will forget-they should stay in touch.I strongly recommend and then think about those who are serving today in Afghanistan. The training of taxis is a journey, look at the drill fighters are not people of the morning and maybe need "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
