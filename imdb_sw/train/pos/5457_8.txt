This film is one of many of the black and white films in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Code was implemented. It is the story of a beautiful young woman moving to New York and making her way over business by using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck has the power of young and beautiful Lily who really works well with her performance. Lily goes to New York and makes her way to business by sleeping with all men. Stanwyck performs better performance as a powerful woman who uses men as one-time contracts, any feeling for them to play with them as they had a string. The power of Lily is a loveless woman on her mind only power and money. I thought this movie was a little different from other movies I saw because there is no natural music to hear. I believe it is because this is when people started the first voice and conversation between film people. Very often the music is heard at the beginning as we are shown how he does his way on the sequence. The movie and the different pictures were a wonderful thing! The director of this film made all the right angles and tricks all right, and made this film full of authenticity. All this film was included with a good film. At the end of this film it was not as good as it should be, but it was not completely damaged. The face of the Child had its slow events in the movie, and perhaps the small parts to predict as much as he would sleep and the next. But this is a favorite movie that can look more at once, and it was recommended for people and friends.
