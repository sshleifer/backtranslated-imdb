The Road to Destruction, an unsuitable movie to be ignored in the same year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best career), the director who has three years before winning Oscar for its great American beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately hurt and sad. It is a family story of wealth and happiness from an outward appearance of depression when Michael Sullivan, a father of two, played with Tom Hanks a great (I am not her pastor but he must say so) is a mafia boss-man domestic, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, thirteen-year-old boy Michael Sullivan Jr., played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of fun ignorance knows his father's work and what their family lives. Moved by his curiosity and his wishes to know the truth he accidentally became a witness of the murder, conducted by John Rooney, the son of his father's boss. The discovery kills an innocent soul and has caused many events that have changed his life forever. The nature of the period, nature and all decorations are created, editing and movies are almost without having a story when the story is written well. But the main line of the film, when more important and the points of the movie and the key factor of the success of the cinema is hardly a father-son relationship in critical times. They are shown in detail, strength and reliability. Tom Hanks has the best and has one of the best performances of his work for the most common role for him and all who do on the board is good. Finally mention a very good score by Paul Newman and for the result we get the best work of all people involved in doing this good (but one more sad moment) hub. I believe the road to destruction is a great achievement of ten years and is undoubtedly one of the best annual films. My grade 10 out of 10
