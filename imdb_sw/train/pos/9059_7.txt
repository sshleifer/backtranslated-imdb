This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this film to be word by word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was disgraced because I read the book a few times I was at primary school. This is about a new baby in a city named Billy. He makes a bet and thanks to the school and bet is not as much money. Billy will eat 10 worms for one day or the success of abuse. <br /> <br /> Acting is the same, perhaps the worst part of the film. Children's actors spread over many things. They think it is apocalypse as Billy doesn't eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a very good job, though. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot is as good as the film, but it looks like a book comparison. I was able to watch this film without looking at .... sometimes. Overall, this was a good family video with weak points. I am testing this 7/10 movie.
