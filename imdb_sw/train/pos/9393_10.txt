Some movies you know will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Monitoring is rooted behind "Double Freedom," and "Postman Always Rings Twice" in 40 years - this was a good example of Movie Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage has a characteristic "low on luck" he enters into the husband's wife's murder - and his fortune comes from bad and bad even though he tries to try to isolate people, city, violence and the threat of Red Rock West. Most of the stages, beautiful performances and Cage, Hopper and Walsh, the guitar's music guitar, guitar and guitar, make this a real pleasure. Line Favorites: When Cage looks at the empty blank gas in the car-get away, blows his head and says: "F *** in my life story."
