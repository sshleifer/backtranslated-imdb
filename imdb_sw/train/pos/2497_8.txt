Indeed: the use of drugs, warehouse-'s-ups, 'Matrix-esque shooting dodging, the future city with a mix of Asian communities, and the vampire alone - all in the same movie - looks like a story that can just considered by the pop / rock of the Japanese. And that's exactly the 'Child Child', and more. While all these connections can be seen as a complete lesson for the B's B's movie, 'Moon Child' removes you with several bumps and expected drives along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a gritty, definitely self-feel, jumping from one location to the next not in a smooth change, but rather a high level and limits, giving light into the lives of the characters and hard to pull in the plot true. But the film is not suitable for excuse, rather than turning the story into one of the friendships, love, faith, and betrayal of any sugar that has been mentioned in the above-mentioned elements of the future community, war and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE as a vampire shadow 'Kei' is ideal, giving you a comprehensive character and balancing out of the hard work of Gackt as 'Sho,' orphan who is Kei's friends. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as a "son" revenge who becomes friends with the entire Sho. This story refers to these characters and their friends and family extended to different periods in their lives, and how simple friendships can easily be turned into sadness and betrayal. When the point at the moment is all too the real and special effects are only visible to show, the same thing that the film is never worth is on top of the most popular Asian singers that deals. Superstars as actors have their mistakes, and so do their characters. Movie is not very much, and it ends where it should, after flying a little closer. 'Baby Month' is more fun, it laughs more frequently, and even more touching: it's definitely worth your time!
