I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko has gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I don't care when South Africa was in 1993. It is also a great story about friendship and honesty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience in the dance debate in Natal singing Lord Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair stopped. There is much to learn from this story for all people.
