I wasn't sure the first time if I looked at the document, a propaganda film or a great presentation. I think given time production was a combination of all three. It is indeed a wonderful plot was possible. But there was a feeling that there would be interesting events as the film continued. We were able to witness what seemed to be true systems of training and equipment. Where this movie gathered to me was close to the end. The events were realistic (at least as I realized) that I had never met before. You can put yourself in action and think of the ideas of small fighters. This was confused with the usual problems of showing the Japanese forces that could lose time when you think of real Japanese actors without a shortage. The movie is the best as a source of American opinion in 1943 as a war organized by Japan. Also interesting was the digging for the Japanese in honor of US help provided Japan in previous years.
