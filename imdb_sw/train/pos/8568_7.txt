Although this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (living action, not animated version), I think still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was done well, the music was more suitable for action, and the results were done well (compared to 101). Acting was perhaps the best, but then humanitarian characters were given the most important roles in this chapter, and Glenn Close was never appropriate, as in the first movie. He makes you shine. The poor Lackey and the most powerful furrier organs are the amazing characters of play, and they add to the Disney Festival has given us. This is a great family film, with little or no material, and still remains interesting for both adults and children alike. It should be a classic, as most Disney film is. Here there is a third hope will still be better even- because you know maybe they want to do one. ;)
