*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Setting in an unforgettable time (such as the above quote, not destroyed by Primus), Rescue describes the story of four people who go on a wild trip to white water rafting and go away The big city for just a moment to find that their happiness takes a bad foot. This is not a Hollywood film. There is almost no special effect, the environment is very realistic, and nothing is sugarcoated or made pretty. The boys of the city seem like the boys of the city, and even the tough boy Louis, was accurately shown by Burt Reynolds, is open to wild mercy on this trip. This is a perfect example of what-like film. What if a few friends went to the river of rafting in the forest area where none of them knew, and ended up trying very hard to avoid being sentenced to the murder that they had to do to save their lives? </> <br /> There is a very powerful feature of the film that deals with social and class structure and relationship (or lack thereof) among rural and urban people. When four people get to the forest early in the film, they don't know how to interact with people living there, and they talk to them if they don't know whether they will understand or can communicate. This communication barrier focuses more on the emerging banjoes, where they try to strengthen the car and truck and get someone to drive their decline. When Drew and the missing boy and probably lost their intellect at the venue fight with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenarios in the film), Louis has trouble purchasing gas, and Bobby is making a comment about the shortage of nature and how sad it is all. When the boy turns away from Drew, who had downloaded his hand after their socialist session, Bobby tells him to give the man bucks, knowing that none of them is sure how to respond. This is the kind of thing that we see in the Rescue that puts a lot of tension that will follow. This area where there is great joy (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' area to Sunday, O Brother, Where is the Most?) It ended and everyone would undoubtedly prove what to do almost everyone. These people are apples and oranges, and live with different laws of life. The people who Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed met in the mountains were alienated from the modern society and modern laws, and lived by natural laws, which do not include them. Concerned by their unusual behavior, the four friends went to the river, hoping to have the last rebellion and for the adventure to start. (/ demolition) In short with Ed and Bobby they run to the river crossings which quickly turn to bad, uncertainty about the way these people live - which was established by the area above - comes to create more tension during area. I think that a good sign of awesome quality like this is that the scary feature of the film, namely the attack and actual killings, takes very little time of screen time but it remains a very memorable part of the film. There is no free abuse here, it's all there for a clear and reaching effect. The action is on a sharp conflict of two different types of people, and what can happen when they find themselves in each other's battle. The trip down the river after the attack, which takes a lot of films, provides a good tension of efficiency, and puts you on the edge of your seat while not blasting for you so much that you become scared. It is amazing when we know that Ed can kill a bad person on the rock, and the tension in the film never stops when three team members reach the bottom of the river, because they present good information to the police about what happened on the river and why of the deputy lost. This is a very disturbing film, which is an agreement of its success, because it is clear that the film like this means to shake people up a little. The hill parts are human (ie, more than true) version of small human rednecks that are seen in infant films but the same as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, and none of which can be compared to non-timeless films as Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their bad weekend in the forests, the natural aspect is true and we know the men well and in the form of a trick that almost like us, as the audience of the audience, is actually a fifth member of the team. Not often that the film can reach that way.
