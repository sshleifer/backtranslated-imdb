After seeing the Mail and feel disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that has led this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was surprised at this film. It is a true gem and from this one of my favorite movies of all time. Acting is perfect, the story is very good, that if you haven't seen it, I would like to encourage you to see it today. It's not against renewal and sometimes I like a newer version than the previous one, but this time you have to admit that You have received Mail is a bad adaption of this classic. Do not miss, go to your video shop and rent a nearby Shop!
