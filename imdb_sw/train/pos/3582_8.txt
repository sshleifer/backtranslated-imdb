Here is still another film from 80 years that most people don't know. This is the slow, colorful color of the Montana landscapes and is very interesting and reminds me of the recent "Range Range", which also starred Robert Duval, and a lively satisfying film is a full movie movie. to watch the night when you can 'sleep or on Sunday is not the day's list. Those with the right feelings will be treated with a good look and with the sadness of the same family and how they come together after a little child to crash and kill the first child during the hunt. All these exhibitions are high and silent. Glenn Close, Robert Duval, and Wilford Brimley are the best in their pictures, like all supporters supported by small actors. I especially liked how Cain (who unfortunately did not mention anything of note since this but the "Young Guns" first) gives us a little calm in everyone's grief. We do not see just how the death of the little brother or parents, but also the middle-sided sister, the lost uncle, the husband's wife, and the boy's boyfriend. What we find here is the answer of the Mid-West answer to "Common people." There are also David Lynch's shades of "Straight" in some of Mid-West's stoic downhome values ​​which people are shown here as well as in the shots of angry farming. This is one of the best and true "tears-tears" of the era, and getting a little good for the best film hunters out there.
