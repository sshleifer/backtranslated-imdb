It is not necessary to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this deep grave is to increase eligibility for the 80 slasher of backwoods. The plot goes to the = girls of 4 sorority from the museum conference organizes the rest of life in Florida, but their plans are to hold when one of them preaches someone killing a local woman, and when she knows that she appeared, then let's just say it becomes deadly game The cats and mice and things are getting worse when he returns to the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Poor infiltration in my opinion is one of the most enjoyable slashers to happen in the 80s, especially late 80's which was during the slimhers kinda declined, this was one of the few who didn't have this movie should be more specific, it is not mercy. this is one film which actually combines practices (just try guessing who the last girl will be - I got quite). The whole principle is interesting and is one of those movies that you hope all leave, which of course do not. This, along with the fluffiness of the first half-hour cylinders of the film (in a good way) and some of the real nastiness of the concrete (second kill provides a real jolt) and unexpected surveillance (even if this is not over the desire of the budget I did not expect the location on which a woman has been beaten with her brain (accompanied by a radio hysterical radio), in the film from the late 80's. one or two bad things about this movie, not just the worst, like a small plot with two young boys who are not going anywhere and the end that was ignorant and with the ability of the Deputy to follow logic. There are no bright objects in SHALLOW GRAVE but, with my mind at least, it is a flute to decrease through and through. Events where girls are beaten through trees and sheriff's pride are temporary and exciting. All in a fun and highly valued slasher, and beautiful performances from all four girls and that psychological sheriff.
