Walking home after the film, I was thrilling the waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were playing. I've heard that before - where? Ah, from the "Great Eyes" of Kubrick (track 2), 'I just got as I came to the door. It is "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2" written by Dimitri Shostakovich, held here by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and took a voice from the Tower Tower. What is a treat! The film mark by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen songs instead of two beautiful waltz songs. It is not often these days we have a totally dedicated voice for the full color of the film. He reminds me of the favorite symbols with Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (the beginning of the song of the 6th song has features of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue, and John Barry. There are subtle forms of trouble and information from conditions, celeste, piano, and harp. Emily Watson and John Turturro offered the practice of connecting emerging. The story of love, their close relationship, is very much among Alexandre and Natalia - his inner world suffering as a child, and his understanding of his generosity and courage - the only relationship for both. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia Line" (1996 Foreign Academy of the Academy of Foreign Academy) gave us a silent film of silence - without his human conflicts, perversion, opposition, family, efforts and respect. The last lesson is a mental and mathematical game of chess. Under this can be a soft-blown tears of the game organized in the late 1920s. The movie screening takes the beauty of the Lake Como sets in northern Italy near the Swiss border. I recommend very loud voice sounds if you feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplat's video "Luzhin Defense" video has been completed.
