Whoopi is the only reason I watched Oscars that year. She is a hilarious master. Of course there was a very large part of the show. He was good not only because he is funny, but because he said some of the things that needed to say in the public forum. White people need to be reminded that the Hollywood celebrations of employment, work, and representation are WAY out of racially equal. We should not need the "black" show shows. White food, milquetoast managers and judges need to bring their heads to the sun and see that many devices were not available for "white" directors, producers, characters, etc.. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the depth of bad taste. He had no business there. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar show I have seen since the "color paint" was awarded. The loss of voting was a great concern when watching the exhibition until 2002. That is not to convince other speakers. Billy Crystal is a riot.
