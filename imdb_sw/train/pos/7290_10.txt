After several specimens very good for SUPERB, I was very happy with the film. The film was dark, moving, angry, pain, guilt and very attractive demon. I had the first prospect to see special effects, and as a caress of a partner, he beat me away from fraud and its legitimacy. Brian, I no longer be beaten away from your skills by telling your story and your special effects. You will go for a long time, my friend. I will certainly be the president of your fan club. Eric Etebari, the best actor's award, was one option number. You did Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasakula. :) In general, acting, story line, high quality efficiency and amazing effects, was amazing. I just want it a long time. I look for Dreamless and very high expectations.
