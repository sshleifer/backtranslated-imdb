I am one of those people who often look at the app and put my feelings on private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I worked on the app from the ads that made the lungs of the show. I was worried about the first, especially after the end of the Sixth Feet was still on me. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all other events. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the question of death and presented it in a way that was so interesting without having a barrier. The characters were collaborating and I love the Ned's main impossibility to touch the love of his life, Chuck without the result of his death. Most characters have their desire for things that they cannot. In addition to Ned and Chuck, Olive desires Ned. Lily and Vivian crave their nephew Chuck and Emerson always looking for cash payments from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are full and reliable images. I love how Emerson is black and playing with other characters because as an African writer; I like the cultural trick of the trick that comes from time to time. <br /> <br /> For all, this visual fairytale is one of the most important pieces of entertainment that I have seen from the 2007 season. I just want the authors to return to work, to show it can continue to turn.
