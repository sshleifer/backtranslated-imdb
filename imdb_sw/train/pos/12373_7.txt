Time has never been a virtue for this film. Once dealing with the complexity of Jeffrey Konvitz 'best seller, now this film looks like the only ordinary version of your typical spookfest. Gruesome takes aside (especially that mad, on the top finale), this is basically a terrible horror movie for those people who don't care so much for that kind. It has an incredible role in the small responsibilities (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but something tells me that producers wanted to be beaten at great cost to convince viewers that this is not your underground movie below (70s disaster producers had the same idea). I was fascinated to see the faces, but the story is deceptive, and no matter how high-school films make it, it works on your average 70s filming rate (not the worst thing, though). However, it is a fun movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. As always, the work of Albert Whitlock's fruit is better. In general, good entertainment.
