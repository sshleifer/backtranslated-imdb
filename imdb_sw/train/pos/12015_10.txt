Imagine this movie would be a typical Western movie, however, it became very interesting and spellbound keepers right up to the end, which was very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76', had an old experience with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", 93, and Zach never allowed Sam and without standing without making sure he got with him and pay again. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey, (Susan Burgade), "Woman's photo", '96, managed to get over this situation and found herself among the hungry men who were not found to remove her alone. Sam Burgade had to make the most difficult decisions and I was very surprised at the conclusion. This is a very entertaining film and acting it best.
