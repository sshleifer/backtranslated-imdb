The second aspect involves a young woman in London having a great job, and gladly accepting the position of secretary and older woman and her son. Wonders about people being held at home against them always make me a little worried - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this rather classy B-film is not lurid nor claustrophobic. It's very far from impossible, but it's not exciting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) has to hurry to his feet. Resurrection in 1986 (as "the Dead of Winter") was not wise, as the plot of the plot is not modern. "Julia Ross" is very compact (very short for 65 minutes!) But it remains undoubtedly to the point of the speed, which feels very little. *** from ****
