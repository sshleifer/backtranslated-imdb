Many readers are doing when you were on the movie and all were bad .... I think you should have some kind of person to enjoy these movies. If not a person who enjoyed Waltons or a Small House ... U will not understand nor enjoy these movies ... it would show more than the end. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff .... it's 6 years later to know that she will be interested in Girls. I want to say that I have enjoyed all four movies so far. ... It was not mad on books ... Join wait until the next movie. Clark's method gives you every time. I would like to see January Jones make the appearance ... Maybe a family union or something.
