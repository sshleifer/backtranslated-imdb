I am probably one of the greatest fans of Nancy Drew out there. I have read every book three times and played many Nancy games. I loved this movie. It made you happy all the time you looked at it. I went with my friends about 10 and everyone loved him. There were three women sitting behind us who seemed to be at the end of 30 years to 40 years and I asked them how they liked, they said they liked it! So you will see that it will be entertainment for all ages. You just need to give a chance. And it teaches the lesson too, just to be yourself even if everyone around you is right. In general, this argument was good. I will see it a second time now! Therefore, exciting stimulation please. It's a very good movie!
