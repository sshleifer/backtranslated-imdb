Leadership over me (the post-song name) is a movie that is sure to bring tears to the eye almost everyone. It was a moving story of a person (player) who lost his family in the attack of the business center of 9-11. Many years later, he runs into a former college (cheadle) student who is not even aware of the trauma after the shock caused by his family. The two restore their old friendship with Cheadle's character, Johnson, knowing that he must have the character of Sandler, Fineman, another help before the delay. This is the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It is very important to watch and after seeing it, I am a good viewer to sponsor his family more.
