This film is quite classic for camping. That's why it was Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girl's head alive in a pot of lasagna on his apartment while climbing the city and trying to look for the body by examining the chicks. Finally he gets a real body of hourglass and the head of the head-red top. The given title makes friends with a failed attempt in the closet and the hub comes out of the closet and burns the hand of a good "assistant" hand (the other one is not correct from the failure of the scientist), and everywhere it is decreasing. The movie was very scared as children who my friend did not want to go down for a year after seeing it. As children we put the scariest movies of all time and this was four numbers. Only one of these awesome movies was quite good (The "Red" text.) Its good effect because of the crappy production and weird's angle when a scientist looking at the body (full of sound and voice sounds) affects hell for innocent children, while ignorance elements make it useful for looking to talk and laugh. I was able to watch this film tonight and enjoy the time I would like to go to the Dentist than to watch "Chicago" again. Seven is more I can give, because its value of entertainment is just lucky. Movies, like movies, are a tragedy.
