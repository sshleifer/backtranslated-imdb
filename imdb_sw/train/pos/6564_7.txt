Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a delightful for Indiana Jones and other fun movies known during the eight years. Wayne Crawford star like Jake Speed, the skillful who always fights with the evil everywhere. Along with his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they want to seek a step (and some lines of good story). Duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister was taken by a rough businessman (John Hurt). What? Can she get and persuade Jake and Desmond to help her save her brother? <br /> <br /> Mystery and cheesy image that doesn't make it something that is not. I should give this recommendation. That's like you like to enjoy movies that you love to have fun and for those who don't have anything to face value. It is recommended.
