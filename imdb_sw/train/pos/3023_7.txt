This small enjoyable Black finds itself on top, with many unexpected images. Overcrowding is a complete refusal for real permits. Spanish characters in the film play with Frenchman (Boyer), Belgian (Francen), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungarian (Lorre)! And for all the far off Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite this deception, all exhibitions are very good - especially for Paxinou and Lorre. But the place that Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meets, and talking about different smells of nature, is a real hoot! And I think, see if they were alone, that they should really be speaking to Spanish in any way! It seems so good that Warner of the Jews could not find Spanish practitioners in Los Angeles! Of course Mobile has often had "any old emphasis will make" my policy - my favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who loves with Russian soldiers playing with Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Perhaps they should have Novarro for "Secretary of the secret" - he would have been good at the role of Boyer or at least in Francen (which would have been very stored in the budget of the dark birth).
