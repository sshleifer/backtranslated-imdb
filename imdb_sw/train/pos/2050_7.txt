Everyone gets bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken. In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war has gone and they go home when they see a group of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following the fight with Mad Max 3 (!) Of Thunderdome, and a brief killing later. Walken and some of the Colombian boy had donated bills to promise something or another. <br /> <br /> Cut until now (1991), and the Colombian boy leads the revolution against El Presidente. He succeeded for the first time, but after El Presidente threatened to crush people with a tank, he had to surrender and beheaded on a live TV. This is shown in full detail as an example of the news on the American phone, which causes Walken to assemble the old squad (although it was not part of this squad to start), to invade Colombia with guns under thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a stupid film of pride, but for all that is also a good laugh, and a full-loaded action too. This is one of those movies where logic is given wide - how would Walken be able to shoot the fighters in the head from the other plane without suffering from the deficit, or even breaking the window? Also, it seems that these people can shoot down drug traffickers in New York without police harassing. It is a mad mad madness here, from Michael Ironside of the diabolical act in Vietnam sequence, for the death of a hero but meaningless of one of the heroes, for the split competition between Walken and El Presidente, and we forgot the speech recommended by the rebel leader, looking at a television in America (almost bringing brown tears to my lower eye, that little) <br /> <br /> It is out there for button. Buy if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can see camera players as well.
