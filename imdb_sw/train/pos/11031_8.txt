Sly the best and out action action. It is a very enjoyable movie with other interesting characters, strong performances and the trend of Renny Harlins is a stylish point. Stallone is rarely this interesting in its practical films and certainly looks partly in terms of practical events. This was one of the best annual films and one of the most exciting and enjoyable years of the 90's, a kind of obvious kind. As a fan of Stallone this is one I look back with good memories. There are a lot of good steps and Sly in the form of a great person of action. Practice lovers enjoy this film because it has all the features that show the best aciton film. The film looks good and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
