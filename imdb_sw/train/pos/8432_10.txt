I couldn't read anything about the film before watching it, incidentally, last Saturday evening. And then, as I watched, I felt Lena and Boesman's trouble in my bones. I was so impressed with the acting and voice and photos that I listened to just part of the discussion. My husband slept only after going to bed and had no sleep, under the impact of the film. I just wanted to awaken him to say: "If I voted for the Oscar selection, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the film on the IMD, and I was sad to know that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and that he had never seen the last version of his brilliant hub. I still want to tell him that his film was a real self-film, in his conception and spirit. Actors should be praised not only by their brilliant performance but by accepting the parts without shining, without showing, on the contrary, showing the true picture of human depression. Sad but poignant.
