Maybe the greatest film ever about jazz. It is jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening image continues to undermine my reverie. Lester, of course, is wonderful and beyond this world. Jo Jones is always happy (see Jazz Sounds too). If you can, find music; available on CD. All lovers of jazz and film films should learn this great masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Are shades and light - what music is - what hat!
