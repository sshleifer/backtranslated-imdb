I love him when they are doing good story games. Many in the past have been so hokey was a shy look. Not this. It's just a real good movie, the old kind of story - and based on the real person of life to do what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He has a high school coach who speaks while trying, at the end of life talking to athletically, becoming a professional baseball player. Finally, he reached his goal of making the Premier League, even though it was very short stint. All of the characters here are good people, the type you take, from Quaid to players in his high school team, with his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a star on television.) <br /> <br /> Quaid is believed to play Jim Morris because, unlike former actors in film games, he knows to hit baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a boy who can wipe 90-plus with an hour. And, most of this film is true, as verified by a real pitcher of life in one document on DVD. So, if you're looking for a good film, you can't hurt it for this.
