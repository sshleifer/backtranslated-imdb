I was inserted by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprise. I was surprised to see that Paulie's voice was done by Jay Mohr. This function was very appropriate, and did not look at schmaltz not be too hard under New Jersey swagg, that I thought that this should be some unung old pro, not the face of Mr. Mohr's child. The most amazing function, in fact, and you enjoy seeing his talent being taken seriously in the quirky film, indie.
