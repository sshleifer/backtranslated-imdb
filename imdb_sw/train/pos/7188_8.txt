With the "King of the Rocket People", this was still repeated on BBC TV early to mid-eight. If I was taking a capsule of the time period this series would certainly come in. The person who looks at the first time will think it's silly but this is one of the best examples of "Experiments". Don Del Oro will laugh (When I had the name of his little name was Mr Dustbin head) and it was amazing about shooting when he says "Your hardness can't harm me" then he stumbles back, seems to be less happy. I also love the way that provides together with Sebastian in the first part. I looked again because I had a good memory since years ago, there are good stunts and good music, it has links you expect including water, rockfalls, run carts ... with Ralph Faulkner) swordplay was not as close as I remembered, and it shows the “flashback” section that is inevitable! It gets 8 out of 10 because it still faces a small speed, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these journals I recommend a book by William Witney, "In the Door, In Fighting, Out of the Door, In Chase" though there is only a small entry on this series in it.
