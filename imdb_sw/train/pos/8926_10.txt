I don't think anyone except Terrence Malick and perhaps Tran Anh Hung makes movies at the level of purity than Claire Denis. He said, I do not like this, his new film, like his 2001 crown "Trouble Every Day" (though it is very close), which is one of my favorite films. It is only because the story here is possible a little rounded for its own benefit. Do not do it wrong, the fact that this film is not suitable for any conspiracy is one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took over one degree more than was needed and so the film shows a flirt and misunderstanding, and a few key points of the plot should be explained in some way ( as if the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart planting, rather than just showing him suddenly without any explanation of where or why he is there). Also some of the other participants seemed to be unwanted and if they were just because Denis was using the actors who he loves again (Beatrice Dalle's behavior especially disrupts them because they are still expecting him to have some significance). However, the film is very welcome and the movies are not surprising. It is very definitely a jewel in its own way. At least good as Denis' thanked much "Beau work", if not better. Claire Denis should be my most famous director of French for this stage, better than the Carax Leos even. It also must admit that the South Korean sequence actually makes "Lost in Translation" better than the film itself does not (and I, unlike others, is a great fan of the same film).
