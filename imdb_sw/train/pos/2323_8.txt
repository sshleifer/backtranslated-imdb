"Man In The Moon" is a very good movie. It's a very touching touch and it's very good in all things. I can't say that the movie was original, but what are these days? All members who worked worked well with their responsibilities. I was very happy to see Reese Witherspoon at a very young age, and he does a very good job. Jason London is doing a good job as well. And someone else I knew was Sam Waterston, who did a wonderful job and his role. I loved a lot of Sam (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed to be a kind of dad, but eventually you love his behavior. Some of the cast were also very good. If you like to touch movies about growing and dealing with life that gives you, then you should watch this film. I would like to read the synopsis of the plot and if it looks like something that you would like to have, then go to it. However, hope you enjoy the film, thanks to reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
