Who did not want to go on a road to Peter Falk? The right eye of the guy is more characteristic than many actors today. This is a kind of interesting and touching movie that we all look like as opposed to all the bombing effects of bombastic. Women will love it for any sexual advice for men, and men will love it for spot-on-father / child research - one big area after another. And it just has enough of the edge to get the real indie to get. This is indeed a love work for Paul Reiser who understands what it is like to be a father and son, and also to have a laughter and tears when you go through life. The most fun part, though, was looking at the look of Reiser Falk. You can say it is all of his character's acceptance of his father and actress to be very happy with the special trick of Peter Falk. Really really. Let us hope that this film makes it on movies in the region around the world so that everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
