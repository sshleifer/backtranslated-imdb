I am rather surprised that there is no viewer until now has explained about losing on the basis of chess in the game Luzhin as white against an opponent who has no name before the end. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess consultant, Luzhin is shown to win the game for real estate. Among the rapidly reduced and return to the board is not hard to see that after the Luzhin mixture reached the queen's sacrifice, her do's d1 is still inserted by the black spirit on the c1 against her king at the corner at h1. So he cannot play a permanent argument of the Rd1-d8 which will be illegal - but has been shown to do so by rapturous blows from the audience.
