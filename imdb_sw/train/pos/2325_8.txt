Reese Witherspoon has Dani, a young girl of the country who falls to love with a new 17-year-old neighbor, Court, played by Jason London. The court tries to make Dan realize that the difference in their age could make a relationship of love impossible. Soon the charm of Dan's nubile begins to win over the court's will. Then comes the sister of Dan's older sister, who played with Emily Warfield, and the beginning of the problem of love / short-term jealousy. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston are around. This is pure, free; but a respiratory drama that touches the ground. Feel free to cry.
