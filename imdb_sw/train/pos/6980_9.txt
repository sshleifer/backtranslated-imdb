I must admit, I was one of the concerns before judging this festival before any information was not published on it. I decided that it would be a relief led by Ronald D. Moore with wand-wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The test stops the best feelings on the audience. Access is amazing! Of course, seasonal BSG fighters will find themselves getting into a plot, which takes into account the development of the Cylons before the First War. (58 years prior to BSG experimental events). The test also allows visitors, showing clearly the plot and its ideas in the first part of the section. Do not miss: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are shown by the brain, the brain, which has exciting, controversial and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Manufacture is BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are very amazing. Morales's exhibition of Joseph Adama, led by Olmos' to William's show, gives a good story of William's bold father. Stoltz's Dr Graystone exhibition causes many ideas and questions. If the quality of the experiments is any sign of what will happen, RDM and the creative team are set to continue with the BSG's first legacy.
