'Stanley and Iris' are a heartwarming film about two people who find each other and help each other to overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he has not learned to read or write. Iris is a widow with two young children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. He decides to teach Stanley how to read his home at his spare time. After a while they are involved in sex. After Stanley learned to read, he goes to work in Chicago, just returning to Iris and asking him to marry. <br /> <br /> It is a very good film without fraud, abuse, or dirt, that is common in today's films. Good film round. <br /> <br />
