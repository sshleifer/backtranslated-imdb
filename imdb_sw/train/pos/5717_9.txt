Omigosh, this is the worst movie that I've ever got. Saying that I love horrible movies is being low, and I have seen a painful (based on limited access to New Zealand, that's very much), but never have had to sleep with light ... until I saw Anger. Others might say it is a gonga sharp (all according to Japanese movie movies), all of the same lines (still different) of stories, but Grudge considers it to be awesome movie - seeing the clock on the movie , I even cried for some stage on the film. It is good, especially from supportive characters - KaDee Strickland is amazing and stealing the show, she is a passionate person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is happy. However, when I am usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she doesn't appear in this film. Among the helpers, she may find a deep and back story, but it doesn't look like she is there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she sits almost the same with all her films and her roles aren't she? The ghosts were frightening, music and sound effects were full (especially the noise made when KaDee Strickland's behavior responded to the phone in his house), the end was too cool. It was highly recommended. 9/10
