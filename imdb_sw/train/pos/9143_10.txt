It seemed like in 1984 it was nothing but Orwellian's dream was counted as George Orwell's science novel !! 1984 was one of the most exciting times in American history! The shortage in the economy, and the renewal of the American ethical values, cultivated an ethical lack of values ​​that were observed by the American people with very good behavior! There have been many exhibitions of ancient movies in the past, but, nature is almost completely considered to be better !! "Rain Purple" is a similar movie in this category! Made in 1984, "Rain Purple" gave the doggerel of eight years, the fun-go-lucky music, who brought in to make this film better! Some of the remains of the eight-year sign are true! Screwball tips, finished neon clothes, and of course, music! Thirty years of music is taken by experts to be the best decade of music in American history! Setting Minneapolis, "Red Rain" has served the use of ridiculous entertainment and city change. When I was a little child, I lived in Minneapolis for eight months, at that time, the white number was less than 3% !! In 1984, African Americans had done some of the roads in Minneapolis, and so, they developed a culture introduced by themselves! The movie "Rain Purple" promotes clothing styles of eight years, and music together, which did not attract the film audience! I loved music and "Rain Purple", and, the new technique of this film takes the success of the competition, in fact, it's brilliant !! Check out this movie if you haven't seen it already! Prince became an icon of eight years with this masterpiece! For a while, he wrote Kim Bassinger, he must be doing the right thing !! "Rain Rain" set Prince on the map !! This film gets my decision to insist THUMBS UP!
