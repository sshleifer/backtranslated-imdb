I was able to get two nights nights planned before "Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004), and see both films on the column, without getting a chance to get my breath between or reflecting on The meaning of each film is different. After sleeping over, I must say that I have largely preferred the old on the end, and I will explain why. Before Sunrise begins us with small actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), just 25 during the release of the film; and Julie Delpy (Triors Triors Three), then 26 (though looking very limited). She is a proud American writer, visiting Europe after breaking with her lover; He is a young French student, at his home in Paris. They meet on the trains of Budapest-Vienna and voluntarily decide to leave the train together. Two spiritual and intellectual people spend the whole night together walking on the beautiful streets of Vienna, sharing ideas and ideas and gradually decreasing on love. The movie has 1990s written everywhere: back, technology was flying fast, new millennium and all hopes and dreams were waiting around the corner, and young adults like those shown on the film were full of life and passion. for the future. Jesse's (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) characters, with all their faults and disparities (Celine's emphasis, if wrong or intentionally, was half of French French, and it turned out from one scope to another, breaking character honesty), they were glass of time. Watching the ignorant couple swallow life with meaning and excitement like that, to make all the clich√©d and romantic but still manage to have their audience fall in too, what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director will not let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not all of the best time. The whole thing, Sunrise is a dream trip through Vienna's town, a spring describing a romantic romantic session, and the film will come back for more insight into the next time.
