1.) This movie was amazing! I watched it while I was in the city near where she grew up! I went and saw the buildings where the story was held. In general, I loved this movie, better than Jake Gyllenhaal !! Also - my favorite places were science, and always with his father. They were very sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to care for one way or another. The label line is true. "Sometimes Dream One is bright enough to shine the atmosphere." 2.) The way the film was hit was inappropriate, it was all reliable that it would be recorded during the 1950s. Of course recommend this film!
