There is a certain perspective that I have always found in the unknown (semi-unknown) film. This innovation has become almost a popular film - in my experience, sci-fi unknown, action and unknown fear for a very good reason, very good. I have seen "High Tide" on a video in a junk shop, mixed in the middle of a variety of different quality tapes. Of course, this is the only place I will find, since it is still not on the DVD. When I was watching Judy Davis (like Lillie) at all of this film, I was certain she was looking at an unknown performance. Yes, I had seen Davis in a small part - with a single role of star in "A Passage to India". But, although he was good at the film mentioned earlier, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since we recently watched Gillian Armstrong's film, "Charlotte Gray", I had a great understanding of the type of actor that impresses him. Davis draws more of the similarity to Cate Blanchett - in both ways and transparency. Judy Davis' performance is amazing, I can't say good things about it. She shares an amazing relationship on the screens and young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), another popular actress. There are many drama and humanitarian interaction, the details that I will not try to show here (see for yourself!). There is very good in the "Top Rock" to achieve one inspection. In fact, I would like to care - the film speaks well for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise the author of the photo Laura Jones for his amazing conversation, Gillian Armstrong director for his understanding of the actors, and Russell's great Boyd for his talent, photographed movies (Please check his work in "Tender Feedback". ).
