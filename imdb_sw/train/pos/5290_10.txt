Going to something far away with many deliberate things that make it common, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this world famous / artistic experience. Edward Furlong has a title character, a young man working in Baltimore who likes to photograph. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) sees her work, she gives her a great break, which she accepts. But once he blows it big, he should consider everything. Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once a celebrity. The kind of thing we can expect, of course, but for Water to guide, there are always a few things to accuse us (you will know when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also star Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
