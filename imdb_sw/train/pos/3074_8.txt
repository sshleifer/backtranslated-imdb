I recently got this small gem film on the cable. I took a surprise, even though, I had to expect it from the team involved with this film. Henry Bromwell directed this film to the point, and shows. One always wondered about the secret life of murderers. One is not good to go too far to realize maybe it is the person's neighbors, or social friends, or even friends; they are not different from us, at least on the face. In this story, grandfather, is a disrespectful character who does not know in removing anyone at a good price. He has no sense in teaching a string to his own son, and even to grandson! Alex, is a person who lives in trouble. He knows what he did in the past and suddenly comes to realize the consequences of his actions. He should see someone to help him find peace with himself. By going to Parks, he tries to get absolution, though, is not available there. On the contrary, there is a big problem when Alex learns about who should kill the next. Alex, clearly exposed to William H. Macy, informs us. Not only is an amazing actor, but he makes us believe that he is the person. One of the best things in the film is the late John Ritter. He is the same influence as Dr Parks, the man who defines the mystery. Donald Sutherland, as his grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell was surprised at Sarah's primary role. He displays the potential and scope that is wonderful. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the wife of suffering, and can not do much. Also Barbara Bain, for a rare appearance, is a grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, is happy in the film. He shows maturity over his years. <br /> <br />
