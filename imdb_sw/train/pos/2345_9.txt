I was very excited about the first place and I'm more ready. The slightest on the front of the crime (it is almost after considering and not too much emphasis or cancellation) but thought the horn of romance was very strange. You will look again for sure! I hope that they will have a great responsibility for the aunt who are wonderful actors and were using this time around. Migiza who plays assistant / hostess (also from Bewitched I think) is very sweet and bubbly and comes out as nicely dorky and sweet rather dumb and annoying which is very good. Check out.
