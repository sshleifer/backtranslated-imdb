Once in a time in the wonderful world of fear, diamonds are crafted, and one becomes quite impressed with its great transparency. This is not under the diamond! This is a violent, horrible film, and a dark state, and I think it's safe to say, one of my awesome films of all time! And in fact it has probably one more, flat out scary sequence in all history of fear! Every time I see the film, and it comes to a point where you know without occurring, I try to remember especially when I am scared of my success, but it will never happen; I've never found it right, and I find myself as scared as the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, in order to be afraid of a fan of jaded fear like that, that's not short of perfect perfection. Unlike Americans, Brits are aware of their deceit, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need special effects to convey the environment, rely on the power of strong, powerful stories (in this case) of opinion and expectation. Each element is to consider, from pieces, acting, stories, to horrible situations. Pauline Moran would surely make the devil beat, indeed !! If the end of the end, if for some reason the dement does not like this piece of sex, then you honestly does not know what fear is over, and certainly not worth knowing. Thank you!
