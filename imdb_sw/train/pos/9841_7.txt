I love cartoons. They can show what films and actors 'real' and environment cannot - though computer effects are becoming more and more. They can push the satire ('The Simpsons'), a good taste ('South Park'), a 'Aladdin', or a 'Toy Story'. There are some good examples of this in the 'Ice Age', such as when we see a group of current animals that have moved around the country, speaking as old friends. These events are fun to enjoy, when we get a natural and wonderful feeling at the same time, usually through a way that makes us laugh. Although the Ice Age is not as good as high-time movies, it's a very fun film. Sit back, enjoy the delicacies, delicately, good nature and stomach-laugh. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred of grumpy mammoth, Sid, idiotic sloth, and Diego, tiger sabretooth, as they take a human baby to return to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, usually, they have many problems. It also climbs on the trip is a scrat, a mice of unhappy history, who strives very hard to bury the acorn for winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in the caves of ice. Its opening part is classic. <br /> <br /> It is a simple and last story predictable and middle which is just a series of funny events and when some character builds cast, but some events, such as nappy change or dodos, are hilarious , animals seem to look good. There is one time very touching, when the painting of the mammoth caves come before Manfred's eyes. You don't have to see, but it's good for an enjoyable hour or so. <br /> <br>> 7/10
