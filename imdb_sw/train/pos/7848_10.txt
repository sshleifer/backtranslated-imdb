This is one of the best animation movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just an enjoyable movie, or a well-made movie. This is a color animation animation and even if it wasn't, only technical skills that you went to do, you will give it a chance in the animation history. Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of bugs. He considered the world of insects, jobs, houses, nightclubs, cinemas, even small things like posters and bicycles and painting. <br /> <br /> In this film tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has a relationship with the dragonfly's play, very with the pig's anger; but he is a camera and decides to blow the fling. Mr. Beetle returns home and sees Mrs. Beetle having her own thing. Mr. Beetle dismisses his partner but forgives his wife. Two make and go out on the movie. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. It is described so it seems to ban, but once seen it becomes an interesting work of movies. With Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz hid everything that the future creatures will use in their work. For this reason it is not appropriate to forget.
