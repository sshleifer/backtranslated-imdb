I am a man, not given women's movies, but this is a very special story. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a person but does hell one of the best works, while DeNiro is its normal self-reliance. Everything is done well: act, lead, pictures, settings, photography, beat. If you can enjoy the story of real people and true love - this is the winner.
