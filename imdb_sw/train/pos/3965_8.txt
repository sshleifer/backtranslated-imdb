Film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is the best as Hard Hard Chip, and mounted co-star returns with Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, led by the legendary director Mervyn Leroy, had a daily view and the script's approval with every film feature, under the clothes, was protected by controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that Ed Edgar Hoover had nothing to boast about. His office management from 1924 until his death appeared on the world's best research services. But in 1959 Hoover was ready to begin to worry about the arrest and already began to collect dossiers for powerful people to ensure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to ensure that no motion picture showed even a single string on the office. Film shows only the progresses and coverings on failure, and part of the office in the hunt of early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with a strong language in the cheek.
