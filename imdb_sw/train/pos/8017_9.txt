Steve Whittemire as Rizzo rats and others. <br /> <br /> Another Muppet flick. At this time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, Electric violence, Gonzo and Camilla chicken will not come out of university and play in music who are trying to get to Broadway. After failing to get it, they all divide and go their different ways. I love characters and cameos. The songs on the film are "together again", "See Me, here I", "say Goodbye", "and I love you", "jazz mouse" and "will make me happy". Frank Oz is leading this film effectively and all actors are doing a good job to do if Muppets are real. Look! 91. Minutes tested.
