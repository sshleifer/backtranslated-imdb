Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan woman and I personally saw a lesson in history. Spain goes in the direction of political struggle again. That is why this work should be displayed in all Spanish High Schools. It is a great lesson in the secret crime of fascism. The US trial that participates in the Spanish civil war selects the democratically elected Democratic Republic of the Republic. The religious responsibility of the religion is well-known in one of the events in which Uribe has ever performed. Color is very beautiful. Violence of war (is there anyone can tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) It is used as a hopeful situation when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The fear that begins with the abuse of power even innocent children is now working again. 'El viaje de Carol' / '' Carol '' says one of the most sad stories of the 20th century. Again a great job from Iberica Peninsula!
