Once again confirming his amazing competition, John Turturro has the first Russian chess player who prepares for a return tournament, establishing an impossible relationship with his fellow gadabout prostitute (Emily Watson) in the Italian hotel of 1920. They fall in love, and The fear of his social-mountain mother (Geraldine James). Wonderful story of wonder, which gloss of chess can make it appear brain. But despite its nature in the story of Nabakov, certainly not. The romantic aspects and the meaning of time and place beat the psychological analysis underneath. John Turturro, after appearing in "Barton Fink", "O Brother, Where Are You?" "Big Lebowski" proves that he has no dependence on the filming of Coen Bros to approve his status.
