True Star Wars (the film I saw at least fifty times) all the other in the special effects, but this film has everything! <br /> <br /> It has fear (non-model), romance, robots, wonderful welfare, mind, (amazing well) special effects, and sports game. I saw this film a few years ago in the revival and new presses, and I wondered how well it was held to this day. I thought that 40-year-old electrical equipment was looking for a hokey, but somehow looked at modern and modern conditions. Ann Francis here (more) short skirts and cracked legs that are hard to blow while still getting up. The Krell leader appears in the ray beams still trying to bejebees out of me. In fact we all know that "The Great Birds of Galaxy" describes a lot of "Star Trek" from this film. <br /> <br /> No one has beaten Robby, Robot, for the issue of <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). which all the Science of Interesting Science will be required to measure! It is mentioned with respect to the haunting light mark which took us all into pins and needles.
