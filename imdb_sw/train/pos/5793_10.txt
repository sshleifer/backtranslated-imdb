Moonwalker and Michael Jackson are a real film of adventure for the whole family! Before the real story of the movie starts, we get the performance of the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and begins a great movie. Thereafter we get a collage of Michael carrier, as it was until Moonwalker came out of 1988. After a few Music Videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story begins. The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are driven by a bad man of the story "Mr. Big", because they discovered his evil plans to get children around the world lost drugs. During the track we see amazing groups, fx. Video Michaels for the Criminal Smooth, which is quite strange to its dance style, etc. But one of the children get kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael haft to save him before getting addicted drugs. At the time of the film we see a special impact not only surprising to those days, but also wonderful today. For example, see Michael turning on a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's cool! <br /> <br /> Movie approaching and functioning Coming Together (later published in Michaels twice the HIStory album), and leaves the film with a sense of magic. Amazing! I recommend this to every family who wants to spend a good night with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is a man of injustice!" Certainly, he is true, but, coming, we all know it is not true! Wait to see.
