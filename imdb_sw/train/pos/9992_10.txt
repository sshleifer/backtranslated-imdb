... this is a classic conversation with a very many exhibitions no one should miss. Good story, good-rich-of-rags, Mel Brooks is not causing bad, maybe not perfect but he is funny; D Don't listen to rating, it's BS. See, then look at something like the last destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves about the same rating. If you do that, I don't think we can be friends XD At this point I recommend the fourth season of your "Curb passion" to every Brooks fan. Do I make 10 lines here to send feedback? I don't want to write a book here: P
