First, if you are looking to look at this, make sure you look at the UNCUT version (though it is amazing to go back and then look at the incidents of controls), it makes a big difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has since been 14 years forced to commit adultery with her own father. When his father suddenly passes by, he can go into the world alone. After reading about the philosophy of Nietzsche on life, she uses her sexuality to use men to give her what she wants and to leave them in the traps and despair of her love. In the movie it becomes increasingly having physical objects and characters and listeners start to wonder if she has any feeling of absolute values. In general, the baby's face is the most amazing movie and the worst sexual events that most people did not expect to see in the black and white film. While no sex acts are shown on the screen, it is very obvious what happens on the camera. I enjoyed watching this film very much and I believe many modern audiences will have some pleasure if, especially with the awesome movie value. I thought when I watched that the sounding seemed to be slow to part, but I think that about many movies you first see them. Actually, I think that almost all the movies I have seen made from the early 30 years had little pacing problems or some parts were not "completely". Maybe only the trick of the film decision was not yet perfect yet? it will take a few years. Compare films from 1939 and compare it to the early 30 film and I think you'll see what I'm saying. Once again, I am very happy I was able to look at the natural cut; in fact makes a big difference. Also any fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in this film before being popular in the role of uncharacteristic.
