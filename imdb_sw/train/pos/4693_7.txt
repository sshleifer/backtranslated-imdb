Johnny Dangerously falls completely in hit or miss the community and is overglown gags with a complete lack of full script or story that makes ALL sense. But that's true, right? <br /> <br /> Posted; Michael Keaton's best practices before pretending to be as long as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But the location of the area is Richard Dimitri (whistling the word "Iceholes" in the history of the film) as a group runner who loses good time to kill English language. I have many memories of childhood and this film, if I have looked so often so maybe I'm already more excited than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least the innocent gangster film that even relays some meaningful messages on the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <7 out of 10.
