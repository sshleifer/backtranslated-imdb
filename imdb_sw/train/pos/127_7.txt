Zentropa has a lot like the Third Person, another film filmed between the European crisis after the war. Like TTM, there is a lot of work on camera. There is a blameless American who is concerned with the emotion and a misunderstanding woman, and who is the most fascinating in the community. But I would like to say that the Third Person has the most effective story. Zentropa is a little concerned about this way. Perhaps this is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / dream, and making it also involved could damage the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad - "black" in more than one sense; The man never sees the sunshine. It is bad, but it is interesting, and it is scared.
