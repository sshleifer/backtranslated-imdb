New York, when a shy and lonely manager of the design project Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the highway, asks him to date and eat with him. Jenny immediately likes for her, they are having sex and she defines her true identity to her, saying that she is a hero of G-Girl. After meeting with a colleague and his friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), Jenny needed to be jealous, control and cheat, and Matt follows the advice of her best friend Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson) and throwing her, breaking her heart. Jenny returns to the life of Matt in hell, when she has a partner with Hannah. However, G-Girl's greatest enemy and Jenny high school partner, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), suggests Matt to persuade Jenny to draw her strength. My Super Ex-Girlfriend is fun silly and funny. This romantic romantic love has a lot of hilarious time and is very entertaining. Luke Wilson is good in the role of idiot, Anna Farris is very sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great in the role of superhero neurotic superhero that remembers Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in "Playing Misty With Me". My vote is seven. Headline (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
