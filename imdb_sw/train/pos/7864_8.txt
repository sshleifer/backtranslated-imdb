This is another tell-if-is-Madhur Bhandarkar film. I do not know why she has this problem of showing children of the finger *** ion and g * y for Indian film listeners, but I see some of these real events! What's new? It is a good piece put together with Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of the entertainment writer played by the leading woman in the famous film, Mr & Bibi Iyer. What makes this film different, that also addresses the stories of people that the author is interacting with or are friends, such as roomies, colleagues, film stars, models, rich people and others listed on the # 3 magazine. It seems: It's another good performance from Mrs Iyer. It is possible to be considered for this role. She does the chores to choose but shines in them. She is definitely neglected and not good in this film. But, recreational journalists are not supposed to exceed the people they need, right? Decision: The pastor has come with another beautiful film, which brings social issues to the very best. However, this film loses focus and one does not know what the director tries to convey. <br /> <br /> What! Trying to show us glitz and delightful for rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of the author of the entertainment and the life of the criminal journalist? What? Trying to tell us how the government and the rich manage the media? or she tries to highlight the issues of child abuse and g * y. Other concepts produced include an unwritten rule that young women sleep with directors or co-stars, if they want to enter a voice. Additionally, he talks about how the aircraft helpers are sick and tired of their work over time and breaks down with strict action by marrying many older people, etc.. He also talks about unhappy women and children who have been destroyed in rich families. It was similar to me .. but it could be very difficult for a regular-movie goer, who just wants to reduce the daily work problems
