This 1953 movie of Sam Fuller has some of his best work, and his sadness that he cannot continue to get the help of a great Hollywood studio to do his things. The story line goes something like this. The tough street complex (read the pastor) travels on a single hot summer day, and gets his pocketbook picked up by Skip McCoy. What Luke (and dame) don't realize is that he also carries a certain microfilm adoption of commie spies. This opening is beaten without discussion, and especially in almost close-ups is beaut, one of the many that Fuller uses in all movies. Playing a child known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was not better or better looking. One remembers how good he was, and is concerned about this role. Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had made his mark, and put his style with the Kiss of Death of 1947 as a basketball season with an amazing cake, and though he is a "little" here, he still fears. These very difficult characters have soft spots here and there, but they have a very bad way. The performance of the standout is Thelma Ritter's wonderful, who plays Moe stoolie saving her meal to pay her own funeral. Ritter got a good reputation for Oscar nomination for his performance, but he lost the performance of borna but the famous Donna Reed as a girl B (read the pastor) in "From Here Forever." Hollywood likes when a beautiful girl goes bad, and likes Oscar even though their performance is very common. See for example Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry." Put among the docks and dives of New York City, with black and white photography photographs by Joe MacDonald's great, with a very good artistic guide. The cold war and the red fear, the villian of the piece is usually looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is more dangerous than pickpocket who is criminals but it's just trying to make life and above all is a faithful US.
