Surprisingly, the worst, the worst of red acts, about the caregiver who decided to get (and destroy!), The killers of the girl should protect. This film is close to an anthronism in today's political proper environment. Director Scott does not have any desire to apologize for the infamous nature of the background behind a great film. Scott does not know or care about 30 years of social development. Surely I don't think we will see a more violent movie anytime soon, so go well and see this when you can. In spite of his emotional pain, I think the movie is a good example of the movie in the worst, most effective, and efficient way. Scott has something hard to sell, but I think I am a buyer. The wonderful technical issues of this film are very good for me to ignore. The selection of Scott's instructions is just amazing, and makes good performance from Denzel Washington. Deep hearts are needed to stay away from this, but I suggested to the audience that they are looking for a great, full movie.
