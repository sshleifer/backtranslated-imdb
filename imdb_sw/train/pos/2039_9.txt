First, I would like to explain that people who have criticized this film have made serious mistakes. Anything that has less than 6/10 marks is clear that it is not meaningful. <br /> <br /> Creep is a very amazing film with the effects of amazing film. The actors are widely believed, the ideas of the story argument and the fear and the content of the model are very broken. <br /> <br /> There are many mystique in this film. Many questions arise when viewers are exposed to a strange and tribal creature that makes the environment in dark tones of dark mice. What? 'Craig' was created and what happened? Fantastic film with a very great reason. Films with many non-responsive films and films that need to be counted with others like 28 days later, Bunker, Dogs and Deathwatch. Expect more of these amazing films!
