I looked for the king of Simba many times that all my friends put them. Have a baby sister .. you know how it is. I was now attached to the compound and lines. After the Lion King 2 came out I was as well well let me see ... the second was very weak ... then I saw an announcement for the lion king 1 and 1/2 ... I was right there when we went again. After looking 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (repeatedly) were broken. A good and original mark lets you keep your seat for a long time. I found that the cartoon was full of so much time that ROFlmao will be used here 100%. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend seeing the cartoon.
