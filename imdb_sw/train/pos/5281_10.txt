this is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it's a good movie road. puts its two characters gently and easily. The audience will learn the basic tension quickly, which is a tax for the director. there is a young French child (and English) who wants to do well in France, has a French and alcohol lover, as young people do. And there is a Ukrainian father (and French) who follows his Islamic faith faithfully, with the kindness and wisdom of the elderly and who rejects the new culture around them (like mobile phones). The film can explore the most powerful politics - a wonderful couple do not drive Yugoslavia of old, and Turkey and then in the Middle East to Makka. these are places where Islamic people are involved in war, oppression, ethnic cleansing; where militants have followed torture and summary killings to hold the power and where religious communities are in a constant death war. but the film goes to those areas and the possibilities with just such agenda tips. The relationship between the two is the key to this film, and the belief, politics is behind. it seems to be that we are all human beings, and we need to understand and care for each other so that we can manage well in this world. it is certainly not 'natural killers' and is better for it.
