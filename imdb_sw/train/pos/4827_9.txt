And that is why historical / biography is very important to all of us, as well as when they have done well, like this! Before you see "Victoria Young", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but at the end I got more knowledge about it. Emily Blunt is just as big as Victoria (Who would think that!) and maybe she will get a selection in this Oscar years. For my soul, I am glad for her ... , The beauty of a regular costume! One way is that I want to see more and know more about the queen attracts, but especially, the woman and the wonderful mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
