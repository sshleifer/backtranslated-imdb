I am a great buff of the film, but I'm getting into silent movies. Most silence documents do not end, but Show People is a great discrimination. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are just amazing in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows different things as she likes from the little giggly town to the star who takes herself very seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast film planned with a wonderful list of cameos and some of the great stars of the silent era. The movie practiced my thoughts once and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that it is not good for many minds, but that is what happened.) Vendors are skilled in their tricks that the dialogue cards are important. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent movies. It is a fast, fascinating film with two-star silence. Add to the Hollywood satire and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all kinds of ordinary movies.
