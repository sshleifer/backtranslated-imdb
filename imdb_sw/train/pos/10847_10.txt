I am 60 years old, guitar, (leadership / rhythm), and more than forty years ago, I've been in four bands, it's all there, struggle, evil, decaying food, worse accommodation, always traveling, little or no money, and everyone was over or over. But, clubs, fans, and music, they did so to be worth it! Just like a wonderful fruit! I am too old for now, and arthritis in the hands and hips means that there is no rocking again, but for the length of the video, it all came back, and it was all there! Birds, heroes, and booze! And I was a boy again! It's like the voice of Billy Connolly over, God loves 70 things! Rock On Forever!
