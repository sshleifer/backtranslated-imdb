I've found this movie available to distribute on Netflix and I think I'd try it. The plan revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen after their father has passed. Ryan and Theo first say about who did what. But later, Theo finds that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of the last disease. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time playing their differences. <br /> <br /> This is a very fantastic film. I just saw Colm Feore in the 7th season of 24 but was a wonderful thing in this. David Cubitt, an actor I had never heard before he did a wonderful job. I would like to recommend this to those who are interested in Gay and Lesbian types. This is one movie you don't want. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 stars out of 10 films.
