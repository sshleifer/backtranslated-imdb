I was a child .. things about Michael Jackson. His music, his play. He was the head of all times. A few days ago my friend gave me now .. "Moonwalker" DVD. I can just believe! So I took my time and saw the film again. After many years, and again I ran again. I almost cried. Not because Michael Jackson but in ancient times I remembered back than when I went to his concerts, enjoy music and play. The movie gave me another view than back when I was a child. In fact you can see the discovery that Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson returns to me in these great times, for your great music and play. It is a shame that people have forgotten you. I was not because you gave me a good time and your music.
