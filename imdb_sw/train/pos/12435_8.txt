I was glad to see that she had black hair! I have been a fan for 30 years now and I have been disappointed in two preliminary films. I was happy that the screen authors changed the time of entering the computer, t totally spoiled. In fact I watched the film twice a day, a sure sign that it was on the level. This is what makes the books I like also. I thought all the characters were shown well and represented the early days of Blaise's well-being and were removed from the book of all the comic and artwork. I would also like to compete with the comments made by the previous consultant about baddies to be bad. What? Really read books? <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very good film and expects to imitate it in anticipation.
