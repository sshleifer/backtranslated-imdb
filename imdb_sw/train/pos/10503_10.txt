When I got my N64 when I was five or six, I liked it very much, and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved IT! Photos were good for a while, good plot, good courses and all over, the best music I heard in Nintendo game. I don't remember the plot completely, but I think Princess Peach was arrested by Bowser, and Mario needs to save him. The game is getting 120 stars from the curse in the castle. For everything it had five or six challenges to get a star.There are hidden parts of the castle, where you can find more stars. * I think there are three levels of hitting Bowser in * Start with characters. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi were in the game towards the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there is a group of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are very large. Next, how about People say Gameplay is more important then graphics, and I agree completely. But with a good plot, there is a great graphic. Especially at that time. and their graphics are not comparable to the color of Super Mario.Bright, serious effects and amazing effects of the sound. Now, music. This is my favorite part of the game. Join, when I played this a little while, I'd like to leave the game all night so that music can sleep. There is also some great, especially in, once again, worlds and Bowser, who are sharing with me more and are my favorite. This game was my favorite time of the old gamer, and I love it. For this game you get 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) NZE GAME !
