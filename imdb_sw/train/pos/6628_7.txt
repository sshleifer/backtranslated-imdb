I have seen this film in pre-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco. I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from now, I waited to see the final result. I have never been disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3D movie with black and white color. It seems clear to other comic books, such as from Miller. In this optic, it goes one step further than the best "Sin City" from R. Rodriguez. At this time, (near) no gray or any medium color, but the graphic style has never seen it in the original animation film. (Can't wait a dark scanner) <br /> <br /> The Great Use of Motion offers a lot of life and loyalty to the characters and we forget soon the technical aspect to focus on more classic things, like the direction or plot. The trend remains prudent and controlled despite the medium-term possibilities, and that is a very good surprise. <br /> <br /> Future stories (Paris 2053) makes a modern movie of fiction and maintain a viewer until the end. With a basic basic plot (further observation with the previous prospects) the atmosphere and certain interesting landscapes (genetics, full power of certain companies ...) provides this film with great interest. <br /> <br /> is an animation film, this is definitely not made for children. You can't get here any funny pet or any stupid family values, just a cold fact. It's very close to a good film film. I have seen that the environment is one of the best features of the film: we still hear Paris known, but it's morphed for a good touch of Futurism. However, I feel a little wrong. Montage is sometimes a little flat, one or two effects of slow motion and some poor conversation. Although technical is the best, it shows its boundaries in the circle of will (as little as "fantasy of the last" made). These small things make 7/10. Overall, it is a successful artistic challenge that you should check if you can. Director, Christian Volckman, knows how to fall into the traps (incidentally, they did not ask John Woo to work!) <br /> <br /> To conclude, it is a film with statues, mental stories and an amazing art of art. See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for spelling mistakes.
