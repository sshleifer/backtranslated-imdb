The biggest problem is where to start if this film requires a two-hour alert and do not waste a few minutes to get a coke if there is a risk that you can't follow. But good is also a pause button. Bruce Willis should go into the timemachine to see some antivirus for the virus that made the animals dominate the world in 1996. Because of some mistakes he ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how to lose it all could look like , Terry Gilliam comes with what should be one of the most intelligent texts ever. The former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how the SF-story stories should be told if and his choice of casting could not be better, there is Brad Pitt in the afternoon (his performance in the park does not remember) and Bruce's good Willis who confirms he is more than Schwarzenegger they want to be. It's a movie you can watch as often as the script is very strange and complicated (and still you can follow) that all comments gives you another surprise. One of my many favorites.
