This action really was and I jumped out of my seat in anticipation of what actors were going to do! Acting was better, Farrah had to get Oscar for this was fabulous. James Russo was good I hated him he was a villain and played it strange. There are not many movies that like me like this. The cast was good Alfie was shocked by the great eyes of Farrah looking as a victim and living again as he passed through. Farrah made you feel like you were there and heard the same anger that you wanted to use, but you also knew it was a bad thing to do. The movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene.
