The first film had little desire so nothing put it on the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with the charm of zero. Once accepted that Bill & Ted is nitwits, jokes may get hammer for a long audience before breaking. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is just your warning warners ... <br /> <br /> For today's standards, this is more fun. This prevented the release, sadly considering that more talent is more involved than at first. We get a 'Face / Off' photographer, a 'Provider' editor, a producer of production from the early Burton work, and a 'Matrix' voice player. Writers made their own depth to leave first and something deep. Since this was prevented by the fanbase and the public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. It's not, fits appliances. If 'Death belongs to Him' and 'Catch-22', this wishes to be smart, but we love our movies "easy" so we don't choose. Probably since this has separated itself as to why it took 12 manufacturers to remove it. What is good? <br /> <br /> - Dial up to Keanu; from the air of air to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> - Joss hates his creation as he hates his friends, does his own hate. B & T bad and "good supply of robot" you have the same vocabulary with their origin: small text and language fluctuations. <br /> <br /> - "Model" of motif. No other place seems more than in voting styles, many lower and lower votes. They use Roy Brocksmith from 'Total Note' to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - "choice" motif. I don't know where this started with (what 'Ghostbusters'), but it is used well here. Even causes 7 games against death - War and Club. Think about yourself, even now in the game against Death (clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. See the Prime Minister's magazine last: "Bill and Ted: Movie." It is also amazing how Death and Nomolos were criminals in the 'Die Hard' column and 'Lethal Weapon' <br /> <br /> I still have small nits, but nothing compared to nature. Music and film are different mediums so it is not recommended why many scripts surround the past - especially in the youth market. Carlin is a good player, but in these movies are lost. Also, for all struggling this effort shows, even concealing the joke of gay, can not kill the cat? So, despite looking like Nikkelodeon production, this is very interesting. From this film we got Beavis and the head of the head. "We're in Heaven and we were holding three people." <br /> <br /> Update Analysis = = Time Material
