There was a time when this film seemed to be more difficult than it was needed, but I think it's a part of the charm. Detective Philo Vance's observation appears to be the largest eastern eastern era with the final evaluation of how the killings were made. The drop of pigs into the Chinese vase was kicker to me; I mean, had no one just left it? Vance (William Powell) had earlier in the film about 'impossible psychology' of Archer Coe suicide - I had to think about it for a while. I was left wondering if there was a scientific basis for that concept to be true, without learning the psychology itself. It seems logical, but then there is always a case that is not recommended law. <br /> <br /> You know, I've got a kick out of a furious coroner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek's. McCoy several times said "I am a doctor, not a witch" and "I am a doctor, not a detective". I can see DeForrest Kelley watching the film and saying himself - 'I'll need to use it at that time'. Once the identity of the killer is revealed, it does not seem like a great surprise, but until then it's a guess of anyone. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film did not answer the central question made by the head, and the massacre I was very interested - who killed the dog of Sir Thomas MacDonald's Ghillie?
