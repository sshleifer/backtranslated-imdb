The death of death gives you the loss of every turn, each turn one, in fact the biggest problem is that there are so many twist that you never get oriented in the film, and often does not mean anything, though they usually find you with surprise. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has many changes. Screenplay is very good and good conversation with the characters, but you can't get all the progress because of losing. Exactly for Caine is amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The effects of seeing are fair, but more of these are the most in play and are fake. Trying many ways, but it still works and is worth looking.
