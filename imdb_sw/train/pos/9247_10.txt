I expected this film to be the end of 1930. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy succeedes his last. It was not quite so. Clark Gable has Eddie's player and all his charisma and bad grasses. He hides from the fighters when he climbs into the floor of Ruby (Jean Harlow), to see him wrapped in bubbles in the bathroom, not down. Acute Chemistry. She struggles to find time, but the girl can only resist that grin for a long time. The warmth among them is obvious, and there are some scenes that are obvious before the production code! When the hard work goes bad and Ruby ends up in the boarding house for "uncomfortable girls", she is sad and, because of putting the woman who gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will not come to her. Harlow plays hard, quickly talking Ruby fully. Can never allow Gable to get all the good lines! There is a particularly exciting place to play "their song" on the piano that takes place perfectly. Fifteen minutes of time are running every time. Romance really good.
