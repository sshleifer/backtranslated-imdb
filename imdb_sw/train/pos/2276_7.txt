If you have read Mother's mother and you are very happy (as I did) that you should see only the movie, understand that you should understand the basic element of writing to Vonngut - that more of her story is Vonnegut herself, and that you can't put the human mind on the screen. His wind and humor can not only be written with screens or even better performance. I believe that this film is growing in asking the key questions that Vonnegut finds in his book, but that the regular satire time available on the page is not available on the screen. What? Does this mean that the movie loses the mark? Of course no. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to retrieve the reading of the book (this is not among those very lazy turning pages). It succeeds because it takes the basic elements of a story made by one of the true artistic treasures of America and puts it into the system without pretending. I have seen other versions of the Vonnegut film books where the director tries to create Vonnegut's mind and lose his own trick. I can't put this film as one of the best I have seen, but it stands on its feet as a good person to watch. By taking the “voice” of Vonnegut out of the movie details or trying to insert it however can, Mama Night tells her story carefully, and keeps the basic lessons of the story without confusion, distortion, or despair.
