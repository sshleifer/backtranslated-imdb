Many people judge as a fan of a fan service because many star stars that look at this film (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom are very popular in Japan). But don't judge before you look, I say. Gackt and staff are very bad when they did this film, and they worked very hard. It is a good film and story of touching inside. Several events can be very fun and others sad. They did it well until I couldn't stop looking again. The story is well written but I agree that their action is a little sad. This is especially for Hyde because his acting skills are less than the other and weird hear the way when he speaks to other languages ​​except his native language (Japan). But, it is because this is the first time they act in the film. I think Gackt is trying to show us how one can be too weak when they lose someone most important in their lives. When Toshi was killed, Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to be a vampire like him because he would not let him die, Brother Sho when he died, Kei Shoot Son die, and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass ~ even I told him that Hyde's skills are still amazing but I give him two thumps up in the area! There is a time when the plot goes very quickly if it did not cause the reason that the Son can join the local mafia and become the enemy of Sho because they are a good old friend and also the son of Son is Sho. <br /> <br /> Anything, I like this movie ~ (much ^^). <br /> <br /> This is a movie of action and a touch story.
