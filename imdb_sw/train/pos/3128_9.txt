Corny! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was almost 40 years ago! Adam and Burt restore the same to the screens that do not appear to be gone! They are also living in the past, with the participants who have played with them since the 1960s show the past things that are quite interesting to know. The 1960s TV was a corny liberation for most of us back, and this DVD is not different, as you know with the original TV show. The battlefield with Boofs and Bams written or whatever is wonderful! Part of the film show shows the parts of the criminals who have died. At the end Frank Gorshin makes the appearance. He died not long after this DVD was made, I believe, so it was with his huge loan that he came back to play man with Adam and Burt, as did Batman & Robin many years ago. He never lost his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to resume human responsibility, too. In conclusion I think that this DVD is a good memory, and I would like to thank Adam and Burt for returning and repeating these memories for those who remember the original - !!! Thank you, Guys !!!
