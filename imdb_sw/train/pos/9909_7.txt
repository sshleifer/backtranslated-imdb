Comedy great. The Ross Hunter's movie released by the French "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americans as "Employer Woman Extremely") is interesting, cast, frequent funny ... and unfortunately not found. The wealthy widow of California, who seems to be losing her money, runs the road with her two daughters, silly people, all of whom are afraid of Mrs. Rosie lose their inheritance regardless. The whole issue of a valued woman - but a year old sent home to rest against her will, and later introducing herself to court hearings, is the touch of the comedy (and for her director, director David Lowell Rich does not exceed photos and pictures A clear understanding. Some humor is very broad and not working, but Rosalind Russell understands the nature of nature in this situation and never has a false sense. Sandra Dee is also as good as the grandson of Rosalind, and James Farentino is very attractive as a young lawyer. The movie has a lot to say about the importance of our elders, and the way in which they choose to spend their remaining time, that effects of "Rosie!" 'S theme almost disappears in the rush for a happy ending. The photo stops you from being excited - and at the same time you wonder how many older women were not quite lucky. *** from ****
