Jammin 'Blues is a short Oscar-appointed from 1944 which is essentially 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at the same time by showing the film then jitterbugs and Archie Savage to bring this "recreational" session to its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer with the experience that shows in some shots of opening two of the other musicians who make this one of the many more '40s' horns. According to other notes I read one of the musicians who was white and had a silhouette closed to reflect on the social behavior of the time. It's a shame. Still, this unusual movie of time is available on YouTube so if you like jazz, I ask you to find it out there.
