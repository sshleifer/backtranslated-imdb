I think I am reading this section: Joe Johnston (film director and also one of the boys who made Light Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something that was getting their minds on the movie name, "Rocket Boys" (I think) had nothing. <br /> <br /> One day they were messing with a PC app that makes words from other words (ie: you type in a word or a series of words and combines letters and creating other words) I think the technical word is "anagram" < br /> <br /> However, they wrote in "Rocket Boys" and certainly what comes back is "October Sky". They were shocked to say the least. The title concludes everything on the film since the movie approaches Sputnik. At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he climbed after the "novel paper film" came out and left.
