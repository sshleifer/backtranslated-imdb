One of all the work of science fiction science, like a visionary display and ideas like Blade Runner or even Brazil itself Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but has left with Pitt's turn to a very strange thing that he did nothing before or since. Even Stowe out of his league here, though. The story is layered and offers very much to think about. The climate is very good, and the last lines fit perfectly. Events in mental hospitals are creepy and are still funny in their own way. Dark play shown here. Manufacture of amazing production and incredible movies. In my top ten.
