"Right in the dark" is a piece of film, sparkling, and largely sparking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, saw strong testimonies, seeing her 3-month-old child being taken cruelly from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian River. Azaria (the child) has never been seen again, and the result of her terrible disappearance resulted in a truly frenzy life around the world. Meryl Streep has no right to Lindy's position, as he does. But one thing that helps the "Right in the Dark" never falls flat is a brilliant direction. The true-guided view of this beautiful case, tears brings to the eyes. This concept is a low and terrible thing, and later it will be left haunted, but also inspired.
