Kirk and staff occupy the planet alone where the sun is about to explode. They are willing to transfer locals but find the only place except for Mr. Atoz who does some kind of high-tech library. Despite trying to get the answer directly from her about everywhere, Atoz doesn't care about their questions and insisting they should "hurry to select when there is still time". They have no idea what he is talking about but walking on a hand-looking glass as viewers and they see old pictures of the planet. Then, when the disc is located in the viewer, Kirk runs through the door and is magically transported back for a moment and what the world would look like during Louis XIV (1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and sent to the ice spirit. But they all know that the library is a time to travel and store. <br /> <br /> When Kirk's visit is very short and not all exciting, Spock and McCoy are the most amazing thing, as Spock fell head over the heels to Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this bad place as a penalty. Events and Spock are interesting and very common to the ordinary guy. <br /> <br /> Departure usually from the usual, the script of ecosystems and very different places makes this a unique place - one is important to see. FYI - Ian Wolfe, the best actors, played Mr. Atoz. I am a great fan of old films and I have seen him as a player and a small player in many 30 and 40 years of films and appeared almost as he did during the course of 1969. Not surprisingly, despite his past, he lived on another 23 years - die for over 95 years!
