Maybe I need to have my head to explore, but I thought this was a good movie.the CG is not so bad.I have seen the worst.The appearance of creation (and for i mean good and bad snakes) was good cool.the action events that associated and the snake was very good, I thought. and some jumping to a regular logic, and the story does not always make feature.but feature creation, there is a lot of bad.a a lot of other creatures seemed to leave from other movies, so it's not quite natural. i think the essence of the story is original however it's a bit of resemblance to Godzilla (Big version American version) which you liked a lot.i did not like this film very much, but I still say it was good.i also loved music.all in all, I think The dragon battle is about 7/10
