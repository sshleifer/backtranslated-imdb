I was waiting for this film since I've seen the trailer, which made it look like a political game, compared to my three favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And although it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done the wrong work, he and Pacino combine it in SEA of LOVE, which becomes among all their best jobs. But interruption to a certain level (at the beginning, several events in the previous trailer do not appear on the film) and change the sound (the following events make it look like exciting) to do this, when it appears, it is not anywhere as it may have been. Where is so bad, because I wanted to love this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government could be useful in spite of all corruption, and to make a hard statement about the damage, not the good ordinary people against wrong. And there are good things here. Pacino and Cusack are all very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his work. But Fonda has been destroyed in her role, with something to do, and when there is a reputation in the central story, when it turns into an exciting, the movie loses its way, in a short time it returns to the final area between Cusack and Pacino, then falls down absolute end. I would like to further this, but no.
