Andie MacDowell's face is now available in this film. When you enter 40 and you have been a wife at the time (or all your life) you may feel you are going down. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antennae is actively active. I liked to have a quick encounter with sex, which should not be a typical school teacher (MacDowell). Her old student is very good, she still takes her teacher for a long time. <br /> <br /> There are some places that I thought rather non-genuine or uncertain, though. For example, in the area where the envy of women exploded and the area was established to make Andie MacDowell throw the boy, do you? A warrant officer (another MacDowell friend) will allow his friend to do a bad act? Is it very easy for anyone to stop in front of the car? In fact the accident happens all the time, but I expected to see the heroine getting married happy with the first person engaged in (that was the most difficult part of believing !! For a very beautiful woman to remain one for a long time?) ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps the filmmakers know the fact that many romance between an older and younger woman does not last long. Instead they know that the end of happiness can not appeal to the public, especially for more than 40 women, who are waiting for certain miracles to happen. The sad ending of the sadness of a sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if that person continues to live, do you? How long? No one knows. However, it's a movie to make you want to look at it again sometime later .... next year maybe.
