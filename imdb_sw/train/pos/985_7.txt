This film is similar to many ways 'The Enemy of the Country' and Will Smith and Gene Hackman, if we have an innocent (black) man followed by 'government' and modern technology known to man. Usually when the storyline is copied as this result is a catastrophe. That's not right here. Of course I would like everything David Morse does, so maybe my opinion is not right, but there are more positive things about this film then. The main Baddy, played by Doug Hutchison, was a brilliant, and the story came out of extra surplus like David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was influencing many places. He is out of place, blowing bad jokes, he had no pity from the audience. Or not start, the strange thing is that he grows up to you (and to his followers too!). I didn't expect too much when I leased it, but was surprised by a good action action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
