and this is a very awesome film. I would be wrong, but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds real actor, who changed the role, and sent the message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are strange and do not know; businessmen want to enjoy the country. They didn't know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and sets are true and normal. This was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> What is more troubling about this film is the fact that this place is still there. In America, the people of the country still hate the people of the city; is almost a half and a half years since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this film. It was done in rural areas of Southern Georgia, which still exist. Not just driving it with Mobile, Alabama; The area has not been developed since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
