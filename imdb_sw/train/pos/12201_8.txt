It was done in 1946 and released in 1948, Lady and Shanghai was one of the great films made by Welles after returning from a relative transfer for Citizen Kane. Dark, dedicated to describing some of the clashes of cold winter, this film stands as a film film film and film. The film of this film has been filled with Welle's odd corners, rapid cuts, long pots and bad lights. The use of limited music is a wonderful player to be opened for a long time in the touch of Evil, and the wonderful characters of the Chinese and Chinatown mechanism can only be taken as an inspiration, in many ways, for the Chinatown Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, it is the destruction of the Welles and the effectiveness of the technical film that hurt this film in full. The story of this story often disappears behind some unfamiliar times of films. However, despite this opposition, the story with the amazing exhibitions and Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (laugh) makes this film fun to enjoy. Orson Welles removes not only Irish, but a broken identity as an honest but dangerous marine. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks down her normal roles as a sex goddess and takes on a real and distinct role. Finally, Glenn Anders emerges an amazing and amazing or a lawyer for Elsa's husband is not a short one!
