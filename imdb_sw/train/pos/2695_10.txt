What is going to make us - or at least what I feel the author wanted us to keep in touch earlier is our desire to know if Martinaud has done an act of dirt. Without much damage, of course there is a red celebration and deviation. But then we see that this is the story of the failure of Martinaud and her trouble in dealing. When there is revelation - we begin to plead with him because as the story goes on we are made to think of him as a sick, deviant deviation that we should be mindful. One of the things he can deal with is the gap that he and his wife are still living on the same roof. These problems are certainly given their keys in the amazing finale of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie requires your patience and certainly has tried those unstable young people sitting back. They were being exposed because they had no part of the "middle" film. Although there is little to travel, we get to the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as clever as we are made to think he is. Inquisitor is 5/5
