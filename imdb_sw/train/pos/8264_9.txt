According to the actual mining disaster, this German-speaking talkie is still one of the most effective docu-dramas. Together with many non-academic participants, "Kameradschaft" offers a good idea of ​​friendship that binds mine workers, regardless of the French / German border that they may be. Death accidents bring much better to everyone, to eliminate any orders of the chief. Our colleague needs the support of its partners, even with the threat of serious losses, including life. This film reminds you of the courage of the volunteers shown by NYFD following 9/11 attacks. Setting aside any rules and procedures, men and women in uniform knew only one reason: save life, and get their fire fighters. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" still has a sharp and timeless message: A friend who needs is a practical friend.
