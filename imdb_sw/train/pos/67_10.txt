The industry has dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the right of the movie and this time it was opened was in full hand screen. If people had the opportunity to see this, the work of the mouth would have made it very successful. The two leading actors offer great emotional displays that attract attention to stories and especially characters. I looked at this according to rave Richard Roeper's proposals or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. Example of a great film that has never been fully released except in a few screens. Which did not give you the opportunity to appear. Some movies go to the video quickly because it's not good. This is Oscar worthy and is a catastrophic rate that many can never hear. Maybe through the words of the mouth will find the following on DVD or cable. If you haven't seen this film you should. The major performances of 2 leading actors make this film. It can be just a young boy's movie after a special school but instead stands well with other films. The interference girl comes to mind. If you would like that you would like this. <br /> <br /> All your girls are in the same strange emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through many movies, it is a real way that it doesn't give as ordinary or as melodramatic characters. The film will encourage them in many cases and if you are an actor who wants to use these real performances as your school. Erica is much better than this in Traffic. I hope all these executives get more responsibilities that use their talents as well as let them shine. Look at this movie and if you like, please friends so it doesn't disappear among all the blockbuster tricks that come out every year. This film was covered while Spiderman 2 records were saved. What kind of word do we live? AGHhh. So to make the world again see this and recommend.
