I loved the Highway and I did not know the Race to Dakar until I saw it on the local supermarket. I bought it after 'hmm' this would be good 'the first part I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was as great as the other members of the staff. Great to see him Ewan again. There was little right to swear in it but that doesn't hurt me. Because it is not mentioned in the bag. That's more to do with the silly exemption from the Certificate of Classification which BBFC has. They should only give them only 15 languages. <br /> <br /> Recommended series, I want more!
