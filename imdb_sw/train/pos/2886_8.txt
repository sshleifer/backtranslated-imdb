Cinderella is a good film, and good music songs. In fact, it is one of the best movies of the 1950s. You can see the brutality of Cinderella attackers and his second mother, Cinderella's beauty. Mouse is funny and sweet too. I think they changed a little story, but I think it's best. It's a very good film, and I think anyone can resist the bottom. <br /> <br /> I offer 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney film. But it's really a realistic.
