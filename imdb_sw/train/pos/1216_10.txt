As a child I wanted the first movie of Care Care since this looks like dark. I always sat and watched the first one. When I was old I learned to love this. What I think is that this film is very dark for infants, but as you grow up learning to keep it up to date, it doesn't look like dark as it returned when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is much deeper. It can resist the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch it. These are very good, I repeat that 'Flying My Colors' scene. I persuade everyone to sing. <br /> <br /> Sound sound is good! Great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this film, I download it all and listen to it, I listen to 'Our Beginning' also known as 'Remember' at this time. I have loved this voice for the first time, although I really love Carol Kings in the first 'Care-A-Lot' movie. <br /> <br /> I think animation is great, animation both movies are amazing. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it 10 years later and saw that animation at the time was better. It was very amazing. There is nothing to go back from other people saying that this film is good, but it is. I don't think it's wonderful / wonderful. I think it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how Bears Care came and conquered Demon, Dark Heart. The end is amazing and again, it hits any of 'Pokemon Movie' and Ethics Crop Issues. It stops the effect. Again this movie can teach everyone for all ages about values.
