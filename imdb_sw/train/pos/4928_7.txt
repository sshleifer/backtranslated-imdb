Due to its release time, a story that includes in 1950 of "Fear in Settings" was not surprising. The dead body of an illegal immigrant is found and approved as no one until further investigation from a public health inspector who says that the corpse carries a bubonic problem. However for the current world festival, this helps this film to be a reliable appearance for today's audience. Employees and staff are unsuitable. Richard Widmark in his first role in his successful performance in 'Night and City,' Jack Palance at the beginning of a bright film, also with a star in this film is Paul Douglas and the younger (and good) Barbara Bel Geddes. All killed of unbelievers, non-academic characters (eg Kazan director) to fill the remaining levels. Elia Kazan leads, Joe MacDonald's films (later working with Richard Widmark again in 1953 'Pickup on' Southern 'Street') and Alfred Newman says it. Almost everyone involved here has done better, 'Fear in Settings' is a rewarding look, however. Especially for the passion-film enthusiasm.
