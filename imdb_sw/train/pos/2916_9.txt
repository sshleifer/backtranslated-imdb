Of all the movies I saw, and that is a lot, this is the best done that is mainly about the United Nations Air Force (Blimps) during WW-II era. Yes there are other movies related to the LTA, but many use more special effects than real-time shots. The Man's Navy has many pictures of real time of blimps etc. True, much corny talks but that's what makes Hollywood movies, even today. P.S. I spent 10 years (less than 20) and had more than 5,000 hours in the Navy Airships of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. A member of the Naval Air Force Association [ATC (LA / AC)
