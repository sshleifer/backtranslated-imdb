Well, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10, but I have voted for "10" to remove the distortion rate from a few of the boots who gave this zero film or star view. The promise of talented film artists ... three of them have gone to achieve great success in Hollywood production time. The exhibition varies from a wide range to the most interesting, with the eligible turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great example as a psychotic hypnotist and a bizarro strobe lighting, and Lance August looks deliberately dimwitted as a victim of an uncertain laboratory. But in general, it has a great laugh and some time of horror. Certainly worth seeing, so use yourself!
