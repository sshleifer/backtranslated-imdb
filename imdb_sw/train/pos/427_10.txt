One of the best-known films I have ever seen. There is not much for conspiracy, but acting-amazing. You see the change of characters on a regular basis, do not overlook the influence of the planned villa in Italy, and love. And fun. Film gives you a spell mesmerizing on you, as well as the villa does for all women. True "enchanted".
