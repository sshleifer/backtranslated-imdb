I was at the press conference and I saw the film. I thought the author - Sue Smith - clearly outlined what the film was about. However, the film did not require an explanation. I thought those themes were open, and inspiring. The contemporary of the ability to dare, to deal with fear - a particular fear given from parents' statistics - and to conquer it, and to do so, accept the possibility of life, is a film to be observed and preserved. I enjoyed more than many-hyped Somersault. I also think Mandy62 was very angry with Hugo weaving. As a bloke about his harvest, I must look very good! I agree that many Australian films have not been reduced, but 'Peaches' offers products. I am glad I saw it.
