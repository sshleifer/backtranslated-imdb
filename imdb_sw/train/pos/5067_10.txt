Here, on IMDb.com I read the comments, that Owl Gray is the best character of Pierce Brosnan who has ever done. I don't know if he had the best responsibilities, not his fan, but this was normal. Another thing - the amazing hand of the film director. I give my honor. Unfortunately, the beauty and spirit of the desert was shown exclusively, I had never been close to any film before. The original books, and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respect to the original Owl Gray.
