I really enjoyed this film, but it's not something new. Everybody here includes other films of the war, this film has been taken badly! It's not a movie of war even more "One who climbed the cuckoos nest" is a movie of the park or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about self-care, equality, confidence and the cost of such humanity. The program is the same as "One climbed the nest of Cuckoos" and "Cool Hand Luke", its in a good company, and has its own. These movies must be done against comparable, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". Eric
