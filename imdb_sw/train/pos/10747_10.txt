Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted a film document about New York City fire fighters. What they found was the only picture of the film within the World Trade Center on September 11. After working with the James Hanlon level company before, Jules went with the captain to explore and create gas leaks, while Gédéon sat in a hot fire anything interesting has happened. The plane crashed under the City was harassed by Jules, and said the camera up, seconds before the plane fell into one tower. Jules asked the captain to follow him in the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film. He stayed on the site for the next few hours, the impact of filmmakers and others there. Brother Naudet was very concerned in making the film stronger, grizzly, and gory. But the language from fire fighters is very little, and CBS showed many balls playing without being closed. Naudet mixed footage played with direct interview so firefighters can describe their thoughts and emotions at some point during the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike the title of such a title, most of the money from DVD sales goes to 9/11 related support. It has been done well, emotionally, migrating, and completely without political propaganda, it is the best document type to date.
