Greetings again from the darkness. Insight in mind and motivation of an amazing artist. What a wonderful thing for most of us to see someone who should work ... no matter what the situation, perhaps its reason for survival is over. Seeing the image of Goldsworthy come alive and see how his response to each other is a very voyeuristic. This artist builds because it should - not for money or fame. It is her strength. When you see his failure, energy seems to eliminate his body like a bursting balloon. It's not afraid to start again, it's that he takes his power from his work. Watching him just create a natural to take and remember his work is a bit painful, but nevertheless, breathtaking. He talks about the time and time in a short conversation and seems to have little doubt that the artist and the world are direct. He says he needs the world, but it doesn't need ... I ask for separation. The only complaints are the color of the music seems to slow down the moment that enjoys the best.
