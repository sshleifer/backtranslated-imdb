A good summary of the true event! Indeed, in fact, I wasn't there, but I think this is the way it was. I think there are two common American criteria in the film: 'communistophobia' and alongside Adolf Hitler. These should be clear to many independent observers. However, Boothe is doing a good job, and so does many other known actors. The last twenty minutes of films are not available - and I mean! Anyone who can sleep well after them is unusual. (That's why it's terrible - all happened, and maybe it just looks like that). But, in fact, do you? Is the last place at the air station really true?
