Although one time I thought this would turn out to be a Trainer, I must say that Mama is doing a good job of explaining the sexual desires of an old woman. I am very happy this is a British film because Hollywood hasn't done it, and even if it had it, it would have destroyed it by not having time to develop characters. The story is revealed slowly and really. Acting is good, the characters are trusted, and the discussion is sensitive. I often tried to predict what would happen, and I always missed it, so I was very surprised by the story. I recommend this film. And I must admit, I will look forever my mother with a different light!
