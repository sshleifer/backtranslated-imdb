This was a gem. Wonderful acting from the leaders of Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and healed all. The movie raises the subject not only important to Ireland and Ireland's history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. The rigorous and honest movie shows how faith and religious beliefs have inspired a loving and loving family. The title "Love is divided" could not use it better. Although it was a true story and it happens in Ireland's 50's to see how the life of a large village loses and "pogroms" begins to remind me of the Russian history. The lack of violence is still the most powerful in the world and unfortunately hidden in human nature. As in the film character Liam Cunningham says "hate has been under the face". It was interesting to look at the moral choices that people were doing in this story. Also the attitude of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was of great importance. This story also gives hope that the love of two people can overcome everything and love makes us better, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham flows through all the changes during the story that man always wanted to be. Again acting is a high score. The story is fast-paced. Ireland is as good as it was. It is highly recommended.
