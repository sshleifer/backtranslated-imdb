This movie comes only to show that you do not need a great explosion, a billion dollars dollars, or many executives paid to pay for a good film, All you need is a line of good story and plot. which the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa carefully takes care of. I recommend this film to all who like a piece of epic episodes. and for those who enjoy the original work of Kurosawas. 10/10
