] Didn't you see this film? Don't you even hear this film? It can't be amazing to me. One of the "independent" films that were produced in the last decade, no label has faith in pictures and has never been taken for greater distribution. The independent company of Kino Films, gave the BOESMAN AND LENA to run very little with no promotion, and most of the critics of the famous film were not struggling to go through. I think the movie derived from one act, playing one on racism and the vulnerability of two people never had a chance in today's market - with the loss of a film partner. The record, Angela Bassett and Danny Glover were required to be appointed for Ocsar (such as a movie actor) but the film received a very small fanfare that I could not even blame the school. This is a film that is challenging, intended for ideas, and sadness, and really requires the audience to get it on its own terms. Take it into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for entertainment without mind. Director John Berry wisely does not try to wear a play for Athol Fugard. Indeed, we are given a few flashbacks and some of the most beautiful shots, but the version of the BOESMAN film and LENA remains, in general, the story of two people living in bad conditions. their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. The third character joins them in a short time (Willie Jonah, wonderfully in the great role of silence), but the purpose of the film has never come from the characters and what they have had. Bassett and Glover provides a bold exhibition as a lost couple, an exhibition that cannot be improved. By force and aggressively provoking, both mentally and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA are eligible for replenishment on the home video. Hands down, the best film of 2000.
