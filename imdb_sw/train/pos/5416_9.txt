I saw only once. This happened in 1952, I had seven, movie 13. We were very young ... But I kept remembering, forever, the hardest of Gunga's sacrifice. I realized that how long people can be difficult to be presented and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, the kind of friendship that cares for itself, the one who raised him up among people who share everyday life, who see other faces, who know other names, but are of different worlds, it can do just looks. Then, in the worst time the question arises: “Who are we, first, we must be honest?”, Which People, family, mother, someone you know around you? You don't have time to give a complete answer, urgency is there, and it's for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer to his own sacrifice. Somewhere, in the form of confusion, the problem has not yet been allowed, the feeling grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, just one life, nothing compared to the many fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique disappearance of life , I shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was alive and the observer was. That day I choose Gunga-Din forever. When I was back, later, my good childhood, as I left the world that I lived. I left all of this for good and this verse is today a short visit that I did not expect to do this morning during waking up.
