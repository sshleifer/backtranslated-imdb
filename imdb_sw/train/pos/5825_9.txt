Many Stoogephiles consider this to be the best bar stoo short no, and they are the same. Curly is screaming wearing on the drag as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry in the top form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful voice has been given - she was really an opera singer - and it's amazing. Gino Corrado is very cautious as a contemporary Italian singer who has been attacked by Stooges in a community party. Some of the real hard, good patterns and very good layout makes it so much higher of the output of Stooges'. What even more surprising is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in a brief briefing that he did this time, you can see that it is definitely ill; his time is far, he says very slowly and gently, and has trouble around. Fortunately, his health was in upswing when he made this film, and it shows. Classic Stooge comedy, and enjoy with even non-stooge fans (I had a girl who couldn't stand Stooges, but even laughed this). Must-see.
