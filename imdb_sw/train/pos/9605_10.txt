well I was not sure what the film would have been like I saw only a piece of photograph but I was thinking it was appropriate and I was sure I watched it twice a day I got it and it's a good film. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played a part of the beth very well he is a net actor and a writer must have gone in many surveys to find out about bulimia though the last time the beth is in hospital has 2 Horus screening after food because iv he was told if 1 house is similar to that the hospital does not help bulimics like iv was told which is why I am still at home even my sister and mother would like to give me a hospital if I have bulimia but this is a net film I recommend to anyone who has a disease for eating or for people who know one and eating problems as it can put them into a life of a bulimic person and see the world how they are doing little about all net films and I recommend to any kind and any kind of person
