First off, imagine that this film is almost fifty years old! However, it still stands as one of the best films of all time. I wonder how many modern celluloid production can be spoken about 2050? The story is simple, but stable and adequate and the effects are not short enough for the day. I can still remember the first time I saw this, as a child, when the monster enters the power field to protect the ship and you should see its summary for the first time (and only). I was trembling with fear, I can tell you. It seems today, but it's still more than enough. <br /> <br /> Events and tiger show their age now. You can see a summary where the tiger was taken in the shots with Altaira, but it's just visible. Also, the effect that the creature separates its way through the doors of Krell is done wonderfully. It is also wonderful to see Leslie Nielsen (well remembered for the Birds and Naked Gun movies) as a young man, but still an adult. He had 30 when this film came out! About 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all beautiful films that are sure to continue to be favorite for years to come. Not available.
