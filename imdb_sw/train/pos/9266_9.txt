Ah, the best and funniest movie about female football fans, is better than the 1982 saga of youth fraud set in North America (qv). By the way, I watched this in the 4th [2008-12-21] movie and I missed my PVR setting. <br /> <br /> This is my second simple soccer movie after "Mike Bassett: UK Manager", but this time and frustration to be seen as a piece of guerrilla films made by a team that seems to continue to do movies that have been banned in the country where they are made (think about a little where girls are taken from the field if Sun switches: a quick impact on all sides). <br/> <br /> It is rare for a movie to make me scream loudly, but when the village soldiers went to one of the girls in lavvies while forcing her to wear the inpromptu mask made from Ali Daei's poster, I couldn't wake others into my house and strokes, especially when the young soldier didn't understand the grandfather's call for help ... <br /> <br /> Speaking about toilets, I would say Farsi so that I could do the writing on the toilet walls (yes , there were few scribblings in the Roman script, but they were commonly known for American rock wanky bands. <br /> <br /> Also, in rural-and-Farsi theme, do you think Omid Djalili looks like yokel when speaking Farsi? Listen to the sergeant of protection in this film and then go "Yup." <br /> <br /> I can't bear on Iran's political politics, and I can't bear on dubious acting; My love for this movie comes from the script and editing: top modern stuff. Here is a list of my favorite high-tech movies: 1. Mike Bassett, UK Manager 2. Exemption 3. Glory of Glory Day 4. The Honorary Player 5. The Arsenal Secret
