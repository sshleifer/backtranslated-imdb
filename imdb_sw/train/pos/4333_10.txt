he saw this in preview - great-praise-amazing features - ignorant and intellectual members of the conversation were strange - Peter Falk will be on Oscar- Paul Reiser was a charming- picture was amazing Reiser was in the playground when we saw the film, and he gave an open account about making the film - it was a long dream of writing a semi-autobiography account of the relationship between sons and fathers, and more particularly between him and his father - this came to an amazing and entertaining style - hand-hand was well chosen and give him a film of the family - I suggested this film to anyone who desires to see a wonderful game with amazing performances
