This is the eastern fantasy about the night of Arabia and one Arabian. A lot of wonderful adventures, wonderful tenants and wizardly. Jaffar malignant vizier (beautifully played by Conrad Veidt) and powerful magic chairs imprisons the Ahamad of Bagdad (interesting John Justin) who lost his throne, then he runs a little thanks to a little thief named Abu (sympathizing Sabu). They come to Basora where Ahamad and the king (good June Duprez) come in love. But the chief and thief is haunted by Jaffar, Ahamd has turned blind and Abu has been a dog. The story collects several amazing ingredients such as star shifts, horse-flying horses, magic bow, flying cap and of course the genie of colors (overturned by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu, magic eye, Goddess Kali with several hands, among others. This wonderful photo is one of the best films of all time. Developed by Alexandra London Fim by Alexander Fim and led by Ludwing Berger known as the famous, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan and the amazing screens of Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson is also a journalist and actor like Sultan who enjoys sports games.
