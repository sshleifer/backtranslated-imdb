Steven Spielberg (24 hours) had already pointed out two of the best of the 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist", with Roy Thinnes. One time was a 12-year-old boy and a boy had a strong boy (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who lives with cancer. All the pieces were amazing, unseen by anything else on television, and emotionally and substantially. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced his first season. Peter Falk insisted on the first TV managers for the first season of "Columbo", like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk acknowledged Spielberg after looking at the part of Clu Gulagher part of "The Psychiatrist". Spielberg says on the DVD of "Duel" that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder and Book" script (based on the story of Levinson / Link), and tried to make the production look like a dollar bill, even thinking he had a lot of money to work with. This part of "Columbo" is far more delicate and makes good use of sound track and music than than any other part of "Columbo", although the series always used top directors . Spielberg manages to keep Falk and Cassidy great from many hammers, but all actors are still very happy. Spielberg also gets a good job from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All exhibits have beauty and power over them. The only part of "Columbo" which was close to being described is "Light of the Dawn of Light" by Patrick McGoohan (headed by Harvey Hart). I think two pieces of "The Psychiatrist" and this part of "Columbo" say Spielberg has not developed all the technology as a director. He was good at the beginning. In "Fight!" The 1962 guest's DVD player playing with Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says that the place was as good as he had as a director. Maybe it's similar to Spielberg.
