I meant that in a good way, I do not believe. True to life, it isn't. Any Oirish thing gets a thick kinda, but you enjoy throwing it here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc.. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki-of the course played a box, is another one? Forties usually flick facing w / surfaces faces and fast paced scenes, one after another. <br /> <br /> Flynn is as good as Gentleman Jim, you never get to pass 1 dimensional look he or others here, I think, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and it means please, that's all. Pigs were very good, the chairs of the Ward Bond Ward made up chaos, and you would like to see all of boblyclub who use bobbi come running in the area several times. <br /> <br /> True alotta fun, Flynn was on the roll at that time and obviously see why the audience loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
