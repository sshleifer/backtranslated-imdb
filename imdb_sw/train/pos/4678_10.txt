I chose to watch this film in Tribeca according to Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and I saw one of the best movies in the concert. All leading guides provide good performance that seems to be similar to characters at a personal level. The director did a great job to bring characters and stories to life and skills that cannot be seen in the production of the first time. One interesting feature of this film is the love of wood and New York City (Brooklyn in special). The movie spinning family furniture doing business and weaves the stylish movies of all the craftsmen and ordinary life in Brooklyn? again kudos to the director on this good choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I would like to love the whole heart (I'm sure it will do on the screen).
