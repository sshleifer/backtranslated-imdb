I thought that this film was designed surprisingly made me confused with my cousin who looked at me and told me the truth I think that little kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go with the army and what was missing what she told before the death "I was in you". Thinking it is what he does by doing what he did with him and how he would tell him that he was too young when he didn't care what age were the other girls? Now I think I could trust the soldiers as well.but say it was obvious that he was even though he wanted to be cop I still be suspicious of his way either. And that was interesting when he healed the eye in the shop.hahahahaha.she was still it's stupid to re-enter the warehouse with yourself and so was cop who died HELLO !! is called back-up. Sometimes these films make me do when people do stupid things and do stupid things.
