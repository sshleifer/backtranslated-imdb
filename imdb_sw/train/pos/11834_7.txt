I love horse and love hand animation, so I expected anything surprising from the photo of Dreamworks new animated Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron. I think you could say I was ignored a little. You have an amazing animation and for the first time what looks like a full story. Stories about anything but horses in nature. Animals do not sing good songs or even talk - with the main. Unfortunately, the film is not deleted by Matt Damon's description; the sappy festival with Bryan Adams; and enough events to compare the production of Jerry Bruckheimer. If the filmmakers will continue to be humble, we would have a jewel here. This is not a good film, but it is good entertainment for young children. I would like to recommend this film to the family because it has the right heart attitude and the only thing out there now that is not hate for young children. Not bad, but it would be better. Although very good pictures.
