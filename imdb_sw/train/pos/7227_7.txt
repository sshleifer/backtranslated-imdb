Peter O'Toole is treating a look at the roles where the lines he speaks are good and provides an opportunity to get into drinking alcohol. Susannah York beautiful provides good foil for the great presence of O'Toole. The film mentions intervention - without an open space - but it can attract the viewer into his view of the raucous community. Although this is not a great film for any calculation, it will remember for its entertainment shows. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the document at the end, is treating the look, exciting catastrophic silence. Lack of possibilities here is Thompson's left direction. But the film comes because of executives and script. I saw the film twice over the past 20 years - for both the name "Love brother". "Dance of the country" is a very high and inappropriate head of this film, wherever it was released as such.
