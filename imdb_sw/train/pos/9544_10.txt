The basketball machine is an amazing film of splatter, it has an original plot with a little love, blood buckets, and fascinating alien creatures who bring people into robotic warfare machines. Now the film is not for everyone, people who love splatter films or Tetsuo film: Iron Man will congratulate you. Specific effects may be cheesy in some parts of the film, but not exactly do you think to take the film seriously. However, everything is very fun, well if you get budding romantics infested slimy tumor like gobbles who want to destroy each in the alien alien ozing alien.
