This movie is another anthology of fear. Rather it is good, but it can be used a little more. I compare it to the "doctor's house of doctor", although in this case the title is appropriate. It has all four stories that are connected to the house. The first story is about the author and his wife comes in. He builds a killer for his recent novel and then begins to see a murderer around his home. This is a predictable type, but it gives us a few twists end. The next story is a little more unpredictable, and you don't know where it goes. This has a reputation for Peter Cushing and maybe I loved the group. This buys a house, but not a house that takes the middle step, but it is a wonderful museum of wax. The third story begins the most beautiful and shows Christopher Lee. This one has a father as a good father who seems to be a hindrance to his daughter. The problem is that once you know what is going on in the story is not finished soon. It draws a bit of cause for a very great conclusion. Then the last story faces an actor to buy clothes from an unusual store. The actor actually gets what he paid for. Then there is a little story about an officer who appears when trying to find out what happened to this actor and then explain why these things happened. Although I was not very satisfied with the definition as I think it described the story of Cushing completely. I think they needed a story beyond that. All in all though it was an interesting set of stories.
