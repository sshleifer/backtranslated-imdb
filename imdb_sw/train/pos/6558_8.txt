I disagree with the original comments about this movie. I think it was nice and fun and had a good message for young girls like my daughter. You don't need to wear as a cheap trader to be cold. You can be smart and beautiful and classy all at once. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. All my wife, daughter (10) and I each thought I was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original secrets of Nancy Drew that I am sure she will love as much as I loved Wary Boys. It was difficult to make him sleep tonight because he wanted to start reading immediately. I can't imagine the best results of the movie than to turn the interest in the usual series.
