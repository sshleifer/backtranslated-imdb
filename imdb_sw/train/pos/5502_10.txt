If this film is a propaganda or not (I don't really believe it), it shows the power of Media. The importance of this document is not to show how beautiful Chavez is. It is true to show how Bolivari saw how it happened, the way of the Chavez to see it. Although it may seem unpleasant and pleasant to support the film, I think the point of view shown on the film is completely valid. Venezuelan people through Venezuela's media only saw one side of the revolution, Neo-Liberal side. This movie shows us how Bolivari saw it. Call that propaganda, I say it is a judgment call for your part.
