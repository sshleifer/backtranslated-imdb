Blackmailer teacher, organized by a short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first story of the story of Sherlock Holmes and Jeremy Brett which I have seen. Stories are interesting and dark. The film has a notion, sadness it feels, but it is quite entertaining (and some particularly interesting scenes). * Thieves * Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are trying to identify the identity of an uninformed striker who has lost some of the most popular British families by publishing a personal letter which, in one way or another, will destroy life them. Finally they know that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, "a dealer of art," after a few bad effects to victims who could not pay. Our businessmen must follow later Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay them much more than her means or perhaps her next marriage will be known more. The area where Holmes and Watson beat Milverton's home is intense. Although the film has a happy ending, the voice is sad and sad. The wonderful performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the famous villain (many listeners go to recognize today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (events related to him and Holmes are chaos). I give *** 1/2 just *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Lestrade Inspector. (I would like to add to the area at the end of a short story where he gives two burglars details, one that looks like Watson.)
