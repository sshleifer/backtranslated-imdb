It's hard for me to refuse something that Mitzi Kapture does. He reduces the beauty and grace on the screen and is an amazing actress. That no matter what, yes, the plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill HAD slept with Richard then it could make him a little more than he was already, which would add more to doubt. It would also be nice to see Jill and her husband know about the problem of little Richard and his ex-wife, perhaps the story behind more. I was shocked by the end of the movie. I would like to have more closure to the death of Zack and possibly the closure of her husband. I need to say however, I can never look at a firearm and not a picture of standing there. It was the most suitable end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi is bound! I look forward to his future projects.
