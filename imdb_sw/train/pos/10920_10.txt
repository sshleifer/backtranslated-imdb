I remember seeing this film as a child. I don't remember I saw it. I must have been around 14 years old. I thought the movie was strange and wanted to see it again. It came to Kung Fu station immediately, but I missed it. I was very troubled. It's the best of the effects of Kung Fu movie that I have seen so far! I strongly recommend, and now that I have found where to find, I will enjoy it once and for years to come. I also need to look at this movie of Venom that others have talked about.
