This is a good example of the noir story of the Noir which is handled very well - thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger as well as the best performing performances. Star Dana Andrews as a fire detective who always uses his fists instead of his mind. Once the film starts, Andrews is punished for this and warns that if this will continue he will be off power. A future later, during the investigation of the crime he attacked by the accused and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does not use much power but the defendant is killed. Andrews are concerned and they think they will not believe him so he is trying to hide death - although instead of an innocent person being accused of a crime. There is much more to film than this - - including a conspiracy involving a small villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of type - with great false conversation, good lighting and simple but very effective stories. This is how Black was supposed to be.
