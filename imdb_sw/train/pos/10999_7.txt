This film is about this wimpy person who decides to be a spy for an interesting tech tech company called Digicorp. This wimpy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his sad city life and his beloved wife so decides to become a witch. He thinks going to the workshops from other top companies and know all the companies' plans. Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and pretty pretty to be cross-crossing with these two companies that seize power to be a double agent. How does Morgan look out of this? Can he send a good but wonderful Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And most importantly, Morgan can make it live? Wow! What a good movie! I was beaten after 15 minutes of watching this film. It's very festive and you can feel afraid of Morgan and chaos if he does a good job of staying alive. The place where they put the opposite of this horror on Morgan's head to remind him is a fascinating and awesome talent. Morgan slowly goes through human change that is not so obvious until you think about it after the film ended. From a wimpy boy with bad hair and glasses, he returns to be a man who fights for his life. Last, wow, the end is wonderful! Losing is very fun! I stopped moving and enjoying like things! Good performances from all sides, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this film!
