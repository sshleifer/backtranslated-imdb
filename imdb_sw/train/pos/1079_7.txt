Although it does not appear in too many films before, you have certainly seen the theme of the primary plot in most movies since. No one of the best Grant or Loy films, makes great effort together. After all, with this beautiful talent and good support, you know there will be a laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie is lighter, has extraordinary care but it keeps going around the plot and makes you a whole smile through the way. <br /> <br /> A great example of the old American film price that stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Saturday Saturday afternoon, heavy on popcorn.
