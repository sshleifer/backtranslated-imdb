If you went to this film to see a great presentation of academic awards ... oh well..but if you want to see the best old classic performance, you will love it. The story line was good, several parts were added as the Grinch history did better. Ron Howard never missed ... But though there were a few views of ADULT and cleavage added, this is supped to be children or show family. Try not to lose it. If you really enjoy a movie ... and for comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a great motion picture and see how you do it.
