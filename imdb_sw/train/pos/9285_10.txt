Finally! Iranian film not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is not a reference, the black comedy of entertainment and subversive little girls subtly kicking 'system' in her ass. It's all about soccer and its funny, it's really funny. The director says "The sites are true, the event is true, and so they are responsible and extra. That is why I decided to be elected to serve professional professionals, if their presence would give the idea of ​​falseness." Non-executives will have their roots on the spot except. your heart is of stone b. you are blind. Written well, the film faces the authority of older generation and extraordinary cleanliness. It has won Jury Grand, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it is almost-perfect. WHAT, where can I find it?
