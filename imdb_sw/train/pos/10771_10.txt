This movie has all starred stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Shepard of Cybill, and Jim Belushi to call a few, run to Monte Carlo, with other beautiful European places, and it's very funny. The pressure that everyone finds when self-defense is good, and I strongly recommend seeing this film, it's very good! Candy John is on the form immediately after the crime, just like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family film, this is your ticket. Everyone offers stellar displays, a good actor, a great comedy, and a lot of time, which is rare in movies these days. A great deal, a great secret, (which I love anyways) and in general, is the same as the money you spend. So find kids, grab some popcorn, juice, or tea, or sodas, and enjoy the show !!!!
