I had the opportunity to see the beginning of this film on the Appalachian film, which won the Best Picture. This film has been done carefully, and the best cast that works together. My popular exhibitions were from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane, and Adam Jones. Also, there are serious consequences with the dragon and bugs, that I was surprised to know that this film was done on a small budget. The author of the author Adam Jones, who I believe also won the prize for his writing, is doing a better job and direction. The audience liked this film. Cross Eyed will make you laugh in the movie. Surely you must see.
