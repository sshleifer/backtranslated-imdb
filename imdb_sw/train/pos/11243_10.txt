I saw the first "Glass Breaking" when it was released in the UK in 1980. I liked it and having just got it in August 2005 at Canada's center is still good. The only thing I do is that I can't find a voice or a DVD on the shops? ... anyone who tries to stop the light or I must import from the internet of the highest price. But returning to the music film stands for a test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about the 80th of England ... it was actually the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons that "Thatcher" and what she did for the country at that time. Please if you have the opportunity to watch this film you will not be sorry!
