If you like to enjoy Cleese and all the British humorous 'Pythonesque' then, then this small gem is completely hilarious. Arthur Lowe is a real cure! I saw this with friends on the television when it first appeared, and its usual quotes have created a part of our joke for 30 years, and you will do forever! I have on tape and continues to be accepted. Maybe other critics are taking it very seriously. UK!
