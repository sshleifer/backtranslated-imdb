As with everyone else who has commented on this film, I can only ask why this has never been seen on the video. I remember seeing around the age of 12 at the "Show Show," in 1972. I also remember the attack of poisonous gas and horse-wrapped horses and weirdly. (I do not remember the most frightening bits I have seen described here, usually they were cut off by TV viewers.) But my favorite events are related to the death of Lord Kitchener within HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The cruiser's devastating event near the footsteps in the storm was interesting, as I remember. Do not remember music symbols, but the views of others now have my mind. Get this out on the video!
