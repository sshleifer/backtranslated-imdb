I was a little skepticle if I had to look at this when it was first shown in CBS. I was one of the many people who were in NYC that day, I was at the school at Hunter College. I didn't want to see the damage and murder all over again, but as many I was eager to see what this was all about. Tears came into my eyes to watch this document. All my memories were back and only the pictures were not possible. I bought a DVD on a year's record and watched it a few times. How these people could create this picture was wonderful. If you haven't seen this document, make yourself a permit and watch. It is clear that sadness and bring tears to the eyes, but it is a wonderful document of this dark world hour.
