and perhaps near the story of Dickens story. Although I see the little Ebenezer difficult to see (which is the idea it was long hair, surely they could do better than that!), Scott does a wonderful job like Scrooge. His provision of some lines from Dickens finally brought life to me. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and beyond the Christmas Spirit now. I get G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more reliable than the most current version of Patrick Stewart. The Christmas area in the morning when Scrooge knows she has not missed you, it's okay to convince someone that Scott knows how to act against overact. He's a wonderful thing here. Almost the whole cast is amazing. Tiny Tim in this version of Carol's Christmas is very tough to look, almost too sweet. Still music and landscape makes it so you should watch every holiday. Enjoy!
