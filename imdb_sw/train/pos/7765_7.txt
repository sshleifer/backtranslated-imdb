Douglas Sirk explains this top game about unhappy. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are young friends and looks different on life. Kyle is an evil daughter of oil; Mitch works for Hadley Oil Company. They all love the woman, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle who has ways to remove her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be a nymphomaniac of the city and carrying a torch to Mitch, who always seems to be the one who has cleaned the faces of Hadley. Ambitious and bias; a little over the top, but the stars make it a film to see. I was so impressed with Malone. Leave: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
