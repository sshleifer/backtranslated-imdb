Bette Midler is no longer God's! Raunchily humorous. With love with Burlesque. The ability to bring you tears and old jokes with new clothes or just old and more powerful and punch songs than ever before. All of them sing new ballads, strong-singing well of old / permanent as "Rose"; "Stay with Me" and yes, even "Winds With My". The best way to understand Miss M Mr. has always been - since this is the best thing, I have inspired them all for the combination of adult magic and preference and the wrong desires of the child by pushing all limits!
