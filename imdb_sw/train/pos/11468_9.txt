I am really wondering how little has been done in the film on Columbine's murder. There is no great, surprising document. Fortunately we get the talent of Ben Coccio who led ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who made a fine ELEPHANT similar. Two differences take the event, which is usually the idea that the real cause of the murder will be hidden at all times, that there is something that is ultimately surprising and unknown about the motivation of two murderers, and what led them to carry more fantasy in the horrible reality. ZERO Day, derived from video videos made by the shotgun and found after the event, is completely riveting. Even if you know where you are going, you still foresee the hope that HAS "go there" ... and the tension in the last minute of the film is so great. The film is severe from the top to the bottom, from the director to the script (not the best made, though it looks very much) for the two leading administrators, and the support players also. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that bothered me. Well, so we can't understand why the gunmen will do what they did, but one of the contributors was their ANGER. However these boys are not angry. They may say some things to show that they are, but they are really not convinced that they had something in them that encouraged them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me meaning "why ???" that director Coccio wants me to. Otherwise, renting or buying this movie, it will increase on you and stay with you for a long time. The people of WLAWITCH could only WISH for a successful form of these guys had to make a documentary shock.
