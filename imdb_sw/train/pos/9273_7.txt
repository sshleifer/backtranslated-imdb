In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has created all aspects of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, usually doing just what you expect, like going to soccer matches to enjoy the national team if you win the World Cup. Unless women are not allowed to go to the soccer field to watch the game. A little funny funny movie follows a small group of women who were taken into the soccer field with a small group of exhausted soldiers who were supposed to protect them in the remaining pen outside the field. The lack of this situation, the simplest desire of these women to enjoy the team (there is no barrier there), and a little touch to humanity on the life of everyone adds up to positive views on humanity against ideology. <br /> Acting amateur, beautiful script and conversation, very enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, kind - the heart warm and happy in daily interest and pleasures.
