There have been several films about Zorro, even some that happened in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has been played by the best actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me better than ever has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you an opportunity to see a spectacular west, where you will find only the real villain, Don del Oro, its end. Serial also has a good performance of various actors B like Ed Cobb, former Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal criminals like John Merton and Charles King, with a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was sharp, intelligent, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was better for any Zorro.
