This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and has the highest score and is the most common in the two numbers being done by Harriet Hilliard and leaving others to share and / or collaborate between heads. Traditionally the story of the story is not good to keep us from the fact that the record was the basis of play, Stop Shore, which was also used as the basis of Broadway Music, Hit Deck. Anyone who actually saw the Shore Leave in the theater may have been used for a short time as the tasks performed by Fred and Ginger were made for film but what is important, always, is music, lyrics and hoofing and all this is not out of the bottle . It was leaving from other names in the franchise in that 1) we see the Astaire play piano - in real life was a pianist who was flown and composed of several songs, one of which, I create up to Awful Let Let-Down, had lyric and Johnny Mercer and spent a week several in the chart - and it's just one of the series in which he played serviceman, although ex-hoofer who entered into the navy after ignored and playing the ginger partner before the story began. He is making a well-known but better quality of Berlin, I would like to lead a band and also ask for I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the last number is prophecy - in 1936 rumbles of World War II had already felt ready - Let's see Music and Dance, one of the most powerful ballads done by the team. Why if Randolph Scott is a small wood and fish out of the water without either a horse or a six gun that can reach easy and Harriet Hilliard is not recommended one screen for fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, do they give. Answer: In spades.
