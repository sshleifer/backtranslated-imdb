This is one of the most amazing and highly skilled films! <br /> <br /> Movie shows some of the very big sets that you see in the '30 movie, although it is very obvious that they are set, instead of real places. Often if the behavior had fallen or shaking the door of the door is also unconscious, the entire column would have been going. The best time of the film was quiet, more old, timed. It shows that René Clair's true heart was making a silent film. The overall humor is so great in this film. Also, the music time was even greater. This is very enjoyable and interesting of French music earlier. Although the best time is a quiet time, it does not mean that the movie is not presented with a lot of interesting conversations, which are very well available by chief executives, all of whom seemed to act as actors, which in this case worked very well for its fashion film the general and positive conditions of concern. This is not surprising, because this film actually depends on the play for the original stage by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It is a real technical movie, and also a great job of the camera works in it with some very realistic editing, which makes some fast fast and fun to track successively. There is no bright time in this movie! René Clair was a very subtle director, who knew how to build and organize a good time in the movie. It is a very creative film, that in spite of its simplicity, it still feels like a natural and intellectual film, which has not worked so interesting. The last half of the hour is an unforgettable fun, without much damage, and really is among the most beautiful things, with a lot of creative time in the original comedy making. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with other players who are very happy, who are all very confident and were definitely thrown because of their looks. They all add to the beautiful atmosphere of the atmosphere and the destruction of the film. One of the most beautiful movies you will see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
