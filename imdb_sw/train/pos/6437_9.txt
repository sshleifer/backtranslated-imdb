The famous conductor decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes to the Dutch and choir of the local church, which will change his life. I had no expectations when I saw this film for the first time yesterday; I love watching foreign movies that are not English, and I have seen several Swedish movies in my life, but this is better now. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, which one is best to act. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a prudent, skilled and dedicated Daniel Daréus. Good Frida Hallgren wondering with her beautiful smile and doing her craft work. All the members of the singers are well-organized, interesting characters and their stories each other. <br /> <br /> This movie describes stories, good stories, music, love, pain, memory, death, about a man who gave his life to music, and who tries to establish stability in the village where he was born, trying to make peace The past and through his life until then. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedish is the best creators of the film. Go see Så som i himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's also comfort, somehow.
