I have seen 'Long Time' is a fun and stimulating experience. Acting, while not generally brilliant, was fully accepted and sometimes very good. As the film looks for a limited number of people, it is certainly one of the best works in the genre (Children Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, Britain and Australia produce the best movies and television shows for children, and 'High Time' does nothing to reduce this theory! I don't think that continuing with good acting is important for young people. A good plot and a thinking screen are very important to them. Both are abundant in this film. Special effects are good, without damaging the story, or closing viewers away from their own ideas. It would have been much easier to put a huge SFX load into this film, but it would have completely destroyed 'all the Raison D'etre'. The camera and functionality of the camera is very high in this film, and helps the beautiful wardrobe and historical accuracy. In general, this film is very satisfying, and I recommend to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who try, like myself! Now, I must read the original book, as soon as possible.
