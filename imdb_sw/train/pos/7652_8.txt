Acting-amazing. Stories - amazing. Script-amazing. The only way to describe this film. Yes, it is slow and it speaks more, but the whole story of their whole life and how it is told and dirty inside and outside makes you want to listen to everything little to learn more about this haunting and frightening story. I, myself, read a book that the movie is off and showed me more light in this story and answers some of the questions left without answers on the film. I also read the Player of the Player, which is the 'other' of the story of Gilmore. This movie made me think a lot about the words "run on the other side of the mirror". You hear a song in a movie called Gary Gilmore's eye, which is a fake punk that wrote a song about what it would like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of Gary's things that he gave as transplant when he died) and as you hear, which is after The last time Mikal has seen Gary, he is looking for a whole different situation if you were here just the song itself. This movie opened my eyes in such a way and with many others. I recommend this movie (and book) very much.
