One of the biggest 1926 hits, Brown's Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama involving regatta and soccer scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to be the main star. It is valid for all the way: brash smart aleck who does not have anything big until he is rejected by everyone who comes in and becomes a hero / hero and a successful girl. No one made this form like Haines. Sharp comic player (Little Annie Rooney and Mary Pickford, Show People and Marion Davies), Haines can turn from comedy and tragedy and change in the face of the face. She is full of joy in this film as she was in Tell It for Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where she repeats the formula. Mary Brian is as good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a patient partner, Ralph Bushman is an opponent. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and star of the Grady Sutton cooperation. This film is now known for his relationship between Haines and Pickford and for John Wayne's first film as Yale's football player (but I've never seen him). Haines was the top 5 star of the box office starting with this picture through 1932. It is embarrassing she has forgotten so much and that many of her films seem to be lost. He was one of the most influential and talented actors of his time.
