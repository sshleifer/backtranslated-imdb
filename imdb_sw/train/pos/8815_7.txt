This collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea, and offers some great part, but also some awesome surprises. According to the tragic incident of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors were invited to give their way to the American disaster. The results of many of them are not self-pity for the people of America, but especially in the absence of world and culture and different people. Ken Loach (UK) offers the best part, about September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by dictator Augusto Pinochet for US support. Another beautiful place is one of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing the world injustice, and the number of victims made by the US government in different countries in modern history; and one of Mira Nair (India), showing the true story of injustice and hatred against the Pakistani family, whose son had been charged with terrorist crimes in the United States, when he was a hero. Some places are good: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent African refugees preparing an unfriendly shelter against bombs, while their teacher tries to explain what happened to the other side of the world; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows the effects of their war in small parts and the only protests of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, indicating that life continues; and the story of Shohei Imamura is more likely, showing that there is no Holy War but sorrow and shame. The Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) section is very ridiculous, but it shows the worst state of this African country. The part of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and cheating, showing more violence and terrorism. The part of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, without any inspiration and certainly is even worse. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11")
