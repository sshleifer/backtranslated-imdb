A good mountain mountain boy with a sad state (Henry Thomas) comes on a baby girl left in the forest and immediately falls in love with him. The city elders generally help to protect the child, although the local viewer (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A young girl who was recommended for a long walk with a traveling businessman (David Strathairn for her creepiest) has similar stories that turn in a terrifying way. This is a piece of delightful life in Ozarks in the same line as "Where the Blolies Lillies" & "Dollmaker". All three were beaten in the beautiful mountains and cover life's simple life - but it's not easy - people of America. The low level of language and violence but described it makes the family seem safe.
