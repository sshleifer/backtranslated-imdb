Many people, especially young people, cannot understand this film. It looks like a story of losing, when in fact it's a story about being alone. Some people can never feel lonely at this level. The character of Cheadles Johnson showed the opposite of the character of Sandlers Fineman. Where Johnson felt he was standing for his blessing, Fineman was trying to forget his life with that view. Jada is a wonderful mix of cast and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle was responsible for comic and was a great assistant to the Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. Very good film. If you have ever lost and feel alone, this film will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
