Well, this film is really hard. In order to be the same with you, this film does not contain a lot of riveting, nore does not do 'want' to know how you'll ... but I'll tell you something now ... never and I have been like time and got up before before my life! This sure film saves jumps and fun! In order to be fair, I looked around at midnight so I was asleep, so maybe it explains why I was jumpy ... or maybe it's because this film offers in that aspect! It is basically about a couple who lose their child in an unpleasant event. They decide to move and hire something to look at the mountains ... all of it seems peaceful and quiet until they have their first visitors (I think it is a sister of the main character, and brings it with her husband) ... at night, the husband hears the noise. .. he looks out, and that is when things start to go wrong ... they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap like something wrong ... cut short stories ... they finally see what happened in the house in A few years ago and decided it needs to be taken. It's not a blockbuster of Hollywood, it's not very good to have a big budget, but please don't let it put it. It is exciting, timely and fun! Just give a test :)
