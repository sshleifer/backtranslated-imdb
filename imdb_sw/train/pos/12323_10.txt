This is the best Chinese movie I ever seen, and in my opinion, it is better than a hero or chrouching tiger, a hidden dragon. The movie is a unique mix of several types: It is a beautiful story of love, movie action, comedy and fear at the same time. And the amazing thing is that it is so successful in all of this! <br /> <br /> This movie makes it up to me 5, and should be fun for every movie partner. Operating procedures have to fly normally and even fly, but the bullet path differs from the style of a very brave and flying every time it looks good and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> View this movie , you can't regret it. 10/10
