This movie is a realistic reflection of the Australian civilization that is needed to make this country more than 200 years ago. It's not as spacious as the British, not Gung-Ho as Americans. If one of those countries had tried what these workers did, it would have failed to be destroyed. Perhaps because of ignorance on the part of the UK, or a great belief in the most powerful fire on the US side. "True" Australians (that is, not the product) are the only ones who can marvel at modern military conflicts because they have to improve their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
