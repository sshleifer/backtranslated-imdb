I am pleased to see this film as it has seen some of the other films of the director in the past. I thought the production values ​​were as big as clothing and bridges and bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirits and demons was used. I agree with some of the other views about fighting events. They were difficult to follow regularly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the moral story. It will be interesting to know what the Japanese audience thought of the film. It's a film I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some events such as Benkai and Prince fought on a "psychic" level had done well. I got out of the movie thinking about what happened here. Detailed.
