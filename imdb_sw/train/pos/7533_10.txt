I loved this series during Children's WB, I did not believe that there was a Batman when he saw it as the previous show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I loved Robin's idea from Batman to solve the crime itself. It was an interesting view for their relationship. I also wanted to be added to Tim Drake in a series, and once again as this was previously written this was a great story line, a great animation (better original), a wonderful work of voice and actually writing a brilliant. The only thing I didn't like was when you were in the United States often you would like to run periods in a 15-minute story. I just want some of the events can be long. My favorite part of any cartoons of Batman comes in this series, and it is called "Over the Scope", in my opinion is good if not better then "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's count." In general follow good, with this Superman show this made my childhood very happy.
