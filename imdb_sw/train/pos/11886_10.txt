I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, because it provides feedback to take over dealing with HIV information in the family, and much less hysteria than what I normally see in movies. The brothers are very close, but they have no judgment. Their desire to protect the younger brother is good, but it is not appropriate to end. I understand that Leo's choice on how to deal with her treatment might not be more popular with people, but I believed it was the right choice for her. I can't believe that this was a French television program. It had good production standards. I gave this ten movie, and I think you will also, once you have seen it.
