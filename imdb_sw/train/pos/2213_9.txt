Wow was a very interesting movie I did not believe that I started to wake up so late but it came to an end at the end I began to watch I could stop it with full complement of the best members of the wow wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more known actors and the actors of this work was more than a view in history was to open the eye to another part of the society in which people do not know and may even be ashamed to talk. I've never heard of a book or movie on this before and this is something that black history has not just looked down because it was closed with a mix of race, I strongly recommend this movie
