In fact I have seen some "Speed ​​Racer", but I have never seen it and I have also seen it shows some of these characters dressed like a plane who boarded a ship called Phoenix and another around a ship of a visible space as a large sea vessel and returned back in time because a certain and it was really dark and hard to understand by someone who was perhaps five. Even though I was close to every part and surprising to me at that time it was that this show had a certain resolution. In fact it has already been completed, bad people have been different from almost every cartoon of America where nothing concludes such as the last part of one generation of Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this evil man vows to give Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons and kids never to do at home, and GI Joe and Cobra are still there to try again and so on and so on. He finished and made a very cool robot that had a new weapon as the show continued, it was a little bland starting as it could not fly and just have some very cool weapons. As he got the fisting of the 16-hour fist as it was used for cell phones on the Dragonball Z, then the weapon was changed to include the outfit out. Then the big robot even had wings so that he could fly with more weapons into the wings. He would also find two partners in a female robot and a few little Bobo in America. Criminals not only included Dr. Hell, but a true man who was half man half a woman with a head of flying. A fascinating version was the best kind of seeing the conclusion.
