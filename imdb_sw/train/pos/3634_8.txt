I had low expectations for this film, but I looked for something that didn't happen in the evening. I left the reminder very happy and surprised. This is a very good film films, and a good lesson about finding your dreams. Dennis Quaid does his job well, and I was touched by his performance. Certainly the value of the perfect ticket price and a few hours of your time!
