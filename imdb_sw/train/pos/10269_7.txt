In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this movie hits where actually hurt ... in the heart! Prim, a female psychologist, hungry for adventure, meets the pieces of dirt and rotten. An infected doctor falls into badman's work, and asks for involvement in his operation. When the movie goes to a kind of "slow", it is the peak and the end is amazing! You will enjoy exactly how the doctor "forgives"!
