First off, I'm not Justin Timberlake fangirl who has fun and made him beautiful, in fact I am not even a big girl of Justin, but I did like this film. I'm working on a video store and when I saw this film and its great cast that I couldn't even hear about what I should see. I didn't find Justin's job to be bad, it was more obvious than a group, but it was a very interesting group, and Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott have two names that didn't even make the first credit list. The story is basic, the journalist revealing bribes, but I have found that it has done well. L L The character of Cool J was clear to interact, but honestly did not know what he could do at the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, a wise counselor does very well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he had just kind of there. HI behavior did not have many things, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can't do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprise I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal soldier. Really reliable and truly in character, he redeemed me several times. I expected too much effort to be honest. A horrible attack, an incorrect system of action, such things, but it was amazing and I found nothing. Every shot was sure, it was not a clich√©d, of course quite solid. <br /> <br /> Total, thrown amazingly, a beautiful story that has made me interested and just enough enough to get a jump. I don't know why it wasn't found on the movie, it was better than some rubbish I saw on the big screen. I would say it is worth seeing.
