Don't be deceived, this is a moral story. Granger is a former buffalo striker, who was tested again in the plains of Taylor who was killed. Granger can see the end is close, and feels very much at the cost of hunting cattle, Indians and the country itself. Taylor, on the other hand admits to the unicorns, or Indians 'having a woman.' When the role of the Granger of the hunted victim is very good, it is Taylor who steals the show, as he said, 'everyone' evil for buck quickly and goodtimes. There is not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story goes quickly, and we are treated for good behavior by Nolan. The title of this story is as much as poignant today, as in connection with the 1800s-man and the land and what about it, and racism. Considering this time it was done, investigators should have been hitting their halls during the events in the 'house of the house', the relationship of Taylor and squaw, and a lot of discussion. Although the image of the beat, this is a beautiful picture of the west.
