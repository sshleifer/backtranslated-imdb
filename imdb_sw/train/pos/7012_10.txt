Although the jerker of tears is definitely a "movie to feel" movie. All actors were better and Will Smith as always, works and doing well. I could go but I could score any of the "10" and they have also told you a better possibility than me. But, since I must include 10 verses by writing comments I will say that Rosario Dawson was not known to me as a viewer. His work was very interesting and I hope to see him making many films coming. <br /> <br /> NA, this film shows that Will Smith has nothing more to prove to its power as an actor.
