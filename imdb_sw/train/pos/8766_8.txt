I saw this movie a million years (5 years to be correct) changed for the first time. Because of recent events with a Australian woman Schapelle Corby imprisoned in Indonesia for a pot called run, I decided to watch this film again. I just cry my heart, because I am a player for hot girls who need it (just read my review of 'Laurie Show'). Some moisture ran away from my eyes, but had no bucket filled with tears. Why? Not because the two heroes were not worshiping and without help, not because the movie did not have a sad heart in front of these two children in a closed state of humanity. Why then? Why is silia? I wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I except the shift, to knock if no tomorrow, feel sad and like it. This movie was too short to do this. It was as if the script was reduced by the elements of the main plot, and when doing so the psychological element was sent out. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did a good job of expressing the feelings of two friends, but this film just cried for more photos of these girls in their oppressive (and humiliating) environment. The mind journey lacks here for some reason. You only get to see the key time (which is very touching, I accept), maybe because of bad editing. Sometimes I felt that these girls were around the postcard. Relationships with family members could also use more attention. What is the relationship between girls and parents (especially among Alice and her father)? You like to see, but the film doesn't give the whole picture, sadly enough. But this was a great movie, and finally I was asking my little mouth. But I think this has more to do with the acting skills (and looks) of artists (and music) then with the reputation of the director. To be honest, I didn't know who Kate Beckinsale was before watching this film (again). Now, I'm a fan! Great movie, as long as you do not expect to be the most common movies.
