I don't see how this show is like OC completely. First, OC centers near youth and their parents are trying to get life. The North Shore is about hotel staff who are trying to run a hotel and have a social life at the same time. Second, OC is conducting California. The North Shore takes place in Hawaii. And why did Fox make a show if one of the other shows on the web? I think this is a good show with good actors for many parts. It has a good story and plot. I love events and how people care for them and make them out. The most recent part was amazing how the story happened. It was unpredictable as many stories on many shows. I hope Fox put it in the air.
