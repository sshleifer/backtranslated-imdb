I have a very good record of this film, as I saw with my two younger sisters at the first show in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently it was unsuccessful - and now it has forgotten a basket (a pan-and-scan video-video that hasn't done right with pictures or Panavision songs of pride are now removed.) Film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW FINDA) and accepted. Some of the characters and surveillance are better when others are relatively young and unknown. The blue-colored cow (the shadow of Eeyore) and its blue song is the truth of the heart. Joe Raposo's songs are just a good place. Of course the most precious anger (perhaps sadness) will fall into total care.
