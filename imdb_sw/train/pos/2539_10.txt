For real people of the film, this film is necessary, since it works as small for movies themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science involves the light of catching and announcing from cosmic events. This light can do harm, or it can be connected to do good. On the one hand she reveals her mother, on the other hand is used to heal blindness ("I can see!" Cried the little girl who has this lighting done. When Rukh / Karloff himself has a poison and abnormal power of this light, we see him giving spiritual light into his hands and face as bad, and proving the fact that the person we are looking at is a projection, a feature visible on the film (just visible, like on the movie The movies, when the lights are gone). There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as a fact of the fact that everything happens is captured in the light that passes through space for millions of years, as light from Andromeda is released from the galaxy when the world was still rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is taken by the old cultural cars: the author, in the Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, published in the sculptural statistics on the club's Karloff club and its guns project. One is wondering if this film had a focus on what was going on in Germany at the time, and especially in the use of Riefenstall's film year before promoting a government which would undoubtedly continue to do a lot of harm: the victory of love. Happy at the end, Mama (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first science administration. When more movies make you want to stand in the theater and shout: "I can see!"
