I saw the first film on the theater when I was 8 years old and still giving birth. The Muppets are very cold and they are about to show business in an enjoyable way. My favorite part is when the mouse starts a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit in a fancy restaurant. This is one smart and wonderful movie for children and parents alike. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and another group.
