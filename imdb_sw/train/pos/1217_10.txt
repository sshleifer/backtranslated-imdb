I was worried that my daughter might get a bad idea. I think the character of the "Dark-Heart" is little on the bad side and I don't like how he changes-changing "frog", shadow, boy? I was wrong, this film was made for my child, not for me. He "finds" when you passed it (below?) My head. Of course I do not "get". This is not one of the new children's movies that adults will enjoy too. This is the same for young people, and the workers knew what they are doing. There is not even any political ether. There is no key to magic that will save the world from us, no one has the right to earn, and everyone is not happy at all. And as a side benefit, no DIES! ?? russwill.
