This movie really wasn't very bad. It has steps, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy from "Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are playing with Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was so nice and beautiful, but he who was very surprised, was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He deals with a different character than he does, because in other films like "Green Mile", "Indian player", "Talker" or "Langoliers" plays a sympathetic man, and "Bait" plays almost the opposite, someone any feeling, which was good to see. The only thing about this film, is a few pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps a little dated. In general I thought this was a very good film!
