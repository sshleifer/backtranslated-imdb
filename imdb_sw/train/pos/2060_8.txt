This movie is not your usual movie of fear. It has some camping humor and death that can be a kind of comical. I loved the movie because of its distant humor. Certainly not a horrible movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid later. I liked the performance of the hill and the Lester ... very reliable. I think I will come to the color of my red hair as a girl in the Scarecrow - very cool! However, the total value of the lease for the humor of the camp and the unusual experience of fear.
