You don't get more dark or more desperate than "Othello" and this film takes to play well, with the best displays and Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne describes the punishment of Othello viewer as he falls prey to the false Iago lies, and even gives a real episode of epilepsy. Jacob is a loving and faithful wife who becomes the revenge of the Iago against Othello, or something of his wrath (unknown which because there is no reason for Iago's behavior). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his ordinary talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is much less. Cassio and Emilia characters also walk in and out of the events although they, like Iago, seem to be more important to the plot. I have not watched the film against play to see many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop its characters, even those who seem insignificant, well. <br /> <br /> If I had a criticism on the movie it would be that the story continues very quickly, and that the relationship between other characters is not set. The director had a good cast, and no one gave a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed in the film. I feel that they were closer to each other than the movie shows, although you get this feeling very late on the movie. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their pain is convincing, the ability to interact with each other makes them as they meet. On the other hand, perhaps they met â€” like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> Briefly: beautiful, shorter displays
