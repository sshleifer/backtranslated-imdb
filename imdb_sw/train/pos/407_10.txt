My brother ... Give me just a minute breath. This movie sends you on an amazing journey and does not allow you to go until the last blow in your face is perfect. This is a movie for fans of Stormriders and such. Zu's legend was created with beauty, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of stand. I wanted to see the real person fighting, but, oh wellâ€¦ small, and I didn't like it so much till I look at it again, when you understand it more hit it **! I encourage anyone who has ever wanted to see a real Asian movie, to see this film. I give this film one of my top ratings. Go and see it coming out in America !!!
