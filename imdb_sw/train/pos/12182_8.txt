I did not research on the film before my first look because it was a place to put the Welles column I had bought recently. The column of the box was given because I wanted to possess the Man for All Time and also to monitor Waterloo. So I hold Orson and Rita in the player and I am treated with class and chaos at the same level. <br /> <br /> On the face the story seems simple, one meets a beautiful woman and saves from a couple of bonds, one-time and one gets a job on a cruise with a woman and her famous lawyer, then ... .......... <br /> <br /> ..well becomes a secret murder of the devil planned by many shinanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not know what is going on, he's like a mixture as a viewer, and that's wonderful to look like he's pulled everywhere and pretty pretty everyone in the film. It seems to be pulled by the heart and fatale of women's beauty as well as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her time, but you only know that things will go to the poar. in the film, has the style Welles style all over it, look at the scene in the aquarium which is wonderful and the last end in the house of fun is great on the eye.Sturi from O'Hara is a pleasure to humble, and we get good forgiveness of light for The court case case with Everett Sloane significantly lighted on the case. Still the film is odd, and it is actually an experience of looking at the choppy, because [if I got to know after} chief studio cut film for pretty much at all, and that's not just just to offend to us viewer, but right on the vision of Welles. I am sure that the full film of this film would have been respected and respected, as it is, we have a very good and exciting film, which sadly shows only on the greatness, but it is still a fiendishly engrossing film that I am very happy to have renewed . 8.5 / 10
