This movie is much better than the war version of the war especially of the world war. These journeys seem very good but walking with their death would be better. Action events were real. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! oh my god has gone to please or I will come to commit suicide. The area of ​​the thunderstorm was my favorite sequence because the ship was riding the trip. Good movie I recommend for people to read the book. Music is surprising and directors are looking to look very cool. <br /> <br /> benefits. Sound sound 99% for the Book of Violence Violence and handling machines are cool looking <br /> <br /> cons. The worst attempt to watch London
