Many viewers here have identified, the version of the film is quite different from the version of the story stage. I have never seen a version of the story of the story, and so I have a more new idea of ​​film than many other viewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the film director, but the film is still an entertaining account of several players trying to make a lot of time at the choreographer Michael Douglas. The film has the right to choose the most popular actors or artists in the last attempting group. In this way, our attention focuses on the movement of players and personal stories and fights when they occur during the marathon day of trial. Douglas is probably not the best option for that part. It seems that some songs were cut for new, and the story behind the planned image of romantic relationship between the player and the choreographer was added. I speak for all this right was the most frail part of the film. Cassie's regular notes during the emergence attempt appear to have a glass that is often needed to do when engaging with artistic professions for lack of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film has been made to death in the past, and it is curious to see this shoe tired of shoe blowing his heel again. The revelations of the players themselves began to promise enough and "I will be able to make" numbers, but then it hit a bit in different points when the players were telling their stories. In fact, their stories have little to do with real people who do not get a chance like this. *** of 4 stars.
