Since my third or fourth opinion one time ago, I have declined from La Maman and the putain when I wait for DVD. Meanwhile, I have read French screens with a monograph of Alain Philippon on Jean Eustache. Finally with an exciting film, eleven films, fiction, doc, and middle, impossible to see or, in the events of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël ..., re-see. A few questions that struck me this time: French Véronika French is a lot of spirituality (sensitivity to "maximum"). However, he has inspiration? I think I can tell him. What does the absence of color enhance, especially in the same spot the city is beaten? Does this fringe differ from sleep and travel that separates the world of Tempest and Tale of Winter? Ditto Alphaville. We can imagine years ago since we have done that, but Is Eustache deliberately wearing the film environment? Is this a good beauty? What? Alexandre is the story of the story? Alexandre always makes himself, worried about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, to announce these decisions to who should take care of them less than he does. Or is this the way to try others to vote for it? What is the difference with him from Scottie's Vertigo? (I say, I think, very much.) What is the difference, and there is one, between the Eustache of Léaud, and Truffaut, and Godard's? What is the difference with Léaud now? Isn't he still doing that, whatever, in recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching age? I arrived early one in the series of Antoine Doinel (the Léaud character) of Truffaut. For a long time, every three or five minutes, under the aisle would come to the twentieth man with something in the fabric, the red coat, the hair of Léaud, and the nose to find direction. I have no idea if this was a matter of understanding or a favorable situation. I was the same age, but I don't know what I have seen as I did. No slap, at least. I have a brother, however, who seems to have learned his car from Bresson.
