Radio was not a 24-hour day of seven days a week when I grew up in the 1930s England, so the Children's hour was treating when we had a battery and a collection of power. The few plans I have heard so helped my mind, and 3 that I still remember is "Toytown", one about all the animals in the Zoo, and --- Gray Owl, pointing to the animals he knew, which he called "his brother". It was only recently that I learned that Gray Owl was not "true", but the tax paid by the Chief of Sioux makes sense to me "Someone becomes his dream". Could we all have a dream as a world-changing change as Archie Gray Owl Belaney. What? That new Owl Gray can convince world leaders to clean up the environment.
