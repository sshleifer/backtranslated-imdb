I was so impressed when I looked at the movie.Jonny could put that hope and faith was amazing. many people care only about what they want, and they talk about all the things they don't have. and it is small things, such as a buckhes, money a new car. I have seen people with tears because of the peak. This movie brings everything to the basics. love, hope the beauty of simple but very important things in life.it causes our daily problems to be seen by what is small and very important. you look at this young man and you know as long as you are blessed with food, roof over your head and your loved ones close to you. you are truly blessed. and say to stop and buy roses really there is a new meaning. know jonny will see this and I want to thank him very much for sharing faith, power, and humor as I do.
