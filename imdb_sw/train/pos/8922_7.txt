The only thing known about this film is that it was the first responsibility of Steve McQueen. McQueen's talent has not been extracted and is raw but it is trusted to trust in this little sci-fi piece. Steve demonstrates that he is fighting an introduction, a hot car sticker actress who could be a mark of the film industry only five years. Later, McQueen would say that he hated this film and that he was "blob". But everyone starts to start somewhere with Blob is beautiful, clean and innocent. We all were living that way. <br /> <br /> This program is fast and even predictable, it is still an hour of entertainment or so. And it's very fun to see Steve McQueen before being King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before becoming a girl Andy Taylor). A close friend took me to DVD sometimes and is adding my value to my Steve McQueen film collection.
