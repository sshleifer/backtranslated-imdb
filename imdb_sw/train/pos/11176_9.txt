Ok, first tell me the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old. If I had seen this last two weeks for the first time, I would have said that this is just a terrible-of-awesome TV-TV film The other contain well. But when you are nine you just don't worry about that fact. This feared the hell behind me, especially those Zelda-scenes above (and still doing). Nowadays I am kind of considering this film. I see this maybe once a month, and every year of the new year I will look at this with 12 packet of beer & friends of the group. It's like a good party attraction! I agree with those people who said that acting here is pretty unknown. Midkiff and Crosby seem like I wanted Louis and Rachel to look like, but one can't see a lot of dedication or feeling on these two faces. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save scenes that "Creeds" takes. What I really want to say about this is the fact that no film really has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary, and I don't mean zombie things here. THE FILIA ATMOSPHERE IN THE WORLD OF WORK AND ONE OF ONE. In fact, how many times have you seen a film on the top of it like one of the TV-TV, but it leaves you with a little more than just the best smell of the outside? Certainly I have broken the balls of one minute ago, but I must say that all the pieces of the same level also cause a total of performance. But hey tell me if you know a certain film that is similar to Pet Sematary! In fact I would like to know ... And it's not the night of the dead dead here ... this is an unparalleled way in mind compared to those things.
