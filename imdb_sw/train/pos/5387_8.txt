Even in the 21st century, childbirth is dangerous: women are pregnant, and they give birth early. Seventy-five years ago, it was not common for women to die during childbirth. That is the title of "Starting Life": looking at "complex cases" of the maternity hospital. Loretta Young leads, a woman was brought here from prison (what wrong she did is not new to plot) birth; he contradicts the fact that he will come to give the baby after birth. She is in the ward with several other women, who share their joy and pain with each other. Although Loretta Young is the leader, the best performance, as usual, is regulated by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of the "B" women of Warner in the 1930s, pointing up a bit in the role of support, and sometimes earning a B (Farrell played Torchy Blane in some series of "Torchy" B series). , Farrell has a expectant mother who does not want her children, since they will find a way. He does everything he can to find a way of nurses, including alcohol into the ward (this is true during the days of the march), and drinking as a fish - apparently they had never heard of fetal alcohol disease back 30s. Surprisingly, unlike most early films of the 1930s, it is not the women who are engaged in the fight against the brave men - the situation is changed, and the expectant father comes out of the jelly. (See the former actor of Frank McHugh's character as one of the prospective dad.) "Life begins", with the first talkie, assumes the issue with the right gold melodrama, to be sure, but it's a lovely little movie. Classic Turner shows it, though not available; I've just seen a few days to respect Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to watch when it shows.
