This is still a sign of judging those who have the age of Golden Age, and focusing on the small and wrong technology of authority (on the screen) bears better against all generations of similar experiments since film and TV. Quickly angry with Warner Bros many clears, and thanks to no time of love interest strikes together, taking the royal splendid position. I've never understood why DA had to run Vance almost everywhere, I always thought they were deskbound. Palette as a detective but especially Girardot as a doctor is happy to eccentric and un-PC - while looking at the second victim of the murder he sniffs that there were many people around the world. It is actually William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) which makes the film - what did Powell do during the war? The army of cops in the crime area didn 't really do a very good job in finding the second body and the dog did not know! The best thing is where Vance tells us a whole series of events around the dodgy killings that combine with the amazing horns of driving cameras to generate a lot of sensitivity, and amazing and what has gone. The only problem is as if the conclusion is not able to compare the general burnt processes that are shown everywhere and a certain end is made; some of the Chan, Fire and many others of course can only end this way too. But because it happens very quickly and it's ... little moral barrier does not reduce my opinion of KMC status as a classic! All the prints I've ever seen KMC are (worse) if you look into a gold bowl, so if you are interested in seeing it will take you until you enter.
