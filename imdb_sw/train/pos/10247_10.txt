This film has been banned almost every foreign country I can think of. Japanese people (?) Who the stars in this should have liked to work, or we are just friends. Here are the symbols: <br /> <br /> The three guides sweep the hell out of the helpless woman, they use all sorts of things to kill her, burn her, catch her, around her seat (more than 200 times!), Using sound suffering. (forcing him to listen to the static voice for more than 20 hours! It doesn't sound very bad, but it can make you go nuts). They throw guts (perhaps from animals) when he is out, and he runs away. And who can forget the great finale of USING IN HERE! <br /> If you do not feel these films, and you look at one without knowing that it is a planned film, you will think of it! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is confirmed to ordinary people and make other patients! As I said underground. See if it is a fan of groundwater, or a foreign year. If not I strongly recommend you read in the series before watching! From year to year, shock, and feature of innovation gets 10, but from the story and all things are 1. The underground system ... <br /> <br /> My last number is 8/10 <br / > <br />
