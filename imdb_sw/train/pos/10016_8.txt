If there is one thing to suggest about this film is that it is interesting. Cluster certainly attracts the audience because it is a mystery, and in the film there are tips that there is something dark lurking about. However, there is not much tension, and Williams's gentle show does not do much to confuse us with his sooner. Colonel's best ways as a woman whose nature and intentions are not very clear. The production ran and holes were obvious. It really feels like a preview of the most effective and better effort. The book is much better. One thing is certain: Taupin should be written a good thing really to be inspired at least one good effort.
