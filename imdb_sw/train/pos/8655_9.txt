"California" is one of all my favorite movies, and it is easy to have one of the best psychological attractions of 90`s. The film has a very stylish face, but behind it is a lot of skepticism and trust of the maniacs of homicidal and terrible violence they give to others. One of the most powerful features of the film is the exhibition, Brad Pitt is very amazing as the trash of the trailer of the trailer called Early. Pitt enters his horrible behavior without permanently. Juliette Lewis is the same as playing his girlfriend, its vanity is almost broken. "Kalifornia" has a very simple plot, which goes faster and slower for one hour, but suddenly comes into a fatal attack, as Pitt does his psychological personality. There is a lot of amazing events, and they all climb up to the peak of the house that will make you angry for a day. "California" is a film that should be monitored by the observation of how man can be, and not just for violence and the year.
