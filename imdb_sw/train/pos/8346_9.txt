I just watched I. Q. again tonight and I forgot the majority of this film. It is an incredible entertainment and causes you feel that it's all the same with the world. I love all of Mozart everywhere from the opening and "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ's testing of Ed Walters. I wish that a woman is shown to be wise and encouraged to have a job, a special state of the 1950s, when the film is installed. (I myself have been a teacher but I stay at home to raise my children, so please think I am a libber of strong women.) It is amazing how a man who "is just a monkey of oil" eventually seems to be as important and worthy as fiance Catherine, clinical researcher researcher. My message is that we are not what we do, but who we are described and much more - no labels. There are tiny and other organs that are very close if you watch and listen carefully. I got a few things in movies that were not listed on the goofs page. In the area where Ed Walters will say for a news conference, there are 3 (protractor, controller, etc.) on the right side from the lime bridge. In the second camera camera, there are only 2. In credit on our video, it mentions Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti if he identifies himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb. I recommend this film. It can be a piece of fluff in some estimates, but it has more substances than most to lend to. Not only, what is so much cast here. Watch and enjoy!
