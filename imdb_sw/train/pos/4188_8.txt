Samuel Fuller is a famous filmmaker, because because he had the same politics in his films. When the "Shock Shock" and "Kissing Naked" represented the hypocrisy of the American and "Big Red One" was the image of the war of the war, "Merrill's Marauders" painted the war as a key gesture and "Pickup on South Street" is about The dangers of Communist spies. All his films make for a very entertaining look, and though he often had pigeonholed as b-moviemaker, Fuller was as good as any of the major contractors. "Take the South Street" is not an exception, and in spite of the dated theme, the style of making the film is amazing before its time. It is also a very fast, powerful, and frequent movie of brutal films. <br /> <br /> Acting on board is amazing. Richard Widmark makes a big fighter and Jean Peters is very sexy as a girl who works for her communist partner communist. The stealer show is Thlema Ritter however, for a very good performance like police stoolie. Fuller's pieces hire are good, and make the most active and brutal procedure (this is very violent for a while). The camera is moving around like Tarantino and its school would be forty years later. "Taking on Street Address" is a great exclamation of the act of music. "Shock Corridor" remains my full film of Fuller, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
