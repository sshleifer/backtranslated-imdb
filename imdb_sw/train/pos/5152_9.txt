"Hitler, Increase of Evil" is produced by the people with emotionally induced by the fears of World War II. That makes watching the enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> I think its great value lies in its clear revelation of the Nazi Nazi system. In the worst way Hitler used to make it up. After that, the film ends. <br /> <br /> When over, 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') has led Germany to the greatest and worst battle in human history. Complete six years later in Germany's complete defeat. As a result, Germany lost its eastern regions (= nearly 35% of its prewar soil), and was forced to accept 44 years of its remaining spaces. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputation has been severely damaged by a massacre led by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, rising evil" makes a good hour. Put in three years of acceptance, and (for more) to work. Especially the role of Peter O'Toole as the former president of Hindenburg stands out, even adds more direction. <br /> <br /> My text of "Hitler, The Rise of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two beautiful film films. One is about Hitler's personality, the second deals with Hitler's guest. In 1983 this investigation was caused by a brutal scandal in Britain and Germany, destroying the reputation of several historians and journalists.
