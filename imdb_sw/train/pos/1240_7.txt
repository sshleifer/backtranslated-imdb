Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time looking for lost children. When Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) is good in her life, she tells her she is chosen and must have a child of gold. Skeptical and driven only by ambition and preference, Jarrell is involved without realizing that he wants to start a wonderful journey, which involves risk and worse, demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> What! The golden child is the product of its time?, And in that sense, was Eddie Murphy and the popularity of the only golden child to the 1980s? Because I can clearly remember how this film welcomed the people back in the decade, the box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the eighth largest farmer in 1986, but since the 80th century accepted in memory has been a rejection of Eddie Murphy The comedy accolades which actually once was. The golden child is not over 80 of Murphy's most popular images as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but after retrieving the film recently I find that it has Murphy in its beautiful, delightful and interesting wisdom! > <br /> Enter into the form of fantasy action which was reinvigorated with temp-liated by Landscape Lost in 1981, The Golden Child throws all the genre button required. A beautiful girl, struggling with a hero and crying in her arms, convincing madness (Charles Dance so English can kiss herself), a wonderful color, and a beautiful child with a mysterious film, the film just asks you to get involved with fun, not to cut and dig its value as photo fantastic fantasy. Yes, the CGI spirit seems to be honest now, and that's the kind that had the best photos in the 80s, 90s and more, but in fact if you agree with the rating of 5 here on this site then you might be taking this little too The worst, with weight. 7/10
