I got the first film for the first run on HBO in (perhaps) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought that the movie was hilarious. I remember not to see the pictures of Alfred E. Neuman shown on the exhibition trailer. MAD's magazines while playing a movie and dropping half of a sudden and apologizing from a "normal group" by describing themselves to the satire piece of crap, I just thought they were making fun of themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to send them too much and Ron Liebman in order to remove their names from any credit, I was very surprised. Certainly there are many bad movies associated with. Watching a video on the video now (at the age of 32) and MAD-made references, I still get a kick. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where is Poppa?) I think it's his title of the show (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
