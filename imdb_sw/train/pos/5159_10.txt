That is one of my events all the time of Trek. There is something going on so much in this same film that its cool is cool. First boys are under the alien planet about the outbreak. They meet the type of doctor's library (very widely played). Then Kirk can give birth to what is like the 16th century in the world. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow but instead of freezing to the frozen version of the world of 100,000 years in the past. Kirk can lock himself and be charged with witchcraft while Spock enjoys some time of amok with a beautiful girl who has failed for this saved, horrible world and bad man. Spock determines the fun hes where hes and gives McCoy the royal bond whuppin 'when the doc recommends they need to find a sufficient way. However, all eventually run away, leaving the poor girl behind. It takes tons of lobby before Spock finally gives and leaves. You can actually taste sad at the end. Leaving the cave of the alone alone in his own country only seems to be cruel and really touching. Spock must be out of his mind of the vulkin leaving his greatest hope for love and being human. However, in the neighborhood is not very good! Even so, you get a lot of bang with your buck and this section .... Love story, magic magic of Salem, Spock as a man, desperate left in total exclusion ... abandoned, with three different environments on the alien planet. His surprise was able to hit all the running in one film 50 minutes. This is a classic, don't miss .... I want on DVD back back to vulcans !!!!!!
