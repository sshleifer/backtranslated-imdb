When this came first, my father brought home - we were wondering about it - It was quite different from what we had seen before. I was looking for a special film last night, and I saw 'The Eye of the Mind' again. The box is falling, and I'm surprised that the tape still works! Although not 'Get Nemo' quality of graphics, it's still very good. They should sell again - it's a picture of computer animation. It is highly recommended!
