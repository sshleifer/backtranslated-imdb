I saw this film back at the Palm Springs International Film Festival of 2005 and the 14 films I saw there will put this as my film # 3. I was the first to see this original Swedish and my many parents from the Norrland area. Sweden where this was done. I also grew up in the rural American countryside where many small towns were like this film. It is best to see more films using rural areas as their settings as SÃ¥ som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I am a very complicated film with a large group of casting but Kay Kay Pollock really pulled this after a ten-year absence. Helen Sjoholm in her first motion picture as an actor was amazing and I would like to watch him more on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in front of a good cast. I would like to highly recommend this film and measure the rate of 9.0 on the 10th level.
