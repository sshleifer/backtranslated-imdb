Lars von Trier of Europa is a deserving echo of a Third Person, about One of the Americans who comes after the World War of Europe and see himself being hidden in a secret danger. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, Germany and America who refused to join the US Army during the war, comes Frankfurt soon after the war has finished working with his uncle as a sleeping driver on the Zentropa Railway. What he does not know is a war still going on secretly by a group of underground terrorists called Werewolves that are looking for US partners. Leopold is the opposite of the rounds, but it is supplied and lost by Catherine Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the woman fatale daughter of the owner of the rail company. His father was a Nazi artist, but he is forgiven by American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help get the German transport system to get it again. Colonel soon enters, or forces, Leopold to be an investigator (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if Werewolves can make an attack on the train. <br /> <br /> Recently, Leopold is experiencing an adventure in partnership with both sides of the war in a strange and film-ish way, where everyone and everything is not looked. His amazing look at Leopold's ignorant man is responsible for everything (his lover, terrorists, colonel, desperate passengers, his broken brother, even the railway officers who come to explore his work ethics) before finally boiling up and humor and strictly control. The film is totally unpredictable. The film is shot, it takes a night at winter and a lot of snow falling. Their stripes are black and white with a shot of color to randomly visible everywhere. Also, back screens show images that are dealing with the act and image in front. Add a hypothesis of Max von Sydow, and Europa becomes a place of dream that is not out of this world. It is now my favorite movie.
