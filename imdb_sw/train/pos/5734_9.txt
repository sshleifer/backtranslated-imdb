I consider myself a great surprise for David Lynch's work, since it gives the audience unique unique and unusual "Lynch features." After seeing his many works, I naively thought I could predict the next step of Lynch. I was coughing. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under the name of David Lynch. However, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to reflect on this great old character, and rejected the conclusion that deception, cruelty, cruelty and dirt shown here is a great mirror from the truth, and emphasized and misleading. There are things in our lives we never barely insist, because they are shy or horrible, however, they are close to us, so I take courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these pieces and pieces. This is not a fun film, although sometimes it will laugh out of a strange, degraded sense of humor, this is a reflection of all the things we deny, rejecting it, in its simplicity, destruction and perversion. Taking it as it is, you don't need to love it. It's just. And finally, if you are very careful, you will find common features for Lynch as well. I recommend to people who endure!
