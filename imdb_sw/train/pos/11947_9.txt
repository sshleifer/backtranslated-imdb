Written well, directed and done ... Better than 2000 years since not good since 80 years! Hugh Jackman was a good student of his roll. Ambassador Scarlett Johansson and Woody confirms how he has performed well. It is comforting to that it is not available on the screen with a leading woman. He plays the perfect wizard. There has been a few comments that have undermined this film. Do not stop them from seeing the incredible film. The people in the crowd saw this and laughed loudly with some verses I missed the next verse. If you would like Woody Allen movies for 70 years, you will feel losing this. I tell you to watch this film with an open mind, if you do, you can go out exciting.
