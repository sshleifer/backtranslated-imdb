This is a good film for 99%. I feel that the end had this film from high quality. It is shot in the wrong way. This is made clear to feel more feel for the film - a sense of separation seems very obvious because of this method of imitation. The violence perpetrators are doing well and are presented mainly by the 'nutcase' named Joe. However, the best spelling (normal) is very little because of my delight - it has been given, they should come as a pathetic but this has been done a little OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie begins slowly (and the work of the worst camera is facing a 'B' movie to start with) and very soon but soon you get a feeling of anticipated violence that is about to happen. This is one of the 'misleading' movies with respect to frantic violence. After a sudden and uncomfortable laziness I was left to be despised. I would like to give him a 9 film if the end was going with all the film but as it gets 7 just about the power of 'energetic' and the nail nail events previously on the film. <Br /> <br /> Give an hour and forgive the last!
