Let me begin by saying I have never been to the movie on IMDb before; however, I am in a video biz own. And come from that understanding; I can say, without a shadow of doubt that this film is temporary. It has a very good story and something that I like - (going to end more). Opening was done well, I liked the selected video for him and how it was changed. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B&W but how this film uses the effect it makes. And for any film which is all things. The film rotation works well and editing was done well. From the technical side of things (which is the side to which I normally work) everything is also very good. No great tech. items to mention. It's just a bit I have is that the last features are bouncy little. This probably comes from the issue of delivery. I would also like to say that I would like to see more than a love area but I am a boy (so you can beat it because of a boy). Overall I have tested 9/10. It's worth looking like a fan of Indies and / or short film. <br /> <br /> ps. mercy for grammar or spelling.
