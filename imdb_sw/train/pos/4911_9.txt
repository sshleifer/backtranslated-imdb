This film has, over the past decade, has become one of my black pseudo experiences. The three strings of the storyline provided by each Kazan each have their own unique and different enjoyments. The local chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the rooms, the small sign as the phone book Barbara place on the seat under his son so he can reach the table, those very small exchanges between husband and wife, all well crafted by nature . More than anything else, I like their venue, the second room of life where they are obviously spending most of their time in summer. The second file is a professional relationship between many in the film but especially among the Widmark and Douglas characters. It may not be quite original and gets a little blustery but all in all, it comes as real, honorable and effective. The third stick, the grungy story of Blackie and his little tattered group, gives us closer to the dark and terrible world of the world. Blackie's Palma is cool as ice. A person known for business, this man made a person with a hardness that we simply blow up. For me, this film continues to be quite satisfactory.
