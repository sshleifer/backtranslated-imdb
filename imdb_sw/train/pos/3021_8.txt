but it is important to look at Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's attractions that took place during the war otherwise require the shooting of the American coast, as in this Guns for Recruitment, or the use of US executives in roles where they are not suitable. Bacall fits the part here. I waited for him to come back and bring him to Bogie; His voice sounds are just wrong for the English-class girl. But listen to the discussion! No, people do not talk about it except in books, but Greene was sending a message about England that needs to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another good note: Many Greene characters were saved. When Mr. Mukerjee was more like Brahamin, at least his nationality was preserved, and his last conversation with Paxinou is very valuable.
