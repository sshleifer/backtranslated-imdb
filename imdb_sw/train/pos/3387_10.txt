A truly amazing film, the concept as a vision of a possible prophetic future is awesome. The world is too large, the incomplete heat of the ozone layer, and all our natural resources used. In this night's destruction night we have a nice Charlton Heston as a noirish film fighter who tries to grasp the truth behind the murder, contrary to the story of black film Edward G Robinson with a good performance. One of the pictures that will always be with me from this film, is a citizen of people who are full of stairwells and the way that Thorne (Heston) should go through every time she uses it. Music use is also appropriate, although it does not usually mark, the opening theme is good, and the following music titles here in Simonson's apartment, and especially Beethoven's pieces in the euthanasia clinic is clear sky.
