My wife-wife ordered this off again on the internet again and finally went around. It's great. It's cheezy. It's pretty dumb ... but it's also a lot of fun. I mean, this was the happiest we were looking at this movie since the 'Dead Cities' years ago. It was like being on the old Car Store! You can tell the person who made this film love all the awesome zombie dubbed movies. You have all the buttons and tricks from these films that are connected to one, and it is best because it's SUPPOSE to be like that. The reason for the cheeze is high, the flow of gore and roll to laugh! The harm comes from a good to good, and one where the boy is bursting in half and one where the boy gets his heart beat with his chest all better! Acting goes from horrible to real. There are not many conspiracy, lots and lots of votes. This happens after the zombie movies from Italy and Spain I think, because they sit in the greatest events ever, like this film. If you like Troma movies, cheezy beer things, then you can't do wrong looking at this. The best way to lose Friday night!
