It is estimated that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die early due to AIDS. The planned edition is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa where an additional 55 million deaths can be expected. More bad statistics are personal stories that we don't always feel about. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the movements near Leo, a film produced by French television as part of the series dealing with issues facing young people. Although it is false, it deals with a situation that unfortunately is normal - the impact of HIV disease in a close family family. When Twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) says his parents and two young brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that has AIDS, the family has been destroyed. Because of his youthful concerns, they decide to leave the news from his younger brother, Marcel 12 (Yannis Lespert) but he hears the conversation and starts to distribute and act against it. When Today goes to Paris for treatment, she takes Marcel but the little boy has Leo and claims to know the truth. Today she tells him that he has a sick and Marcel is sad but he agrees. He brings Marcel to meet old gay friends, however, the tension between them rises on the face, putting the point to the riveting conclusion. Although I was not worried about events in the bed involving the physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the near loyalty of Leo is a brilliant show with Lespert and Mignard more than stretching scales on his behalf. Seeing events from a young boy's perspective gives them a legitimate film that reminds me of the Quebecois film of Leolo and Truffaut's 400 Blows. Unlike some of the American films that surround the AIDS epidemic, near Today it says a harsh truth but it does so in a manner that is very tender and wonderful.
