If Mulder was looking for his real father here is Darren McGavin, the first FX, the sympathy was only one season for the time the producers of this show did not know that they had classic groups in their hands and in 1993 came Chris Carter and what is called a track for Night Stalker , X Files. Both will descend if classics are my two opinion shows taking viewers to the level of experience that just come once in time and who should appear in X Files years later Darren McGavin, as Agent Arthur Dales support our two favorite hero, s solving the case. Praising the person I think so, Chris Carter brought back the TV's forgotten in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it was not to watch X files and that special show I have never known about Night Stalker.
