Russian Polanski for leadership directs this kind of difference on the same topics as Repulsion. I can't think there is one loyal film player who can't recognize a good director of Le Locataire, but both parts of the dyptic can not be satisfactory for most people, I am also included. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good in making us feel the inside of its characters (Deneuve in the Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with the recent uncertainty soon turning point to become unasiness The psychological ultimately rises into an irreplaceable malaise. The common problem with the audience and the audience emerges as a result of the fear and tension of the awesome movies since there is no incredible physical feature here. While the fear of movies allows certain types of catharsis (that is cheaper or more elaborate) Polanski condemns us very much and, if in the end the dark humor is permanent, we are on our nerves against the edge of our chairs. Shock, fear, all of this is a matter of play with the expectations of the audience (rather than misleading and fulfilling), not real and human nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a great success because the paranoia and clear understanding are in a constant struggle: the story is about a couple going on a wonderful flat, when we have to force recognition and character. What more if the fantasy elements are all in the mind of the brave state is very worried since we, the audience, are forced to condemn him, deny him when we have been lured beauty ("paint 'n lure") that he.
