Kung Fu's master who sends his last student to follow what happened to the last five students who were members of the banned Poison Room. He is seeing if they are doing good and not to stop them. The master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who fled with the money that the master wants to use for good. The original students were all taught in a different snake style, centipede, scorpion, lizard, string, when the last student was taught a little in every fashion. All students go to one city looking for an old man for all the money, and soon everyone tries to get money. The classic karate film has a head that even not many fans know. I have spoken to several regular fans and this seems to be one film that puts his head. It's a very good movie, although I don't know why this film stays with people while in my money there are some films that are best from the Shaw studio (One example of a weapon or a Brave Archer series for example). This is not to sell a short film, not, since the film is designed as a secret, our hero does not have any sign which anyone is with Venoms themselves know only better among others. We have been given four identities but we still have to know who of the five really. The film is also unusual for the military film, except for the training course at the beginning and the death of an old man and his family for money, there is really no action for 40 or 45 minutes. and exhibitions take into account. (The movie is unfamiliar because its first military film I think I have ever seen where there are no women. I think someone has a responsibility to talk and I'm very sure that nobody is looking back. This is a good film that cannot live up to the features that have some circles, but it's still a very good movie to talk to your bed. br /> <br /> About 7 out of 10.
