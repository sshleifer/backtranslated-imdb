This is a good film. From reading another review, I see that I am not alone who cried tears. Tamilyn Tomita acted with skill and courage, made the end of the heart and memorable. In the hands of the little actress, its last location would have been seen to be angry and corny. One can never think this film was done on a strict, reduced budget. The movie is very good and there are a large number of name executives. The script is very amazing, I can see why they all wanted to be in it. If you look at a long, long-term credit list, you will see that half of Hawaii came in to make this film happen, and for good reason. Sound sound (available on CD) is very good and puts the mood in all films. My "complaint" is that I almost wanted the film to be completed.
