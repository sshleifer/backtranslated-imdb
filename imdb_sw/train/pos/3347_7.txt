Robert Mitchum's stars as Clint Tollinger in a short but difficult line: Man And Guns. Tollinger is a city tamer specialist - as it is, when the city needs someone to save; he is the one who is created in doing so. The latest gig comes as an accident: walking in the city looking for its old fling, he is dancing into the city playing as a fabric with a western gangster. But most of the city's city starts on the day they hired Tollinger, since its way of cleaning the city becomes very stimulating (suddenly High Plains Drifter appears below the original). A person with Bunduki starts as an ordinary western film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film continues. What starts out as a forgetful and rush mill takes the end of darkness and character. The whole film is very shot and cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his most common man here with Man With The Gun - not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has his session of the session and the shade of the shade on the top spoon and comes the most efficient, meaningful, and amazing events. the film out of the park. Man And Gun are good Mitchum west and fits at the same time.
