This is the last person to show someone who Eddie Murphy is very good. Just forget Professor Nutty and Honorable Sirs, this is a real Eddie Murphy. His example of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it's also quite difficult to advertise artists where they are very popular at that time. My favorite act is one where he is in his annual BBQ with a family and plays his father to drink and aunt Bunny who falls from the ladder. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel down! If you look at the 'Raw' column should not be discouraged. It is very good but does not match 'Delirious'.
