What a happy, full, sexy film! Of course they don't get any more like this. 4 sexy or pair come to London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. Tone is innocent, because a lot of weakness comes from horse status, rather than any sexual desire for the characters. It is only when pastors lose their clothes that the male characters spread. Richard O 'Sullivan gets' Randi' (sic) in fact. In fact the film shows the nature of the softcore element as he sleeps on the fingers of the nudie's fingers and the old school films. The sole purpose of 'Girls Au Pair' is that I am a great fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actor has ever had the best honey (he is slow but very fun), or dressed, he comes (I have loved since the first run for UFO - who else could carry a purple pig!), I will eat my hat.
