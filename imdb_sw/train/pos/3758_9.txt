This movie is awesome. If you take it very seriously, you will surely hate it; However, it is the quantity of "dudes" and "right ons" brings laugh and despair of 15 years ago. I love its ability to make me just hit with jokes and clarity, and its ability to make me look at its senior, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a full-blown film, and a lot of humor, don't look at it; however, if you want an exciting and delicious film, but wise and engaging, you will enjoy it. I really want more of this type of image shown on today's movies. And hey, Keanu Reeves does the way everyone works for him ... right ... does not give more than that :)
