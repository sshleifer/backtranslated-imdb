This is the most beautiful picture of baseball since Redford lost the Natural way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths shines the screen with beautiful stories and cast that seemed real enough to draw you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Due to a dream - a real fall, American Dream reignites after 9.11 and a true story about rookie middle life of devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian births, Rachel Griffiths, born in West Texan much better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfect? is beaten as a wannabe, gonnabe and a winner of humility as physiological as an average viewer in the audience. It's true. Screenshot function of the screen. If you like baseball, you will love this film. The Americana ingredients and the apple pie were all there. My popcorn was 'mode'. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy CD! Music plays and carries the story very well! Mixing words with music drives the story especially to what is required, the area that calls me more often than. <br /> Criticisms: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about the character and the heart. St. Rita and the girls were beautiful decorations, but they did not find their place in the story to open and close around them. Long time. It is worth every minute in the final analysis. 8 / 10. <br />
