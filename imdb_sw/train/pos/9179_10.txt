This is the best version (so far) that you will see and more true for Bronte's work. Dalton is a little tough to think like Rochester who Jane Eyre declared "not good". But his acting overcomes this with Zelah Clark, pretty as he is, it is also full and believe Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch but it is very valuable. Quoting almost directly from the book is on the script and if you want to first 'realistic romance' in books, this is the way to see it. I have every copy of this film and read it again and again. Display images can seem a little now but there will be no other like this.
