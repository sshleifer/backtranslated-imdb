Lost the movie as a joke. My friends and I were so happy we were laughing that I went and got a copy used and bought myself. Now all my friends are looking for an amazing film I give to the Sasquatch Hunter. It needs to be mentioned though there is a law made that made the film better. No talking is allowed when the movie is on top except the words of Sasquatch repeated again by voice. I loved credit at the end of the film too. "Thanks to Jeep, Tom!" Anybody I thank for you because without your movie Jeep can not be made. In short a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh. If you want a good movie maybe look at something else but if you care about laughing at someone's cost in a monkey suit separately copy.
