What and all the negative comments? After seeing this film for the first time this night, I can only say that this is a fun holiday that is sure to shine any day of someone missing. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end on vacation alone, I wanted to cry. You will need to see the film if you want to know why. Also, although I loved Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) over time, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this film has made me smile and feel good inside. Before you close this, I would say that Mike Mitchell has made a good holiday. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this good holiday holiday that is sure to shine any day of someone missing by Ben Affleck or a fan of Christina Applegate who has not seen.
