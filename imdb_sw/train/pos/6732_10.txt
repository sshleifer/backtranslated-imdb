This was the best document I ever seen! I saw Mr. Dogtown and I wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised to find out this was one of his films too. Great Job Stacy! I was working on the back last week, I heard O * & ^% down with this movie came. Growing in Orange County in 80 years I climbed up and down to the local beaches and so my father was a young man. I was on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I had a body added surf, and then I got up and went from there. This movie just took it. It was the way before my time but it was amazing to see what these people went through. PIONEERS ONLY! This movie is the products of collectors.
