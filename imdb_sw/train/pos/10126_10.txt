Many have been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first "Miike" film and I thought that this kind of explanation could be a bit. But, as well as all the clich√©s, it is based on truth. All Miike's contracts are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, tabling and difficult to love the middle. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's films made entirely. He says in an interview that if he did it again it would be different, but not better. I think it means that the film has the power to reject true and intense edge which seems to be very clean though he can catch more movie visually or complicated technology could not write or better the purity of this film. As you can expect, violence is quite visceral, bleeding and severe beatings are added to a wonderful place where a woman with a chair struck her face. (Just a film of Miike can allow you to get out of such a sentence.) The movie has an amazing speed, different from the dead or living that begins with the end of power and sinking in the middle. The dead or livelihoods are also concerned with similar issues, Miike understands the relationship between Japanese and Chinese in the post-war period and this emotional lesson is handled here. I can't sing Shinjuku songs enough. I don't want to give away too far. This is Miike before starting CGI to make her films and it's almost reminding something like Sonatine's Kitano. The intermediaries are very familiar with the end of the guarantee ensures that once the film has finished you will come back to do all the work.
