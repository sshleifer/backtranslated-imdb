This is the best film of the ever created group. More deserved to what was found on Oscars. Selected for items such as its symbols, art leadership, the role of support (Newman), this film could be easily chosen for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Assistant Assistant (Newman and Law) and won! ! Hanks provides one of its best performances, and a child who played Michel Jr. it was so nice that I didn't see him in the movie today. Critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. But instead of an amazing exhibition, the real star of this film is a wonderful music. This was the most beautiful symbol of the year. Selected but not won. This is a good film that should be seen by everyone. My + A + bridge
