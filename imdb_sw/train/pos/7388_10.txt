The 74 Oscars was a very good one. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very interesting, and lighter. I loved him to his last love, which got a frigid review from the bad language and the joke of salacious, but that's good. The audience seemed to be like. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, and Sidney Poitier created this Oscar phone to remember. <br /> <br />
