Abhay Deol meets interesting Soha Ali Khan and glorifies "Hello Sister" !!! This sets the tone for the first movie with Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl has left her Nainital home and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not stop the heart of Soha & alone in the worst world. . Abhay, a sub-class next door is turning against Soha who is affected by helping him find work and housing in an old house. Little love breaks down and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan goes back to Soha's life. Sponsored image with a very unusual story, with love for Delhi, spinning Soha stylish. This effective film has a time that will continue to stay in one's memory? The first kiss of a sudden & quick relief of Abhay; Abhay describing Soha as a "class of ladki" and adding a quick "that does not like"; its churidar gifts for Soha & ask him out of date. The music is good & music back to the best. In the area where Soha runs and accepts Abhay the voice sounds lost. Stability leads to serenity and gentleness of the relationship. The end of the poignant makes a sweet film of bitter, memories that will last for a long time. It should see the rate of 8.5 / 10
