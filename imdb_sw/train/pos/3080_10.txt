I have complained to ABC about deleting six degrees. If enough people do so then it can be enough to bring this amazing show to life !! Just go to the official website and others are easy. I don't understand why this show has been deleted. What an amazing picture, hit by characters. The whole idea comes to watch! I wonder that my favorite show has ended after just one series. Why this? Six bridges are wonderful, it's better than many other TV programs out there! Until I heard they were leaving from a friend had never been to me that this could happen.
