Tian Remake is not quite good. I just click on a copy of its remake to see Wei Wei, an original actress on a typical 1948 film saying a few words to staff. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after showing Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in Hong Kong's Film Archive. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in the hair, its appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise for its fans. At the Hong Kong Film Festival this year, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic movie and Wei Wei was still beaten from the cinema almost around Hong Kong. My son, who returns 21 this year, wonders Wei Wei was very good then.
