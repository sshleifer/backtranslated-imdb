I was so happy that in this film Othello himself had a dark color and Desdemona had no beautiful hair as almost always. The player played very well, too, and I loved the script that follows the original text of Shakespeare so faithfully. But I must say some of the events took place as well as conditions like Desdemona. I have been thinking he is very quick, and therefore it is not quite right to show him in bed and Cassio - though it was only in Othello's mind. At first, I was even surprised that the area of ​​love between Othello and Desdemona was clearly shown. But in general, I loved the film and especially Desdemona cried in the dying area.
