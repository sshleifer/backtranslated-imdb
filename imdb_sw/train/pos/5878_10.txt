Garam Masala is one of the funniest films I have seen for years. Akshay Kumar is better as a woman who has issues with 3 girls and is doing the same time. John Abraham is Amusing times and this is one of his best works so far. Rawail's Paresh is as beautiful as most of his films. Priyadarshan director has made a good film in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. Three visitors are moderate. Rimi sen is not widely available in this film. I was surprised to see how Priyadarshan made a film with a simple story of a boy having a relationship with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have one day one day and end up in the same house.
