I didn't know what this movie was until I read about it in L.A. Weekly. I usually agree with the comment on the LA Weekly and I decided to get a ticket for this film. The film molly star (from my famous television movie Deadwood) and Lukas haas - who I think we will see more in the future. Film is exciting, heartwarming, it works fine, and beautiful pictures. I don't know if the film has a distribution, but I hope it will do - or it will be - soon. this should be a real gem indie. even has music and my favorite band of financial forces! The only desire was that the shepherd of molly was not in the investigation. even without him there ... this was hands down the best film I saw on the feast.
