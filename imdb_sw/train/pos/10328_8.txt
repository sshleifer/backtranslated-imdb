The creators have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene in amazement. Each interior is full of detail which tells you all about people living in it. If this period is 20 years (the first story), now (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910 years (the end), the dress and arrangement appear to be love. I like the fussy dresses of the two old women in the taste of the sanatorium - the most beautiful decorated with the best Shetland shawl. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but never think of young newborns, is Raymond Huntley as a person who loves his wife's health and freedom that affects our feelings. They have often performed beautiful, glorious forms, but here he is a trick and very enticing and very attractive. China China (30 major film of Gable and Harlow) stole a plot from Mr Know All's news (and also the story of Kipling). I would like to see more than Naunton Wayne as a jealous husband - though he has a good time looking at melancholy in Mexican hats. I love a posh bird who plays his wife, too.
