This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played well with Walter Matthau, and his players play his player (Meg Ryan) and a skilled car manufacturer (Tim Robbins). The combination of these great roles has increased with the greatest victory of character characterized. This movie is beautiful and fun ... "feel good"! Recommendations of the heart.
