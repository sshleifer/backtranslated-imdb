I am a life and death only - only the best film made. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end will reduce the class. It stimulates, stimulates the imagination, the mirror to the post-war world and relations between people. <br /> <br /> The movies are just amazing and the effect of combining monochrome with Technicolor to encourage different worlds to work hard. Characteristics and development of the plot is close to the intensive care emphasizes the fantasy fantasy. It doesn't matter how many times I look at the movie - and I've watched it a lot - it can never touch me. It makes me smile, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me cry. It is like today as it was in 1946. It was allowed to have only one film to keep and watch again Life and Death Problems will be the film.
