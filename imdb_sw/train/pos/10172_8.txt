Friz Freleng's' voices are the best pictures of the Private Soldier warning about spreading rumors of fear during war. Developed, such as all Snafu shorts, to be displayed to the military audience as an enjoyable film, 'rumors' are too much to think and cause tons of thought in his very short life. When Sinafu begins rumors about bombing, it grows in the last rumor that America has lost the war. This is carefully shown through a long piece of baloney ball and a number of strange, fictional creatures who return to tell Snafu and the most frightening information about his country's army. 'Delight' is an innovative, fast and interesting, all that helps cover the work more, “don't know the military message”. It stands as one of the best shorts of Private Snafu.
