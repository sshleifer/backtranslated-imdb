Walking Elephant (1954) He faces Peter Finch as the head of God's field where there is a danger of an elephant or a madman, out of the sun and entering. Certainly eventually makes, after the outbreak of typhoid or cholera, of course, and a lot of violence comes.

Thank you good Dana Andrews is almost to save the day. One of the most exciting and pleasurable pleasures. For colors too!
