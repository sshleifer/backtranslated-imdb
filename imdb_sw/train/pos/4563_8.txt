Hard to imagine this film depends on the true story, and how Kristoy fulfilled the miracle is to stir the heart. Daniel Day-Lewis is a player, very hard to imagine what efforts he made to create this degraded character. Looking at the screen is a wonderful and breathing experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not so ambitious as I thought before, the story is kinda bright and exciting. Christy was not disrespectful and ordinary, his life is also colorful and interesting, although we can see the loneliness and bitterness of pain through his eyes. One key reason for Christy's success is the support of her mother that seems to be more touching, and an unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this young woman middle age uses every one to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky to Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also as good as Christy little, what performance is for the child! Christy's love story has been made well, trustworthy. Christy wants love and nothing to make her a right to love, losing her good to Dr Eileen Cole (surprised by playing with Fiona Shaw, very impressed by her role in Harry Potter's aunt, an offensive Petunia, so her appearance in this role. it is more realistic than my thoughts, but however, any woman has her own youth ...) is a paranoiac and offensive, I have compassion for her, love is a double-edged sword, joy and bitterness close to each other work. Btw, all of Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN US, BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying ', God knows why he chose to lead that crap! Really work the taint for it, it's a pity!
