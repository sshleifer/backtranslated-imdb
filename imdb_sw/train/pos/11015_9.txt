This movie is directed by Renny Harlin's Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and Mouse on the mountains with terrorist terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to guide actionmovie. Stallone needed this role to return to the track. Snowy is the most beautiful place for film action and who is better to lead a film where it is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than a Finnish person. Action is beautiful! Music in the film is amazing. Bad man is John Litghow, another star Micheal Rooker (Photo of serialkiller), Janine Turner (Major Medicine). The best place is and it is very exciting movie. Very good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember the most extreme: a special version of collectors, and a nice bonus. Comig recently in Finland directly on video.
