I touched the last half of this movie on the cable one night and was hit by how it was rude. Even when one of the two victims lost too much, the camera continues. The strict shots of his corpse have been revealed and his statistical concentration camp have zipped into the body's entire body migrates and depressed. don't watch this film if you are sad. then don't look at if your feelings are very good.
