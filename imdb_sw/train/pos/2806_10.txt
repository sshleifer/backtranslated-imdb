Well, first I hate to comment on this but I felt like I should stand for this film. Many people had guns and I felt like people who would like to see them should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the largest movie of the century. If you want to go somewhere else. Because it is an independent film does not mean that it is an art. It should make you feel good and you should enjoy watching the two things. Secondly, acting though not "Halle Berry in the Monster Ball" is still good. Movie does not need to act like it so honestly. It's a family movie. If this is the case you want it should be done or should not look at this film honestly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a very good story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertainment looking. It is also very true for life for the most part of the culture so if you want to sit down and watch a film that you can enjoy and feel good when you have completed it. If you are looking for something with a plot of thought to think too much and this great scenes are not yours. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
