Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and the star of Jose Iturbi in "Aweigh Anchors," directed by George Sidney. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two boys at sea while leaving Hollywood. They meet a young Dean Stockwell and take her home, they meet her aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for him. He wants an inquiry to Jose Iturbi. They are trying to help, but there is a mix. <br /> <br /> This is very brave music and play and play with Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly plays drums with Jerry Mouse in a beautiful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart of Heart. Not one of my favorite sounds, but he does well. The piano work of Iturbi is good. Sinatra expresses its well-being and why girls have shouted over it, and these big blue eyes and boyish face. For Kelly, this was a great break for MGM. A wonderful, powerful film.
