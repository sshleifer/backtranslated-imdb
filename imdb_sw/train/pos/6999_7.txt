The seven stars of Pounds Will Smith as Ben Thomas, the IRS collecting agent who aims to meet those who got back to their tax payments. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people while driving on his phone and the movie monitored his attempt to try and commit crimes for his crime, truth, unforgiving truth. <br /> <br /> Story story is like a trick like a brick through a green house window. What you see is actually happening - even the end of the Titanic was more amazing compared to the seven Pounds. There is absolutely nothing to lose anything, no one will ever be confused or doubt about what is happening. I usually just like Will Smith when it's in Bad Boys full mode. The boy is the best at gun games, driving Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" as every time he tries to do something great comes just as an attempt to try to get to Oscar which is very obvious to. This is probably the main reason why I didn't look forward to the movies, though here she is very low. There is a bright comedy but it is a trick, in fact it was more than understated Will Smith's performance I saw and for that reason alone was strange and usually should be nominated for a great prize. The support was too great - Rosario Dawson appeared very much at the death of the entire film film by Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were as good as the rest of the other players. It is generally a cry - but not to throw all the usual clich√©s and beautiful violins to give you another choice but right. There were a few times even my hard heart had broken down. You will be very difficult to find one of the situations that do not involve your own life that makes it seem to be more realistic. I would like to give 8/10. The Will Smith will show the action on the game without the despair of the Pursuit of Happiness and come to all the best for it.
