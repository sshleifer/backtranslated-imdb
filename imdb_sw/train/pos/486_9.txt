'Luzhin Defense' is a worthy movie at any time. it's a stimulating, intense film, and keeping my mind all the time. John Turturro is quite stunning in its tender tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is a link-binding as a gentle but rebellious family of a highly respected Russian family. Chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is definitely from when their characters meet in the story. For all, this film is one of the most comprehensive looks in the life of the Grandmaster Chess, and Turturro and Watson to add a whole non-standard, not a cliche feel for the film. Many people will come out of the theater ideas, and the feeling of attention to this amazing observation of the most unfamiliar stories of the story.
