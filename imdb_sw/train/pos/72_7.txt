I recently looked at this 1954 movie compared with Vincent Price for the first time on the movie's Turner Classic. Prices show Don Gallico, a witch / inventor who is sent to kill when his boss steals his magical violation (and also his wife, has been shown for a short role by Eva Gabor). Although Prices are a killer, I find myself, he is a sympathetic character who is driven by greedy people around him who continue to use him. Though this film does not have 'We have the reason for the "fear" of some of its most popular roles (such as my favorite, "Wax House") still has enough to put the audience interest. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent price.
