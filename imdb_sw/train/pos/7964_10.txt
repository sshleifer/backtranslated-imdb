It is amazing how I love this movie despite the fact that I am not like a dog. Fox, Field, and Ameche do good work with the sounds of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and act on animals themselves are wonderful. I've seen this movie 72 already (I know it looks scary, but it's true!), and every time the last events gets me. I strongly recommend people of all ages and especially for animal lovers. It's really my movie of all time favorite!
