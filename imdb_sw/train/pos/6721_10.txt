If it was possible to erase the heart and soul of the game - no, clean life - to use with its perfect form, this document has made it. This document shows life is not just about the waves, but it is more of the people, the founders, and modern modern modernization that pushes the envelope greater than the one that has been. Stacy Peralta - a common story from the '80' days of skateboarding as a teenager of SoCal - has been edited a series of amazing stocks and interviews under their cell and creating what is not just a document, but it is the hub of that kind. When his heart and soul are in the matter - and it is clear here - his knowledge is full of clean vision that is not desirable, it is not good, or reduces his lesson. He respects the surfers and the life of the beach, but it is not available. There is a truth of loyalty to the game too. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that can be said about this document, about travelers, the original history of the game, and a huge wild wave of surfers are details. Greg Noll, the first great wave of wave who worked for surgery; Jeff Carter, a wonderful boy who went alone for 15 years on the big surf of Maverick in northern California; and, in the middle of the document, Laird Hamliton, mesiya's current day surf the wave of surf. There is a great heart and warmth among all these boys - and a few girls who show cameras - with deep and powerful love for using the sea from every word. I have seen the story of how Hamilton's father was welcomed to him and how Hamilton's youngest four-year-old had made him compel his father to the heart (and, again, has been relieved of hearing). <br /> <br> If you would like to use - or even if you don't - this is an amazing document that should be checked, if only because you are a form of student or someone who just accepts a good work of art.
