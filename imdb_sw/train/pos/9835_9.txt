From blocks then I would just say that I am a big fan of zombie so I haven't made the statement as above. Secondly I would like to say this is a movie of the Italian zombie and Fulci explained just 15 minutes before giving Bruno (Mouse, Terrorist Night) Mattei. This is not a Dawn of the dead people. He said this is one of the most popular zombie films I saw. <br /> <br /> Script is very awesome. Just look at two scientists trying to get medication ("Let's try to put these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> The zombies come in all types. From self-condemned people, they lose fraud, by plane! <br /> <br /> Gore is a lot. The legs are cut off, the hands are cut off, the belly open. <br /> <br /> The speed is fast, running from the attack of one zombie to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there is a head in the fridge. Oh head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in fear since Ash got his hand in the Wickedness of Evil 2. You should know already if you are the kind of person who would like this kind of film. Get a partner with a beer and you will be a happy night. <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned the head in the fridge?!?!
