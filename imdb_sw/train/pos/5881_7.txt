This movie was a wonderful comedy. It had a lot of comedians in it as Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing wife of Akshay Kumars and so were all welcome to the air. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who have a girl like Maggie (Neha Dupia). While John Abraham struggling with his career becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar gets jealous because his flat should be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia begins to love John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he gets flat and goes with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
