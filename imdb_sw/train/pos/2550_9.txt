This is actually one from the "Golden Age" of Hollywood, a kind that does not do again. It's a special, fun film that lets you think what happens next. All administrators are fully beaten and both are very helpful administrators. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman in it and I have been his fan since then. Reginald Gardiner has always been a good actor of the mine and adds some quality to each movie he has. When playing different types of behaviors here, it still added something to the film in which the other drums were thrown in this character was not added.
