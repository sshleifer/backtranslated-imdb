This is what I call the movie of growth. Each character is different from the best-end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". Josie Lawrence, known as comedienne, really shines like a woman who brings all these changes. Even men in this film are involved with better people. The book remained a lot of novel, which includes more in my book, as I am a reader. Take a breath of beauty and a true love message.
