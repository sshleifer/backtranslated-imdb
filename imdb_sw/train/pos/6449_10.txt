I was taken to this film with a friend and I was worried about a Swedish film. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. Unwanted brutality that one can be shown with boldness without strong images - although animal lovers may have their eye protection for a few seconds somewhere in the first 10 minutes. The traditional story of humility against violence and hope against the disaster was shown from a satisfactory angle by using the scope of the wrong and natural characters. I loved how the film has been able to deal with many of the human characteristic traits that involve pleasing, discriminating and purifying. Gem full of film that I will encourage all will listen to.
