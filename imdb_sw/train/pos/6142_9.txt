Disney's fun film with Angela Lansbury for a beautiful form as a middle-aged spinster whose interest returns magic in World War 11 England. Lansbury was 51 years old during the film and she is only better for the film. part. She is Jessica Fletcher again but this time it is for the benefit or the children of England's mother during the greatest risk. This film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a magic professor in trying to get some information on magic. The 3 little loved ones sent to live with the price of the bombing of London are just amazing in this fascinating film for all of us regardless of age. It is not bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are given very little in this exciting film. I thought of the film Ben Stiller - "Night at the Museum," at the end of the film when the events had finished the war with Nazi invasion in the small coastal town of England.
