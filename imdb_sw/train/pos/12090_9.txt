I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent basement on Saturday night. It was shown on the "Theater Chiller," a constant fear of which I watched religious as a young man. Now, I have seen many old horror movies thanks to Chiller's thanks, but no one has ever been with me as "Danse Macabre," a.k.a. "The Fortress of Blood." I am now 51, and just last year I was lucky enough to get the latest version of the DVD's of this amazing fantastic amazing odd, I thought I couldn't manage it again. I have looked at it four times, and it can't seem to be tired. <br /> <br /> They do not have spoon filters like this again. Anarchy of swarms and dams from the mist do not work properly as they did in black and white back in the afternoon. However, this has been caused by Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, shadow shade, a whiten-wrap'ed seat made by the fortress, the undressed spirit to make their deaths ... and the end of evil ends. IMO, this is up there with Robert Wise's "The Haunting," "Walewa" (with Deborah Kerr), and more recently "Others."
