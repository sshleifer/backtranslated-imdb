Clint Eastwood demonstrates his role as Dirty Harry who is now in the case of the Sondra Locke who kills people who have stolen him and his sister at the feast many years ago. Eastwood makes its role with the movie is much more then then talking, not that I am complaining. Impact suddenly is an enjoyable recreation.
