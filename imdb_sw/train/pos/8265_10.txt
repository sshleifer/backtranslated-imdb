The name of this film only made me see what was about, and so I beat this film during AM morning. If you ever wanted to see young people who would go through the early days and actually see an amazing place when the mine goes into men. This film wants to show that Germany and France can work together and become friends after WW and how the Germans helped the French breeders for the lack of confidence in French cities. All actors were the best, and the most unusual events in the mine and the horse and the little boy who worked in the mine. There is an old man who retired who is forced to go under the mine to the level when the elevator dropped. If you are a real buff of the film, this is a film that you don't want to miss.
