I was very excited about the first part of this two parter, The Impossible Planet, and was a little worried that the second part could not hold quite well and has been true in the past two pieces of the past 2 Who series. But thanks to my fear was as unfounded as I found myself enjoying this part as before. However we start with members living in the flight from Ood, who have been the pawn of the devil. There is also a bit of philosophy on the Doctor's part in a period that I am really enjoying. Without saying it is a good doctor who says the story. It may be too tad too much for a small audience though. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: B +
