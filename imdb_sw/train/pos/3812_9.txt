This is a real eye candy. The earth was made by the surrounding islands and the old cities to fly. Many creatures whose way of fighting attacks Macedonia with their opponents ... Who can resist it? An ancient prophecy, a group of heroes of young men and a beautiful princess in search of her hero ... feel ... Yes we heard that song before. But you will forget that when you look at an interesting environment. <br /> <br /> This game is fun to watch when it stays. But after you leave the movie You will be craving a little more stories. What is behind the 30-year cycle? What chased the knife stuff? Who built all these cemeteries, palaces and cities ... and why do they fall? And away from one group of farmers, where are people? True, this picture seems exciting, but not the Lord of the Rings.
