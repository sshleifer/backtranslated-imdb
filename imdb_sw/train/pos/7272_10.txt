Before I start, I would like to tell you how great this seems to be when you are playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Director at the same time (Flash Red Mountain exactly). So when I look at this particular suspension, I ask - no, READ you to do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia holds up to San Francisco, California. There, he offends everyone without apologizing. Thank God here that Carlos did not do something that he uses the same joke again and again and again and again over and over again. He does a lot of work to make everyone and at the same time have the truth about him; I know how many times I said, after Carlos said the noise, "Damn, this makes a good move!" And then Screen Over Game came on my TV because I forgot that I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Director. My evil :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this special stand. If you have a TiVo or something like that, please make yourself a record with this historical record.
