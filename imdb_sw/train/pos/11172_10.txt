Personally, I love this film and novel (I read the book first and I decided to see the movie). Initially the whole plot is actually original and one type. Acting is also great and I love being thrown. Judd Crandall (who plays with Fred Gwynne) is doing his job perfectly and actually sells you. There are also a few Corny lines that are cited there (Idk if they meant to be a corny), but they certainly reduce the feeling and give a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is a full spot of this movie film and it's kind of inserting it into the cinema. Not only will you like it but you want to see it regularly, I recommend this 100% to any fan of panic!
