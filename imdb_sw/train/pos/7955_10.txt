This is one of the biggest children's movies created. I cry every time I see the shade cry "You're waiting, waiting for Peter!" as a family car lifts. This must see if you love animals! Best Movie! The film line is sometimes stupid. As when Sassy says to Chance; "The rule of Cat and dog drool!" Plans like this I can do without, but when I had six bet I liked that line. The storyline may seem hooky for some, but I love it. Shade like an old dog who prepares a chance to take her when she has gone is moving true when you think about it. It reminded my dog ​​of childhood. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in the "Bound Homeward".
