One member, Cutter, leads from the camp to search for a gold temple and captured by Thuggees led by a sinful Guru. Gunga Din, a squad boy, returns to the camp for help and two other members follow him, but also arrested. Now the chief uses full details after three, but they do not know that they are trapped by Thugees. However, Gunga Din who saves the day. It was made well of the buddy film, although it is today the right politics. Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks provide very exciting and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the title of the head and the very singer Cianelli as Guru. 10 - 10 out of 10.
