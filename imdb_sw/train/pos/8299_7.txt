When a scientist and relative Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally received an invitation to work on Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suite project, he moved with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Chrissy Soleil Moon Frye) for a large modern house in the organization of the organization. They meet with their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family was completely taken over by a new life, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to fool Matt telling him that every member of the club has a professional meteoric planting in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted to give. Later she was brought by the club's director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) to be Patricia's friends and persuaded her to join the club with her children. Matt feels a change in the behavior of his family and decides to explore the club, finding the worst hidden about Jessica and members. In the 80 years, when I saw "Hell's Invitation", I loved this movie that remembers the section "Stepford's Children", and people change behavior in the urban area. I have seen only today, and I have received a great message of events against major organizations, while people actually sell their soul to the devil plant space and get higher salaries. I don't know if the author wanted to give this interpretation to the story, but I believe it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Hell Invitation")
