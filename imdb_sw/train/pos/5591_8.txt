The alternate title of Ecstasy, is the Symphony of Love; The name that best describes the feeling and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie, and can be very good classic film, as released during the era of silent film. This film is a treat for feel, and deliberately monitored so that the viewer can enjoy its lyric quality, shown in the basic style of art. The style of the director is too Europe. Prayer and sexuality were more modern, than those produced in Hollywood, at the time. Think of the regulatory code in the United States, during the 30 years, that the best amount is calculated. Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauty of all time, was the perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love.'
