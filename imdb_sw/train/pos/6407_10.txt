I went to this film in an effort by the staff to show why my friend, who is the producer of the movie invited. Forget what you saw on the ads, don't forget what you heard, go see this movie yourself. I was more surprised by it. In the world of Grinch, the Angel of Charlies, the 6th, non-broken, here comes the film worth your bucks! Features of glory, good cinemtrophy and cast want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of these years the most powerful and planned films. Robert Deniro deserves a musical nod. If you can give an oscar for everyone involved as a package, this will be a film.
