In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a good executive of the real estate office that has reduced significantly for its use of addiction and a costly way of life with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). When an investigation is planned in his department, you want money. Her brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) is a complete complement of child support for her child for three months, and has a relationship with Gina every Thursday afternoon. Andy builds the skills of their fathers on Saturday mornings without using a gun, expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents, since the insurance company could pay off losses. On Monday morning, we could add the necessary money to make it extravagant. Invites Hank to share, since it is widely known in the shops where the flowers are located and can be identified. However, Hank yellow and ask Thieves Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne) to steal the shop, but things do not work when their mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as a substitute for clerk and Bobby brings a hidden gun. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but he is also shot. After Nanette's death, their father, Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decides to investigate theft and bad results. "Before the Devil Knows You Are Dead" is a comedy of error, revealing a good story. Realism and difference are on the screen, with non-line information for "Pulp Fiction". Twenty-three-year-old Sidney Lumet has another good job and it attracts the life of this director. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a surprise in the role of an unemployed man and a shocking relationship with his father who feels the world breaks down because of his brother's safe and stupid. Marisa Tomei is still beautiful and beautiful, showing a beautiful body. The ultimate conclusion shows that the world is their evil place. My vote is seven.
