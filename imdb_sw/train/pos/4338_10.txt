The movie was moving very much. It was a tender, and interesting at the same time. The scenery was quite good! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave the award winning awards. Olimia Dukakis was good. I understand from the story of his story his part should have been short-lived, but I wished I could see him more â€” he really was true. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in Q and A after watching. He is a good, intelligent, knowledgeable person and a "real man". It was a fun night out! This must see the film. You will be very grateful you went.
