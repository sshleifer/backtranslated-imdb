Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> Tony (Arkin) is a typical ordinary high school student. Prepare for a great home game, a girl of trouble with hair growing in strange places? You know the usual. But the hair in the strange places gets a little tax at the time of the trip to Transylvania with his father (Yes! McMahon) leads to the worst case of furballs. Now they have lost a walk in the world forever as a wwolf how Adam will find any girls? <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' is not often talking about but it is spoly silly and spoof entertainment. Larry Cohen (The Winged Snake, The Stuff) incorporates as much as he can come with the author / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a good time in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'Birds' and 'Student Boards' I think you will be happy with this fest-fest.
