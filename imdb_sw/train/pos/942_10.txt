This is the best version of the story of the classic Dicken. I have seen it on a regular basis in VHS, and recently got a DVD version, which is designed for TV (not screen-wide). What I enjoy about this teleplay is the forest of English actors who are now recognized since many have been seen in other films / exhibitions in North America since 1984. My greatest surprise is Edward Woodward, "Comparison", as the Christmas Spirit Now.
