Every child has a movie that enters the VHS when it has nothing to do, or when there is a child around. This was the movie to me. I can tell you a whole plot exactly, I must have seen it at least 100 times, and I can say it's good children / movie family. <Br /> <br /> I still have a tape, I haven't looked at it in 5 years, but maybe I'll move around this week, and be a child of the day. <br /> <br /> You should only love the delivery of services, and their products. <br /> <br />
