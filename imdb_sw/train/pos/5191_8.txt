Scott is the same. The best man of 2 sword duel ever put on the film is in the middle of this movie. The sword of war and many fighters are not good though they are very good. However, the middle struggle is even better than the Japanese Samurai movies. The Chinese exhibition of swordplay in my opinion has never been passed to Japanese for entertainment. Particularly in cases where one person should fight a group of enemies, more Japanese movies, the model being the Lone Wolf and Cub. Although duels in Japanese movies last only seconds or minutes for more, the very power of that time made them better. But, this is one example where the Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese. The center of this film had five minutes to fight with an amazing choreography ever. Another war in this movie is also good but even if they hit this film they will get 7 for the same area. If you haven't seen, you should. John Woo is a man.
