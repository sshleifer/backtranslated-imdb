When I first saw this film on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I am a great fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. Movie shows the correct image of the South and the color view. Many of the views came from Soll, the former owner of the farm who uses work criminals. Soll is what makes the argument, his amazing ramblings give us the understanding of the South way back then. I think if Soll would live today he would get Alzheimer's disease. Not even his attitude towards the little boy who comes to serve and prisoners is hard. When he has an opinion of racism, he is grown to believe some of the prisoners are all black. The two suspects are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversation between Ben and Soll is the best in the film, they have a real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler all but with great displays such as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should be more aware. However it is on DVD and the value of money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
