I loved "Dan in Real Life". A good story-of-love story if you have received a letter or when you were sleeping, but it's not a great surprise to see trophies and bad jokes, and not romantic makes you want to lose. Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a famous consultant who cannot be seen to find objects in his own life. Until one day, on a family trip / trip, it meets and immediately connects with Marie (always good Juliette Binoche) a beautiful example of a woman who seems to be placed on a hazy filter behind a starlet of a classic cinema. Chemistry occurs on a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be away from previous cooperation, and they must do the way. Later we are treated by the Dan family, who like to have fun and not just have a big breakfast together but also enjoy using Dan and good dorky as a lot of joke. I liked it so much that although family habits might seem unpleasant to some, I thought it was a beautiful picture of a large family that didn't get into the spread or spread of dirt. The Burns family is a close, loving group of people who are very interested in Dan. There is a wonderful moment when a family cannot think. Families are nosy, but never means-heavy or gossipy; quirky, but never not out. And then Dan loves his brother's partner he has brought to the family meeting. And so begins the player-lover of love and love-budding. I could go but I thought that this film was just amazing. Not particularly "hip" or "clever", not a word of words and thoughtful or humorous as the most comedies are in modern movies. There is a good balance of storytelling and funny-but-real conversations. In fact, early in the movie, the original spark of love begins with a tribal discussion in a typical Hollywood-ordinary conversation where the characters say what they think about the voice. So maybe I have run and repeat myself, but I strongly recommend "Dan in Real Life". It is a great festival of the date, depending on me, you will laugh, and only if you're a geek if I will get a little-eyed-eyed. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in Real Life" will not do. <br /> <br /> ================== 4 stars 4 Bridge: A
