Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good films can have a practical budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and sky freight. RRW provides all this and more. Nic Cage plays an old marine, wounded in Lebanon, which is under his last 5 dollars after refusing to work on the oil field because of his bad knee. He is involved in Red Rock and is mistaken for Wayne bartender (JT Walsh, not as much more risk-but still worse) for a spine from Texas. He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like a robbery. That's just when he comes there, just look at him. He gives him twice to kill Wayne. The only cage wants to get out of the city with its free money and leave the sparring lovers to be. But the series of publications and sanctions leads him to yo-yoing into and out of Red Rock, back and forth. This ultimately leads to a flight with Lyle from Dallas (an excuse and some kind of sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a REAL man from Texas who offers help without knowing he is making it more difficult. <br /> <br /> RRW has never been released, so many listeners found on the video or on television shows. Watching it in that way can make it like a TV movie but it is bigger than that. The best trends, slowed by the wind, and the wind and the wind of the desert would do everything for the great movies in the movies but the best you can do these days are watching DVD on great HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak stage of the movie that I can think of is the farale of the ladies of Lara Flynn Boyle and the bad hair of dyke-ish. I am sure he will not fall on him but if you think the character of Nic Cage is for military scholars then you will accept it.
