Indeed, basically this is a movie of a sci-fi popcorn, but from the beginning it is obvious that it has been directed to a great mental skill. You can count approximately 10 of which the film creates, but offers only about three of them, and two of them include those who inform them that the director doesn't know that you are idiot. Kurt Russell's work is very good and brings a lot from the character that raises and rewards. It is recommended if you have seen something stupid, and you want to rebuild your faith!
