The only reason I fear this 8/10 star film, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is bad and 2) The love interest of Kelly's behavior is very much in demand (IMHO). What? Love Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is a little boy. The series of drums and Jerry Mouse is one of the most drums and drums that I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my own favorite and my daughter. I am 28 years old and he is 4, so when the character is much smaller than Mickey, he still loves many children and adults today. Kelly is always attractive, her eyes full of joy and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen him, he always steals the show. One of the best 20th century players. It is not recommended that Paula Abdul "was appointed" Kelly's action. I would also like to write Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful of the 20th century. If you were looking at just one place, don't miss Kelly and Jerry Mouse's dance. YOU ARE NOT WANTED.
