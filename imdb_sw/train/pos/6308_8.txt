Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. The bottom-and-out group is collaborating with a “session” organized to volunteer from their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwup feature. Good to see George Clooney doing a real thing for funny to change. Composition is complete with high-performance standards. Although it may be said that the motley workers are not new, I think this movie holds in an interesting and unique way. Effectively as much as possible from what passed. <br /> <br /> Do well.
