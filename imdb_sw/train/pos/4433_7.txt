Stories: On the Texel island, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot to the newspaper, meets Kathleen's amazing. His free spirit and lust for brain life Bob, who has suffered so much experience before. His life is not as simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob gets a burden on a dangerous network. Can Kathleen win her hope? Evaluation: The discussion in this film is very natural and the story continues well though it remains a little on the face and it would be good if 'psychology' would be done a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choice? This gives the depth of the film and something to think about my opinion. The story does not reach the emotional point, although the characters go through enough to prove it. So you can't know the characters on that level. Actors provide a good job and play through the most common and 'reliable' way, but I think it would fit the best movie as Kathleen was played by the little actress, as this naiveness character does not work entirely for adults- up woman. The function of the camera is good, and there are some great shots of nature on the island. I offer a 7/10 film.
