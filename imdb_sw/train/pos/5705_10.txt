Good original music music from Rene Clair, as happy and beautiful as silent "Shadow of Italy". Using the voice to describe and not just for the harmful effects of the conversation, Clair affected the early music in America (the opera area from A Night in Opera has been affected by Le Million, for example). Must (but not available) appear with all cinephiles, and DVD from Accuracy is exactly the same as you would expect. No extra tons, but more of the DVD I've got is a useless fluff, and interviews Clair on the disc is one I've never seen. Find when you are near.
