I saw a film at the Nashville Film Festival. It was done well, from movies to acting. It is the story of the father and the child, and how they get to know during the family crisis. Written well and conversation that has never been a false ring, the film shows the talent of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in cast. The movie begins with the old father (Peter Falk) trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left her. The father appears to himself, unintentionally, at the door of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and child leave the next day to look at some property and end up on a regular road trip. They make fish, play the pool, watch the game of baseball, drink, share in the barbar barrel, and play with wonderful women. But most importantly, everyone faces an open tension that can affect any family. It is a kind of film that affects the heart and cares for those around them.
