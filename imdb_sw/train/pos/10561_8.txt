089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, viewed 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cube is invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we hit another music Busby Berkeley from Warner Bros. This time is the ultra-fast paced Parade Parade, and the star James Cagney as juggernaut fashionable Chester Kent manufacturers. I am 100% sure that Cagney was driving Berkeley with its unintelligible Kent, who will come up with new ideas for every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as a acid-waiting-turned-love-loving shepherd. Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subplot is not great at this time but not less enjoyable. One thing that has been surprising is the Berkeley exhibition itself, which seemed to be very strange and complicated for any action, forget what action would show the film later. Of course Busby does not allow a little thing like a barring story from putting together more-over-top music numbers can win.

I wonder if James Cagney was driving Busby Berkeley while playing Chester Kent in this film, or as a role as written was followed by Busby. I hope it was; it seems to be wise that Berkeley is a kind of guy who could see the drama of the drama in everyday events Chester's way. The strange thing about Cagney is that he did not look like a leading man in a traditional sense. He was 5'7 ", a square-head, and spoke to an unusual mood of New York. For the man he was a good mixture, with poisoning groups that made him very popular with the kind of speakers we see here. In fact, one of the cast has familiar faces, Joan Blondell returns and almost just steals the show as a trustworthy and ambitious secretary of Cagney, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler playing a good couple, but they seem to have little time of the screen than ever before, Billy Barty reverses as a horrible shock. Warner of the same year (the number of "Shanghai Lil" which has never been, with Keeler doing less work in the Chinese watch.) \ T Angel (1933).
