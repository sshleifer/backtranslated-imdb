A very few movies of chess have been done over the past few years, but this is more than a movie of his chess story about the need to be loved and the need to win, John Toturro has a psychological person challenging, no matter to accept the 64 square and 32 pieces, the game confirms as a man, when he loses a game he chooses one thing which means to him John Torturro explains this in a good fashion, even a woman's love is not enough to save him from his sad life. I am wondering if there is another Luzon out there who feels about the game, I'm sure, if you're interested in chess you won't hurt it. It is a piece of work that is well organized and properly implemented, achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt whether there will be an end.
