Blackadder 3 is probably a series of Blackadder people who have never heard - it has basic basics like the second and fourth and it doesn't have any changes in it. But it's still big - the Duke of Wellington's fire and the golden fool Dr. Johnson (author of the first dictionary in the UK) to make this series an inventory. There are still many hilarious links available in this series, and provide humor in an unprecedented time - in an accurate and enjoyable history. The third error of Blackadder is not very popular and known for the vote, but Rowan Atkinson's role as the chief master of the stupid is a wonderful and effective thing, and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very nice! 9/10
