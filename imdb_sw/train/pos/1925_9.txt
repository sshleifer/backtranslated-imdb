This should be one of the best comedies on television at this time. It takes the idea of ​​a sugar-sweet display around the family around and allows it to be a true example of the typical family of a full-blown family of parents and parents, brat brothers, guardians and sisters of the bimbo. I am almost surprised by Disney! <br /> <br /> For its credit, 'Code 8 Easy' knows it's comedy and does not try to be more. It is widely displayed (for example, 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') thinking just because their leading actors are now young and they have to deal with social issues and end up losing their sense of humor. This is a trap '8 Rules Simple'; it takes other issues (such as excluding school) but it is fun when you do it. In fact, the only time has been so great when it was carefully involved in the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. And I think, although John Ritter will be missed because he was the reason the show made his logo, '8 Simple Rules' still can do well as he remembers his humor and does not make the father of Cate the second version of Paul Hennessy.
