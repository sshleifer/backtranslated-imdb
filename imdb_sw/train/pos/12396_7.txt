This is the second part of 'Animatrix', a collection of short animation movies that tells us a little more about the 'Matrix' world. In this we learn how men and machines can not work and live together. It's a history of a little history in the 'Matrix' world. It is not the same as the first ('Osiris' Bird) but it is still a good entertainment.
