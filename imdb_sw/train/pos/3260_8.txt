People call this comedy, but when I just look, I split <br /> <br /> just once. I think the problem is that I saw the first time when I was 14 years old, <br /> <br /> and I wasn't old enough to understand that it didn't mean something to be worth it. There were a few incredible events that were expected to be funny, but I was very concerned about the laughing people. I recommend that you watch this film sometimes when you come in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it. I think you will find that, in spite of a little deception / spell, it is one of the most beautiful stories you have ever seen.
