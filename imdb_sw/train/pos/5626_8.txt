Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female women, Pat and Terry.One night she comes into her car and is infected by a knife with a knife. The policy cannot help him, because real rape did not happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's residence is working, the defendant comes there. His name is Joe.A a lot of battles start against But this can beat the eyes and mouth and pesticides, things that kill him if he does not get any help soon. Used in its early years. (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young.The basis of the play off from Broadway from 1982 by William Mastrosimone. James Russo, who played the attacker also in the game, persuades like Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia and Scarwid is as good as Pat and Terry.James Avery looks like Security Safety. He was given a selection of Golden Globe. This is not a movie that should be of interest to you. I ask the question is the right revenge. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend.
