I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opposition, the greatest of all time. I can't, however, buy a ticket at its concert at the Tacoma Dome at the U.S. I was angry to say a little. Then I've got this DVD. It was okay to be there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy this for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I would hear Hey all Jude. Paul also did not die. <br /> <br /> One big DVD concert ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** ****************
