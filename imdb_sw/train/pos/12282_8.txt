At first I didn't like it very much, though I did it. They did not have a third generation of Trueba, love between Blanca and Pedro did not explain well and other actors were very different from what I thought. Later I realized that, he had a more trustworthy movie on the book, it would be like five hours long, and it would kind of stir. Now I love it very much, because my dear characters are like I have shown you. Clara looks like a living angel, and its introduction to the story when praying for the film was wonderful, trustworthy and short-lived. Glenn Close is Ferula. I showed her as, not just to mourn everything. Esteban is getting enough. I've never loved his character, and, though I was interested in it, I hated him more, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is one of the most exciting, and has a real history there too. <br /> <br /> Movie is very good, especially considering that it was a gringo movie found in Latin America book. It is amazing how many popular stars exist, do you think?
