Having offended the Halloween advertisement of the radio announcement of the Orson Welles' classic radio world war with the real invasion of Martian, a group of Martians of Moron shows on the world looking to win their plans just go awry as they themselves get out their feature and really alone. <br /> <br /> This is often very beautiful and beautiful, and some good lines (just look at the notable quotations) for boot. It is more likely to appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time to me if I see it again soon seemed to be better than I expected. Despite the cast of an unnamed star, this can only be a Martian invasion that has ever been a film. Surprisingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent every kind of hero of the Hero Hero / Sci-Fi hero there (a 50s boy of winter, fighter fighter, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Enjoy the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare yourself! World Scum!"
