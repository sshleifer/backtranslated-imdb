A wonderful feature of the document, giving the clear direction of the country is very divided into it (for further evidence, see some comments on IMDb ...!). It compares very well to the "Comandante" of Oliver Stone (which is mainly a comprehensive screening of Fidel Castro's hair caps). I don't know if Chavez is everything that happens to yourself, or yet another in a long line of ordinary Latin-American people "caudillos". I don't know if he will be able to carry out the great expectations that he has built up among the majority of the poor of Venezuela. It is not possible to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but for now I have a clear idea of ​​what is in danger, and what it wants to consider in the middle of the revolution. Someone says in the film "we do history", and that's exactly the film that feels like catching. Good things.
