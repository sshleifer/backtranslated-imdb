Family is about two families that are available after each blood. Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a world river, using from Bangkok. She has a family in India. Once wrong he kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). As Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), the brother of Shekhar has revenge the death of his brother. Catching the family of Viren Sahay for the same reason. The film has one step to turn (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the movie is its totally where instead of its dialogs, expressing more things. The role of Akshay's minuscule has also put him in the right position with Amitab. I did not know what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this film. There were few fewer in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most demanding criminal of the city is still free of charge in the city. The grabbing of his family also seemed unknown. Does the donor family have no safety cover?
