Personally, I get a movie to look quite good. It mentions the realities of triads in Hong Kong and offers the viewer details of how the triads are framed. <br /> <br /> Not only, it shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the state of the triad and why the police are not outside and removes triads. Generally, movies are against violence due to fake and torture methods. However, the film remains true to the real world, so violence on the screen is an example of what is happening. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to any fan of Triad / Mafia. See another good can be a dragon squad. The movie has more gun than this, as in this film there is a knife more than a gun (in fact I don't remember seeing one gun).
