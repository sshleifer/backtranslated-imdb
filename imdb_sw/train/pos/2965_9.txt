Very likely one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before seeing this I recommend seeing "South Park" one of the funniest cartoons designed. Buy, laugh every time you see it. Clean stroke of genius. If you think of her funny then you don't have a soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
