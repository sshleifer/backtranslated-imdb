I came first 'My Friend of Tutor' for accident one or two years ago when playing on TV. Prior to this, I could not watch any Korean movie before my whole life, so MTF was the first Korean film I had ever seen. And it's a wonderful surprise! I had been very troubled from the beginning to the end, and I was laughing at a good time. His comic style is quite different from the comic film of Hong Kong (which I have been using all my life and so exhausted as well), breathing fresh air in my experience of watching the humdrum film. I thought there are few scenes and tricks in MTF which are pretty hilarious, wonderful, and original too. <br /> <br /> I looked at MTF a second time a few days ago, and after looking at once ready, surprise / impact of the comic on my kind of reducing. That, however, does not mean that it affects my views of the film. Instead, something else that came at this time - that motivated me - stories about how two young people, who seem to be 'enemies' who are not found to be completely healed together, and how they can solve their differences and start caring for each other without feeling themselves, reminds me of high school days past. I, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are truly compatible if both have something that is pure and true in them, the quality that separates them from people like to say, the lover of Sassy Ji Hoon. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts - part 1 deals with 'fight' between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon finds his last review with Su Wan playing (in Ji Hoon's opinion) an exciting dance, things begin to change. These speeds slow down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes she cares Su Wan than she could imagine. So part 2 deals with the development of their mutual feelings, and lead the course to the end of happiness together with the final match with the boss's team. <br /> <br /> It's just one last comment. I find that this is impossible - the fact that a 21-year-old who is known to be a 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed that almost naked in front of a promising girl and losing her 'cold' is just a little .. odd. I think that shows that Ji Hoon is a pure boy and not really looks like his appearance. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) JE, have the body with full picture! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of more than 10 most popular films of all time.
