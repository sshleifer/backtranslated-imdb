Going to see this film I was very worried because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. I did not know that I was on a journey through the magic of movies. Everything in the movie from conspiracy to negotiation and effects was close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like a star in this movie. From beginning to end comes more and more in love with this character. Michelle Pfeiffer is afraid as a evil witch who has fought to capture the stars for eternal youth and beauty. Robert De Niro is a delightful character that gives the audience a greater chance of comic relief as the movie is approaching the peak. This is generally a lively and fun movie as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable film that will be fun for children and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
