I was very interested in this film ... when it was found to develop characters, deep attention, good displays, wonderful lights and movies, good sound sounds ... <br /> <br /> It has a common size and light touch which will not be used for anyone who wants a quick action to flick fast. If we lived in Elizabethan's day, I would say this film is like Shakespearean. But because we don't know, let's say it's like a movie-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The program is simple, but the story is hard. The movie is minded in a way connected with the issues being examined. Many stories have been shown instead of being told, which I find makes it more clear and informative - and also makes a good story of a comic (or novel) story. Sometimes I felt when I was in the 1930s, part of this story - there was a true and dream quality as a way of telling. I don't often like movies in books that were dependent, but in this case I. (Although I enjoyed the book too.) I bought a DVD, which is good because it has the most beautiful pictures and definitions. I took my little cousin, who is younger than a boy in the movie, to see after seeing it for the first time, because she has trouble at home and I wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion about issues the father of the father with him - and talk.)
