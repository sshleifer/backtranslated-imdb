Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is an old chess player who tried to return to Italy. His gentleness has not been cut but his patience and chess has reduced its growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort as her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to possible possible marriage partners. Vera relies on good counting but, surprisingly, Natalia is very impressed with Sascha, who met him for a walk. Sascha, too, is taken by Natalia and proposes marriage to their second meeting. But, with a collection that Sascha must give chess and, with other events in his old days it still causes problems, will conquer Natalia's heart? Oh, and can be the winner of chess, too? This is a good film, according to the novel and Nabokov. Acting is wonderful, and Watson is very good as a beautiful rich girl with a perfect Turturro fullness as a shy, awkward chess enthusiasm. James gives a positive change as a strong mother and other delegates sent out too wonderful. By looking for the film, it can not be better. The environment is a kind of put-your-eye-out, vintage dress is good and the movies are well fired. Yes, the story is odd and told by the use of flashbacks, sometimes, making the film not everyone aware. Then, too, the end is interesting. However, if you love romance, pieces, good acting, barrier setting, or the beautiful art of image creation, do not miss this. You will be immune to many illnesses.
