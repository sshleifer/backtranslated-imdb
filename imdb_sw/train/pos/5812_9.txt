Moonwalker should not be a film to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I am a great fan and I enjoyed many movies, the last was not surprising but 50 minutes or first minutes were - if you're a fan. I personally believe the first 50 minutes are available again many times. Playing in each video is breathing, amazing music to listen to and entertaining conversations. Includes many more beautiful videos from videos and browsers from their original videos. It also includes live video clips. If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson this must be, if you don't have a fan / don't like Michael Jackson, keep it clear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
