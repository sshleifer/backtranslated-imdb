The story is about a young girl who grows in colonial Africa, but it is more than that. Anyone who grows South can get the same things. Expect another, one of the different race, which can not be completed. Even the view is not related. No words required. Their facial expressions say everything. It is a story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so powerful because they suffer because they cannot see each other. Little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. Surely he can't see this dance. One of the most influential features of the film is the laziness of colonialists. They cannot even be stripped of their bed. There is a world approaching to end; they don't know yet. Their tribal view will be wiped out with their presence. I think I would like to visit this Africa. It looks very quiet; especially at night when you hear only animals.
