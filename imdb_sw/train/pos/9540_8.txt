Most of the comments I heard on the Meatball Machine were mixed. Couples even say they think they "exploit". Well, for those people I say, get f @ thoughts and go f @ ck yourself. This was a flick of entertainment. The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and somehow changes its forces into these gwar-costume checks, death called Necroborgs. Finally you realize that these mechanical bugs also link tiny microorganisms on you, which can then control your actions by combining your nervous system. Unfortunately for two young people who want to love love, it happens to cross the path with a mechanical disorder, and before they know that changes are happening and blood becomes widespread. Is there a way to stop the change? Maybe it's a way to stop this threat of mechanical bug? Why Necroborgs fight? Do these two aspirant like to express their feelings to someone else and do evil? The only way to know. Going to the Meatball Machine I was looking at a mixed effect, but it was a great surprise. A few non-responsive questions, some of them make time and the end of a little frustration are the only points I can think of. From the anime you feel, to the parasites become the little characters themselves and even feel under the budget, this film marks the most accurate marker than it lacks. With an ongoing ongoing story that attracts enough to ask questions when mixed with the effects of doing good and splatter of blood, this is one fan of flick of fans of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter should look. 8 outta 10
