"Cinderella" is a film about a little girl whose mother died and her father remarried. Once his father died, Cinderella's mother became very important to him and made him work all around the house, like cleaning after his two evil fighters. One day the king sent a message to all female women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son, to get a wife. Of course, Cinderella did not go, but her girls did. Cinderella was very bitter and thought that there was no way he could attend the royal ball, until his female lady appeared. So he made magic and made Cinderella to be a beautiful woman, but he had to go back in midnight because that time the magic changed. During the royal ball, Cinderella loses time and two hours at night, so it runs out of the house and lose its glass glass. Then the King commands the navigator to find women who were wearing the slipper. Duke searched every house, but eventually he found women who were Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske led one of the best Disney movies in 1950. This film is about the magical Fairytale. At the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to his own family and he had no one to love him, but for a little magic his whole life changed and eventually found love. My object about "Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella's star appeared to do magic, he sang the song Bbid Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my songs that would like to go around my house, so I will never forget. I also liked the part when Cinderella and Prince sang the song So this is love when they play because they realized they love. In general this film was my famous film when I was a little child because the little girl wants to live a life story story.
