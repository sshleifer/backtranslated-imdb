When I was a video shop I was tracking through one dollar tax and I came on this small gem. I don't know what it is about it but I had an illness disorder on that and wow I was right. <br /> <br /> The story circles two girls who have just survived the school shoot. One of the girls is Alicia who is the only one who is the only witness of the complete attack and the other is another Deanna survivor who survived the bullet by head for some miracle. With the fate and destiny, they start slowly with beautiful healing and development. I hate it when awesome movies fall through cracks. Because wow is a performance with Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen without mentioning some of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD wasn't very much in special features. Oh and some cuts to jump on the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all the best movie.
