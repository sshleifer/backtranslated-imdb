Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are a few holes of conspiracy; Yes, it has quality made for TV; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" book for self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all that ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy after School Special way, but happy yet. Virginia Madsen as a mother does a good job ... so nice that I will start watching her movies. He reminded me of Diane Lane for all good reasons. <br /> <br /> Others cast a good job, too. If I am a disposal agent, I would be trying some of these small actors. The values ​​of production are on the standard TV and music levels were much greater ... better than several major budget movies I have seen. If you are in this traditional German movie this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and realistic movie, this is good. It is one you can show your 10-year-old daughter but also enjoy yourself.
