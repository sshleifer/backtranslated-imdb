Great, big, big! That's all I can say about the movie, but imdb requires at least four lines of text so I will explain. Released was good (Jerry O'connel is soooo cute!), Music was great (sixty years with the best music, imo), historical material attracted, and so did the '90s' actors looked like they were actually there' 60 years'. And most of all - the story of the main characters bring tears to my eyes, and that is the size of any game. But in one word: great!
