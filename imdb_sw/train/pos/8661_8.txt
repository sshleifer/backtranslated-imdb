I have enjoyed a series of Crime Crime and Procedural Crime for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, a female detective is very hard and seems to be very bitter in a series of criminal crimes. Look at his other side in this film. This movie shows the most amazing side of talented artists and if you are a fan of Crime crime this film is a breach of its acting and you get a very good family line of trouble in the South. I do not like Albert Finneys's role in this film because he did the same work of a South African counterpart who is hard and unacceptable and unacceptable. He reminds me of many people from my youth and to be shown by God, but you may have found it difficult to love in this film. Kattie Erbe is easy to love on this film and why I recommend it to 10 stars for Critical Interest, law and fan order.
