No people like "Show People" Marion Davies (like Pepper Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs Davies was a "piece" of this film; one of the fun spoofy which he will cut down the scarf to reveal the different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was watching this film, for now; though, I may have seen him in the role of a little memorable. Haines makes a wonderful impression, when he joins Davies for a cafeteria - plays his hat in the ring with good bits in the table to eat. Indeed, Haines and Davies offer good comic performances. The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) to guide Davies's daughter on Hollywood, some of which will be a new feeling than Tinseltown. In fact, Davies and Haines have already arrived to become a comedy star. But, Davies desires to be the true style of the queen. Davies leaves Haines, with its partners with Paul Ralli. But, viewers prefer Davies in more comic tasks; perhaps the King Vidor director gives a case of art to follow life? <br /> <br /> Full of pictures of popular Hollywood photos, both on the set, and off. Full of "big cameos"; at the lunch studio, on the star table, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best player "little", however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough courage to ask Davies for his autograph! When the delegates are happy, they, and the orderly arrangement, helps "Show People" to be under the most important film, and more documentation of important history.
