It seems only 1 season so far but this is very good !! People of different backgrounds captured the island. No one who seems to have everyone seems to have many bones in their rooms .... looks like a place of Melrose meets the Crusoe family and why is it so big? Maybe not but then gives a spoonful of X Files, a "What"? and a "hey" big and island that is whatever you dreamed - in your freakiest dreams and you will be lost. The story was very wrong and it turns out impossible. Establishment of power, working hard and acceptance of redemption that at the end of everyone is human (almost everyone ... I think ...) and the beautiful and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ...
