Despite the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this more interesting program, which even though it had only a short time, was a great idea and good lines of story. In general it is unknown for more than 40+ years will be worth looking at again. Opening credit showed many different images, one of which was a snippit of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, riding his famous rocket stick, where he was often known as "The Man Who Is the faster".
