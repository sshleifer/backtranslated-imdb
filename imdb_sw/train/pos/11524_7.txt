This is a small movie, and it must agree that there are some working in it as well. It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas fool, and is part of his dream, part of the dreams of others, and all about the showbiz job. I thought the movie was so interesting, and it has a short time or two of the real magic that makes the whole thing worthwhile. Alan Arkin is as strong as a witch who has never been, and his Max's advice makes for a good relationship with the touch. It's not for everyone, maybe, but if you like movies about the trip, then I think you would like this.
