I appeared in the "Shower" in the foreign movie shop of my local video store and reviewed it several times since the start of its cover was seen as farce or comedy. I enjoyed the purchase price for the economy and I enjoy my fortune. "Shower" is a story of three men (3), father and two (2) adult men, each discussing with life change as the world around them is also changing in modern China. Like many "foreign" films, Chinese culture is one of the most interesting features of this film. In addition to the impressive features of the local Chinese color, it provides an environment for this story, it is still difficult to touch the relationship between men and women involved in the story, all set against the rise of village bathhouse . Family stories migrate from equality to understanding and enjoying these people. It was added to the main story are many young characters, bathhouse customers, and personal conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is one film that walks away from exciting and touched by its heat and humanity.
