this was one of the most moving movies I saw. I was 12 years old when I looked at it for the first time and whenever it was on TV I had my eyes made. Acting and conspiracy is amazing. it seems to be really true and touches a lot of controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to a good game.
