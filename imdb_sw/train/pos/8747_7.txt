Spoilers possible * Although you did before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return to Paradise', Brokedown Palace is still competing with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have a story of two young girls who travel through Thailand, and arrested for drug charges. What is Clare Danes' Alice? What is Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? What is a good visitor who met them on their journey? Nothing is important, for this is the story of friendship and trust and boundaries that can be identified. Give us in Bill Pullman as a non-interested lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as a Thai master (and a better lawyer than she) and we have a good story that tells the audience. The Brakesown Palace is not strange, or notorious for any reason - not the original concept, it does not show the violence of feelings leading to the people of the wannabe-avant-garde talking about "realistic truth" or The truth hitting the truth "- is only good news and good performances. Bill Pullman has very weak in his way of laziness and way of talking - I was very tired and behaved. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, when respectful, is not an amazing thing. He does well, but not the most memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim however, is a good form, doing good and defined behavior where, in fact, there is not much to work with. But do not make a mistake - this is the Clare Danes movie. I have been a fan of his work for a long time, and this is not a change. He attracts every area he appears, and not for him, the film would be standing at a boring price. I am especially grateful for his performance in the area between his father and Darlene. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a voice of brilliant sound. About 7 out of 10
