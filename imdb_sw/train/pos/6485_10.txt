The world in war is one of the best documents about the world war. The first part tells us how Hitler started, and how he could build one of the most powerful forces in the world. They also perform military acts taken during war, and sacrifice. One of the most powerful and best documents made. All of you must look at this. Perfection! 10/10 <br />
