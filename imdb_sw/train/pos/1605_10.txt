"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I have the film on DVD! The movie works with a New York widow (Cher) who loves to her boyfriend (Danny Aiello) of anger (Nicholas Cage) who works in bread. I am glad Cher won Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are good, too. Trends from Norman Jewison (who led the "Fiddler On The Roof") are amazing. "Moonstruck" is the best movie for everyone to see and laugh. Must-look! <br /> <br /> star 10/10!
