This film is on top and books all the time. Music, camera pictures, and acting are excellent. To show the film in black and white gave it a better appearance and enhanced music perfectly, like Psycho. It is amazing how few people said on this film. I think my is that his hard movie get. I paid the film 9. Look at the movie and you will know what I'm talking about.
