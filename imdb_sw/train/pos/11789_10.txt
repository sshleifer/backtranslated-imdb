Okay, this small film is especially interesting for the artist, filmmaker or music creator or visual artist, with: A little of a humble relative. <br /> <br /> You can see the sound of the shots, pan and sound elements. Even as a simple film, this creation is a multiple array. For example, there are voices coming from all sides, while others appear (though fewer), for some points to help certain shots. One can also see several types of pots: some go up and down through gently back. There is a pan of diagonal. Zooms also goes regularly and returns. The light and structure / structure of elements in space are, as usual and clear, the work of the artist / artist. This can be seen even in this crappy room. This is to say: one can make a very beautiful art and an easy to keep view / view and create area. Then comes the image buttons: like digonales, parallel, etc.. Damage of light and color, although without a good study of textures as in major crops, it is also good. This is a diagram of a kind of artist ... \ t
