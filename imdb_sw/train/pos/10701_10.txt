Critics did not like this film. It hit a bomb in the country and the result was only released in the UK. Which was a great shame, because it represents British humor rather than America and should be displayed in the UK first. Nicole Kidman looks amazing and is a very influential Russian. Ben Chaplin is a characteristic of Dustin Hoffman from 'The Graduate', and 'Girl Girl' has at least 4 scenes that reminds the viewer of the 1960s of the classic (despite a completely different story!) A few from the comedy for the black comedy for an exciting adventure - but it's memorable, moving and breathing fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster. Look at the clear mind!
