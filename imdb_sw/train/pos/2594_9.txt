This film took the approach of Jerry Springer to the power of mankind. "Wilder Napalm" is a kind of movie proposed by the theme that I like, and addressing the idea that the American system is defined either by their gifts or by trying to hide. At the same time, the movie shows that every leader is a human being, and there is no more fear or worship than any human being. This was a good comedy, fun with humans and that little edge satiric.
