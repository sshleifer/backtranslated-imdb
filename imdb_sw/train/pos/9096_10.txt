Ideal! I saw Internal Entry into Philly in October with my children. We all loved so much that we saw the second time with my parents. I haven't heard them laugh like that for years! It was the first time I remember seeing the films that my parents and children can enjoy. In fact it is good and we can't wait to get out of the DVD. They need to make more movies like Insert Inside. It's a pleasure to go to a film that three generations can enjoy (and don't be shy). I haven't seen this beautiful movie since My Greek Greek Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. He was also in the capacity of Austin. Howard Hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious. I remember from WKRP.
