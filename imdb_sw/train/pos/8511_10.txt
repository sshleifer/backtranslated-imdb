This film repeats the word "Spring Breakumentary." Hans, one fat group, shows his talent as this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "King of the beta of $ 1," shows that again Kansas for regular and firing pieces. Kyle's laughter is actually a fact, and it gives a little candy to women too (like Matt). Few, when they have their time, did not do justice to the dance of Mexico's hat as it is suited. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives us hope all of us trembling, stopping, group, colored people who are still looking for that special person. And that hope is a small part called Cabo San Lucas. When this blockbuster has just vanished the cinema, this should turn around, since we can both involve one of these Spring revolution.
