The first day I saw Martin's day when I was just 10 years old, at home, on the Movie Channel, and still remember the results made in my life. It touched me like no other film that touched me, and I remember hurrying my eyes out. After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere. I would like to ask around and no one has ever heard of the film! I think it was one of the most unusual films that most people didn't know, because no one, and I don't mean anyone, knew what I was saying. I wanted to search for all ages, watch video store shelves and scanning cable TV list, but always came short. Finally, in 1996 I realized that I could import special, I did, and I have been looking at at least 50 times since - and still making me cry, every time. Martin's day is about Martin Steckert, a prisoner (but really good), who wishes to return to a special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place, where he lived away from nature, spent time with his dog, and was left alone to enjoy life. Recently in the movie, he runs and starts to return the way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> Not long before the fighters found him, and Steckert takes the child as a kidnapping to convince police back off. Recently Steckert and his hostage (Martin second) become the best friends, and have many adventures of fun together - from stealing a toy car, preparing a car train, all along this special lake. In all films, Steckert has huge obstacles to him in the lake as a young man. I will not destroy you at the end, but I will tell you, this film must see it. It's the most beautiful movie I have seen in my life! I am, of course, a great fan of this movie EVER! I was able to find a song by Martin two singing during the movie ("I'm going back, when I went ...) I planned to go to Canada to see the lake and island where Martin Day was closed.
