This is the best Emma in my opinion. After seeing another version (1996) which is also good, and reading a book, I think I can honestly say that this is a true translation and is more faithful to the jewel of Jane Austen. Movie of 1996 and G. Paltrow is also good, it's that it's almost like a completely different story. It is a very narrow light and cannot see the black horizon of the characters and if you want only a good movie, the person will do well but the problems of some points of conspiracy, such as Churchill / Fairfax insertion are so much higher than that. But if you want a bit of a bit open, more realistic and numerous, the TV version of 1996 is the best. Emma is a wonderful man, but he is a scared. Kate Beckinsale is a skilled in displaying a little quirks of character. You see him seeming disappointed in some of Harriet Smith's simple conversation, but he does not know that he is guilty of destroying Harriet's proposal until that stage affects the happiness of his marriage at the end. You see the narcissism of it and shows Frank Churchill because they will do harm to others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​it was playing a match match and having new friends during time and after having suffered the loss of her marriage. For Frank Churchill, it is to get a promise of a woman who loves when she treats him and others with disgusting secrets. In the book, he knows all of this by waking up everything that he has done. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow persuade them in their regret but Paltrow is a young and powerful child when Beckinsale's resurrection is true and true and you see changes from children such as selfish behavior for adults and wise. All these versions are very good but I would like this.
