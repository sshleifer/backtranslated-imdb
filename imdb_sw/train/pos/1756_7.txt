'' 40-year-old '' 'made me laugh. I don't care if it is considered a very comedy of sex, I just enjoyed a lot of jokes and scenes available in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the area where Andy has her breast chest given for a single cold one wax, especially because it is true. Many of the actors and actors present in this film are known or already known, by the way. Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a bit strange and gathers a lot of toes, but it seems to be worthless. One day, when playing poker with his friends of his work, they find that Andy is actually ... virgin! And already has been 40 years old! After this amazing revelation, all his friends try Andy sleep with a woman ... The problem is confusions Andy enters, especially now that she is actually starting as Trish, the woman met when she bought a DVD player in the shop she works.
