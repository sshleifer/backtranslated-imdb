My mother sent me to see this film when it came out next to Christmas in 1976. I know everyone laughs Barbra's hair in this, but I think he looks and looks good! ... And I seem to remember the number of women who photographed it at the time! Also, the location of the bathroom bathroom between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy! Music is also good. This is the 70 Babs of the groovy in its best!
