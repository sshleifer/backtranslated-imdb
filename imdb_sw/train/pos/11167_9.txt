My love, this movie describes the two "characters" of New York, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), all of whom are struggling to be a "big guy" in Bowery at the end of the nineteenth century. Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913), were real people, though this is a great account of their antics (according to play) the story of Cardie (did it? - it's still a reason to move!), flying from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), which emerged, is shown here as it happens at the same time as the Spanish and American wars (1898). The Walsh senior was a great love for the period, so it was restored here, and it included the rgustious ragtime number from the singer Trixie Odbray (Pert Kelt limited) .Raft is in trouble as Brodie, and Beery shows again a wise actor , as hard, hard-hearted, and sometimes touches Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love of all the boys they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "Bowery" goes at a fast pace (unlike most of the original "talkies") It's not an easy-to-find film, but it's good to find.
