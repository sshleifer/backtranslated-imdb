Tis is very short of Tom and Jerry-state is designed, conflicts arise and emotions occur. The characters act in the right way, the natural tension between the various characters causes a general unrest. The best part (and funniest) is when a peace deal deals with respect â€” all wonderful wonderful things are seen in your eyes. Word of warning-not wise to let Tom help you make your morning cleaning procedure! It is highly recommended.
