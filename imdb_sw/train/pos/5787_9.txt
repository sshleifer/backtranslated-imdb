Many are dated in this period (such as many parts of Twilight Zone), as well as a military military regiment "uniform". And other things are not believed, as easy access to clean water. Still, think of this year's time, and you understand quickly why this section is unique as you look at. It has a good sense of hope, something that is lost in many Twilight zones, as well as attractive female behavior (despite the fact that she speaks a few times), something else in Twilight. "Two" is a good example of how Twilight Zone, for more than 20 minutes, can absorb more emotions by a player than two-hour movies today. And it's good to see two people who became American icons for early in their work.
