Get this flick on videostore, it had to $ 2 purchase. The whole movie begins quite bad! Called Kanali, who is the hero here if the cover can be trusted, it must be in his eight years and it is impossible to walk. However he can beat some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves Colonel, which makes sense for the lack of an adult to do anything that should be mentioned, now two people who are expecting horrible fears are, they should be a story. I lost a hundred times but didn't mind, because the movie is so bad, it's really fun to watch. Budget Budget Disposal and executives do not deserve that name. Go look!
