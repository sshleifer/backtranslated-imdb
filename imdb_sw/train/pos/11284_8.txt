When I was a child it was the time of Lex Barker like Tarzan. I was hearing from the elders that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I could not understand why since I got the last film Weismuller in the character and I thought it was a kind of shape. It was not after many years that I came "Tarzan and His Wife", and then I understood. Spiritism is the image in this picture and looks like the characteristics of behavior that are not characterized by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. For this film I was also surprised by the physical presence of Maureen O'Sullivan, a smart woman, who works with "no-inhibitions" as Jane is going through a time when the film was made (Tarzan pushes she into the naked pond as he has been ignored, one of the investigators kissed him in amazement and though he did not kiss the back of the bus then let him do it a bit and does not make a big deal from him; These behaviors did not think of "Janes" coming as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all of those who play the most unsuitable women who make it hard to believe that they can live in a hostile area like the African Jungle 'Sullivan who plays quietly changes Tarzan himself, unless the course comes to action and Weismuller leads easily; The mixture is perfect. Another reflection in the film is the secondary role of Cheeta and not as a major direction as the future images of Tarzan where he often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and His Partner" is like a good product in its kind (Tarzan film) and maybe it's best, though it must admit that I also enjoyed "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) made by the big budget and powerful support cast (and in spite of Gordon Scott only accepted in the lead position with its perfect "physical exercise" that is not recommended for a man of rustic rope. <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
