Taking a collection of old stories brings challenges to the production team, how this common behavior can be brought to date and making it attractive enough to catch new audiences during stimulating memories from its former audience. In my opinion, their message was completed. You must see for young children, before young people, young people, and their parents. Well there is a terrible time that is solved in a short time, but parents with young children should sit well, the movie goes to good things. I will go with the wise viewers who tell that Emma Roberts gives us a good example for young women, and not right about it. Nancy her female balance and skill skills. Plenty of fun here, it laughs, you don't have too much, the secret to solving (one can pretend yourself as extra bonus, and good character) Nancy Drew even makes a good movie of the date in my opinion.
