I went to see 2 times this movie, my friend went to see it at the party to release, and was telling me it was too big, that I expected too much about the film, talking, I couldn't enjoy because I didn't look at the nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt it in the form of a party. I loved music is just the best. <br /> <br /> As Tom Barman improves his leading talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking. If you can save this film as the first you must have talent. It is done by the stars of the big Belgians (Dirk roofthooft) and a top talent group like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
