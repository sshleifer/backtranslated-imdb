This is a political political satire. It is not surprising why it is so largely ignored in the United States: it shows our foreign policy of murder for what it is. Another beautiful image from this time, Rendition, was also expelled because it showed, precisely, that the US is a war machine that has been fought on disruptions, killings, and massacres in its attempts to the world. <br /> <br /> The clever way, acting good, great star (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) And some hilarity events should make this film hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in mass murder.
