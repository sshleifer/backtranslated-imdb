Do this one in the winning array, this was a very good movie. Acting performances were huge and the script was very good. Helen Hunt was as good as Riverside Police Officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a bad habit. He was a rookie copo and the Riverside Police. He ended up with a colleague who knew he had a wife and children, all the time he took a dangerous job to go down to catch the killer. Jeff Fahey (President Ray Liotta appeared similar) worked as confused, often, with a police connection with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was quite opposed when dealing with his feelings and his extravagant aspects of marriage. Steven Weber, especially from Sitcom "Wings", did a good job as quiet, gentle, under society. On the face, he was an innocent offender, but under the face he was lying a cold killer. Weber actually took a young persona as thirsty and thirsty to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The entire movie was awesome. Each area, sharing each word to inform us more and more about characters. The production team did the work of innovation and freezing days, if not the weekly events in the 90-minute movie.
