Romantic romantic / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan write love letters to each other without one knowing who they are. Usually, they work together and can't stand. You can assume others. It is well prepared and cast down (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a wise, intelligent writer and quite visible. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself convinced I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks as perfect and as a dream. One film type. Don't miss it!
