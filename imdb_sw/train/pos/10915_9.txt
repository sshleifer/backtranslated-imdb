The College of RKO decided to pay both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of the largest attempts to finance the fame of The Thin Man. They succeeded at a certain level. Many people have forgotten that in addition to earlier than Nick Charles, Bill Powell has also played in Philo Vance's small films in the role of head. So at this time he was very well set in the role. Dr. Bradford does not make lunch like Nick Charles, but Nick's base is still located. One difference is that when Nick Charles married heiress, Doctor Bradford works as a doctor. That helps in its detective avocation and actually makes it in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two killings. Jockey falls the horse coming into the homestretch of a great race and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer condemns something far, but has been hit by the usual way to shoot. That's after coming to Bill Powell for help. Myrna Loy was the most influential on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur plays like a dame dame than Loy did. But it works here and he and Powell have good chemistry. James Gleason who is the most reliable is a police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All that they need here is Asta and maybe Eric Blore as the pastor of Powell was trying that place. If Powell and Arthur were signed on this studio we can see the killings of Bradford movies.
