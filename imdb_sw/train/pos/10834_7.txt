I was not "Still Crazy" for any real desire. Another picture of rock'n'roll, I realized ... good beauty for babies. This film is a place, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously helped the Tina Turner biography, and is very successful in his style. I think it should be that this was his last film. <br /> <br /> Posted well. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as assistant band. Director-turned-director Bruce Robinson looks like a washed-up guitarist guitarist. He does a good job, though he is not seen in the film since the end of the 70's. 7.4 out of 10
