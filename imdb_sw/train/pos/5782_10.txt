Database Database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV displayed on the "Oddities" program, after "head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I saw at this time was the VHS tape and all the events in the film without faint in the middle or waiting for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have a story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a great hero or bum, Julie social worker or animal queen, Sarah girl who should listen under Smiths and Mr. Gone guy who can not appear to keep his head up. And then there are other good beings ... I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to identify which parts of the story are real and which is a dream. Perhaps both are real or dream. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one has the dreams of others. You will need to wait and know. I had comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The diagram was amazing and the story was original - unlike anything you will find in Superman or Batman. It will strike your mind, and it has great power of adults without having dirt or anger. And the show used a real sketch (now underway) with the same story ... to ensure that the beauty shown in the comic will be produced faithfully. This was the best show to appear on the "Oddities", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like dark drama or you need a good mental walk, this is a watch show. It's "Donnie Darko" before it has never been anything. The most surprising thing is that this has never been the same film or television series, but I have not told it to despair. By keeping it simple, they have closed this film with gold and set it free from the pain brought by the success of the series.
