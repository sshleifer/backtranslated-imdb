It is rare to find a film that provides a plot that cannot be seen every time. Surprise all the time you please. Some things that I did not understand quite though are here you have a female female character who plays "a beautiful girl, a hard worker" and yet at the end she ends up becoming a victim of social risk. That wasn't enough to make me dislike even though it stood still. Another thing I couldn't find was an old man who was being chased by the police at the end of the film. I've never found who he or what his things were. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what they might be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and fun around and always left me guess. Very worth seeing.
