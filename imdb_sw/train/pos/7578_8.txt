Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the "Zatoichi" blind player in a total of 27 movies, concludes the trilogy of Hanzo with this excellent film that gets to make love to the spirit, Mark Midori (Blind Beast). The big stick, used frequently in the search for justice, is retired for ever. Katsu was an ordinary person because he drove those who could steal from the treasury to give a large sum to those who could not pay. <br /> <br /> The amazing amazing swordplay and the skill of the big guy was now, with blood. I will miss you.
