Measuring E <br /> <br /> I have never owned Nintendo 64 but I have played once more. For my opinion with the Badha Opportunity Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. often with its beautiful every time. If you have N64 and infinite with this game you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were games of video but Super Mario 64 has 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment. For the game it is a kind of weird but there's a lot of things you can do in the game.You play like Super Mario and once again you must rescue the Princess and the 120 stars power from Bowzer.Now you can do it in 3D settings. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good game for N64 and I recommend. <br /> <br /> 10/10
