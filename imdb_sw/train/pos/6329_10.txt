Movie worship for every Russian specialist. Everything is brilliant, especially the act: it's beyond any attribute. The movie, as a book, is full of symbols: my favorite one more bright sign of Razrukha (the word colloquial Russian for "destruction", often denotes the time of dirty life after 1918-20 Civil War) - wide- The door that blows into the brick wall entered into the snow and the black-hole door behind it. Now the film is released on a DVD with a fully restored voice and voice 5.1, there is also an English translation, although some of the bad words of Sharikov were replaced by more versions in translation. I don't know that the DVD is available abroad but if you get it right away, it's really worth checking. <br /> <br /> And, in conclusion, the fact: about 50 percent of Russians today, especially young people, can be identified as Sharikovs on a large scale. It is the after-effects of the Soviet: Soviet people seemed unprepared for the news of Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry with amazing media for violence, anxiety and thoughtless make it dark for every Russian. Even among the third-party users of the third party use dirty language on forums and conversations because it is surprisingly common in the club's speech.
