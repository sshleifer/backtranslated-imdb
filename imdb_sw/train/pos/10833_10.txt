This film made me cry at last! I look at at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw loads of great movies, even more guardians. But when you finish the area - catharsic on the basis - came I was washed! And if you do not - you have serious problems! Myths are archetypal - no new or natural. But it is true - because that kind of stuff came true and that people are right. Glam is not my kind of music but I am very happy with what they walked in 70 years ... This time we refer to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never works very well. But this film has just played the whole ... Because it does not try to do it as a way of full festivals of glory, present artists who are superheroes, girls groupie who are ignorant and emotionally numb, do not respect drugs and alcohol, promote rehabilitation and redemption which comes even 20 years later ... again no big movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I have not been promoted by the movie.
