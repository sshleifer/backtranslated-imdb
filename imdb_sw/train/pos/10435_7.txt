My hour was late but I am happy to see all along with the supporters ... which thanks me to the creators of this flick by providing clean and basic treatment for a romantic idea… and separating it from a small amount is from the idea of ​​relationships! If much has been written on the film already, it would only be appropriate to show small parts of the movie that I loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Celine are making their phone calls to the following friends were the wise way to understand each other for what they meant to each other through the journey even even extending hrs 24 ... curiosity of two people who all think that another has had a negative impact on another has been very effectively dealt with ... <br /> <br /> In the presence of a plot, making a romantic story work on fresh conversation is not an easy task to achieve. br /> <br /> I believe in the romantic flicks of that taste, the characters do not make it clear even in the minds of the author and director. What the executives provide is what happens between them. The right or wrong even the hearers of the idea will find it difficult to justify ... the character, the life that the drama gives goes beyond orders and stories ... here all the workers are working only for RIGHT! Kudos .. !!! and Before the fall of the evening is the other feathers that make this more beautiful!
