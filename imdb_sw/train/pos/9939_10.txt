This is a series of cartoon where many of the actions take place in the human body where actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc. I do not try to explain for more details, you will only need to see for yourself: You will not be eligible. I remember this look like a child in 80 years (with Swedish sounds). I spoke to a few people who were also children in the 80's and also loved it! I must admit that part of the education session did not think of me at the level of awareness but the whole idea of ​​educating children when they are happy is amazing. I have seen a few times; there is humor and heart in it which is difficult to find in other children's programs today. <br /> <br/> 5/5
