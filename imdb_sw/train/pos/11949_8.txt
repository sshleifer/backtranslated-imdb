The second movie of Woody Allen set up London. The Tarot Cardinal is to kill prostitutes in London. Sondra Pransky journalist (Scarlett Johansson) gets the tip that she can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). He starts to love her but loves quickly. He is assisted by the wizard of Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who does not like what he sees. I love this better than the rated "Match Match" since last year. It was short and was moved more quickly. This plan is old but I was happy and stressed until the end. It's not really comedy but hidden with a few beautiful comedic lines (both from Allen of course). It is not one of Allen's best but it is better than the worst. <br /> <br /> Acting is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad but played this character a million times before and has found tiresome. But Johansson and Jackman are good - they seem amazing and give two very interesting performances. Allen (surprisingly) works for refusal of their sex - there is a sequence where they both have in their bathing suits to show their beautiful bodies. The only Debit is that Allen still looks safe how to beat London. She is not as far as she was on "Match Point" though - maybe she just get better if she keeps together. <br /> <br /> They should see. I offer 8.
