What a little class of UK movies! It's about time. And the dividing side when you come boot! Anyone who wants to join a little freedom from their young people without this permission will show a ticket. <br /> <br /> It is a mix between "Withnail and me" and "Easy Rider". The movie runs faster and does not allow you to remove it for a long time ... Sometimes there is a time for reflection, but I think they are sure and enhances characters who act. I was a little worried by the behavior of Phil Daniels at the beginning but thanks he failed over half the way through what was the funniest pictures of the whole movie! I have often found my stomach laughing through this film is possible to persuade some people around me. Oh well. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend it completely. This will be a cult of Britain. Certainly worth a visit.
