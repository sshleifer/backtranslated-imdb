Alas! It's one thing I can say about this movie. I am one of those people who love cats so that they would be a great part of the movie, but I loved how cats from each other had their revenge. I liked the movie, but I must admit it because I saw Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very failure, I think the disappointment got better when I watch this movie. There was one thing I had a high ambition. I watched Charmed before and Brian Krause married Holly Marie Combs, her kissing place was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but it is very bad to compare with its scenes of kissing and Holly Marie Combs, I don't know whether it is because Krause and Combs have a great chemistry or maybe a little more more, that was just a disappointment in the movie but I think it was created by Brian Krause in jeans the donkeys that he was wearing in the film. <br /> <br /> If you use to see Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs of heaven and your son's father with a great surprise with this movie, he was nothing like a boy's angle. Although now I think about it, it would be nice to see the character of Krause on Charmed taken over by evil provoking something like her was in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also say music was great in this movie too!
