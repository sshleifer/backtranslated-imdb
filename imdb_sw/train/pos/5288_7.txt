This awesome cartoon of Bugs Bunny sees the return of Marvin Martian and Mark Martian and his side of k-K-9 dog green. This time instead of trying to destroy the world Marvin is on the ground mission, catching the Earth and returning to Mars. Of course the choice creature is Bugs Bunny. In Bugs first you think Marvin and K-9 are a trick or treat but you don't know this can't be right when Marvin expands a rabbit hole with a gun. Bugs try to deceive his way out of the situation in several ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 plans to rotate. Finally he is sent using Acme strait-jacket ejecting bazooka. Surprisingly, for the products of Acme, it works as it is announced by Bug is forced to use its wits to get K-9 open, the tables have turned recently and two martians troubled by the bugs tries to fly their plates back to the world. I enjoyed this though the end is slightly weak compared to the whole story. Marvin's voice has changed a bit here and it gets emotional when he is angry but this didn't make me like him or a little cartoon.
