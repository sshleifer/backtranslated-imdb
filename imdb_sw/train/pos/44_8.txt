When asked about this film I thought it would be another flick. I was wrong. This movie sends powerful messages about judging others. I moved a lot. Everyone has found, I have suggested this film. No one came back saying it's bad. Busy, also did a great job with his role in this film. I don't know a lot about his work but wow, they way he pulled off the end of this filled was good. <br /> <br /> At first it was slower. But after going to hospital .... wow, the movie gets again. I don't care why this film is not spoken in the film world. I wanted this film to be reopened and broadcast ... because it sends a powerful message for an hour and a half.
