I was just ashamed to enjoy every part of Pushing Daisies this season, hoping that the strike of the authors will not remove brutal at the start of a very good show. Ned is a pie manufacturer who owns a restaurant in the center of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private inquiry and his unique quirks as his love to connect. Charlotte (Chuck) is the once dead-but-no-friends friends of Ned's life. Olive is jealous but good. O, adding dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his beautiful description of the show. Chuck, Ned, and Emmerson as well as Olive and the dog often solves many secrets of murder with the help of a special Ned gift to bring dead people. The show is funny, clean, and romantic in a very nice and beautiful way, and I would recommend to anyone.
