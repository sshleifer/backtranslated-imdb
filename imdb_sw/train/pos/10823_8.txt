I have loved Johnny Concho all the time and I would like this film was out of VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in her work in this. When we meet Frank in the role of film title, he is a notorious gunman who is out of town now. The brothers overcame fear in the heart of the city and Frank takes great advantage of convincing the people of the city in its shade. Phyllis Kirk only has any feeling for him. She is the daughter of the shop Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other armed men arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and apparently Conrad has killed the Sinatra brothers and arrived in his town to take. They hurt Sinatra and run out of town. Kirk follows. Sinatra Night turns from a punk on a coward and becomes a man looking for a certain spine. It is a good performance performance, almost like its Oscar job selected in a Man with a Golden Arm. Being compassionate for some reason this has not been seen for years. Two other note shows are Keenan Wynn as a former weapons player turned out to be a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand for Conrad and Giza. And then there is Conrad in what I believe was his work on the screen. He is a wonderful man of adultery, walking in the evil of the body and speaking on the silver screens. However, what I like about Johnny Concho is a peak that is unknown where Conrad and Dark are being addressed. Just say I believe Johnny Concho was the answer to MGM for the Sunday Sunday and the primer for what you do when evil causes the law to break all the rules.
