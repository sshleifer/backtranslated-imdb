Anyone not laughing through this film is anointed. I have looked at it at least twice and still have tears in my eyes in many cases. Sally Field is quite perfect as Celest Talbert, a star of soap that will hold waiting is trying to get its place instead of hoping that their star will rise. Fields, at 45 years of age, still have a wonderful pixie and good quality and a perfect figure that has three children. I am so happy, I have loved her. The release of "soap" is filled with stars that do their work in full. Kevin Kline is perfect, like Robert Downey Jr. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as a good manufacturer of costumes, and better, Cathy Moriarty as Nan Nurse who leads the plot to get the field of Fields removed from the show is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This movie should win Oscars for the best comedy, the best leading woman in the comedy, the best leading man in comedy and many other bests, including writing, leading and helping executives with actresses. Get a DVD to watch it again and for the next twenty-five years. You will still be laughing when the disk is off.
