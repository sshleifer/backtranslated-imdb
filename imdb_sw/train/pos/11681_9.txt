Many reviews and comments I have read about this film say that this is a common film and performance with Clara Bow. Although the story line was common to the future of the clarity of Clara, I have still found it very encouraging and exciting. Clara has a happy girl to go to Hawaii who stops anything from defeating someone she loves ... never know that this person is married! Clara's lack of humility was surprising that day, but I believe it enables you to enjoy the great beauty of the movie. Although it is certainly not a brilliant story (quite common, in fact), this film is a good reflection of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
