Easily and intelligently played with two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is rather a stretch of imagination. Hazel Young runs the race to the mayor does not seem to be a place, to be honest. When the work is done well and all involved with the movie tends to have no real sense of the game. Perhaps we have grown to expect the truth of the exhibition in the movie, rather than compare Pollyanna and How Green Green Valley! Never worry, each of them is good in their own way. Thank you for Joan Plowright even if his role could fail here. The recreational road of the road is suitable for a small audience, and how good a regular appearance of a good classical music which is almost a shortage! I get this movie to be welcomed as it shows high-quality, values ​​of thinking for years of growth, and no violence thanks to goodness. Family warming film enjoy.
