Dear Beloved, <br /> <br /> Final Battle between Rebellion and Empire. The Second Death Star is about to be completed and when it is finished it will inflict punishment on the Union. Luke Skywalker, who is now a knight jual, returns from Tatooine and Han Solo and Princess Leia, who is now revealed as a twin sister of Luke! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator in the Endorian Forest when Lando Calrissian leads the Star Star attack. Do they not know that the most skillful trap is placed on them and King Palpatine himself rests on the construction of the second Star of Death. <br /> <br /> Return of Jedi is a very favorite of the original Trilogy. It has been a step, drama, romance, great battle, doing amazing work, amazing fighting scenes, and amazing music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is now mature in Jedi Knight, he is a young man with a naive farm and his place is quiet, calm Jedi decided to save galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film with Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie are doing their roles for T while James Earl Jones is still a great man of the film: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also the best villain as a deviated King and cruel King Palpatine. The performance of this film is surprisingly surprising and the fight of the sword is dramatic and beauty. John Williams's logo is still cool and tightening the film to several levels. <br /> <br /> Signs, Collection of regular DVDs
