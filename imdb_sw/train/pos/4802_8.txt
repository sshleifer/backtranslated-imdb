I have seen this event this evening, in the most recent testimonies and one of our local independent ways, which now show two events every day of the week. If the gentleman is guided by the other side, the original suggestion here, I agree this may not be one of the best plans of the series, but I enjoy yet. My father was a friend of one of the chiefs (in my town, Cincinnati), for whom little Ser Serling had worked in the media there - and I remember Father explaining how he has knowledge and creativity he remembered there. In general "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true artists on television, and as a result of its production during the Cold War period, it provides not only a contemporary view of the country, but also (today) photography damage to the production technique , creative ideas and actors of these era decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Small "spoiler." * <br /> <br /> This story shows, as well as other exhibitions in this series and elsewhere, a story where the country's territory means to give "amazing" ended. Sometimes the characters are in the world, from elsewhere, when the first story denotes at least one is "World." These often included the message (like here) of the conditions caused by the doomsday bonds after being caused by the high power during the Cold War. Watching today, a story like this provides a sudden look at this worldly view of 4-5 years ago, and still giving some food-to-ideas. - as did this part. <br /> <br /> When dialogue cannot spread many heads of themes, it still offers a simple, important, and essential 20-minute recreational experience and interest.
