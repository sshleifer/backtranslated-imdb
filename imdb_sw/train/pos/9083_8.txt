I enjoyed this film and I had very low expectations for all the negative views I read before going. I went because I wanted to know what this had been because some publications were angry with this movie by the Koreans. Oh and it's from Korea that has given some of my favorite movies. I loved the Army but not my favorite. Some of my sci-fi / fantasy movies that you love so you can have a sense of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Resident, LOTR, Stargate, Giza City. It didn't mix like everyone said and monsters looked good and great battles. There are some holes in the story but it didn't mean. I have a kind of things like that and I have been asking for why long ago when I see the summer blockbusters. The Korean text was amazing, the regenerated items were different, and I thought the main characters were dressed as Korean actors in other exhibitions. Ethan's hair (Behr) seemed to be Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be better and I hope later that Korea, with a normal sense of life, strong emotions, and unexpected moisture, can bring some difference to a blockbuster type. Maybe the combination of Army and Army in the future?
