In small Phones Micro stooges are there better. In this short, trio is people working in the recording studio. They end up watching Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the spring sounds. Sounds are amazing. The evil in the drag is heard by Ms Biby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. Three stoogs go to a party where Curly will wear a dress. They play the sound of spring sounds and all go well until Moe destroys Curly's head record. They use the lucia sex until they know it and open it. Alice Van Doren closes to a boy screaming and hiding behind the curtain to help them. All is well until baritone wondering how Curly sings without the help of phonograph finds Alice behind the scenes. Three things have been revealed as deception but Alice's father finds her daughter's talent and admits that she should be a singer. Stooge is knocked out of the room. Better.
