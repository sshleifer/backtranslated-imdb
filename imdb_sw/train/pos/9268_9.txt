On the face of the film about women wishing to see a football match without much rejection of a non-interested person as I am not yet about soccer is about the discrimination and females of the women's favorite film game opens the day of the Cup qualifying match The world between Iran and Bahrain, the girl tries to enter the Azdan field of Tehran by wearing it as a teenager, looks like she will get until until the soldier tries to find her. Once arrested, they are taken to a small field on the outside of the field where there are a few women who have already been found, here they are protected by a small group of group soldiers that the leader would like to return home to advocate for livestock. We do not learn the names of the character but we know it as people like girls pray and the guards leave them to watch though the closest gap in the wall and when they refused to try to get at least to comment. Even the most important thing about the lack of gender discrimination for a large number of days now Iran film has a lot of hilarious time as "hiding" one of the girls is wearing when going to the toilet with a girl who hid himself as a soldier and he was just caught because he chose to watch a match from the seat reserved for a senior officer. Participants for the game are that at last the viewer may be on the edge of their expectation seat that Iran will win and so go to the end of Germany. Soldiers are not depicted as fundamental human beings, only those who are there because they should have time to explain to girls why a woman cannot watch men's games does not seem to be sure of their own arguments. It is embarrassing that this film cannot be seen in Iran itself but it is good that a wider world could see it and thus see ordinary Orthodoxy is not a group of fanatics who are struggling to fight in the west but ordinary people with similar desires like people everywhere. The wind did a good job in making the characters appear as real people rather than just a picture.
