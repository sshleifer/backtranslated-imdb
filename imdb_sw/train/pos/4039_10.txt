Many of the complaints I have heard of this film come in one thing: It's not the difference. Yes, cast and staff are essentially the same. Yes, Kitamura eliminates a few shots on combat scenarios occurring in the second half of the film, but that is about the identical end. This is done primarily out of the outside, and demonstrates the ability of Kitamura to do business B interesting in natural areas. For Alive, almost everything is done inside. In small, reduced space. Here the creative art is hit on your face, and what is the creation of art! We are dealt with in a number of beautiful and attractive places, and our characters are in a large part of the space. Also important difference is that we can't get many steps here until the end of the film. The difference was on action and cold, here the more emphasis on the LOT is placed on characters and situations and combine with your imagination. Because of this, Alive is more interesting film than Versus. You can't log in to go to an unusual area to watch five or ten minutes of losing blood, but you'll sit on the screen for about two hours to watch the interaction of a few interesting characters. <br /> <br> Now I am glad that I ordered the DVD despite naysay. You should also! But make sure that this is a different animal from Versus - often decreases, and requires a little bit of ideas to get more. I hope Media Blasters takes for the release of DVD DVD!
