When his DVD was released I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was in the right way if I expected it before buying it. The amazing story of what else I can say to Will Smith, has been an amazing actor as always if it is a movie or a great act. It always gives the performance of the record to swallow. I think this is a movie after August rush that makes the person right while watching. The way the director explained the story was very real. His past life and new life on the film were explained to the audience correctly. Even I couldn't find any fault in the story or how they beat it. I think his DVD should be a house because this would be a good thing for your collection. It is not a movie that requires the horn of the ass for enjoyment, this is the film that allows listeners to learn the lesson. now what lesson can you see when you look. I advise those people who are critics of the film please check this if you find any objections about this movie then please say to me.
