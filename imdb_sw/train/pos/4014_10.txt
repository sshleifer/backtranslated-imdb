Spoiler for anyone who is fortunate to see this film (so it is not completely destroyed after all). Seeing this film when it was released and can still remember its parts. It is all put in a small town in the west or what remains of the city. It resembles most of the city of a few local inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is very bad. He lets his man die at the end of the film and leave the city but cross the desert. We do not know what happens to him next but only before the departure of his dead person strikes after him and deliberately does not respond to him instead of water. He does not know that soon he will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills two bad boys in a bad story - but that's another story, which I don't remember very well. The remainder of the film was that it was the first time I saw a very bad woman on a film, who pretends to be nothing but evil - can't be compared to a witch in 'Snowwhite', who, in comparison is easy to know. The western west has a few main characters and still holds.
