Remember that I did not say that it is better ... for more fun. Lack of community and realistic definition helps keep things moving. It was a kind of surprise that this was not a Troma movie, since it has all Troma's trademarks, as well as the manufacture of acidic water, preferences from Women after daily killings, The area of ​​the brutal rape (which is the most difficult type of anger, because the offender is a snowman striker) and dumb deputies. There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who is said to have no feet or feet, gives a police car near the city. Although it should be close to (or below) freezing, there is no breathing of the person showing and no exhaust of the car when the cars are running. The snow reminds you more of travel or styrofoam nuts than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. The little girl gets scared for her boyfriend a few hours after her brother is killed. She tells him in breaking into the house of sheriff, everywhere, to get it. But first, he tells him he needs to build a good fire in the fire and open the wine. After the head of Jake's old boy is cut off by a sled runner, his father says to sheriff about whether Tommy, the son of sheriff, had nothing to do with it. Sheriff insists that Tommy did not want to fight with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet more than Tommy." At that time, the back man comes, "It's no longer!" When a bad snowfall begins to melt, the sheriff fights with a flat striker who has made some sort of fabric for a long time. This is better than to deal with Tarzan and rubber crocodiles or gladiators to cope with molds made. If I am an actor, I could not keep the same face at this point. <br /> <br /> For all, an enjoyable film. There is even the blood.
