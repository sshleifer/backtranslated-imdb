What do I say about this beautiful film? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considering that this is my main city. I am very sci-fi aficionado and enjoy the film of the kind of action. I came to be up all night and was almost ready to call it the day when I saw this film playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi film or kind of any kind. Let's just start by saying that I'm not a fan of Pastor or Eric Etebari, after looking at a few moments (his performance seemed like stale and robotic). But he was able to overcome the truth in this practice. I mean to win me. After seeing Cellular, I didn't think there's a lot in the way to act in this person. But his performance as Kasakula was just amazing. He was very influential as a bad demon. But there was deep depth for this character that surprised me completely. Later I looked at the web and I found that Eric won the best Actor awards which is worth considering his best work and getting my honor. Now I continue to read about this fx and this project project and I would just say that I did not listen (sorry sorry). They had done well but I was very fascinated by the story - which I think was more than his goal (Seeing films such as Godzilla for just the worst consequences). I couldn't sleep after this film to think constantly in my head. The family situation of abuse is not easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and he almost cried because it touched him so after living with abuse. This is one film that I think about always and would recommend very much.
