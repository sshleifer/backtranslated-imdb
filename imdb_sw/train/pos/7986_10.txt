This is a good, breathing movie. It is the best I have seen that shows the current realities in South America ... slaughter, bribes, brutal and ambitious police officers with senseless feelings towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actor. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is well documented and displayed, I believed every minute. Sent is a brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is as good as always. Walken lights on my screen if there is no other actress. I would love to see more of both. The real place is amazing. The camera function is interesting and different. There are many Latin actors popular in cast, making it more attractive to people known by the American cinema. I strongly recommend this film.
