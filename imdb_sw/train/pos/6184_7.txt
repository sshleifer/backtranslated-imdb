Since this is the Black History Month and I look at the achievements of many African Americans on the film in historical order, I got this film on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and its Orchestra were in it. The Jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was an amazing mix of the genocide of comedy music. Many other numbers I love are Kitty Carlisle especially "Sweet Marijuana", "Carcktails for two" of Carl Brisson with his duet and Carlisle earlier, and those who are Gertrude Michael who is as big as the woman you hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen may go too long for their love / hate banner as a producer and detective but you grow up. And Toby Wing is a proud girl who is not Nancy who keeps trying to say something to Oakie but gets "Not now" from her every time. While many characters are committed to murder that happens, I am not surprised by the revelation of who did. And get the burden of childbirth here (although of course their breasts are covered, either with their hands or on the top flimsy). This was clear before the Code. It is worth looking for any buff of the film of the kind of thing. P.S. As a long-time Louisiana host, I would like to see when someone was born here as Carlisle was originally New Orleans.
