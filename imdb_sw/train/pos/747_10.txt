Although I was born a year in which this movie came out and it has not been heard until my high school year (1996) when I saw it I had a laugh and cried and heard with the characters because I and my friends were theirs. Their hair, clothing and speech were outdated but the feeling and despair of every situation were very good! I remember thinking about how it was true and how I wanted to make such movies yet. I actually saw this video tonight after being in a mad party (not the same as the one in Jay's house) that had been destroyed by what we had lost those lost who had been beaten on the fringes of our crowd. The type of world BS'er and the "responsibility" mother of a kind of figure I had once acquired with Jeanie (I also had a car) though I had a little bit of uncertainty for Madge around there too. My best friend was Deidre and his best friend from childhood was our Annie. Looking at the place where Jeanie is at school or one where she and her boyfriend burst and then tells Madge how much she loved she felt like a conversation with the conditions I had. Now I was 27 years ago I saw the film again and I felt an increased sense because it was like looking back my young piece (though no friend of mine died). I think this must look for all 13 girls and above.
