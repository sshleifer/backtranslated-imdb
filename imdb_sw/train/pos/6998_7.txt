Entering the Second Seven was not sure sure to think because the preview was left out to understand what the film was about. So within the first 20 minutes or so you are completely lost in the plot, don't know what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is a great storm. All this comes to an end when "misleading", to say, is done for the last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will be smith) was worried and haunted by a serious accident made resulting in the end of seven people life. For this he decides to make seven new people who need bad help that he turns on to give his life. <br /> <br /> The film's film is good, if I feel smith no matter what section looks attractive. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of his best movies, away from the eye of an eagle that I think is above. He has had a good but he saves this film. Other actors, such as powerful Harrelson, have very little responsibilities and are not a big responsibility to understand behavior. Although the making of the film was still good. This game was not what I expected and of course it is a slow pace that I expected. The movie, however, was still very good. There is nothing revealed until the end of 5 minutes of the movie and everything takes place. Until then it looks just like a loveless story. Think of the last seven pounds = Seven stars.
