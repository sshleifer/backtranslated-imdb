If I'm not a fan of almost every post "Living bad" films John Waters, I dropped it to "Pecker". After emerging from underground, the water generated litter of its original works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") that the die-fans would be seen and taste like a liqueur of water." Pecker ", which does not attempt to fix early success, is a limited definition, stability, simplicity on the vagaries of the celebrity and the bravery of the world of art. The most famous art of creation has never been able to think of anyone who can give if they did not have the reputation of the “Name” of water.
