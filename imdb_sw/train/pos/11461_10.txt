In addition to the fact, that in all this surprise this movie has grown beyond my expectations, this brilliant picture of the movie history of the crappy filters in the best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show solidarity with all existing. Usually a woman thinks of her real goals. The latter was as shocking as the murder of Keith Scott and his great brother. <br /> <br /> The events of the 'wiking ground' are as I remember from my previous trip. - Being honest with my passion for trash movies makes this possible in my unfinished collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all people with love and the most horrible brother from Tree Tree One. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
