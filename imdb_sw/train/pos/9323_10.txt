For me this film was powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; we were like brothers. This movie brought clear memories. For some reason, I did not put my vote for this film that would have been 10. I have continued to get a message like "No votes have been set." You will try again tomorrow (Monday). The little things I ignored. It was a relationship between the characters they found me. Conditions and realities. I've been in their couple. <br /> <br /> Gem of the movie. Like "Spring Forward" is another neglected. I have some fun movies like these are still being done; about the relationships between people, well written, clearly identified and the first acting and guide. After all, isn't that what?
