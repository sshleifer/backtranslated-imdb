There are not many movies around that give me a feeling like Stardust did all in the film period. As the story of the royal text as the King of the King, Stardust is the most spectacular spectacle of the 2000 years as well as the 1990s. anyone watching this film without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know exactly how it will end, but it's a journey and not a destination that incorporates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, and not a decimal down.
