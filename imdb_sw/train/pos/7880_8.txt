The fun MGM music program is available and is often interesting, dealing with the wind and romance but the film's focus has bestowed on a good combination of the talented champions and titles of Eleanor Powell, who was appointed by Tommy Dorsey and her orchestra, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. The red Skelton gives the bills up with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given many minutes of comedic, although Skelton is better when he, as it may believe, makes like Powell's love, and Virginia O'Brien actually give more of the humor film as a friend of dancer. Powell's technical advice is confirmed during one of the most amazing areas that Buddy Rich contributes to his running skills, and which should be viewed several times to allow a breathing person to deny its accuracy. Director Edward Buzzell uses his good work to move that step together with a registered script which must be able to handle, and allows the possibility of powell to control it, as appropriate.
