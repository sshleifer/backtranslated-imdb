Great stories and messages. Joan Plowright is as good as "Phoebe", Mike Kkululeko is a hilarious master like "coach" and Richard de Klerk has the role of "Carmine" superbly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts good performance with Ingrid as "Hazel" leads first. This film is headed by Jo-Beth Williams. Editing is the first level.
