Long-term fan of Bette Midler, I must say her live concerts are my favorites. Bette pleases us with her jokes and brings us tears and her ballads. The true sense of talent and talent, Bette shows us the best from its solid repertoire, with new songs from "Bette of Roses" album. The descendants of the people give something to everyone. Just one Diva Diary proves here that he is the most powerful singer in the world.
