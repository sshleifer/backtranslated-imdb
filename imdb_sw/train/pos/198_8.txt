Oh it's so cool to watch Classic Silk once in a while! The CEO is just happy and even makes a long time (at least in 1928) came as himself. The story is about having success in life and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a great "drama" studio. He becomes a great star and as a result he actually leaves the real world. For a while he even refuses (his poor)! The camos are hilarious, certainly the area in which the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studio and concludes she doesn't seem that special ... It must be one of the first movie-movies here and for real freaks are amazing see the camera with the material from behind back. Must-look if you ask me !!
