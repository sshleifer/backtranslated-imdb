Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a good couple and show for their unique charisma shown in this film. This is a "normal" or an indie plot with a conspicuous indoor that shows abnormal situations that are suddenly very important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an ordinary boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is taking pictures of foreign people of a small town where he lives. Suddenly an alternative artist focuses on the job and employs him to open his job in the most important and more holidays. <br /> <br /> But the life of the Pecker changes so much as now the luck and popularity seem to convince the people of the city who are the main impetus of Pecker. Even her girlfriend gets mad because now she did not give her "enough" attention to her. Well this is the Indie movie for the edge but not for everyone. It may seem bad or engaging in other people but I still think it is worth only an hour because it offers something "different" than the usual Hollywood standards. Explaining in a few words: This is a typical Christina film of Ricci and John Waters. That's it. <br /> <br /> Oh and I almost forgot to mention that "Full Grace" lines are really annoying. Geez.
