I went to see this film with friends one night. I haven't heard so much about it. So I didn't expect anything. But after seeing it, I liked it very much. Nicolas Cage and others were beaten were very good. But I must say the performer of Giovanni Ribisi needed to lose a little. But such a small mistake, it can be inserted. When they were in 60 Seconds it is about a retired thief who must add 60 ordinary and foreign cars one night to save his brother's life. The movie is totally unpredictable. So the latter must be concerned. Think of it just another, the driving speed of the car? Well, you are the right part. There is much more. Everyone should watch this film.
