The movie took a new angle to the life of Gandhi, which is good to see and shows how human was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi has suffered and was mentioned several times as his failure as a father in his history. My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was awesome in the movie. It can be best made by someone who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed to be very serious and it seemed as if it would be deliberately displayed for illumination in some parts of the film. The movie is not very suitable, but it briefly described the relationship of the father and son. The rest has been provided and used only to show the time and the overall settings of the movie. It is generally a good film if you remember that it's not a perfect image.
