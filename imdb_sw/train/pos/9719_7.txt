Entering this film, I had heard good things about it. Leaving out, I was not very surprised nor faint. Simon Pegg plays the character of religious children like his other movies. There were a few couple here and there - there was nothing to cheer. Perhaps my favorite movie clips are when they are playing on the club area. I gotta quite try that sometimes I will find in the club. Several stars here and there include: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the player from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I saw that it is very exciting to see the appearance of comeie's Thandie Newton in the area. He actually be in the original movie by Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. If I see it being faced, you will enjoy it or get it a little. I can add, Kirsten Dunst enjoys in this film. : 3
