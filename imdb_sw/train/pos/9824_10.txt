This flick is a good example of the B-erotic cinema: the worst porn movies without hard sex. The plan in this is not as bad as these things go; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove his partner is not guilty of killing his wife. Some of the films, however, leave something of want. A bad job, a bad trend, a beautiful woman, bad sets, bad movies, bad sounds and bad sexual events. Film workers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. They don't even have the common sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love area. What is dumb is that?
