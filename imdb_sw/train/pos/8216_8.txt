*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two so-so outings ("Magnum Power" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to be no longer criticizing her in "Impose Sudden," exciting exciting that works wisely with its power: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who is also inspired, and stories that consume enough time on exhibitions and preserve its power for major events. <br /> <br /> At once, the case takes Harry out of his native San Francisco (where he again is in trouble with his heads for his "first shot, asking questions later" method), with a hammer of San Paul. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler) A small group of people have been killed, one at a time, and a woman who attacked several years before, and whose sister has been in a catatonia situation since the attack. <Br /> <br /> The murderer is shown by Sondra Locke, and makes the character of Jennifer Spencer to combine the attractiveness of compassion and bloodshed. Locke's cold eyes and cool sounds, whenever he tries to comfort his sister in the hospital or to take revenge for the fighters, it is very effective in drawing a picture of a missing woman whose years of torture and anger now begins to bear deadly fruit. > <br /> Businessmen are a lot of disgusting, especially a leader, who has a "psychological nutjob" tied primarily on his forehead, and a girl who looks like one of the boys, despite his inability to participate. Featured flashback, while not quite clear, it's a long night, and it is clear the purpose of making the audience relaxing Jennifer as it kills its attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will remove "Impact Sudden" as trash: without intelligence, retaliation stories. At some point this is true, but it is a good litter. What works for the benefit of the film is the power of Sondra Locke's performance, giving us a complex attitude that wounds are more visible in his paintings than his signals or his words. What we are here is a movie of action and perspective. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some errors deserve to be punished in any significant way, but if the secret behind the murder becomes clear to Harry (understanding that, wisdom, not written for discussion), is shown by the option - what to do about a killer who motivates the inspiration but whose behavior is bound by the law of tolerance. This makes the story more interesting than the standard Dirty Harry. <br /> <br /> Another way of the release of the movie is Eastwood's direction. That's after all, the movie of Dirty Harry, and Eastwood knows better character than anyone else. Film is directed to fashion and magic, and edited to provide action scenes for great benefit. Some of the best "Harry time" in the entire series here, including the famous Harry line, "Continue - do my day." "Impact Sudden" is a movie that has the confidence of its faith by providing stories about the crime of disrespect and the negative consequences that follow. It is also a story of riveting, well-researched and well-informed. And it never does. For these criteria, it is very successful.
