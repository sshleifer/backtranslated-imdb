Who would think that such an unimportant film could be haunting and touching? I am very interested. It is a shame that many people have not seen. I liked the Hans Zimmer logo regularly. And it is the beginning of Bernard Rose! However I wonder if I should call this terrible film. It is possible to easily be a fantasy or drama game too. Yes, no matter what, I love you the possibility of translating what you have. Everything and everyone in Anna (played by Charlotte Burke) dream represents a real crisis in her life ... The house itself, tree, Mark, lighthouse, etc. It is a lot of such information that makes this beautiful film by watching it constantly. I hope I have come to a small movie as closed and impressed with the psychological sense like this immediately.
