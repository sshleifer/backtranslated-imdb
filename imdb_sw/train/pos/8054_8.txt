"Enter the meat dragon" is one of the military military movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung shows the young man of the Chinese field that comes to visit a friend of the city. Like Lung Lung's "Way of the Dragon." Where Sammo goes, problems begin, so he has to rely on his military skills to solve the difference. Luckily, Sammo's character learns military art by following and imitating his image, Bruce Lee. He even blows his nose and his finger like the way Bruce Lee does and also makes his voice interesting. He also uses nunchucks in the area. It was like watching Bruce Lee oil. There is a great showdown near the end of the movie that has foreign fighters. Sammo should meet every opponent one by one. Such as "Game of Death", where each fighter has a different discipline of ignorance from someone else. This is one of the films I enjoyed watching and also the first movies of Sammo Hung we've seen. Best events to fight with a lot of laugh. Sammo's movie fil film I recommend for all military fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
