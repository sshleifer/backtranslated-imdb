I saw this movie after seeing Blue Crush and other cinema Michelle, I thought I had a future mess in this business. In this film in the way he finds his father on his treatment with his brother, the way he takes the rage when he gets hit. The other characters learn the string in the film he keeps the wall and hide from love, or that because he has power he can win. I believe that this role was appropriate for Michelle even though she had no previous experience, the director saw the talent, I thought to not see the talent in it.
