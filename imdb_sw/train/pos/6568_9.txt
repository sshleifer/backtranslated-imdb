I enjoyed this film as a child when it came out, and up to this day yet. A simple story involving a search of a girl who has been stolen by a volunteer evenly lost the paper. It has executives who were most recognized back in the day. This should not keep the viewer open. Wayne Crawford star as the main character Jake Speed. Indeed, it can ring from certain aspects of Romancing Stone, and Indiana Jones. But this film has been made well enough to remove it from the cellar. I wonder not so many people know about it. It must be covered with other movies on the movies on '86. I looked again at the cable TV. It can be hard to find since it has not been published on both VHS and DVD. I was able to get DVD from ebay under 8 bucks! Flick fast.
