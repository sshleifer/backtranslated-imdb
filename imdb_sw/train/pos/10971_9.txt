Gray gardens are amazing, exciting, sad and measuring. I watched with amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. bickered and doing when remembering their past. Their presence in a damaged home (which did not stop for more than fifteen years) is a comedy and catastrophe. This is a film that you quickly forget.
