People who can't understand about this film are that it is not the beginning, middle, and end, it's just the conclusion of a series of television series 26 times. So remember that when you talk about how the world could not explore enough. That's all done in the TV show. <br /> <br /> As beautiful and amazing as the picture is, I think *** *** SPOILERS *** The argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what made me love this movie. Seeing the characters I was following through the 26 sessions were as violent as it was, and saw Gwizdo walking hard with his soul in the middle of the ruins when Lian-Chu was consolidating his string was close to tears. Then we had a complete difference with Lian-Chu to fight these amazing dragons (which were addressed before the series) and Gwizdo screamed carefully and without fear to kill Zoe. * Hero * I am surprised that this area has not been featured more in the alert. Any child with a sense of intelligence will be able to see that Gwizdo was not his own soul and was fully committed to suppressing a little girl. It was enough to bother me, and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than many million councils, and it was a good way to see some of my favorite characters go. See. :)
