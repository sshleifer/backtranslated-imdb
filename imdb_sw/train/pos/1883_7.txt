Good comedy planned by Dudley Moore supported by Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud speaking well. Moore is Arthur, a member of a multimillionaire family, who was about to get 750 million dollars to marry a woman (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In fact, Arthur acknowledged the situation, but eventually he refused when he met the poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he enjoyed himself drinking hard and fun with prostitutes. After several positive ideas in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided to marry Susan a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy with Linda and Arthur although the latter knew that her life would change in the future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. Rich people are not happy with their way of life.
