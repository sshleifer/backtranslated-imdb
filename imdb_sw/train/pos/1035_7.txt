This film was selected for the best photo but lost Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart for the best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was chosen for the best actor, I just thought she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children come from Mexico and come to the United States in the first movie area. They go by train to the relatives of the Davis family. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Minister so so tired and need to relax. But when they get home, they are Nazi who live there and they are not many they can do about it. It turns out that Nazi are concerned only about money and are willing to make a contract with Lukas. They are more than plot but you can find it out.
