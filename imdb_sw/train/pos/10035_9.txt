I think James Cameron can be my famous director because this is my second review of his movies. However, everyone remembers the Titanic of RMS. It was great, fast, and "did not think" ... until April 1912. It was on the news and one of the most devastating disasters. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie from them but two star characters lie in the spotlight rather than ships. Okay, get a good review but I would like to remind you that this is all the views and facts of zero and the only fact that you will attend is the event from the film. So our two characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not very angry but look at this and you will see why they can be angry (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I think is unfortunate, finally, the hand of God (no insult), or Caledon Hockley open (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what you get? Yes it is! We find the story of love in the sinking boat. Garber heads (idk was very good), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and many more. We also have a current treasurer farmer, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The step here is amazing, especially in the second half, the game is also good. Finally you can have your eyes that leave rain or tear tears. The story is simple and works. The treasure hunter seeks the heart of the Sea and instead finds a drawing for a woman wearing diamonds. He calls and tells his story on the Titanic of RMS. Two lovers separated from the community class and eventually, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few mistakes. I offer Titanic, it's amazing 86%
