Posted for a game of a few people. Simon is dead but somehow revives from the outside. What he saw there is displayed in a broad-based broadcast written by the German composer avant-garde. Simon is haunted for his death, he was comforted by the help of death people who could see the other side. Her girl is trying to hold her but she can't, she decides to follow her after her death. Very touching and moving, deeply psychologically, but slightly slower and somewhere even boring.
