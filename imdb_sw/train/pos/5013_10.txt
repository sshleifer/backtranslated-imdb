If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before this, ... (is so POSSIBLE?) ... they certainly knew who was back! <br /> <br /> This show continued to win 5 Emmys, & stand as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. Created by three actions ... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra singing rates from room to room, filled with musicians, including where she is a little girl again, all with the royal version of his song, (at that time) ... "People". ACT .... .... Bergdoff-Goodman's music visit, when Barbra sings poor songs ... it is better than it looks ... ACT III ... Best part, Tu Barbra, musicians, and other great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Come Again", & "Funny Girl" medley .... all in all, a great part of television history, made by one of the world's most famous artists!
