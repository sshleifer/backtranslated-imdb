I saw you see this film twice or more and I get it right! WWII was completed and what is known as "Winter War" was about to begin. So the film can be described as one of the best “propaganda”, patriotic films that are preparing Americans and, secondly, people from yet to be formed "NATO's West" of the country to deal with the next risk. The film celebrates the potential of the United States, for hundreds of years, while reading to the end of the current war. Good and beautiful is the way to describe the discovery of the Continent of America and Columbus and the beautiful “part” of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from Indian Indian. You must see (at least once, for the propaganda model of time)! :)
