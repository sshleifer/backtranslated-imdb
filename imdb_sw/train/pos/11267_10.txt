Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. He deals with the illusion of history and facts that are not generally known. I would like to see more of this show. It is very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses models to "show and tell" to get his points. He explained that a person who actually climbed the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name of Pastor because it seemed better. I've seen Robert Wuhl for many years, since he was making comedy stand up and through the "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good player to stand up, but he's a good teacher! I strongly recommend watching this part of this show. It's very good at your time.
