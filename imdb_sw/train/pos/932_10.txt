********* Ten Out of Ten Eleven ********* <br /> It is hard to believe this was made for a television film. Just words, "made by TV", made me afraid. Production ethics made for television movies are almost always more surprising than the production code for professional studios. What it said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should be presented on the movie, because it is good. It is my personal favorite of all "Christmas" movies because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are little screens on screen screens and two ghosts visiting Scrooge, but no existing movie does not have at least several errors. <br /> <br /> Scott returns the stellar performance as Scrooge, he's pleased to look. In fact, I cannot reflect on one performance in this film that should not be praised. Running at a high cost, the location of the place, and the backdrop of winter is testing. Music mark is fun and stimulate the heart. Add to it, leading a stable, non-manual, and scripting honest; we have here what one day will be taken as a holiday session. In fact it has never been almost long to be a classic, but my words mark, one day soon will be. This movie has turned into a Christmas tradition every year at my home because it means true Christmas: Love, selfishness, and giving. In a selfish and greedy world, my family and I can lose them in "Christmas Carol", with George C. Scott.
