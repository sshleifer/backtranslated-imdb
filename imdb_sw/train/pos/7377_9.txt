This movie is impossible to describe. Any header "Don't look" is more information. Like many Japanese movies, the story is not like America. This story revolves around the director who gives birth to a story about the ww2 provider. The set is haunted (?) And the actor who died (?) During the show of tv show after 60 years. The director is ONLY who saw this show. if you have seen Ringu (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked it, you will be like a spirit actor. I loved more spiritual performer than a rock. The terrible and awesome movie. 10!
