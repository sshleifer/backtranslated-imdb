This special Opera's final Wagner's ultimately grew on me. When I first saw, I had many feelings of many surgical movies, and I felt so much was about the story. However, if you consider the right amount of "gimmicks," I think you will find that the film makes you manage a very strange situation, the world of opera, and that there is a time when it is particularly fine. Personally, I have never understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever showed her. Its performance (voice-sounding Yvonne Minton sound) is not an amazing, from end to end, and it alone emphasizes the hours it takes to capture the film. Another interesting reason for this film is that it takes an interesting definition of Robert Lloyd of the important role of Gurnemanz, which Lloyd has worked in opera houses around the world. I have had the opportunity to enjoy him in the role of Gurnemanz on the steps of Metropolitan Opera several times, and the lusciousness of his voice, and warmth, the father of his definition of this beautiful character is required to be protected, as did the performance in two major monologues of character, the area Karfreitag and the description of the prophecy in the Law of the Law. I saw it was a videotape released in America, and so there were headlines, alas, could not be deleted. This is unfortunate because it used to be used is incorrect and leads to a very Christian interpretation on a film that has already made the definition of opera. This seemed to me to be quite contrary to the most obvious Wagner of Christianity, and his deliberate attempt to "produce" Christian stories of the story. (See footnote and spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it impossible, while watching a movie with headlines, to stop cleaning, and make sure that, if in DVD versions you have the ability to turn the head down off, you do so, and instead, if the opera is unknown to you, you read free of charge before. The bottom line is that there is a lot in the film that I do not like, and it would just recently have seen it done differently ... but it has steadily increased in my estimates over the years since I first saw it, and I found myself offered to enjoy regularly. _________________ __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTE WORLDWIDE: A good example will be the famous Kundry line, "I saw him ... he ... and laughed." This is interpreted, in the subheadings, for reasons for my escape, as "I saw the Savior's face." It welcomes me especially, because in freetto, Wagner very intentionally and carefully refers to this unseen character which WHO DOES NOT BE LIKE Jesus as "der Heiland," that is, Germany for "Mphuma" - referring to the injury of Amfortas, and all injuries and diseases and need for healing.
