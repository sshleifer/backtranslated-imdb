I saw that when I was younger and it was better. Kelsey White as Lisa and Mec Meices where cute. Susan Valley as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was fascinated. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was a brilliant. What Hilarius which Snoodle and Doodle eat so much candy. What sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops Meecy Mices on the head then and the fairy will give a little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he returns in goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle will go to the Big Candy Mount Rock. Show this is the best kids will like to show this, new words, songs, and watch them playing.
