It is one of the best movies I have seen in the last 2 years (I have seen the Prime Minister at Tel-Aviv, Israel during the summer of 2006, especially when the last war started ...) This problem in communication between people, which causes The war, it is interesting to me for a long time, and it doesn't matter who-boys and girls, like gay, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen a bubble already 3 times, and still amazing and exciting - every character reminds me of one of the most people I know , and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... At last I saw - had my friend, who is a Christian Christian, and was on the day of Israel's liberty (i more than an example i could! amazing) and ... she cried at the end !!! - if she is infected and was not ashamed - everyone could be touched by the bubble!
