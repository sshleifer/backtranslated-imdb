As a low-budget enterprise in which filmmakers themselves build and distribute the DVDs themselves, perhaps we should not expect too much from a broken form. And yet the most amazing thing about all this success is the fact that the release comes with an adequate bonus for the DVD DVD Cameron DVD and well planned presentation. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only bigger is that Broken comes with non-namorphic transfers. Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85: 1, show no technical errors and look pretty much as it should be expected. In fact, from Ferrari's hands on the way to put this disk together you can prove the truth. <br /> <br /> The situation is true and voice sounds. Here we are given a combination of DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​and when I don't know about what should be considered "natural", the fact that Ferrari had participation in both ways should not be considered as inferior. In fact, although DD5.1 ​​can give more atmosphere to see experience from how it uses the logo, both are equally and without technical errors. <br /> <br /> As for the disc of the disc it is best to be destroyed. See the road on the right side of the screen and you will see many views, loads of features and different homes. In fact, from the way that everything has come down in the chunks of minutes rather than on a long document, there is little to discuss. 'Anatomy of Stunt' feature, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes to pieces. So we get vaccination on the very best element of the original production of Broken, production and after production. And when it is possible to find them in 'making' more easily, in this way we get easy access to any special feature that we want to see. <br /> <br /> Different types of pieces, then, is probably only the comments that require any kind of discussion. Then again, there is also air to predict each of the tracks. Those involved actors are a great mixture and do not take the film very seriously. Ferrari pieces are a great passion for the whole thing. And these technologies are, well, very technical. Of course, we also find a barrier and what is covered somewhere else in the record, but for 19 minutes no one of these pieces comes from inviting. Indeed, all in all, extra bonus bag.
