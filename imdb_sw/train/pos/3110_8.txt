The third and final part of the Bourne trior (duh), lacks a little in the story department, but covers with detailed images! Twi especially take a lot of time and make this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find the story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was completely ... the top-wise story. How did they get around it? Events act, at once, but also did another thing, which I can not reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you look at the film, than you will see! I am very happy to read, that these Bourne books are more appropriate than all three films.
