When the chemistry played between Ryan and Robbins alone is enough to see this film, cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) include an extra. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as a clinical partner of Ryan, and the Shalub line about Eonstein's gonads is, as described, one of the highlights of the film. The words that Robbins offers at first appear to the public are good poems. Kudos for authors for this froth handle and wit and balanced. I also thought that Keene Curtis was as strange as Eisenhower. This can be considered to be something of a chick movie, but I think everyone will get a kick. Eight points very stable points.
