THE KELLS WORK CAN BE A LOT OF THE BEST OF THE BELLEVILLE BUSINESS. Although Stylistically is very diverse, KELLS cooperates with the TRIPLETS and (series of deleting jaws 2D) KUNG FU PANDA, the incredible direction of art, production structure, background / layout and richness of color which is a human mind feast. KELLS is safe - almost Gothic in its layout (a certain amount of Klimt reminder), a very remarkable flat for a general view, beauty in its design of Celtic & light, but the characters are very simple and interesting - and all are used together for beauty. You fall in love with the characters from the time you meet them. You have attracted every story of the story and every pencil stroke and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and all in the Cartoon Saloon (and their extended staff) have succeeded with a small budget / VERY small film made, is quite amazing. The reason for the support of our animation community is a wonderful thing. This film is to breathe and buzz among our colleagues in suggesting this film spreads like a fire. Congratulations to KELLS on her many accolades, her Annie selection with her current Oscar qualification. They are all very well deserved nods, in fact ...
