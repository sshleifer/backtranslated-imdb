A person's opinion that Pat Robertson is evil and his plan is evil is nothing to compare what evil and justice. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call evil good and evil! He does not even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know Him now, that's right. He still loves you but when you do that you finally bow down before you, and you'll be, you will be late. God did not send someone to hell, even you! You will go there with your own decision and your publication defines! God be merciful and give you the experience of Damascus. The 700 Club Service and Pat Robertson is one of the reasons I am here. In the severity of drunkenness, adultery, and possibly death, God came through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God! You have the right to say what you said but you do not have the right to condemn in your words. God be merciful to you.
