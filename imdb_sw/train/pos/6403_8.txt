GOD'S MERCY has a Good Good Jr., in probably its best performance so far. She plays Carl Brashear, a brave man and a hero. He is a small farmer from the South, who wants to be a diver- Navy - but has trouble because of his race. The director of the dive school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a redneck racist which however grows to honor Brashear. The film is about how Brashear agrees with bad behavior, not once but twice. Exhibitions are what make this film special. The advantages are good, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of the film, provides great performance - its best work in years. Shakira provides another stable performance as a young DeNiro wife. The film shows very little patriotism (although no where close to the standard was in PATRIOT), and a few of the characters are just one rounded (Hal Holbrook's Mr. Pappy is just bad), but the film is a shortage among films today. It is exciting and unacceptable. Good movies.
