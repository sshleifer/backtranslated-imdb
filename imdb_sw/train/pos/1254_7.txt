Ed Harris's work in this film is about its standard of quality, that is, steals the screen from anyone sharing with him, and includes Sean Connery's awesome. The movie, which is more than cleansing, comes alive only in events when Harris is interviewed by a lawyer for someone else. It's amazing, master's master in control of art. All other members of the cast are capable and Connery is reliable, such as Fishbourne, but the story itself does not pack. This program is largely dependent on the basis of the black prisoner being harassed and forced by white law enforcement officers. This is an engine running a story, similar or accurate, and makes someone feel tad deceived at the end. <br /> <br /> Still, looking to see Harris in action.
