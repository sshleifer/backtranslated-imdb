This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a very good job with Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Of course the best performance of Jude Law. The movie is the best, editing is about good, and it includes the original original color suitable for movie status. Production production is also a factor in what makes this movie special. For me, it takes a lot to beat the godfather, but the movie pictures show the success of this race. Certainly it's a picture of the best pictures in my book.
