I don't know why people always want deep meaning in movies or consider it worthless. <br /> <br /> What is it just to be happy? Something that Morgan Freeman is stirring. He gets a chance to show a little. Paz Vega, a fellow star, gets a job with Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people in watching his film. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some pathos, some pleasant but no higher up. I've got lots of Jim Parsons as a recipient in the construction company. When he looks at Freeman for love and says, "You make me want to be a woman." He is only hilarious. The situation of the struggle between Mrs Vega and her former husband is also amazing. In short, it is a beautiful, beautiful film that will make you smile. You can do a lot, very bad.
