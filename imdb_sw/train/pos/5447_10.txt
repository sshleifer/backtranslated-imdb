Personal color when it comes to talking about movies like this precious gem. When I was behind the eighth, early eight years, I discovered this film, as many were given at that time, "Night Patrol" "A bad way" or even "King Frat" painter and beaten back behind the tested trials and ignored you. Really being of age, movies such as what I have already said and things like "Screwballs" and many others, captured thoughts, and thanks many years later I still remember some interesting and others to resist many movies that helps to maintain my love like that like parodies or pastiches. It took many years after a successful "House of Animals" and saw how it had been dropped for many years, now I know that there will be no way for this film to break down the box office box to find the words mentioned there The above will not grow in memory, as well as the National Lampoon Holiday. Being faithful, not everything that carries the national logo of Lampoon has been a wild achievement, however I Reunion Standard is one of all my favorite movies, and identified characters immediately, such as Bob Spinnaker who emerged in fullness with Gerrit Graham, very good at Charles Band's "Terrorvision" still continues in the old glory of his youth. Or how about brash Stephen Furst and ballsy turn like a lazy high school sexual drinking gun bum Hub Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet like. Which makes me reflect. As I said already, personal taste is not available. People may be very aggressive, so you will not be able to win any prize or comparable with their peers in the comedy world. It has good reputation. Be one of the original writings written by John Hughes, who would then continue to do one of my own recommendations of his work "Weird Science" as well as the head of the strange head called the Gary American Car. <br /> <br /> What more can I say, it's just a movie waiting to be found, again and again.
