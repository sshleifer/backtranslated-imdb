Using Buster Keaton in the evening of his work was an interesting option. He might have been the most talented player of the silent age. This gives him the opportunity to show these talents in a little travel story. It is found by a boy living in modern times, and it becomes apparent that we are better left in our own times Keaton can make his eyes very well. I've heard his voice before. I believe he made some films of the Parliamentary film, playing some vague characters just to get a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and showed him that way. Not a bad story. It shows how a person is affected when we want something that we do not have and want to.
