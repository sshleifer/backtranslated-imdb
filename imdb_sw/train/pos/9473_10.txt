I was lucky to see this in the pre-night inquiry (October 20) and I was surprised by the wonderful and good plot and the true heart saw the work. <br /> <br /> When the plot is not very difficult or unique, the story continues in a way that feels pure, unique, and correctly "indy" in style. It is not something that can easily be compared with old films, it is unique to take a variety of middle-aged stories of love sadness. I was especially impressed with the beat of the film. Under every last bonus in the family, it was beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters did a good job, the talent had spread evenly among them and none of them had "shone" the other two. It was really a beautiful, suitable film for all ages and a great laugh while also being really touching and stirring the heart. It was a wonderful break of sexual jokes and films of recent films.
