The film had basic family values ​​and love. It showed human feelings and was a stirring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to make it perfect for kids) and it was fun and exciting sometimes. There were a few signs of claiming to search. The movie is accepted. There was no sense of experiment which many movies of movies have been doing today (which quietly is getting a little warning out). It was shown clearly but it had a good quality quality. Although editing had been done better I thought it was a good movie for the family to enjoy. And the news agency was just hit to you which was something I had nothing but for all it was a good movie.
