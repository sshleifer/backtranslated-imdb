It was the best piece for the puppet series because this film showed all the series, from one to seven. And this was about a woman trying to stop the new master of the puppet because I never thought that the fabrics were pain. Plus showed some series of master's puppet which I have not seen and what I see is bad as part of the two. It showed the appearance of the Torch who can turn things to mankind, which is cold, and showed the return of the master of the puppet from one place. It also showed young visitors from the 4th section which was too cool, showed other people events that could be good for them and so.
