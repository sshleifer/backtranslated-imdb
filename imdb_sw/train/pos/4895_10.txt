It is rare that I sit in front of the TV especially watching certain apps. It is rare even when I enjoy the program at the end, but the Blonde End of Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I have seen. <br /> <br /> Wonderful street, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, with a beautiful, ignorant and hurt script to make it a true experience. I can't explain how good I thought it was, so I don't try, I'll just tell you, if you get an opportunity, PLEASE to see IT !!!! I just believe that it comes from the video.
