After completing the Knight Heroic Events a few minutes ago I found myself very happy but still questions are losing on me. While it would seem that the first 7 events or so are really voting the events of the first Memories of Lodoss The real war is that they don't have the truth. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision about how the last nature was finished (and that could be the reason that the first 7 events occurring) but I don't see it. CotHK says it starts 5 years after the Battle of Heros which Parn was part of. I think the director made the first 5 events appear as a preliminary reference to give the viewer a small reminder and the introduction of the characters and their actions done because they seem a little after the series run on Spark's story. Now, once in a string of Spark we find ourselves running 10 years (15 years now since the Battle of Heros). Spark and his crew makes, sometimes, resembles Parn and his crew once a trip enters into a gear, especially a love story that brews between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times in CotHK that I beat the previous series and if it was not for the long hair of Spark's hair I know I would have refused to stop more than once to make sure the correct disc is located. think back to this great backward, however, the authors did a good job in creating reliable characters and wonderful stories. The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how? You may not have both errors are good criminals even though Ashram only a crime character is that he supports Marmo. I probably missed something during the series of series that described that part. In addition to travel trips, I recommend very CotHK. I put CotHK and, even more, the original Memory of Lodoss more than the Lord of the trilogy of the ring. All this is more epic than something I've ever seen or read. I strongly recommend this.
