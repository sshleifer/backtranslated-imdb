I saw this series when I was a child and I liked the information that came in and never forgot it. I finally bought a collection of DVDs and just how I remembered. This is how the doco should be, without discrimination and truth. The footage of the film is impossible and the interview is amazing. Just another series I have found the same is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, then they can make great movies of war. <Br /> <br /> Remember. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Private, Letter from It Jima, Flags of Our Fathers And When The Fade Trumpets are some I would recommend
