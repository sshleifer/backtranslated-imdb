This series started at the "Comedy Central" television station in the United States. It was cut to death, and it was shown in sequence. This was sad for the audience that should be interesting, did not fall and fall through. Luckily, at the same time my cable company went to digital and I got the BBC. Thank you good because I should see the "Lords League" order, complete and unbound. "Community of Lords" is the same as "Monty Python Flying Circus" of England and Canada "The Kids in the Hall". But ... warning. <br /> <br /> "Lords League" though it is one more step. It's not just about wear in drag and calming cultural events, it goes more and much, much, black. I can tell many of you now - it will say other groups of people, it will convince others. But remember, his comedy alone .. likes, the dark comedy. If it's not your business, don't look at it. If you think you know the dark comedy, see this - if you get angry and angry, then you don't know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These people have found the right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are the best and I enjoyed every creature. There is a complete story that has been told here from one place to the end. You can't view this one time at a time, of course, that is one of the attractions of this series. Look for the order. See how creativity and delicate and deeply disturb these ones. Nothing and nothing is outside the borders. That, my dears, is "dark humor". Bravo!
