I was made at birth and I certainly did not have the problems of the fishermen of Antone who had a film, but I still have a feeling with this movie that has helped bring them out and insist on dealing with them. It has even led me to realize that I have "a piece of lump" and I'm going to find my parents now born. I cried for about a day after seeing the first time. The Antons' struggle with his mother of the birth of his father's family in his sudden appearance is powerful for those who do not know what will happen if we see our parents of birth. And his confidence and confidence of his mother and against his former rebels were very powerful. I was able to really recognize this and my need to tell people "yes, I set aside my parents when I was born. For another generation of parents they took me and loved me. And now I succeed!" It also helped my wife to understand me and our adopted children, who had a sad experience before coming to our home. And it helped me realize how we destroyed our social system. If you remember reading last year's story about a baby born in Florida who was "lost" and then "Miranda & Ashley" stories in Oregon City where SCF ignores many complaints of sexual abuse on a person who finally killed AND this week the movie was released, but another story in New Jersey of three children who were not ignored by the system. One died. The government seems to have the house they had was the same because the guard was employed (as a striker) and "only once" he used heroin! There are just a lot of things that are provided in this film - and it is well done by the script and by acting that the Antony Fisher should be "Best Photos" chosen for sure. It does not matter whether you are accepted or not, it is a hard heart that cannot be overlooked by anyone concerned about children in our society.
