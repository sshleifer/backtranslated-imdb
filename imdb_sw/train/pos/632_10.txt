Well here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 elements. Each section will be created by nature and 5 points. It may then lose or earn 5 points for possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this feature 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five things. The action was enjoyable and outdated. Romance has never been excessive, but still emotionally moving. I laughed hard and for a long time in the movie and I was still fascinated by the wonderful game, and the riveting doubts. I think I give this feature 10 points. I thought all the good stories of stories were told. I found myself, sitting in the theater, I returned to my childhood, and at the time I believed again in the buffalo of witches, witches, and fallen stars making dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Movie Photography - I offer this part 8. When the movie was a very good story in many corners, I immediately recognized it once trying to learn what just happened on the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I offer this feature 10 points. I like that they used C.G.I. little. Epic events were reliable. Magical powers were realistic for fear. All in the bottom are all over, and this was ALL! Send - I offer this feature 10 points. No names and executives sorted exactly, cast was awesome! Michelle Pfeiffer was a good rival, Charlie Cox made Tristan grown up, Claire Danes gave the impression to the stars, and I never saw with Robert De Niro alike. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this feature 10 points. Even newbie executives played their heads in full. Once again, I will not look at Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I give this part 9 points. This felt a little run and I think if the movie was long they could make the characters more beautiful. Conversation - I give this feature 10 points. Talk was wise, wonderful, fun? even mushrooms had a good discussion. Score - I give this feature 7 points. I can honestly remember one piece of music from the entire film. I am not complaining over the fact that music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finishing - I give this part 9 points. Welcome to the perfect end! I see that some of the last things should be pronounced more, while others could fail more, but no threads left. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy DVD? HEL YES! Look at the Theater? Certainly! Below Low: Best movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing it in the theater, I know I will be back in seconds!
