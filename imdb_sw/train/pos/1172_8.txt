And yet another run of South Park there is an end. This is not as strong as I expected, but the Night of Resident Residents was perfect to complete Stanley's stream, Tsst, Mary Bloody, or Erection Day. It still can't hold a candle for Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but a few sessions can. <br /> <br /> The Night of Homeless Residents is a spoof of zombie species, done just by way South Park would think of. Instead of eating the meat of the zombies, these containers do not have residential homes that ask for change and appear to live away. Randy and others are locked at the Community Center, although this time on the roof, where they can look at the area. At a very special moment when one member sees his house gone, and has a residence, allowing Randy to have no choice but to remove him. At the same time, four boys have decided to solve the problem, and the whole story behind taking a house that does not involve trying to convey the message, but for that without consideration. South park is often best when it is ignorant. Matt and Trey put it safe this week, and they had no doubt about the coal problem, which was lost. <br /> <br /> Time of shock is coming when the scientist emerges himself to try to avoid shelter. This is the first time suicide in South Park goes wrong, and we look at the poor person missing his brain and then try to beat himself often when he dies in pain. Sometimes South South led. Overall, that part was surprising, but it was saved to be alive by preventing any real definition of homeless and directly connected to a zombie shtick. The latter is amazing, but nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for the second group of periods. It's cutting for a long time, but South Park should clap because it runs. The show seems to be out of the last season's steam, but now it's back in full form.
