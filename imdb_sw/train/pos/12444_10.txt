The best modern Blaise Movie I have seen so far. It's like a good trial for TV series. I even think it's a little "cult", like to touch the lite of the magic of Quentin Tarantino, or something. They have behaved a great characteristic of humility, but I admit the lack of Willy Garwin little. Even though I have read many comics and a book by Peter O'donnell I am not disappointed with this film, quite the opposite. Positively surprised by this story about humility and his childhood. I have not set my high expectations for the bad movie since 1966. So I might have a little more movie. But if you like the community and other stories about Blaise's power, you should definitely see this! can't wait to monitor ...
