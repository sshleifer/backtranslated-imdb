S. S. Van Dine must be a business expert in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were often closed on one or two studios. But it seems that Van Dine must sell his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Remember that the Great, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more left the Philo Vance films. Tarzan only seemed to be closer to Hollywood. MGM provided a Garden Case Study with the Edmund Lowe as a fashion detective. Of course MGM had an original Philo mirror under the contract at the time, but Bill Powell was working for a Holy Man at the time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to focus on it. Edmund Lowe is a Philo Vance acceptable. Lowe had already started so much in the last tail of the silent and Glory of Prices and then with the film line by Victor McLaglen and their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got its Oscar for The Informer, Lowe appeared to fall in the B photo market. Garden Crop Case includes three different victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The worst form of criminals is far away, the secret is true how all killings are connected and how they are fulfilled. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you this though. Vance takes great opportunity to disclose the villain and the last 15 minutes deserve Hitchcock.
