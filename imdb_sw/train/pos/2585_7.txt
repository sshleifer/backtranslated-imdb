Here is a rare gem for those who have not seen or many do not even hear this news. During the 80's, Dennis Quaid was a hot product, but in the 90s, Dennis Quaid was lost from the area. In 1993, he dropped out of large screens and three movies, all of which unfortunately were bombed. Two of these films I liked very much, and let me define one of them. "Wilder Napalm" is a flick of things about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... stars of fire: they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder has decided to re-use his power (for nothing to do so) after the murder of his youth, where he and his brother beat the abandoned house that killed a person who was in an unknown state. to them. Nowadays, Wilder is a hot runner and married to Wacky Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, I think what, absurd (see the movie to understand this better). Wilder also did not talk to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace put her hair hot during a bachelor party. Wallace likes its pyro power and uses it for amusement. It also runs Carnival and is a clown head. When the Carnival comes to the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to reunite with her brother and also see Vida, whose Wallace has been interested! The house of Vida arrested finds its end, but Wilder is involved. So, Wallace comes in and the fun begins. Ndugu vs. brothers ... fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some of the big flames throwing us on this flick ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The movie also has some of the best features, but so interesting, as the Wilder fire unit to sing the acapella songs during the fire and after the county. Jim Varney (known as 'Ernest') pops as a player of the redneck's necklace player. "Wilder Napalm" is shooting at the brilliant ... and with cunning put together ... very far from the wall and before protecting. <br /> <br /> Do this look ...
