Now here is a direct film from my childhood, my family has been used; but it's kind of beaten and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the entire film on youtube.com; I loved this beautiful film when I looked at it as a child, and after looking again (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the film is "Candy Hearts and Flower Flowers" (I'll remember the sweet song ever). I was surprised when I looked at the features of the opening (for who lived animated), that some animators comes behind the 1930s (WOW! That's about 47 years).
