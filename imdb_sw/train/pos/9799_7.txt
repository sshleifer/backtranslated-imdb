The image of Batman's favorite photo. Not the same as the "Return of Joker" or "Mask of Phantasm", but established yet. I liked how the movie enabled you to reflect who the Batwoman was. There was a beautiful delight. Procedure for good action. I've always had a comment that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the sad batman live live action sequels. The situation continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
