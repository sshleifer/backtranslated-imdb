I remember that the trailer of the Legend of Zu was quite amazing and became a fan of a Man Called a Hero (all my favorite time), Storm Riders I decided that I should look at this too. I know that there is a way to strongly reject Ekin Cheng's ability to act everywhere but he is my favorite Hong Kong moviestar so far (the best way than Nicolas Tse yet) and he is one of the things that I enjoyed this movie. Of course this film is a work of art from beginning to end. I even think that only executives were real and everything else was produced by the end of this film. They should put a lot of work into this and deserve a good loan for it. The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil and love story beat in (I think Ekin Cheng attracts girls easily). Stories are not very intelligent and deep but you are not expecting when playing movie action. I wanted to have many military action and fist and fist rather than war and magical abilities, but well it is life and not the way you want. And why were they seen as modern birds in battle through heaven at the end? That way is also funny. The Zu Legend cannot be a person called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a video video and that's not a bad thing. If the company chooses to publish games on this film I can not be lifted as it takes all video elements. Good work. Please make more than fantasy films like this
