I will admit, I thought this film would not be good but I changed my mind soon. The film enabled you to turn it as a trend. Pierce Broson is remarkable in his role as a beaten man, who suddenly becomes burned out and asks someone he met him on a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an amazing person, as his role as a wise man from Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce on the Mexican bar. The film will laugh like Pierce who will use hilarious links (especially on sex). Thinking in this film is very good, especially in the bullfight area & when Pierce sees himself trying to finish his last job.
