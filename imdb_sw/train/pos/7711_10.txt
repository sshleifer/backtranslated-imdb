Okay, so Robbie is looking a little for hokey for today's standards, and some acting is stilted good, and the more current effects can be duplicated with a bright 12-year-old child with good computer editing software. And don't let me start on a poster. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, 40 years after release. I was looking at "science fiction" at the "Fiction / Adventure Theater" TV on Sunday, so I saw several SF movies from '50s. While many movies liked to beat one person with clothes and to strengthen a small image of the city, Planet Forbidden ever raised the bar and showed that it is possible to make a false fiction film which actually had a plot. I am sure that many SF films made in '90' will still seem to be worth looking at 2030.
