This is not the best romantic comedy made, but it is certainly very good and looks. It is directed to the old and which works well. Pastor of Cybill as Corinne is not bad in his role as a woman who can not get over her husband's death. He has great maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is, better, nondescript. He may have enough in the role, but that's not enough. However, I feel that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with a deep thought. We don't know anything else about them because minutes after the story becomes thick, and the authors don't know much more than what is happening. But the problem was protected because Mary Stuart Masterson has a beautiful-like-daisy beauty to make it, and Robert Downey Jr. is very interesting that it reduces the screen. Even her smile is infectious. And so it happens that his great eyes of dreams are perfect for a visionary vision and flashback scenes. However, this movie is lighter and simple and if you love it that way, why not try it. <br /> <br />
