I liked this film very much. In fact this idea is very good there ... the federal government planning a tracking device placed in the jaws of a temporary thief to attract more dangerous thief / computer to hide. But Alvin Sanders, a person who feds "volunteered" to be inserted by the device, is a very good person and it is a great pleasure to get his head with him for a short time. Alvin even submits himself to be more than a beautiful but odd or indecent behavior when he shows that he is not nearly easily waiting as he can appear. Definition has an hour value.
