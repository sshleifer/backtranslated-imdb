This movie was quite amazing. Time to divide before and culture has been restored. Urmila has provided another brilliant performance. I loved so much on this film that it is not available Pakistan-bashing which is run in movies like Gadar and LOC. For redistribution as increased, the film does not turn on political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. The movie always circles the bad story of the life of Urmila. His weak relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been shown well. Modern reality shows how people, Hindus and Muslims, have suffered from this part. The theme in which there is only one religion spreads in this film.
