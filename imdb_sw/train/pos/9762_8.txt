This is a very wonderful film for director / author Richard Williams. All who know William's work know it is a little-kilter (if it is not ingenious) but this takes a cake. <br /> <br /> It features two ragdolls that should save a new doll of French owner from greedy pirate toy and find themselves in the sympathy of several wonderful characters in the way. The power in this film is mainly in its quality of surgery; its amazing designs of character, its powerful animation, and its distinctive difference of sweet and scary. Williams's animation of beauty showed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real sharks, floppy and lids, rather than simple versions of the cartoon of dolls, which made it so reliable (at least in the sense of seeing). The animation shines on bringing us a camel-to-Knees-Knees, whose body walks with two different creatures to control each end, the silent movie is pushing by Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, Mjanja. The pride of the proud, alone, is more likely to be the psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop - and every second is something new. To live in what was tasted "Pingu la Taffy," Sneaky is an adult who remains and eats sweets. She sings a song that I can't help but to feel under sex, then she tries to kill Ann Raggedy with her heart of candy. The only complaint I have about this film is that there are so many Songs. It keeps plugging the film because there is their SIXTEEN. There are six good songs (which should be alone) including "Watching, and What See?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though she didn't need to sing twice), "I've never been enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I am Home." Others seem insignificant and honestly they are not very impressed to listen. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and less wonderful film, but if you are looking for it, you can't get better.
