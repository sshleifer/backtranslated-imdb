This is a very long movie, which means you can be very tired before it becomes interesting, but its length gives it an opportunity for its characters to get a lasting relationship in your mercy. If you are evicted by an offense of disgust you will find particularly heartbreaking, because it is a story that finds its heroes between evil and weak. If you love a monster crying for Magnus Pym, a witch who takes everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been created and created since childhood and people. There is no single character in the entire story, not just one faithful person, the 'conduct' of mutual respect. But looking at anything without the help of tissue would be quite amazing. I enjoyed it at the end. It is important for people who love movies to stimulate human behavior.
