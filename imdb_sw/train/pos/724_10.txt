The movie is just fun .... maybe more fun for those who were young and fans of "Ramones" almost when the film was made. I have watched the film regularly, and I have friends, and it's still fresh and pleasant. At the risk of being too bad, the idea of ​​a big fan of a particular band is not available, and high school students are sad and the effects of some classes are timeless. And, the film has some of the gem / events lines. The references to how “our permanent record” in secondary school will follow us through life. (I assure you I have been in secondary school for, uhhh, several years and not to follow) ..... the famous static "(" I get a static "....." That's not what you can get ", as the General Togar reach.) .. a member of the school board who is greatly reduced he attended with nurses .... The Nazi Rights Defenders like "body search" ...... Togar head announces, "I give them a final solution", and burn record Ramones (note: the memory had come before CD) .... and of course Joey Ramone noting, "The facts have changed since we left high school", followed by Togar asking "Do your parents know you are Ramones?" "<br /> <br /> Just one piece of advice ..... don't look at where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was a great hottie in the film, today reminds us all of us are old .... PJ Soles work has not been increased as we expected ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, looks just in the film this (one of my male friends dies on it whenever we look at the film), although I present his performance was more than enough and you must bring him more work than a boy film. And, does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ..... don't think .... just FUN!
