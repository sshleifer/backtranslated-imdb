Fans of HBO series "Stories From Crypt" will like this part of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that many of the EC groups were based, will recognize this directly from the bat. A proposed brother named Martin Donovan (also a good author of the screen show for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH comes to him) is a kind of guy who everyone looks good can go any way. He could play very well if a second-door person, or he could play the same role as under the creepy of grandparents. In the case of RIGHTS, he takes the last method, and works. Donovan is a doctor who recently had a relationship with his pastor's slutty office (Robin Sydney), very angry with his unforgiving wife, forgiveness, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When both are involved in a serious car accident when they return from an unsuccessful weekend of "forming," and he is burned to the fire, he refuses to pull his nose, without fun for enthusiasm from his even a sleazier lawyer and friend good (Corbin Bernsen, looking worse at wear these days.) But Abbey never stopped without fighting, and that's where the EC-theme of the part comes. Men with pigs - and his - have always been a favorite kind of issue for some odd shenanigans of spooky (and OOKY), and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, all kinds of sex and year should have Bill Gaines with glee on his mausoleum somewhere. And that's not going to mention that the original script of John Esposito offers an angle of just a bit of adultery. You don't realize when you see that you know only half the story, until close to the end ... (consider WHAT BENEATH and more tablets and gazongas, and you're there.) either. At least Rob Schmidt shows a touch of flair here and there, especially in an area that makes a mobile phone message a really awesome experience! As with most cases of MOH, this follows the theme spreads this season of hitting and forbidding, so the need for squeamish is not used.
