For the first time I did not think that Ben Affleck could eliminate a wonderful Christmas movie, a young man, I was missing, my daughter invited me to watch here with him and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I loved Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was good too, the story of the story is what it bought me, i mean, too, set and family, on the table for people you just barely see but once or for two times a year, and probably not available and any, you need a lot of alcohol if you are a system that can stand up to deal with Christmas, so I thought that the premise was good there, to buy a family with $ 250000 dollars, it was a little on the far side , but it started to do a good job for me, because it was an opponent in every way, it shows a class of different family differences. it has a lot of enjoyable time, including embarrassing things on the computer for a young boy. all in all I loved this movie and I will look again at the next Christmas or as soon as my daughter wants too.
