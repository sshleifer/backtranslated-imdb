Rosenstrasse is a newer film than one of the epic numbers, which can be far away many film goers to watch the Pianist plot similar. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good journalist, appears to a female woman for a period that is shown very much on the outside of her color, but very little analyzed by the relationship of friendship and to a common German view of Aryan instead of Hebrew. Rosentrasse finds its strength in this unusual cargo of people who are suffering in a historic state that emerges as victims. The motion of the film is independent, gentle, slow, reflective. Besides, the characters are very clear when you change between generations and approve the repaired time. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some error stories are well recognized. Another error is on a small movie that cannot catch an internal game level with characters. However, this film is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the final trend in German films related to the night-ghosts, which includes the best films like here anywhere in Africa, and recently, a lack of controversy. I would like to recommend this film to those who know how to read more pictures.
