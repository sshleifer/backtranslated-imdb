Years ago, I've got a copy of "bargain bin" of this film with a buck or two. In many ways, this is very appropriate, as planned again in 1933, it was the cheapest film of "Poverty", Majestic. However, when the film is part of the source, it is a STILL worth viewing and offers a few surprises. The story is very, very much, as in the German city, people are angry because some recent deaths seem to be the work of vampires! Adding this skill is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - though weird weirdo very bad. In this case, he has taken into account his pet mice and people begin to blame him for death. The film has a good job to give "red" (ie, fiction) and when it doesn't take a genius to know that Frye cannot be held responsible, WHO and WHY are amazing and makes it very different from an awesome movie. In addition, when the production had little money to talk, you still had good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they were done movies for the day). As a result, the film seems to be very good in general, although I thought that, usually, Fay Wray had a terrible - he thought it didn't prevent the film. I have seen him in more movies than many people on IMD and I've noticed that his characters don't have a deep - he always seems to be cast as a "woman shouted" and offers new in every film. Overall, for fans of old movie films, this is good and fit to see. For people who are not fans of that kind, maybe it's a good jump-ability.
