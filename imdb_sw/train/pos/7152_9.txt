'Holes' was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Everyone who I have told about it said WITNESS. Everyone who was beaten was suitable for their position, and Shia Labeouf actually has a future and act. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was exactly how I think of her. everyone who has not seen this I recommend and will assure them that 'I will strike'.
