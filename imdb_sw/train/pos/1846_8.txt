When I first read the lesson of this game I think it will be like Sex and City, however this game is something like that. Story characters seem to be more real and you are witnessing more and more. The concept of this game is similar, four 30 something that women lead us through friendship and relationship with problems and problems along the way. Katie MGP is a dark and debate habit that you have trouble communicating with and is the best friends with Trudi widow. Trudi's behavior is to encourage the heart if you can understand and the trouble he has with the fact that he is the only mother of four. Jessica is a very interested party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a good character and is close to Siobhan who has recently married her husband when she really does not help her eyes lose her job. On the whole game is amazingly addictive and if the BBC will continue to produce series can do well. It is different from other feminine sports games such as Sex and City, or Workers. This being played right can be the next cool feet. In addition to giving us men is not bad in the eyes too.
