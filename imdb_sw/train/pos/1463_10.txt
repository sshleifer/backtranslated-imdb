Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a good, wonderful relationship between popular culture, fraud, and globalization through making and printing muscles. I saw this film at the International Boston Film Festival, and I was expecting the introduction of drying for globalization, but what I got is to show the amazing pictures from China and the United States. The opening of the eye is exciting, deep, rough, non-binding, and it leaves you more demanding as a credit card. It's important to compare with Murderball - it's just that well done. Youth workers in China have different views, and the owner opens open on discipline. Journalists during the carnival are open, but only because this excellent film provides a local context within the factory in China without explanation. Bravo for the film manufacturer to get inside and finish the film! I would never think about the relationship between beads, China, and New Orleans; now I think about human relations between almost everything, but also the role of globalization, equity, and happiness. Most importantly, I can make this relationship without feeling guilty after watching this film, unlike other films in globalization that I have seen.
