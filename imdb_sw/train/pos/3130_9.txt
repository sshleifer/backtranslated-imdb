I am Belgian and I grew up in sixty years. Many of the American series were shown here (native language and subtitles) and Batman was the first one I had longed for. Unfortunately here it has caused "fear hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered as much violence. Geez, comparing the lack of the same series for sleeping children can see today. So because of my mother's protection over 60 years I had the chance to see maybe two or three pieces! I had a lot of trouble and started collecting comics and bubblegum cards (still getting it!) To pay compensation. I found the slides of the Looking View ... I was eager to see a headline campaign. All children need a kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later I finally got the opportunity to see the re-runs as a teenager and I enjoyed it very much. Chair-cheek work would have been saved if I looked at it as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. Well, I've watched them all now and the spirit of a regular type in web posts because they haven't opened a series on a DVD (with my knowledge) This evening I enjoyed "Go back to the cave of the bat" ... it was fun to enjoy because it was full of trivia and into joke. To see Adam and Burt was fun with this television movie is just amazing in every aspect. They are busy as they played their part in the series. Thank you for the people who produced the "feast" of this great nostalgic ... I see it again. My advice to all fans of Batman is: SEE IT! Rent it! Pay from a friend! Buy !!! I would never expect myself to test this as 9/10 ... It's done very well!
