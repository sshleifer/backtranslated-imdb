I have looked at this section more often than any other part of the TFTC, so it enjoys. And it's terrible, but it's all beautiful, happy ghoulish. The woman kills her second husband but runs the trouble when a survivor in Santa Claus's dress wants to pay him and his girl to visit at that time. Mary Traynor, who seems to remember from the SNL or another comedy television series, is a bad wife, and Larry Drake plays at the end of Santa's dress. I had forgotten Santa played with Drake over the years. Santa is a powerless power and very fearful time. You may probably think how Santa eventually comes into the house. This period is played for laughing, but it can also be very tense at a time.
