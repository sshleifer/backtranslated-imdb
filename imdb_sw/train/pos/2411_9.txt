This movie makes me as one of the most successful attempts at any time to come with the right answers to some of the questions that have emerged on recent studies about "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What prompted Judah if the money was not a matter? What could cause Sanhedrin to meet the holy day? Why did Pilate shout?) It is a movie for the big and thoughtful Christians: fans of "Passion of Christ" of course have craving for the lack of gory festival and dialing characteristics. As for myself, I see a picture here printed - of the common interest of the people to offer a normal sacrifice of sacrifice when they themselves are interested in personal interests - in fact more and more deeply. (Worried, "just do my job" looking on the face of a man who runs the first nail in the hand of Christ is as cool as at any time in the film.) The film does not claim "truth", but the environment and costly always feel "right" "more than a lot of effort to appreciate." It is a slow film but, if you accept its independence limits (ie, after all, "Death" - not the Life - "of Christ"), it is ultimately very rewarding.
