I just love this film. It is a perfect example of amazing stories that come from the Asian movie. There was a recent remake of the movie of this movie, and Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez just very bad. Please do not break these two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, of cunning and wonderful. Hollywood version is quite the opposite. I was surprised when I saw the first trailer for the American Edition to return and who had a star in it. It is typical of damage to Hollywood damage to the worst situation. Cements remake arguments that some foreign films can never be improved on. The only reason the original movie has never been viewed is the US insurgency rebellion for subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for this movie will never work in telling the US is that it is stored, ultra social conservative behavior of Japanese persona faces this film. Indeed, the main character stimulates a more comprehensive understanding of survival in the form of drums, but half of the tension of the film comes from the stereotypes of football games in Japan. Please try to see this film in the original mode, not a full screen of awesome. And please FUNA to return to the US restructuring .... is a sharp efficiency in comparison to the original Japanese movie. Yes, I know the movie "natural" is much larger, and this is just Japanese to make a story, but only two people can see any time soon with this new US restore. Speaking of foreign films, I will make a few quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon's wedding - I am writing this first because, the best film! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian lies flic identity! 3.Shiri-A Korea action pic which combines both Asian flares & style of American conspiracy 4.Run Lola Run-A German film that merge is techno logo for beauty. <br /> <br /> Well, a quick list anyway: -)
