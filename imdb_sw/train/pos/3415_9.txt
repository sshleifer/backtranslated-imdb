This film was awesome. It's a piece of movies. The characters are well organized through the fact that Director, Lucy Walker brings to the film. I strongly recommend this to anyone who looks at this special film that shows humanity in human nature. Lucy Wlaker reflects the beauty of the environment. This film is a true example of man against nature and sometimes man against man. Internal shock and victory is great in that regard. The lesson of how Tiebtans see blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film describes a culture that has never been made. Lucy Walker has made the voice of Erik Weihenmayer when he had no ordinary hearing. Thank you Lucy for being true for your vison as a film manufacturer.
