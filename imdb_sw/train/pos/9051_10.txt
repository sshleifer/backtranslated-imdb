I was looking at this when my wife asked to ask from another room about my rental option. My opinion? "I look at my life!" Even though it is small, but only for 5 years or more, than "Rocket Boys" I remember very quickly what Sputnick was greeted by our education administrators and how all the features of the Science Fair got faster and took me with on a hurricane. My hurricane entered My State Science, in physics and '62, although our group was very unsuccessful to get help, for example, fire fighters approached for leadership and advice until after a terrible event, our city went so far away and allow us to visit the Nike forest site on the Chicago coast. This movie brought it all back to me and I will hit that brought it to our group "UberNerds" of '50s' and early 60 years. We are in the same state of the current brain brain and we need this movie as a country. See!
