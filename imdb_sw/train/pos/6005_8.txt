Although this film is clean (because it was made when people did not talk about sex), it is a very important film to show girls of prepubescent so they can know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, paid to Kotex's company, though an amazing thing is that Disney made this film - as they did many educational movies during the 1940s-60s. However, the film has done well, though, I think the filmmaker has missed a real chance. Instead of the beautiful voice of the female writer and bland pictures would be great if they could use Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney group !! I know this would have given the Walt old heart attack, but wow that would have a good film! By the way, although the concept of sex is not recognized in the film, it defines the general menstruation. However, you have no other information (especially about sex) that I think was included in the accompanying booklet. Now as long as I can know why I looked at the cartoon about menstruation.
