I am aware of these reviews to review the critics of the film, but I will protect this film. <br /> <br /> Dentist is a very good film. Acting is not always high, but fun is good and the story is good. You can also see the stars of Linda Hoffman. It's not that I am a professional in this field, but the direction seems to be good and the plot means. Corbin makes a good dentist. It makes the dentist what the jaw does for papa ... ish. In fact it had a limited budget, but they did well with what they could, and developed good characters (those counting).
