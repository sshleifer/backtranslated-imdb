I was very surprised by this film. To enter the sneak preview, without knowing anything about the movie except for one trailer I saw, I thought it would be a Dude Where my car is so passionate. I expected an unhealthy sexual joke and the prevalence of leading behaviors that would be put to the end because that's how the films work. Instead I got an amazing movie, amazing about a decent woman, who had never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film faces a joke of full sex with dirt and frequent-looking -nipple! All characters are people you might know in real life, redeeming friends who are striving to unite the brothers and live their lives. I went to think that this film would be a total destruction, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's up to the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin), but it has been made wise. At the end, you are attracting this person to get a firm, which says a lot about film because honestly, do you care if Ashton Kutcher got his car or not?
