Cheech best with Chong movie so far !! In Cheech and Chong all this is more reliable so far. I think I've seen them all about twelve times, and I love all. But this is quite obvious. Compared with others, this covers a lot of things and gives you plenty to laugh. The portion of Scripture is still part of our language today, after 25 years. I heard them write a new script so who knows ... I think these are the only ones who have succeeded in doing good movies in this kind. I wonder if John Ashcroft has ever watched one of them ...
