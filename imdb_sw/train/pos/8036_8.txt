Some boys think that the sniper is not good because part of the action was not good. Well, if you look like a movie action, this point of view can be true as part of this point of argument is not exciting. However, I think this is a psychological game rather than one step. <br /> <br /> The movie actually told us about two snipers who definitely had different behaviors and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and strong 74 killed him, looked like he had a cold heart. However, after Beccket showed his dream day of Montana, we can see his mildness inside. It was the brutal war and the sacrifice of its allies that made Beccket called a cold heart. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the contrary, was a new start, a green hand, and even had no reputation as a sniper. Billy Zane did very well show the victory of Muslims and panic when he tried to "put a shot to the heart of man" (such as Beccket said). What he thought about the suicide mission is now that it can be done easily and then he can return safely and receive a prize. These two were quite different from their behavior and I think that the movie had made a difference with the results they had because of the difference in their behavior. The two players were fighting, judging and finally coming to the knowledge and communication with what they did to help save others. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good work of a film but a good psychological one.
