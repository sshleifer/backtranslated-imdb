<br /> <br /> Hide after the war, this story was made to show the Anglo-American relationship after the war. It came to receive the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after WWII. This amazing film includes the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the American Foundation's father and various others on a long-term level (special effects at the time) and beyond the doors of heaven without lose his loyalty. Even though a strange voice, this clever script leads and plays the player between heaven and earth with the knowledge of the mountain goat and the priceless gifts of charming not compared to the movie since then. Ready to have your heart hot and this beautiful, innocent and pleasant story. Roger Livesey works as someone who has stolen !!!! British cinema should cry when it remembers how good it was in the early years of the war. <br /> <br />
