Titanic is a classic. I was so surprised that this film did not have ten solid, generally in the IMDb user position. Maybe, it's just cool to borrow Titanic loans today, but when it started to be something. When the movie came out the people gathered at the cinema. When it happened on my sister's video and I'd like to watch it twice a day a month. It was safe to say we were considering and for good reason. Some disaster events were hard to forget, like a child who was killed, or someone who committed suicide after killing a person in an unworthy crowd. Many people died on the ship, and showed that on the film and quickly and the feelings needed are a difficult challenge that James Cameron went on. And let's not forget the wonderful romance between Jack and Rose. If their relationship was the idea of ​​someone's thought it was interesting. They didn't know each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They are sure that hell gives Romeo and Juliet run for their money. "I won't leave you, Jack." Titanic is a very good film on the basis. It is a powerful story told through the act of brilliant, cinema movies, good music, and full staff of hard and dedicated workers. In fact it makes my thoughts when someone says they hate this film.
