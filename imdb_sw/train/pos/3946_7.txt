I have seen one and only comments about this non-sensitive and very sensitive movie, so I decided to write myself. I saw this film first when it came out and made it several times since then. First of all, I would like to say that, in general, the items that this film gets are what is appropriate. It does not matter that it has some low budget and other errors. It's worth checking. The idea of ​​introducing a film on Walt Whitman's visit is the Anglo-Canada community that is a narrow and narrow community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to the most amazing muscles. The movie is about the type of humanitarian catalysis inspired by people. And in that sense it is absolutely correct. Acting - especially with Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. Scripting and discussion are powerful and pay proper attention to the emotions and inflections of time. In general, what do you not like? Besides, the name of another film that Whitman brings to life for life?
