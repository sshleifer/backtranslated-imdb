I can't say this movie is disappointing because I read some reviews before checking and didn't do as I thought it would be. The bar was not set up, so the fact that my expectations were met not to say much. <br /> <br /> Good: New York City. If you live in a city like me, you will understand somewhere and understand that the city should be more than just setting, rather than one of the characters. There is a real time of tender, interesting dialogue, and a conspiracy emerges on the left and right which everything puts interesting things. The worst: The first thing I thought of after leaving the hall is that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them want more" fashion. Certainly skits / scenes more beautiful, but there are many skirts falling into the "middle" category, many in fact, which is ultimately brings the movie down. Also, the distinctions of New York City, although they indicated that although the various pans of the city and mentioned in the film, have not been identified or analyzed to the point of making the city justice. For example, most of the skits involve well doing mid-white. I mean I know the city is the home of a large number of humanity but come, the Paris plot is a new character that makes New York City like Lancaster, PA, or a certain place is white. It is only a desire to see the city has changed to its inheritance. Even so, even after saying this, I would like to give you a New York, I love you view. Who knows, maybe you will agree with my opinion and maybe you can't. You will never know until you see yourself. These reviews are not meant to prevent anyone from viewing this film, as everyone's opinion on the art varies. I only give them very clear headings on what to expect.
