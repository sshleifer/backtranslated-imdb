That's right. The movie is better than the book. Do not make a mistake, I would like to book. But the movie is very good. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall for the best. (I have not seen Scherman Crothers and open Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than what used in the book. But I have already said about those in my opinion on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The film is being shot in a better place than where the mini series was hit. And the events of REDRUM are creepi than what is in the book. So if you are looking for a great film, get Shinley Kubrick to shine. But counting have a nightly nightmare for 3 weeks
