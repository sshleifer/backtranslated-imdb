In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and walked through the three-way Warner Brother music which gave the listeners a time of depression during their crisis. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42 Street Street and Footlight Parade were all placed in the world of Broadway Theater and basically the same theme of the show must continue. Apart from Keeler and Powell these films included the olddiscopic biography of Busby Berkeley, showing a stop tunes with many supportive players. They all say that the characters of their kind but I have to agree to the delightful with Footlight because of the energy speed and cause James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42 Addresses get well as headlines showing production - especially Baxter as burned out of Julian Marsh in search of the last box of smash box. All of them do not have the Cagney's infectious energy, however, who applauds the self-reliant speed of the Broadway music. He is quite a hurricane as he deals with production numbers, uncomfortable partners and gold partner. The script faces some of the bright migrants twice delivered to the superlative help support featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who will reject everyone down. Busby Berkeley dance numbers are subjected to surreal, impressive and dangerous and have been done long before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Unfortunately, thirty and sometimes more will not be able to see the rich music and Footlight logo again. Jews and values ​​made sure.
