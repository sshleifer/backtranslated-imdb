This may be 10 if it was not predictable and hollywood-ish. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the greatest actors of our time (why not lead me to ask) and others to stand on a very high level. I was personally attracted to Hugh O 'Connor who played with Christy Brown as a child. The first part I watched was very strong. Wow.
