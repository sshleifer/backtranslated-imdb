Coming Things is a rarity of rarities, films about ideas. Many movies show a vision of the future, but a few attempts to show us how the future is. The first part of the film, when the war comes to Kilatown, is short but powerful. (Surprisingly, a film viewer in his release year laughed at the report that the enemy aircraft attacked England - the appeal was in its length. The Wells prediction was carried out very quickly. best. The names of the details are very much thought to German Expressionist graphic design. The director of art was William Cameron Menzies great, and his sets of Everytown ruins are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is a very deceiver as Grandmother. Everytest of the 21st century is the same design. Acting in the 21st century story is not compulsory - perhaps this was an improper attempt to compare the knowledge of technology at this time with the 1970s discrimination. and it could be done better, even with 30 technologies. This is especially difficult since the major flight events are very persuasive. This is delivered by Raymond Massey's good speech which concludes the film - rarely has a scientific development efficiency shown. Massey's last question is more relevant now than at any time, in the shadows of the shadow-shaped area. The area is supported by Sir Arthur Bliss's music, whose last name I am proud of. Unfortunately, VHS versions of this film are quite awesome, and serious technical problems. Many versions have exchanged montage interesting of future workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope a good DVD exists throughout the entire film.
