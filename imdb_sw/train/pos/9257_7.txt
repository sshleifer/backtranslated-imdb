What? This is your ordinary women in the journey of love travel navy? Perhaps, Hell, you know how this form works now, a beautiful woman is brought to the picture, someone should love her. <br /> <br /> I think this film follows the usual lines of the story, but that doesn't say anything about content. There are major events with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, though they are short. Other items were useless, such as the need to enter a random fight, but it is entertainment to watch, the fight was done well. It is quite clear, but he feels very good. Humor is a good balance, you will not hurt your stomach on this, but you will continue to smile. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of steam action, so it's not one for children.
