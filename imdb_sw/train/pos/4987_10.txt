Although I love EE books "Doc" Smith and David A. Kyles Lensman books, anime, which is interesting to consider books, are very happy and highly creative. Even though the story may seem to have a knowledge of Sci-Fi / fantastic buffs, such as a child on a planet alone possesses mystical power and repeats the death of his family, however it is entertainment yet. Plus, Lensman was the first picture of the motion of the Animation using hand-set and CG animation all at once. Indeed, it may seem that it can not be short now, but it is still innovation. If it was not for Lensman, nothing happened (personally, I think the Computer Graphics looks best in live animation.) It is just too bad to be released on DVD / VCD in a few countries (especially on designs foreign and different). I just want to release the Lensman film and television series on DVD / VCD in any part of the world, not just a certain part. <br /> <br /> P.S. Bad rules! I think he's wonderful and very good looking too.
