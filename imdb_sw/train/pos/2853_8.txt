Finally I saw this film tonight after hiring on Blockbuster (VHS). I agree that it is natural nature. Yes, maybe the characters were not the perfect road but not one of those movies. Instead, we are treated by the eye of the director, his vision of the story. And it does not stop. And be honest, I didn't want it. I believe that Sabu should have the influence of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I totally love the third way leads to seeing a beautiful woman on the street to expose them for a short time. I really need to see another job of the director because this film has helped me very much. If you want insight, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, the camera and hilarity movement of crime, see here.
