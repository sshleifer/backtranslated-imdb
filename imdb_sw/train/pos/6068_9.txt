The red skelton was still another great star who made a change from film to television. It seems that it was certainly a cause for laughter for US backs. <br /> <br /> Show show and opening of monologue. Later, we would have different characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in monologue? How can we forget San Fernando Red? I remember one place where the Red King told his queen to call him your oil. Go to know that Red can use its comedic talents to hide the really terrible life. She lost a leukemia child at the age of 11 or more. His wife, Georgia, died of suicide.
