Modern I thought it was better to think about romance and little doubt in the middle. Rob Stewart is a good actor I don't know why people keep giving him bad rap. As for Mel Harris he is a good actor and for those who think he looks too old for Rob is only five years. <br /> <br /> Rob had a leading role in his TV series and one at the Scifi Center. I am sure you remember the hot posts by Jane PainKiller. It also made stars in several television films and now performs TV series. They need to give him more responsibility to lead which is the best.
