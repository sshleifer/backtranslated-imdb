This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the West has what could be the best John Arthur performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but ddy devoted Calamity Jane. In fact he drew it! Gary Cooper is in its taciturn, but can say some of the pithy words: 'The plains are great, but the road crosses ... sometimes.' Myths are pastiche to end all pastiches. All the coworkers of the West Lolo cowboy seem to be there somehow except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story to someone (or at least, DeMille would like to believe it). There is no chance of anything so evanescent as a trick, this is' stomp 'em in the face' story for civilians. The strange thing about this film is that it is a very early attack before what Eisenhower was finally called a 'military industrial complex'. It's not just stories about gun fighters, but about seizing anyone, and doing it from Washington's heart. But let's not enter politics, let us go to DeMille, who can be assured of being high. The main theme of this film many years later is that it uses the first color of the film written by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about work in its history, 'Bad Boy of Music'. Antheil seems to have come out of the “loud voice” adopted by all the West, where the valleys sing with the sounds and sounds of countless cowboys in heaven, celebrating open spaces and regular interactive songs. That is why it does not sound normally, because we've heard a thousand times. But he seems to be the first to call the collective rustlings of the whole sage into the open sky symphony that has entered into the American historic unit, and it emits a sound that has never been different since then, as it may, but of course fit. It's exciting to see Anthony Quinn in the early appearance as Hindi Cheyenne. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but you missed the crowd. Gary Cooper destroys them all, with great size, - but when did he disappear?
