Cliffhanger is a good crime crime crime and some errors from director Renny Harlin who is very interested in making this film about a professional player who finds himself being kidnapped by a colleague and a group of criminals in search of suits full of money stolen in Rocky Mountains . Sylvester Stallone is an amazing as Gabe Walker viewer of the expert especially in practical action / fight but some of them definitely go to the unrealistic line. For the film though I intend to stop my unbelief. The rest of the participants including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respected as the helpers in the movies. The process of action / fighting is done well but as stated before some are not very realistic no matter how difficult you are. Plans to plant however have made it very good because instead of making a whole film on the studio somewhere they chose felt very realistic and Ariel's mountain mounted views are wonderful to add touch to the movie. Death is an invention while others are predictable. Criminals are strong but it would be better if they insist on one of the main ones rather than having many of them. Stimulating the film was a little slow but good worsened in this. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone than you enjoy this too. Cliffhanger in general has developed character and adequate action, drama, insistence, excitement, exciting, and good performances with those who make this film a watch time.
