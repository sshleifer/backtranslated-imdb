The stars of the film Jay Leno as Detroit soldiers, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as Tokyo troops were sent to Detroit to find a stolen model of car cars. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit with the hope of selling a high-tech car company and a run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately people who were asked to discuss the contract killed him and took the same pattern. Derek Jarryd tries to withdraw from Phillip Madras who led men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing and threatens Jarryd to force him to continue his cooperation. At the same time in one junk building where a Japanese man was killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by these men. Tony's friend was looking at jard's junk. Tony sets out to find a murderer against his great order. Tony is on theft while definitely killed should investigate the case. When Tony examines the crime he runs into the Japanese army and for the wrong he is holding. Finally they end up working together in the case. They make an unusual pair and there are some really exciting parts of it as well as some of the ignorance events such as Pat Morita flying and voting through the windshield of the car moving and pouring Madras on the head. But you become a fan of a friend of pleasure lovers, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he enjoys that role with Pat Morita is also good. However, it makes one of the most thoughtful fighters of film in action film. If you liked the buddy movies of the buddy, the 80 cheesy films or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie.
