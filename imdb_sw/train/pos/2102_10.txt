I sat to watch 'Largo Winch' I expected anything more than practical events and interesting cars. When I stood, I saw all this; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden is finally not an opponent in the film, start with. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but two real stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both working well. In Radivoje Bukvic demonstrated good Goran. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> and especially the awesome Croatian seas were amazed, and I had no intention of taking my eyes on the screen when Largo entered the beautiful island. Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; as a person likes cars of great variety of limousine; this is their movie. It is also a movie for people who love tracking action, a good acting, a high-quality theme, and above all, a fast written film, to fight with an amazing and indoor game emerging. <br /> <br /> My vote, since you have exposed the bad day is: 10/10
