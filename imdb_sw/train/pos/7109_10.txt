First, let's start with the wrong points: 1) There are TIME, a few who are in the line of stories and questions that have been raised that will not find anywhere near and answered; 2) Movie is not for all people, so senseless viewers will be worried and start to start during the film. The two most accurate above is important because the film is very quiet. In the old hall hall (like that I went), you can hear the reel go through the projector sometimes. I liked it. The movie did not stop the function of music, nor harm: it lets you reflect on what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates the atmosphere that is quite attractive. This type of atmosphere was produced by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would like to recommend very much to the fans of movies, as the movie work is amazing. Those who appreciate their appreciation of the only movie on the story will be completely disappointed. It's a kind of story that you should create links in your mind later. (My version is a good taste, but maybe it's far away!) If you are going to catch a movie, there is one very cool place: when two are talking on their mobile phone. Effect of ultra-cool sound that puts you at this time. Hats off by someone who thought to do so.
