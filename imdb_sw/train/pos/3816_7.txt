"The Sunshine of Mystery" reminded me of "Rapture" (1991), and I Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is the best film. It shows many Korean Christians in the Korean region of the region, and the experience of the main character interacts with them after a tragic tragedy. Shin-ae is a widow who is a widow who goes to the city of Milyang ('Mystery of Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul and her little son. She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a new start in a new place. He has not taken well the series of local Christian zealos, one of his members trying to persuade him to come to their church meetings and prayer. Shin-ae is essentially secular and excommunicates these people as they can. In fact, he drives almost everyone in Milyang to start, but some of them continue to try to attack his world, and the result is often interesting. To say more would be to give them a film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is too high. After reading that he won the Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I expected to have a good job. But Mrs Jeon is fascinating and impossible to take your eyes while she is screwed. The movie is a kind of hurting Evelyn Waugh-esquire piece of work, showing how Fate can feel insane as very strange inevitable.
