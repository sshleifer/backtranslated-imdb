It was spent on September 12, 2006 2 inquiry in the first field 1 during the International Film Festival of Toronto. The film was the World Union one day before the Elgin Theater Visa Screening room. <br /> <br /> The basic plan involves Morgan Freeman playing one of the most popular actors who are on the bottom of his work and who keeps the tasks that can be under him, but which he still does with a good attitude to know that he needs to pay tax etc.. The downward slope is shown to be a long-term between the tasks and previous flicks in the DVD's business spaces and become chauffeured and not very sure of the producer's own producer who gives Freeman off the market of the community where he will do research for the role as a supermarket manager. Recently it finds a real life market being carried out by the steel "10 or less" steel tracker adviser tracked by Paz Vega. When Freeman's trip back and Vega needs help in prepping to the interviews cause them to join force in the journey to get to Freeman to return home and get Vega work that will send him over the work of the way work. <br /> <br /> When the movie was fun, it seemed as if it was still a sketch or an ongoing work. There was an extended music circle (One with Vega & Freeman teaching songs of other children in the car, one of which looks like Paul Simon's music video) that seemed like a padding to bring time and even the film was about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing Morgan Freeman also likes if he is because without him this would be very little. In fact it was a delightful part and Paz Vega is also happy, but it wasn't enough here to say that it is a perfect film. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman began talking about stopping the car asking directions and Paz Vega said he would never do that. Who has ever heard a boy who wants to ask for directions by a woman saying no? In the real world it is the opposite of truth. Make sure you stay with the withdrawal on credit. Little with the Target Store saleslady teach Morgan Freeman how to cancel sales are just hilarious! The first time a Freeman driver insists it is a Freeman voice on reading "Tape Books" was also very good. Director / author Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for Q&A shortly after observation. Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took over the role he had exchanged very little on what was there. The beautiful writing of Silberling and also about how Freeman can get into the role and make it feel like if he was born to play.
