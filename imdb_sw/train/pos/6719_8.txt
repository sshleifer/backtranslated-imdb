I love this film because it is a good work of movies, made by people who care enough to make art and not just home movies. It is filled with the Super-surfer home of Greg Noll, and video videos from others who are joining the 50-year-old enthusiasm. Filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however it is too small to think of being a citizen. Surfers are not elite nor experimental experiments. Neither are the surgeons (perhaps) or Ph.d's (again, maybe). It believes in the efforts of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of humanity goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace, derived from the end of war. Surfers celebrate the abolition of war on the north coast of the Hawaiian island attacked by a Japanese zero fifteen years before. It celebrates the lowest time of the country that fought the cold war - instead of the fire - and the Russian scholars. Surfing is the last narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historical. I think Alexander the Great did not want to celebrate his tactics. He had to go out and conquer several countries to get the good news he received. This movie has no military heroes. It does not have guns. The only winners of coastal fighters have a beer stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not a desire. It's fun to exhaust.
