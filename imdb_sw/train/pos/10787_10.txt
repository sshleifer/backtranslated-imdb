So when I had a little movie this is now with my sister and I loved it. we would like to watch it all the time. when our friends came we had sleepovers and we expect a great rocky rocky rocks and magic weeds. I'm now 21 and still like this film, some old friends and I recently met together and watched it, we knew all the songs and we played and we talked about how much we hate Profster when we were younger. One friend really bought this of magical toys and grandmothers for her 2-year-old daughter because she wants to adopt our love of this film. This is a movie you can let your children look and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, just many songs and important lessons.
