Designer of the best race of this year's Animation in Oscars. It is an Irish film with a heart, but it was produced by Belgium and Brazil, and, I think, workmen in all three countries. The product is one of the best and unique films in recent memory. The preservation of the character is a small reminder of the French film's Persepolis film from a few years ago, with very simple characters and beautiful, black publications. This film is not black and white. No. What makes this film great is its use of colors, just some of the awesome and awesome colors that I have ever seen. Composition of the overall image is also many geometry, and characters who are rectangles or ovals essentially. Many parts of the film can be used to find the circle - the main feature of the visual view is the center circle of the picture. All geometric designs have a purpose - a story is about a young boy who learns that an artist who works in a targeted text. The story of the film is not deep, but it's a good story of fantasy. Brendan is a little boy in Kells, a walled city, built by his uncle to keep Vikings. The Kells member, Brother Aiden, encourages Brendan to take an example. He also encourages him to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forest, who lives in nymph. Bruno Coulais offers a wonderful, close and beautiful mark as he did with Coraline, which I see better than a year.
