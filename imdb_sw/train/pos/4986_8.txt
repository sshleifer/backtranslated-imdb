Lensman is a very low gem of Toho and MK studios. It is free to consider the novel, but reminds me of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see it's Japanese and Papers or Japanese. English publication was broken and edited to die. Nothing new is new, although it is the first element of animation to combine CG images with hand animation, but it's fun to watch, however.
