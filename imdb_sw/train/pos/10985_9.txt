I had no speech and destroyed after my first look of this part - many parts of the GARDENS GRAY is very funny and unsupported surreal - a documentary of not, this gives true Fellini or David Lynch run for their money in weirdsville sweepstakes. I continued to look at how these women (living on eccentric clinics) reveal their own humanity in the most extraordinary way, and I wonder if their success from the world was given by something other than life in blue-blue world, perhaps abuse, or perhaps only the streak of rebellion and rebellion who spiraled out of their control and taking his own life. That may be one of the same future films that come close to exploitation, without going to an absolute limit - if Edies do their thing, I kept considering things like empty gin bottles in the beaten bedroom, cats on the bed, racoons emerging from the holes in the walls, and the last area seemed to be sad - like a very wrong baby's birthday. It is very obvious to see and seek - never forgot, but very sad.
