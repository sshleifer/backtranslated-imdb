Richard Dreyfuss star in "Moon On Parador," the 1988 film of Paul Mazursky also played Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss drives New York actors, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make the film. When the dictator dies suddenly, the Secretary of Police (Julia) who is really compelling the dictator and the country, gives Jonathan's description of playing dictator, after seeing the similarities between them. Recently Jonathan deals with the house as Alphonse Simms, and the girl of Simms Madonna (Braga) who knows how to change him in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears in the drag like Simms' Mama, looks at us how CIA works in three countries of the world. Characteristics of Winters, allegedly a trader, is actually a CIA Assistant. The film, however, is engaging but not so much on a very bad land and is more than sending, and one of the most wonderful there. Richard Dreyfuss does a good job as Jonathan actor and Alphonse dictator, and creates two different characters and pouring two. Sonia Braga is as good as Madonna, and Raul Julia works as evil as Strausmann, the back of the dictator. It is one of these exhibitions that you do not know at all. Charo is near the maid and can be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good film, not a great blockbuster, but very entertaining.
