Antonion was aimed at another hippin, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than "blowing". It was not successful with critics and young as old though. Why? Perhaps because it was the European view of the United States filled with clich√©s that did not work then and that was not a good age. (The revolutionary students initially are embarrassed.) It is possible when it was released the largest movie posters and those specially designed for the youth market seemed to be. If it was released a year before maybe the hippes in the desert would have looked clean ... It is a very interesting film tho, beaten very well with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes between, such as love in the desert, the quietness of the desert house and the end of explosion. .. That direction was two amateur did not help. They were good but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with proper executives! Maybe Michelle Phillips or Jessica Lange little ... Talk is really fun and pain sometimes, tho can't know how the lines are given ... <br /> <br /> The last seventy years of intervention is worth looking at images and sounds ....
