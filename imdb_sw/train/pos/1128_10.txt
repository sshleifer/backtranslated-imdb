Although the recent reference to the part of Homer's "Troy" and Brad Pitt was a recreational once, "Iphigenia" and incandescent Irene Pappas are delightful. According to the natural environment and the Greek-speaking actors speak their language. Meet this film on one of the many DirecTV movies to protect my heart despite my concentration problems. No glitter or "bling" in this film, just a rich-rich story that has been described by the same realistic actors feel that they are emerging from a real family in trouble. I think even Homer, if there was a truth, would be proud of this story. JLH
