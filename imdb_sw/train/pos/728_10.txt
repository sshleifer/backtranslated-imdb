Ramones, whom I consider to be the founders of a modern punk rock, whistled their unique voice to a staggering movie about the rock of the spirit rock (PJ Soles) who faces the head of compassion, happy (Mary Woronov) for the right of Rock. <br /> <br /> Working with the sound of brimming and fantastic music, RRHS is happy with the concept and implementation. Facing a delightful harvest (such as a mouse experiment), a young spirit (perhaps my all-time filing film), and wonderful, off-the-wall when (scenjacket scenes). If you are looking for a film that seems to be fun on the molecular level, do not see it again. But if you are looking for a good, dignified, wonderful, perhaps you should look a little more. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I am Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
