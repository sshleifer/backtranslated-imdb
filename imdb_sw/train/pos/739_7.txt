I have been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were two children, from her Disney years. I loved her antics of pride in the film like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was very departure from all. Where the other female actors of the time turned into a brain sex similar to the comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie went to the story of hurt and sadness of young people who were motivated to lose by the temptation to abuse. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not Porky. This was not "OK". This was the story of the dark & ​​powerful destructive life of young people. Unfortunately it's a story that is still going on every day around the world, this film can be changed (with the sound of the current voice) and it is still quite suitable. It is not the best film made, it's tired in a certain place, not all the shows are better. But Jodie Foster continued to show his chops as an ordinary casual actor (the trend started when he was very young in Driver Driver). 7 out of 10 Barky
