Viggo Mortensen star as a new prisoner of the haunted prison in which the guard (Played well with Lane Smith) has a secret of a gris that may be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners are killed by the common existence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a pastor who knows the secret and fears his life. When I think the prison movies, I always think movies using Stallone or Van Damme or popular games such as Shawshank Redemption or Green Mile. However, I did not expect the stories of more spirits in the verses of III III. Prison however is an aviation effort and certainly remains the best movie of the works of Renny Harlin. The movie is creepy and has some good acting from the cast (at the time) unknown. Lane Smith comes off because his supervisor is not a typical evil person but rather a nervous and twitchy that adds some trust to a movie that surpasses expectations. <br /> <br /> *** between 4- (Good)
