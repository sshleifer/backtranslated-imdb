This movie was excellent. I had no expectations of living on all the hype but made. As all the Bourne movies this step is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked two other movies in the trilogy you would like this too. Film films are straightforward and no problem of conspiracy is not available. Okay, Julia Stiles's behavior in the Itiko's safe house was a kind of surveillance especially after what happened in the parking but it means that he is the only character in the "stone stone" which Bourne knows, they don't want to be dead and may be trust him alone in the right direction. The move is driven by characters and their effects on what is happening around the world. What I have always liked about Bourne movies is that Bourne can beat the butt but when she is well as she is a struggle she struggles and takes great damage in them. They do not obey the audience as helpers. <br /> <br /> All actors were established in their exhibitions. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and gets good support from Joan Allen taking his place from Uuwala, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and trilogy. I miss miss Franka Potente though.
