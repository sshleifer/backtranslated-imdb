Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place as Ted Nichols who meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley, (Lenore Aubert). The couple only knew for two days and decided to marry the Judge of Peace (and Judge) and are watering the rain when they go to the home of the judge and know him at home and he will not return until tomorrow. Since your couple is in the house you see some car lift their car and takes part of the car from the engine. As soon as you see this event you are aware that these couples are in great amazement and the storytellers reveal a wonderful event that surrounds Alice Barkley and Ted Nichols who is poor and begins with many problems and no marriage. A good secret, but I've lost Richard Dix. Enjoy.
