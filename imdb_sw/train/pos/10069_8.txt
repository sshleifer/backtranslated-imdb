This film should be seen by the beauty of seeing and moving only, but there is also a fascinating culture of isolation. Women and artists (all linked to the role of the transvestite star star) both have been punished with serious responsibility in China. This makes it possible to cling between the old street musician and the little girl even as strong as a victory over natural culture. The only problem I had with this film was the sound of the widespread sound and feeling needed for the performance of the actors. Alternative ways to satisfy summer movies.
