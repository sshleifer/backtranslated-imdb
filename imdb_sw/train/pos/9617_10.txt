This was a very entertaining movie and I was very excited, not usually paying movies like these (ie indie flicks) however, I was attracted to the film because it had an amazing stroke that included Jamie Kennedy, who I loved since trilogy Scream. The film director took a risk (and risky risk) telling them many lives (and I mean MANY) different people and worried at different intervals. Taking that risk was a good idea because the final result is a very good film. <br /> <br /> The movie has a few MAIN characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - an unfortunate writer of a cookie whose relationship with his partner is on rocks because of the argument. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - a masterpiece of a plane who has love for all living things (except, maybe a meter) and who, despite his good heart, has an unfortunate increase. Cyr (Brian Cox) - the owner of a Chinese restaurant / gold shop that is germaphobe and because of his viral fears put his assistant / cook - (Alexis Cruz) under pressure to continue with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) married Olive - (Christina Kirk) who is believed to try; make him happy, see shame, go mad, and live a normal life. They begin to have a small argument and around things and Olivi begins to worry about Ernie. Gordon (Grant Heslov) is a person whose life does not work very well, as bad things begin to increase in his life he decides to do it. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) has proved that Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is a girl of her dreams and that they are for each other, though she's more concerned. He tries to give every chance he gets and surely makes the effort! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has just run away from his job and is skeptical of his role as a service provider, taking another job that is not just good. His wife Annelle - (Arabella Field) comforts her experience of losing her job until she learns that Johnston was not a husband of love who she thought was. <br /> <br /> All in all I show this movie! <br /> <br /> -Erica
