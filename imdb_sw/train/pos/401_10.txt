I returned from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and noticed the Legend of ZU. I thought it picked * s! It was very creative and special. It is the Crouching Pig's Secret Pig with a very good game. Even if others thought there was a special FX (yeah right!), You can't complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are very good !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks * s !!!!!!!!
