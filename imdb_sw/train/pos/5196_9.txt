Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways better film than it was written. The director knew what he had to work and joined Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It is an enjoyable movie with more sound and working. Artists don't take too much and it seems that this time almost everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and not as hard as it was Dolemite. I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it. As his first film, it seems to some audience (I am very doubtful that Mr. Moore was trying to extend his audience at this time in his career). Look! It was recommended Highjly.
