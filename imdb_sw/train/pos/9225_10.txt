The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek makes this film worthwhile. Bo, looking more than ever, is a widow who recently gets a visit from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo should find the body of a young man so that his soul's spirit can make its transition from a specter back to the life of the body. What? Can he get a suitable candidate? How will he do so so Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> For Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, the presence of the Quinn film, and, thanks to John, look very strange to the entire film, this movie is looking good.
