The Journey of Hope (1990) refers to the journey that most of the non-poor Turks are doing so to live a good life in Switzerland. These people have a desire to live like the West that they will leave their lives and live in an attempt to reach the promised land. Many of them are attacked by greedy pigs who live their lives for a large fee for desperate people who have no win. One family deals with the cold, the mountain range and the criminals only find that it is not always visible white light at the end of the hole. This problem lies around the world, not just in America. Some people forget about it. The heart breaker of a film that will leave you wondering why at the end. It is highly recommended.
