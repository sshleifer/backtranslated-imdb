Kurt Russell, whose work started when he beat Elvis REAL in the Fair At the Fair Fair of the World, perhaps never on top of his performance as a King in this biopic helped by the slash and shock meister Carpenter. There are times when you feel that you are looking at Elvis until something makes you feel the truth ... maybe Don Johnson's absence from Elvis and Queen of Beauty? All exhibitions here are best: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings good levels of nerves and hysteria to its delivery of Momma Presley. Kurt Bing's father is here to play Elvis Vernon's father, and there is good performance from Robert Gray as a friend of Elvis's Elvis. <br /> <br /> Must see for fans of rock n roll.
