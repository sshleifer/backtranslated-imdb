"time of the day is over" is a wonderful picture. somehow, it's better than to "meet close to the third type." (I prefer self-reliance to a large budget). The special effect is cheesy, but that's a great part of fun. jim davis gives the best performance in this film. perhaps it is one of the best roles he had in the feature. The music marks are very good. The story is not meant. Except except it makes IT ALL INTRIGUING more. as many works of art, "at the end of the day" is not afraid to be wise and uncomfortable. "The day of the day has been completed" could be a small indie movie budget, but not too much of the spread of "existential" films of Europe's ninety-sixties. (many of which had limited budget production themselves.)
