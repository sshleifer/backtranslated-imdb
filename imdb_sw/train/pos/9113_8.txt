Perhaps the first Portuguese film I saw in my life, and I liked it. The deal is related to how young military leaders gained power in Portugal in 1974, and eventually won a fixed Caetano government and also completed a war in colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events portrayed in the film show precisely the characteristics of military officers and soldiers making a revolution, oppressed people, who were very happy with these new developments and independence, resistance to Caetano men, and also in the cunning way of many conservative leaders, including Spinola, who took as a new president. The Portuguese revolution may be remembered for the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain explained that Portugal should develop democracy, and this is a country that takes several years after fighting or revolution. The film also shows that military officers and soldiers did not want to kill anyone; even the great enemies were honored last.
