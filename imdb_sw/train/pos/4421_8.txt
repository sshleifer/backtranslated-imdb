Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese movies, taking creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historical themes, what Japanese calls "pieces of the period". Gojoe is very creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. Brilliant, even. The new Japanese Samurai film allows traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and magic powers which are actually part of their old culture, but not actually investigated in the phases of Kurosawa, or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this type is Onmyoji (2001). I would like to put the director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and innovative new Japanese directors of the wave. A recent period of Japanese pieces that I would like to recommend include the Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shato Zatsuichi Zatoichi: Blind Swordsman (2003).
