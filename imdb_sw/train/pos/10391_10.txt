It is very rare for the film to appeal to viewers of all ages - for children with good details and wonderful production, color, and for adults, for the script for reading and writing, good production standards, good making / acting, all who are bound together with a good logo of Rozsa. Two modern contemporary films reach this - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some stories back on this production are amazing. This production, started in the UK during the summer of 1939, led by Hollywood, and became insurer for British intelligence efforts! Producer, Alexander Korda, was finally integrated in 1942. Here is the special case of the intersection of art, business, and politics! By all means, secure a good CD of this film for your library!
