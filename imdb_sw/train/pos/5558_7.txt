This story is known in Tom and Jerry's long-term cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference that two cats instead of one are threatened to evict if they do not recognize the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unknown friend ("Butch?") Who lives at home with him, so this is a "Mammy Two Shoes" who can't believe that they have mice despite two cats in the house. However, he who takes Jerry can stay sometimes gets boot, so the competition has continued! Although it is a common area I enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original vision to see entertainment. You are not just having cats fighting against each other but Jerry in the equation too, so there were enough talents to suggest if you are a fan of Tom & Jerry.
