One of the most beautiful movies that draws us so close, is much closer to the most recent! There were left to look at the screens like, "No they didn't!", Lol. Good performances around! Acting is amazing with Emily Blunt just better! I knew that he could give a strong performance, influential to capture the control of a young Victoria, angry, and dangerous through the entire movie. Also, production is ideal for every way: style, substance and sensitivity. The wonderful view of the wonderful time in the history of Britian told through personal biography and touch of the old school princess until her reign as Queen, later married to Prince Albert, than end up with the birth of their first nine children. It had a well-written screens and non-emotional editing. Rupert's younger friend, the sick and compassionate Prince Albert trying to win the attention of the little queen, than to find his love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), was coming to look. As well as considering it was a relationship between Victoria and her mother, which was sometimes angry, such as her mother and King William (who also did not like his mother). Acting and events were powerful, emotional. I would like to recommend this to anyone who is fascinated by the historical and political situation of the time, and in fact, anyone who loves the true romance story
