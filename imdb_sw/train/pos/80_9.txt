I enjoyed the width! I would like to weigh 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Little". There was no mention even where today or why they did not participate in the atonement. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake to give information about their lack of appearance. Even so, I was glad that TNN was running back again! I was looking for events for years and how happy to be able to delete the entire series (I might have missed a few events). Jenny Hanahan
