After seeing Redemption, movies like Pulp Fiction doesn't seem too bad. Perhaps with the blood today and the levels of bullying do not seem to be difficult, but if you think this was 1972 and that the movie has a very bad base and makes you think differently. I started to watch this film was nothing unusual until I got to the "Dueling Banjos" area. In such a situation the cruelty and edge of this film is clear. When I saw Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) going to head to the head and a young boy appeared, it was shown how these movies can be found. When you think that a child has a small banjo, which is likely to be made by hand, compared to Drew's fine guitar, you know how out of their four men. <br /> <br /> If the plot is going to be very reliable and it has never reduced its limits. But what defines this film, about four business men who get more than they discussed on the sea trip, is that the director John Boorman (Excalibur) destroys all characters away from the clear caricatures or exhibitions. So if the movie goes into full fear and insist I was worried about all men and what will happen to them. Teamwork is best. And Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemies of the Country) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading great cast. Jon Voight is possible the most difficult thing of all in this film and that is making its transformation from the family family to a very reliable hero. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a hero from the beginning, the attitude of view changes the movie period. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good in a very large role, comes raped by hillbilly, while Ronny Cox returns in reliable performance. One thing that has made these movies have power for me is that criminals were as frightened as I have ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and very scared as hillbilly's. <br /> <br /> Total rescue was better and I suggest it to anyone, except for people with abdominal and weak children. 10/10. Watch this film.
