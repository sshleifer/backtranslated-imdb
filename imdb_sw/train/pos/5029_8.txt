I entered this movie maybe a little jaded with hack-and-slash films on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This small treasure was fun at the speed of the sky, the dark sky. More surprising was still a very small amount of blood displayed. Like many beautiful movies, this chooses something for thought, and Bill Paxton did a good job in leading. Events in the car as well done, and after looking at the part of the "Anatomy of the Scene" at the end of the video tape, it is good to see that some of the subtle aspects of the trick, but what I saw it desired and not just "Oh, that looks good , put it "kind of direction. This is an interesting movie, full of grimness. Still, for the lesson of darkness, much of it is done during the day, even some more disturbing events. Acting is unique (OK, I have always been a fan of Booth Authority), and I haven't gone up. Alternatively, it has failed so much that works well for this type of film. If there is any place where this film is missing, it is located at the end, which looks just a little bit, but it still works with a simple level without damaging the feeling or film message. What is the message? It's something that everyone decides for himself. In total, at the rate of 1-10, this movie fits 8th for those who have a type of gothic of the south (ie: "Body temperature" or "Midnight in the garden of good and evil"), and about 5 to those who give them 't.
