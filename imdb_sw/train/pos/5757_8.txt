This movie can only from the 1970s! It is a wonderful movie of action set up in a small town of California. A certain type of mill or plant is locked, all of a sudden, very bad behavior occurs on the street! The cities of these cities are fed! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), goes to another city to use his brother, Aaron, played with Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is Vet Vietnam who looks and makes a little bit. He hangs out with a group of other vet of Vietnam ignorant. They come to the city to sanctify it (they are used), but under their good works, they actually run gambling houses, asking for money, protection. It takes time for people to consider, and in Cain's and Abel Bible presentations, Vincent will take his brother. There is a spectacular blue-collar environment for this movie, which makes it interesting (see the scene of fighting the cock!). Vincent is also close to angels in this role ?? he thinks too much of his brother, he cannot take him to do the evil deeds he is accused of. Finally comes his mind? her lover, the Victoria's chief, has been shot in the back and she has been beaten at her home. Kris Kristofferson is as effective as Aaron. He opposes any cold, and even coos gently and speaks to Vincent's little daughter (she calls him 'Uncle Aaron') even when he ends his father's life, all the while shouting! Vincent and Kristofferson have different good chemistry for each other. Bernadette Peters makes it look attractive as a 'saloon' girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good movie to work on 70, if you can find it! Not available on DVD yet?
