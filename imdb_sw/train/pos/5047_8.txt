Actor Paxton made his first writing in the shadow, the dark, and the good sparked about the widow's servant (Paxton himself) who unites his two sons to participate in copper, claiming that the victims are not human but "demon", and that they are chosen by God destroy these "spirits". This is all stated in a flashback with one of the sons, now grown (Matthew McConaughey) to the FBI agent concerned (Authority Boothe). It's hard to forget this film directly; better than most of the killings, it's a misleading and unmistakable story described in a straightforward style and a minimum of cinema movies. Paxton, of course, shows any blood even to the end. They did well with all, especially two children's actors (Jeremy Sumpter recently "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary's "Spy Kids 2" and "Internal Disruption"). The only reason I set aside any points is because I can understand that some people can get all this hard on the stomach. In any event, it is an atypical thriller consisting of a good script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
