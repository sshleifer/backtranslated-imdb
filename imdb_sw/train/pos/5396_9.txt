Simple, meaningful and provides punch emotional. I will always follow a short film and it is often good to go through something that has a simple and broadcast message, without pretending or guiding separation. The boy at school should attend the lesson when his friend is struggling and is given the most important lesson of his life, just to find that when there is not enough copies to go next to him he will take part in the comfort school. Unlike many short films with children or actors these children find themselves and are believed. Sound tone reinforces the feeling of the piece and the punchline of the film works well.
