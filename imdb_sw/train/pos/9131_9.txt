'I just wanted you to laugh at the Purple Rain.' This is the best film. It should be reviewed by PG-13. But however, the first film of the Prince and the biggest. Monitoring was hit. But I haven't seen for years now here is what I can remember about it. The child (Prince) deserves to win the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), putting his band together (Revolution as they own) and tension in his family. But his rival band (Time as they themselves) is destroying his life. If Morris (himself) tries to steal Apolonia from Kid. Just like Fever Night Night, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Pay taxes, laugh and cry and if you like, buy it.
