This movie is good. The plan is very real to the book that is a tribal writing by Mark Twain. The movie begins with an area where Hank sings a song with a group of children called "when you grab your toe on the moon" It reminds me of Sinatra song High Hopes, it's fun and inspiring. Music is so great and my favorite song is hit by King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall movie great family or even a great movie date. This is the film that you can watch again and again. The child played by Rhonda Fleming is good. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Judter of the Court then you will be like this film.
