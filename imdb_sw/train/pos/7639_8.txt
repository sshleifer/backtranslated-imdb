It's not a great film. Acting is not surprising (some small publishers are also badly played), the film is not good in any sense. There is nothing innovative or new. If you like a great film, this is not for you. still has a great-true BIG plus story. Larry's story works, because we know this story from our lives. The girl did not ask the date, the test failed, the friend we allow, all in our history. This movie works, because it touches it, It's a good story because it's small. It is the life we ​​have, and the sadness we all have, and yet the message affects: every life we ​​live would have problems. The first time I looked at it, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a ceremony in my school. 16 years later, I continue to meditate every time, and every time I see it, it makes a smile on my face. See. It will do you good. You will be more happy with what you have.
