The quality of production, cast, cluster, actual New England (Waterbury, CT?) The location and surprising of John Williams logo should have the result of the products of 3–4 star collectors. Unfortunately, all we found was a 2-star “polite” star, which does not remember what he tried to do ......... to bring a gallery of art gallery. The city's small town and the story of ordinary people are of itself, and if well done, it will satisfy many people. Jane Fonda could not hide her brain enough to make her character reliable. I wondered why he was not making a postal doctor at Yale instead of working at the factory's final job at Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was just a little bit emerged. A person who is illiterate, good young man who turns out to be true, with little help from Jane's character, the 1990 edition of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. This type has been taken more effectively by "Foo Man" in the mid 90s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt." stored several screens on various TV shows for these efforts. <br /> <br /> I will give "A" to the effort.
