This is a great show, and it will make you cry, this group of people really love each other in real life and shows it often. Email and let's talk about it. I've been in Australia and they really talk like this. I want you to enjoy the Five Mile Creek and adopt these beautiful and bad stories, and friendship with your children. I have all 40 DVD-R programs I have collected over the last 5 years. Check out my Five Mile Creek tax at www.mikeandvicki.com and hear the extended music sounds. Let's talk about them. These people are very cool!
