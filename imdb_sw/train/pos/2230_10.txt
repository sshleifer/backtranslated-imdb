I have been looking for the name of this film for years. I was 14 years old when I believed it was revealed on TV in 1983. All I can remember was about a young girl, alone, having survived a plane crash and living in Amazon. I remember people were looking for him (family) and that he knew how to care for himself - he tells stories and I remember clearly about him knowing that bugs were under his skin. I don't remember much about this film, and you want to see it again - if this is the same - and if any of you has a copy, do you? Would you please email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would like to be interested in getting a copy to see if it is really a film I remember. It was revealed on Thanksgiving (United States) in 1983, and I was having problems with myself and this film greatly affected. Thank you in advance!
