This is a good movie and thrown by stellar and some good acting. I have never been tired. I especially love the area where the character of Danny Glover and the character of Kevin Kline is Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline is a natural and looks characteristic and one would meet many times. SO is his real movie. One of the most powerful events in the movie, however, is the beginning of the film when Simon arrives where the Mack car is broken. The movie also has a strong message and is different from an unresponsive message with a movie where there is one who preaches to his audience. Instead, the feelings and conditions of administrators provide inappropriate messages that do well without using words. And finally, Mary McDonell is as brilliant as always.
