Life Is Coming is a good original pre-code that looks at some of the best of that era. It is placed in the hospital reproductive ward, especially in the women's waiting room. In it is an old woman, a tough mother (Glenda Farrell), a young woman, a Italian woman, and a great character (Loretta Young) who uses 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital when she wails for the second time to know that everything will be all right. Aline MacMahone has a nurse who is good at her job. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and entertaining. It's not too scary in any way, but it's amazing to see such a distorted lesson on the financial screen. Acting is brilliant around. Loretta Young is gorgeous here at its head. Eric Linden comes out and is as real as he can. His right is to remind Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is as good as ever, the main number of pre-and for good reasons.
