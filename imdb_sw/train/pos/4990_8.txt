If other reviewers have identified, this is a non-copyrighted film during the movie. Directed by Frank Borzage (Oscars two) and written by Jo Swerling (Departure from Heaven, Western District, Lifeboat, etc.), is a hard, well-planned and modified argument on residents of New York City. They are worried, applicants, and women are forced to commit adultery, but it is a community of all good and bad people, as well as as hard as trustworthy as any group. Perhaps the most important of the many features of these exciting films is the difference between the behavior of Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Loretta Young Trina. He is tough-talking, physically strong, and obviously without fear - but Bill is not a character who gives this film the meaning of life. While clapping, Trina really depends on the hardness (if the word can be used for such a woman's behavior). His commitment to him is obvious, and finishing. When she is pregnant, she says she will stop herself if she wants to leave, or "I will leave the child if you just enjoy it." That is the honor of Loretta Young (at the age of 20) as a very simple character, that she seems to be weak or dependent, but instead of a woman who knows the happiness when she gets it, and she doesn't want it anymore.
