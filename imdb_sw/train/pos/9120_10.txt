This movie speaks the language of the whole world; one can associate it with the soul, society, society or world wide. It has no way to open a few questions but also put one in the track and ask the right questions to achieve this self-confidence / ownership. The display of discrimination in the film speaks of the archetypes around us which must be identified as being repeating the cycle of destruction, the power to resist the innovation, innovation and growth. Reasons that break the flow of natural things should be made clear and considered. The idea, it is definitely a film to have the skills and not just viewed if it blows into the inner voice / conscience through checking, makes the person feel the opposite to just looking.
