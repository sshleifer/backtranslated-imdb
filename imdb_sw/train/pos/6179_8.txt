As its informal demolition, the killing of Windmill (1949), the assassination plot is only an excuse for a detailed show of the girlie and Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael led the girl's most attractive girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace , Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also ready to lend it to "Cocktails for two". Of course the most popular film, you hear no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who stole the show, not only for his "Sweet Marijauna" beauty but his powerful performance as a rejected girlfriend. For all the others, we were able to do without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is its weak drama and icon of worship, Toby Wing. In fact, in order to give you an idea of ​​how far the comedy has been overthrown and further interrupted, the Auditor General McLaglen can not lay his hands on the killer though, you would believe, at this time it happens that the person you are accusing. Director Mitch Leisen actually goes to great pain in order to tell the killer out even a dumbest member of the movie audience by giving the player almost close-up after close.
