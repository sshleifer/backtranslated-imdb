I've found this late afternoon show, and tried it. It is an enjoyable change from other types of things shown at the end of the night, if you catch my drift. His moral humility and the sweetness of the heart reminds me of how friendly the children were. It's something I get when I get (which is a few, maybe I must look at the list! Haha) ..... and tension between Joe and Nick is very good. As little good, you get emotionally in the characters. Good Ol 'Louisa May Alcott still urges the good news :) So I must fill 10 verses of Scripture so that my opinion is correct, so I think I'll tell you more. Children are played by talented actors and actors, and the settings are good and full of nature - something else you see on television. I hope everyone gives a shot. I know and know that it's sappy, but it's a good heart. As I said earlier, it is comforting.
