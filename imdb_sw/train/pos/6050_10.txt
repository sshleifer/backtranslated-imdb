Finally! The good comedy of UK is not close to the bank robbers of mockney or reduced from the TV series. John Ivay's film is a psychological story of discovery, wearing a gear biker. The three characters are sympathetic to the failure of each other in a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive trio, emotionally small squares of the comedy comedy together. The amigos of three amigos are appropriate and makes collaborative cooperation with the negotiations of a hilarious and certain comedic time. It feels part of Withnail and I, part of the United States Werewolf in London, and part of Quadraphenia (but only because of cycling groups, and Phil Daniels). In fact, the delightful rogue of Phil Daniels reminds Danny's seller with Withnail and me, and his professional approach to scientific commitment to drugs. This is a good film, especially for those who have emerged in psychological things in the past, who will be associated with a lot of time in the film. Personal love is a brilliant place in the Welsh club shop, the purchase of munchies when you enter the 'shrooms'. This gentle comedy will reduce the heart of your heart and laugh loudly. And you don't have to ride a bike or even if they enjoy it. But it will increase them if you do. Brilliant.
