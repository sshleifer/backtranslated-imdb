Good movies, especially if you like horses, WWII movies and the Hungarian Plateau plane. The story of courage, mercy and faithfulness crosses generations. The amazing park is amazing with the horses of the main characters in its training. I will buy this film and watch it again. This is a family film and I recommend it very much. Some of the 'Family Nite' 'movie. Although there are some incidents of violence, it was Nazi work in Hungary. Indigenous people were very attractive in the way they stood even during a certain death from a Nazi officer who had his own reasons for hunting Brady. A highly hauntingly film.
