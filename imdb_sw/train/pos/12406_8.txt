The long prison, locked for more than 20 years, is reopened by Ethan Sharpe (late, good actress of Lane Smith), once a guard there, has been appointed as an administrator. Since prisoners are being put to work to repair the area, they are directed to the old room of action. This brings a strong spirit that destroys anger against all the guards and prisoners; Cold-like-can-be a prisoner of the bottom of Burke (Viggo Mortensen, showing the real poise in the first role) emerges in the role of the hero. I know it's not a brainer of the film's filming (was shot in a real crime left near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this awesome film to the highest level. It has a great sense of widespread spread, firmly certainly at the beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his four leadership efforts here; found the "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" leading gig and effectively started an amazing job in routine action movies, exciting games, and fears. It can have stake holders, but it has the ability to raise them up: Chelsea Field as a young woman joining prison prison, Lincoln Kilpatrick as defendant Cresus defendant, Tom Everett with Rabbitt's quiet, Ivan Kane as Lasagna, Tommy Tiny "who was speaking like Tiny big, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It is also important to consider whether the original loan of Kane Hodder (as a spirit of revenge) that helped him to create a gig of playing Jason Voorhees in the "Friday 13th" series. Special effects of respect, the illuminated movie of the movie Mac Ahlberg, the spooky music and Richard Band and Christopher Stone, the best performances, the most amazing scene, and the general presentation and the edge help make it completely. It's bad, angry, and good fun for a fan of fear. <br /> <br /> 8/10
