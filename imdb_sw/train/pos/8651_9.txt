Kalifornia came in 1993, as 3 of the 4 leading players were up and coming to their level of popularity now in 2006. This is a good psychological-thriller that should appeal to all Duchovny fans because of its dry and intelligent stories that they get Their way in its work, as with its many episodes of X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe Diaries. People who were evacuated to south south of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis's characters have certainly never spent much time in the south. For each "Brian and Carrie" south, there is "Adele and Early" and in 2006, that's a real fear of this flick. Besides, I think the film is written with the intention of a film of worship - such as photography by Carrie, unfit for great use. But if you have a copy of this on your personal library, I think it says something positive about your taste for private movies.
