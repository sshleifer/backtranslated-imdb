*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is of course the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with a wonderful film script is enhanced with good performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) are only married if bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent to the fight against the war and now Maria and her mother and sister should be infected and live. Maria decides to work as a player in the club that attends the GI of America and meets a black soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they begin to meet on the basis. Maria hears that her husband, Hermann, is dead in the war so she gets too much with Bill. But one day at the close of Bill they see Hermann at the door. She has not died and when she enters the room it happens and Maria breaks the bottle on Bill's head and dies. Hermann takes the blame and is sentenced to a long time in jail so Maria tells him he will succeed in something and throw him out. The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on the train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman and uses his trick to get a job. Maria has decided to do well and climb the corporate ladder and become Karl's wife. She tells him she can't marry him but he loves her. Hermann comes out of jail but he goes to Canada to try and get on everything Maria has done since he was arrested. One day Karl is dying and leaving Mary almost everything in her will and Mary buys her home. Then Hermann returns home to his wife and both are ready to get married even though they have been married for some time now. But Mary comes out of the gas on the stove and the house evaporates and both are still in it. There are many interesting features in this film which is one of those movies that can learn and speak for a long length. As in all films of Fassbinder color use is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins tones are the color of the color of red and white color. The construction of Germany with all the construction sounds is used as an increase only and the film stays on Maria's goals. Fassbinder wanted a voice to rebuild and remind us of what happened in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla was not the best and its performance is the key to the success of this film. With this little actress it would be another interesting film but Schygulla is so powerful that its performance raises this film in an elite mode. Schygulla shows Maria as the most intelligent and intelligent but at the same time uses her beauty and feminine to get what she wants. He is not shy or ignorant about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who gives her life easily. Schygulla was not selected for the Academy Academy award but gave good performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a walker with his own mother Lilo Pempeit has Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of the film and relates to whether Maria deliberately came out of gas. Later in the bathroom he runs water on his hand and seems to be sad. This is just rumors and if you think I am wrong please e-mail me. I think he was very happy with Hermann at home and stopped by accident (Remember he put on clothes for any reason?). Then the love is told at that time that she learns that Hermann and Karl have been friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she did was free. That's the reason the bathroom area. So when the house breaks up with an accident. But I think the reason for Fassbinder to end such is to show that anyone who could sell their soul do not live for business. Fassbinder was attracted to the victims but was also very enthusiastic. In her opinion Maria can not have both ways. Interesting film.
