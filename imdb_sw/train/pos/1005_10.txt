The Verhoeven Movie was completed and completed the trash. She is hack of the hatred of the director and should be ashamed. By his own entry, he read chapter 2 of the book, he got tired, and decided to do anything about the beginning. Heinlein did not want to support the trash if he was alive to see it. It actually steals the name, laughs the politics of the book (which is a good part of it), and gives us in T&A so the average idiot of American moviegoer is not available. <br /> <br /> This animation is perfect, but it is at least more accurate, as best I can tell.
