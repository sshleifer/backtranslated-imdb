I entered the Way to Expecting a sad game / fun and good direction and good acting. These have I found. I was not expecting it was an example of an experiment of human existence. Remove Lynch to take a simple story about a trip of 300 miles on lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for humanity. If you haven't seen, look again, check out the age of Alvin meets, the area he runs, the way people give, the type of conversation he has (the first one is about pregnancy and children, the last one is out of cemetery). The last way he leads is very interesting in this context, since it is thin and afraid of the mountain. The failure of the final installations can be seen as death, and the regeneration of the miracles of his life-related engine after life, which he fulfills the desired reconciliation. I just hope some people who have expressed this as a slow slow melidrama takes time to watch more carefully.
