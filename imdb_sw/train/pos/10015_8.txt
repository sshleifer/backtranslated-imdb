A friend of the famous radio news Gabriel No (Robin Williams, surprised and speaking in a romantic voice) becomes friends with a friend of a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book describing sexual abuse. from his parents. For boot, Pete has AIDS and this is still frustrating Gabriel yet, because her boyfriend Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to be an HIV advocate herself. He also deals with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) And when Gabriel decides she wants to meet and talk to both of them individually and go to Wisconsin, she finds some secrets that she was (not usually) prepared to get. <br /> <br /> According to the actual events that happened in Armistead Maupin (who wrote scriptplay with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film goes faster (90 min., perhaps a few minutes longer) than one can imagine the film this type would be run. That's good for it takes action and lean and clear stories. It is bad because it leaves different holes in the plot and does not cover any of the stories or stories behind. I would not like to enter any good information unless you say that, if you do not know the work of Mr. Maupin or his personal story, you feel a little in the loop here. Still, the Williams show (I'd like to hear more of his notes, personal), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and a lot of cures (Waitress at Collete's restaurant Donna frequents does a good job with what small part she has!) Is over-notch A strong mood here - that is, chilly, out of black exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - provide a strong forming for this story. It may have an end that doesn't really fit, but it's still a compelling story to cling to.
