Hayao Miyazaki does not have the same when it comes to using hand animation as a story form, but is often compared to Walt Disney. That's just the same, because it becomes obvious to look at the Miyazaki movies that he is a great artist. In fact he has an exciting young gift with all the children, and Laputa is really a single trip to the amazing. But where can I begin to describe this magical and interesting film! The work of Miyazaki has never finished me. Laputa is an adventure of a large scale and I wonder how the film can be so full of details and ideas. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who is going to adventure so great in scope and so magical, what will it be? The answer will be locking yourself on a certain chair and looking at Laputa, because it is really fantasy of childhood flats. Every minute of the movie is rich and includes ... from the train to run up to the amazing air-flying series ... and amazingly in front of the castle surrounding itself. Not to mention the best score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you may want from a movie film is here.
