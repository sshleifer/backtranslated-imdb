This film can be seen today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was crossing over the Hippie Dippie mountain with great humorous satiric. This film is a great grandfather of all. Enjoy with its historical importance, with its powerful entertainment value.
