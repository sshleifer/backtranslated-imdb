We often talk about movies - Kane, Godfather, Bout de Souffle. One film however is often ignored by critics "bad" film. I am talking about the Doc Savage of the ethnic group (M.o.B.). Don't mention kung-fu. It was also the most loud voice in the history of the film (until the course of the King's breathing work at Flash Gordon). Although it is a bit, this program is very suited to search - it will pay your search ten times.
