Just looking after my mother to restore from America for me, she was afraid to look at this after all negative comments here but I say, yes to act it cheesy, some effects are laughable. But you should remember this meant that the 1898 was not 2005, and for that small budget I thought it was quite good. I enjoyed this version more and then the Spielberg version I saw last week. I have read the book many times, and I found myself "ahh yes it is in the book" almost all the time, and another version is hardly any of the book available. It has done well for at least trying to try a true version.
