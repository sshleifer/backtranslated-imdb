When a small hobbit called Frodo Baggins inherited a magic ring from his uncle, the witch Gandalf examined and found out that the ring is the creation of an evil master master. What? The ring should go back to his hands, he will return his power and destroy the Middle World. Frodo and his faithful friends put forth an effort to destroy the ring and the band of fighters. This is a frame under the classic novels as it covers the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and amazing film animation. <br /> <br /> Animation has been made through rotoscope, which monitors the image of life operations. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget given. The film also has great music and Leonard Rosenman suitable for every area. There are a few holes of the subject and the script, but that should be released, based on the original contract was to make the trilogy of the book in two films, much comparable in first. My great gripe is some design of character, Samwise was very little, while other hobbits act quite naturally. Other characters are actually well written for screens, and voice actors are doing a good job, I am glad that Legolas is actually more helpful to the plot. The rotoscoped orcs are more interesting than fear, while tips are available at night. Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman, because of the authors. In general, I think a little more money and better authors would do this a lot of justice, but there's something interesting about it. Ralph Bakshi made great efforts to make the effectiveness of the screens of these common stories. The film is very serious due to the closure of the live films, but it is still a good movie for animation lovers of all ages.
