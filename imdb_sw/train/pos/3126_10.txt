I have not removed ten star ratings easily. Modernly it will benefit me, and Bondne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Additionally, this trilogy has gathered very well, I believe it is one of the biggest events of our time. Although all three films were not very different from Ludlum novels, they still stand as a strong symbol in the success of movies. The Ultimatum of Bourne has made me want to cry that the series was completed, but I couldn't even try to stop an exciting hour. From the moment the head of the opening occurred, I realized we were on a trip. Paul Greengrass has done again. Everything we like from Bourne's original films is here again: action, conversation, and of course the shaky camera. However for me, the end was not a problem. I think it adds to doubts. <br /> <br /> I'll see this film several times before being released on the DVD, just because it's mental. It is a very satisfactory conclusion, and must stand the test of time as a wonderful movie, and quite, trilogy not surprising.
