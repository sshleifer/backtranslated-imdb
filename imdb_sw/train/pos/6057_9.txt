Indeed, since it is a beautiful and amazing picture, it is a great exhibition of the home "show off" disk, but this is also a drama affected by the knowledge document. Parallel stories that are connected to this film will cause all viewers concerned. Young people, adults, boys and girls will see the bottom, we are fans of cars, especially high-performance machines that are the result of blood generation, sweat, tears, courage and patience. The voice of Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder is perfectly compatible with pictures and content. I don't want to stop at last, but the last sequence of driving "Day as These" can bring tears to your eye. Enjoy!
