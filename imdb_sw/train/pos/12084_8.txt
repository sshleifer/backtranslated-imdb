The little player whose 65 minutes is not suitable for the second short, my name is Julia Ross connecting to the traditional English of things that are not seen - Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is one example. Outside of work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) gets a dream job in another employment agency in London, whose sinner's representative seems to be very worried to know if she has a living family or partner. After reporting a duty, he wakes (after being beaten) in a large bunch of Manderley on the Cornish coast, which appears to be a barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of George Macready, who shows a horrible interest in knives and ice targets. Voting for her, enabling the mum is Dame May Whitty in the absence of this time (this is an example of good effectiveness on the other side of good-vs-evil than she used in Lady Vanishes). The vision of the pain of this story begins claustrophobically; we know what's going on but they can't afford to tell Julia the poor. This film, sadly, is given a regular position as one of the first film people (and very few UK). I think it is close to the ancient traditions of Gothic-house darker than one of America's cobblestones rain and cities corruption; it makes, however, evince modern modern, psychological intelligence. Whatever you call, it continues to be a great satisfactory attraction.
