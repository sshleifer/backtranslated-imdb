Even if you don't know about Ireland, you should love "My Left leg" (and especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in it). She has a brain-brain disorder caused by Christy Brown. From this, he has spent most of his life canceled. Even when he tries to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the dark for him is that he has authority over one part of the body: his left foot. He uses the color to write poems, and make him popular. Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this partnership, and also cooperating later: "In the Name of the Father" (but "Boxer" was not needed). "My Left leg" can make you a lot of ways: sadness, hope, or anything else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave life performance here. Great movie for every meaning.
