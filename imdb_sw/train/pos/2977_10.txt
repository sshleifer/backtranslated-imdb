There are many words that I want to use to describe this film, but I can't do that which I can? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I am bad. Do not look at this film if you are faced with injustice, sex, witchcraft, homosexualityâ€¦ and everything else related to nature. Be a woman, and that may be even the reason, I can watch this film regularly. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are quite brilliant. With all their demands, I think Baseketball is a winner of the prize. I laugh now just to think about some stupid things they do in the movie. See the movie! That's all I will say. It is difficult for me to leave these comments because I am one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a word of curses next to each line that appears in their mouth when they talk. So I put a specialist. The best modern. Heck yeah!
