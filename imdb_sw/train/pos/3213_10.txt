What a perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines, and something like 104. What is the problem! As the black and white picture, when your mental eye fills the column, the face of the face, physical exercises, emotional signals, all combine to affect power. This is one of the top 5 movies that I can't live without, above and teachers like Warrior Road. If you liked this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" all star Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" by Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in the Soldier too. "Thirteen Warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" Star Harrison Ford.
