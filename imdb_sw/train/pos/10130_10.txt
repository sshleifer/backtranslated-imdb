The quiz is very good. It sets how the collateral of characters in future sessions. I don't think anyone can create the best attempt for this show. It shows amazing creativity on the part of authors. Although not everything was directed because it was the first part, most of the events taking place in the coming season were shown in the trial. Example will be the future relationship of Ross and Rachel. Even though the fear of the first part occurred, it was unsuccessful with an amazing plot and the best choice of cast. <br /> <br /> Bravo. The best start for the incomplete comedy!
