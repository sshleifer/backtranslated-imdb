The wise, courageous, courageous, quick, attractive, evil, courageous, heart and female heart, Footlight Parade is the first entertainment, what all movies are about. <br /> <br /> True, satirical treatment provides a new edge of the material and its speed and delivery of the line is to breathe. Thinking that they just started making pictures talking about 7 years before this! The beauty of the dialogue cannot go anywhere today, especially considering that "authenticity" has taken and incorporated modern movies. This film was made at a time when the content of the Hayes content was ignored and the result was clean, self-referential, useful and live cinema that spoke directly to modern audiences suffering from depression and angst The total age. I would like to suggest watching any film from this period, which is 1930-1935, for a vision of what a popular film might be.
