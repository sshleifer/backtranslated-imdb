The country must see it for children and adults. My son was very happy to see all these wonderful birds and ice-bearing. We can learn a lot from this film and we should be proud of our great treasure in the world. There are other animals at risk of extinction. Especially the problem should restrict all the power of our planet. <br /> <br /> This document presents many unique images that I have never seen before. Then include heavenly music. The director did a good job here that gets great respect. Nothing can stop me and my family providing a high level of EAR. I hope that things will create good.
