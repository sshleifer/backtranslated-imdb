Best of Sorro serials and one of my favorite intervals, period. This is the ceremony that was set up after the birth of Mexico. The new nation is counting gold produced by this one city to keep the republic. However, the god of gold, Don del Oro stimulates the Indians to steal the gold himself. Zorro her with her band of rescue men. Reed Hadley is Zorro won and takes a gold beat figure as he gets a good selection of pieces (more than all that was used by Zorro's future papers as well as other papers). The story goes and is not quite clear who is the worst person. There's a reason why I found this over any serial I found, it's just a great film of film adventure. The only thing I can compare with is the symbol of Zorro and Tyrone Power or one of the other swashbuckers of the period. Its high and highly recommended.
