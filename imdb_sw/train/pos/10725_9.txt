Camp Space is a very good film. The plan is predictable, but executives do good work, and special effects are of respect for time. This film was opened early at the time of the tragedy, and actually trampled on how popular it was. Where the shutter doors have opened on space are interesting ... on the big screen, that's ... on TV ... it looks just average. I remember this place in the theater. It made you as if you were above. <br /> <br /> This may be a good film to see on IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
