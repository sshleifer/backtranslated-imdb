OH WOW. I saw this film in the Philippine Manifesto of Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars attended and were found for later questions. WHAT FILM OF GORGEOUS! Although put in Ireland between the Catholic / Protestant opposition, the story may have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate one another. The fear of how people can get quick when they get an opportunity to speak out their hatred and anger is well covered with the story of moving love full of humor and happiness. If this was not taken in the United States, it would actually be unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for stars and players to help ... FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady Meril Streep of Ireland, I heard. It's my opinion that it is better than Meryl Streep. They should be calling Meryl's Orla Brady of America! And, the example of the strong and powerful Liam Cunningham man of the swift and solitary war in the political battle was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Check out this MOVIE.
