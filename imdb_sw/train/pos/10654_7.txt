Haunting is a film that includes an attractive house, a good work effect and a good job, cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and the house. There are cases that make flying, and features of sin that have continued on the Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There is enough time for the film and I like how the ghosts emerged in the paper, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's blows gave the right space and sounding sounds with the surroundings. I liked to happen to something more. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to compete with it and I think that he was standing very little. Poltergeist was very scared when I saw many years ago, and still continues. Haunting could be used more scenes of pure terrorism. The end was to me, a little anticlimatic. In general, I enjoyed it. Acting is good and there is a time to jump. I just want to be scared.
