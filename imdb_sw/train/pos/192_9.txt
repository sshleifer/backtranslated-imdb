Before seeing the People Show, my feeling of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and just slapstick. I couldn't imagine how comedy screens could be possible without having to rely heavily on the spoken word or multiple pratfalls. But this beauty film has proved me. Davies, from my point of view, was probably a great comedic actress coming along before Lucille Ball. I say Lucy especially because the Davies and his face face reminds me of the fact that I'm wondering if Davies was not one of the great gravity of the ball. This comes from a 21-year-old who has never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how much of the specific time you get (I don't deserve, apparently), you can't be influenced by this movie. You will probably not laugh more than you would like on many of the talkie comedies. This is not just my favorite comedy, but easily among my favorite comedies of all time.
