Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate should deal with their two young daughters and a female man ... But after a short passing to John Ritter, the show became more on dealing with losing a loved one ... <br /> < br>> I have seen this show, passing through these days one day and I think I was surprised until my cracks had broken, just for different types of characters; The lines of magic and the state Paul would find himself dealing with his daughters ... From then on, I stood on the show when I was free and I must say the text was very good ... But then I read about John Ritter's Death ... Shortly afterwards I watched 'Good' part 2 and tell me I was close to tears, watching the feelings of the characters, losing a loved oneâ€¦ How Rory strikes the wall with anger and frustration. ..Cate deals with sleeping on his bed alone .... Briget and Kerry are talking about what they should do. But the show continues, bringing Jim Egan and CJ Barnes who laughs so much, as Cate's father tries to protect his family and give 'a conversation' to Rory ... But the real gem is CJ. who is quite hilarious like wild cousin. <br /> <br> You will be the jewel of John Ritter always.
