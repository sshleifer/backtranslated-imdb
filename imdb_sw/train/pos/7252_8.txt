I saw this film before joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, the first time it was difficult and then I went on a lot. My time was found during the crisis of NI and the cold war. There was a time when I wondered about what I got inside, not for long, if the exercises would take every day and you would like to respond regularly. The voice used to show what soldiers think is the top spot, though I could add a breathing rate and such a heart as it appears to enter your ear drums in given conditions. A few years later I was in Canada for the family to be together. My Anunty who lives in the United States and is a teacher in Columbus Ohio Ohio has made a paper on the impact of the British Army at NI. He spent time out there doing research. Although an old man was a very young Englishman. He made me a bee line and he judged me for being a British soldier. My only answer was that the film 'Long Day dies'. It is closer to a citizen who will discover why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
