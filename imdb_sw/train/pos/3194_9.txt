There has never been such a thing, certainly. This periodic, seemingly ordinary trilogy is actually taken in a general sense, and therefore not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, Utah crossing dressing sensation. It is a very independent film about how a filmmaker joins Groovin 'Gary. For Harris the whole project is clearly extended and interesting to fight guilt and repentance. He tries to erase his sins - yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after the first doc was revealed - through the revision, definition, and compilation, to restore standbys as well as the author of the story as the best friend and the end of the fun (the last two, and the revision to describe in version the Glover) and converting to its own use. Therefore, while the ticket is still a movie about gender and differences, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about MOVIES - but at a very controversial level. There is only a very persistent; by telling them and telling them this story Harris is a good place in a good time three times in a row, and no chance of doing something. Moving significantly, and as a great camp as it got.
