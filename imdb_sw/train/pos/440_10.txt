My movie of all favorite time. Work on Oscar-caliber with everyone involved, both in front and behind the camera. Screenplay is perfect, and makes a connection between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike novel. The handling of the other leading actors has been awarding taxes to the screen writer Peter Barnes, and the bright beauty of visuals should have won Oscars for the Mike Newell director and movie movies Rex Maidment. It is the best work of Josie Lawrence for far away, and changing my opinion of Joan Plowright. After watching this film at least 50 times, I can't find an error in it. Music, and famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is wonderful.
