An important and financial commentary for the first release, critics have turned to saying that this film is the best of the Director. A La Ronde as a quick film feel like boys from the detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) emerge, fall and out of love with some of the most beautiful and beautiful women seen on the film (Audrey Hepburn, Campen Colleen, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the documents were covered or rewritten on the shooting day that gives the film a feel. Ben Gazzara is better as a head investigator persuades Audrey Hepburn after leaving singer Colleen Camp and seeing the cab Patti Hansen side. John Ritter follows clearly Dorothy Stratten and immediately likes her. Blaine Novak has a few girls chasing them (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This film has very good performances and cast. Rates are Audrey Hepburn (they have no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara has never been much better (with a motivating choice for romance) and Colleen Camp has one of its best roles as a manic singer Christy Miller. She is happy to look like she flies off her lines in the mouse-tat-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* star!
