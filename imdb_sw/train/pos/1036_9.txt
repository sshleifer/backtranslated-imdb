Look at Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi films made during World War II. Paul Lukas was convinced of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines carefully as a good actor and beauty she was. I would like to recommend this film to those who have a desire for that time, and, of course, the wonderful movies of late, beautiful, Mrs Bette Davis.
