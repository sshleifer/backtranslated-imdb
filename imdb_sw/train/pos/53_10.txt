The room is too wonderful for me. In comparison to other movies written about Columbine Secondary School is the best. The home room does not show a school shot but rather the impact and impact of the community and the city. Take a look at the movie "for the two opposite characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). At the same time the police are investigating Alecia if he knew that a shot would be made. Alecia and Deanna are very different and they are not first available. home The beauty reflects the strength of proximity and trouble after school shooting. I would like to recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
