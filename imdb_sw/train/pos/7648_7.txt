I agree to have a weakness with the history of the history of history, from its LIFE EXPERIENCE for DAY GROUNDHOG to 12: 1. Among those greats are this small gem. It's hard to get through MR. DESTINY would not give thanks to every member who was beaten, from James Belushi's hearty courtney to Courtney Cox. This film does not have gravitas and make it a good film, but it's good fun on daylight. It is also a major tax for a low-cost date.
