This is one of the best of the series, putting the title above with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (Or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good story that you play like Claire Redfield in search of her brother, Chris Redfield (which you might know from a wife It is as scary as a bad woman, and it has many more tablets. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out of ***** Stars (Measurement based on comparison with other video videos)
