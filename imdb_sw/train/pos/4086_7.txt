Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I think I will start with a plot. The woman who was married (Lucy) came to her home will be a husband (Mathurin) in France, where they await the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone of the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy love.) While Waiting, little Lucy learns about the story of the Beast that surrounds her. centuries before. In the bed that night, she begins fantasizing about the Beast and her attempt to sex-turned-upens with an old housewife. That's what attracts them! The program is very thin (and it seems to pull you long in the middle of the flick), but the film's salary (?) Those who make it with a terrible and awesome finale. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for big movies, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a remote film about meat disease (which is about to see a sympathetic attitude on the subject) this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid. In addition to the horse-on-horse at the beginning, 'works' is a beautiful picture, IMO)
