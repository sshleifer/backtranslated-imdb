I enjoyed watching this film. It has a great trend, and you already know Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it's the same in Spain that the movie takes place, in Catalu√±a, to be more accurate. Luna explores once again the theme of the compilation, in this case a little adherence to a young woman for milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story as the hard of rejection which the older son feels and the birth of his brother. In this film it leads to a collection of a little boy who suddenly sees his mother's milk to a newborn baby. So he begins to try to get a chest who can feed him. He gets it in a woman who came recently and from here on the film is almost everywhere. This game is very lively in the picture, more than the story itself, the viewer gets some time (non-memorable time) and a certain color (movie needs to be analyzed for everything that happens because it usually means something ... ). The landscape, landscape, model from the region and surreal behavior of the characters, are also typical, and the voice of the voices of Nicola Piovani's voice takes us to another direction, not the same as the real world, but opens up at times often ... Value of living in the world, we should watch this film, even though we can finally and only when we are tired and very ill with a heavy burden, which is perhaps taken over limits ... <br /> <br>> I also enjoyed the performance of the main character ... 8/10
