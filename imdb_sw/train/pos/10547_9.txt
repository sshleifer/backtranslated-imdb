I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the film, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the film could be surprised and perhaps trembled. It made a lot of the fact that the film was "by the director of the Cube" and made it look like a terrible film, when in fact it is the Absurdist comedy (viewer spell IMDB does not seem to think that Absurdist is a word, but it is), reminding Rosencrantz and Guildernstern dead. I love how the story is slow for the first time, then gradually increases. I also enjoy the fact that there is no explanation given to what is happening in the film. That is the fact that the story looks particularly in one set only the respect which this film is similar to the cube. I recommend.
