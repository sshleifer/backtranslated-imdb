This movie is very good. The program, which works as a viewer of the puzzle effort to think and think, what will happen later. This deception brings a wonderful surprise and makes the viewer looking for a riddle solution. Photography is very good. There are many styles of fighting (although one of the styles was not true for me, but it's just my opinion) to look and it's an awesome show. The only thing that can convince them is the watch. A little bit too (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70 and 80 years, so "Five Stations" (or otherwise) is a great option.
