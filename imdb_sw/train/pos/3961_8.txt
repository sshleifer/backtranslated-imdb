This is a magnus opus from the Swedish king of crap, Mats-Helge Olsson. Frequently has a film of this size made in Sweden and it really looks like one of the most amazing achievements in Sweden's film so far. Who is swearing for these things? Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to have a defect in Sweden. But his plans have been destroyed by the Russian army that arrested him and told him that he had arrived in Sweden. This fraud is their way of seeing that Markov keeps his work in nuclear physics that will exchange the energy supply to the whole planet. However, CIA finds itself to find the western Markov and send their ninja to free. The task of having Swedish practitioners speaking English is something that Mats-Helge has completed in his future career. This b-cheap film creates probably not configured for performance. But instead of this? Well action is a direct-video style. Gun machine throws huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians die. People riding around the white suit of ninja, trying to hide in the snow. What exactly comes out though the poor way of fighting fighting events is available. When they say "Ninja" in the head I expect military art, I expect to fight around. But there is probably two or three scenes of real military art in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's too bad I have no words to describe. If ninjas moved slowly their hearts would stop. And of course the whole movie is crowded in a bang that shows a budget of special effects with four food teams and McDonald's vouchers. What is the decision? Usually classic course. Never a movie has been made which is quite clear means to be used with a large amount of alcohol. It's the last movie party. Enter the video and laugh. Only one needs to realize that such movies are not being made again. This is the history of the film. The rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for permissions.
