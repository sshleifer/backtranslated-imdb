This is the best film for the builders of the female body and fans of women's steps! I think Sue Prices did a good job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. He looks very attractive with iron love against the strong Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not the most valuable film and the Sue Prices work is not the best to meet my life, the film itself was an amazing thing, the worthless gem of fans of the action of female body builders! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have missed some of the most popular sci-fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but not meaning. The fact is that A.Puyn was cast into a talented body of talent who puts all his energy and body to show us the best he can do. I was very excited about the film and watched it with the same Nemesis 3 (a very interesting sequel) and Nemesis 4 (sequel more than 3). What mercy has not yet shown on DVD :-(
