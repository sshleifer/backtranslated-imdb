This is a very great and awesome movie. There are many squares and it turns out. The story or director opens the question mark on the line of death or supposedly committed crimes by black people. This film is dominated by Arne Glimcher and the beautiful sound of James Newton Howard is the best. Sean performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this it should not be "CRUE CRES" or "HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
