The function of Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry come out well, with a small story and story approach with Govind Nihlani. Talk with Vijay Tendulkar is also great. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen another film like this. It's one whole, each piece so well suited to the plot. You can't be surprised by this film. Amrish Puri comes as husband and 'baap' of Om Puri. Om Puri is a young man who caught between his sense of duty and his lack of anti-system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives only a proper touch to the movie with its exciting and smooth voice to talk. The first meeting of Anand Velankar and Rama Shetty in Sadhashiv's place has never been surprising. Smita Patil is not recommended for the main role, but its part also does not bother with the main plot. In addition to all that Kafi Inamdar has the role of the police who has agreed to the system and its functions. Say the right things in the right places and know how to pull away from trouble. He is also the 'guru' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble. The movie not only brings attention to the problems faced by a police officer trying to do his job but also a brutal side in police protection. Om Puri takes the lust and ambitious desire to break free in this unique performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> Treat all the powerful fans of Indian movies.
