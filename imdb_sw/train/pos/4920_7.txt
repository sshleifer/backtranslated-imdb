No, it is not true, but this is a very good film, and sadly it's a forgotten gem. Black and white film suit. The way forward, the boy had a blow and authority to monitor everyone he had contacted before he died. Well-directed, and acting is good. Richard Widmark as a male player is good but has been shaded in the columns of Paul Douglas as a police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as baddies. Unfortunately Palance started playing characters similar to the second level of the gangster or the war movies.
