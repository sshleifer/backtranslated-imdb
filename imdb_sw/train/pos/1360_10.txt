This is one of the most popular films of all time. Parker Posey's character is high-top-entertainment, and the library's motif will not be lost for anyone who has ever worked on books and owns the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, this RENT. Then buy a poster and wrap it on your wall. Voice tone is also recommended. I showed this film to more friends than the library than any other - they all love them.
