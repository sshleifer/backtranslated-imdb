This seems to be one of the first Shemp cup and Stooges. (This includes the previous years of vaudeville and team). But the comedic summer time is at the best honed here. In addition to the severe scenes of slapstick, there are more than a trick, but it's as beautiful. Look at Larry when the sheep ask him to look at the camera with a snapshot. Or look at the real cause of Moe's excitement, "Oh ... mahogany with a pole!" Emil Sitka is in its amazing state. And goon can look scary, but somehow funny. He seems to be disappointed and confused by Partners like "ordinary" people in other shoes. <br /> <br /> For success, this must have a part. It will not be a desire.
