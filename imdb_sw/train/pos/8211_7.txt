Since I've never seen Dirty's original nature, I showed this movie on a fresh slate. And I must say, I was very happy. Indeed, some act of Sondre Locke has made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was 80 years. just for Dirty Harry. Or at least, the cow's cow will love 'MeatHead': P <br /> 7/7 7/10.
