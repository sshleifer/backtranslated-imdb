I loved this movie. The environment was breathing, the plot had a good mix and returns, and the characters were well. By two borders, however, "Rob Roy" scored far more than the average. First, I have never seen the "popular" film which the quality of the conversation was very high. There were many slashes and a lot of remarks to accompany the prestigious swordplay. I could give many examples, but why? Just watch the film. Second, this movie understood the unacceptable principle. For a successful game, it doesn't just need a hero, but a real musician. If you do not have one, there is no great joy in the roots for good people. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but three - Earl of Montrose, his wife, Kilairn, and Archie. They are not single-minded, either, but they are fully full. It takes a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more talk, and accents are a bit tough, but it's a piece of more cunning and subtle. (As I said, I loved this film!)
