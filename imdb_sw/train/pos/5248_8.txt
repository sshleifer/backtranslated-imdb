Okay, as many films, came from the SNL skit. But Tim Meadows does a very good job of making 3 minutes of one-dimensional behavior in the common character of the comedic movie. He comes from time to time - unloading other organs and circles of justice, Billy Dee Williams is in him though his Lando days have gone a long time, and anything is shot well. True, it is not a good art, but if you have entered the world of Wayne to seek the rulers and the winds, you have done something wrong. Why enjoy .......
