"Twelve monkeys" 's got all the things that Kito Terry Gilliam's. The best screenplay, rhythm sustainable, sometimes clever extraordinary conversation. In addition, he had a good nose about cast. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands out of the kind of character he played in his previous movies. Here, the jaded and unsatisfactory character which can be called the name of the prisoner prisoner has taken from a brave and inexperienced hero (as it was "hard die"). It doesn't matter how much he tries, he's a prisoner at the time. The movie has a very exciting end too. It has real power power. But this severe movie is also a human mind, the dangers that are feared (especially, that can lead to the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can infect). It does not matter how long it takes, "twelve monkeys" will be counted at its true value: a Catholic one made in the nineties.
