For a long time I have not seen a feature of beauty. Having a good respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any film made by 'em cannot be compared to this. The animators have created a wonderful world here. Graphics are amazing, natural environment is mind-blowing, almost everything in each chapter is fully available. Sometimes I felt under my back - I liked what I saw. The plan is completely romantic. As romantic as a plot of film that can be able to be. The characters are loved, especially Hector, blue rabbit, has, leaves, rocks and rules! Char-other is also good too. Humor is a high score. It was often seen that the creators did not invest much in this. I mean it seems like it didn't take too much in the difference from the people of Pixar & Dreamworks who are struggling every time thinking about something new. And I am so happy that the European animation products turned out to be very good. They have made a good film, touch, candy for eye and heart. Only from the beginning is the beginning and that's why it is not 10/10
