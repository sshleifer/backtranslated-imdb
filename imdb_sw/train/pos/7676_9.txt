Brilliant! My wife and I joined the moving line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the film, I can understand why there was a very long line. Holly is a story that affects the impossibility of two people. She is a little girl, she is a western round. The film has taken every bone in our body. There is no picture or anything that is difficult to look at - it is a common preference that you get into the gut. The film was shot well. Among others, we liked the area where Patrick teaches Holly to plant a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's creativity (do not believe that this is his first job job) and the performance of Ron Livingston stayed with me for several days. It is highly recommended.
