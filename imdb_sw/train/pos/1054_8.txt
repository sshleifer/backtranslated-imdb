If you want unreasonable action, hot chicks and apocalyptic rear view of Seattle, then this is a show for you! The concept of the Angel of Darkness is not something new (in fact, there is a problem on whether James Cameron stole the idea from the book), but I spend an hour to watch every Tuesday from beginning to end. Jessica Alba is a cigarette with friends of Max (Cindy, Kendra) of the original as hot. Fighting events are going well, but talks between Cindy and Max are supposed to be better (slang sound obliged and it looks like someone living in the suburbs wrote) <br> In my opinion, the Dark Angel is a great pleasure The guilt filled with everything fan of action can apply, but if you are looking for a hard blow, a winning game, walk "Wing West" or something.
