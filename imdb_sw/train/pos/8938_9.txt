The amazing film version of the best selling book and the Smash Broadway about the life of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African and American sisters who all lived more than 100 years and told their story of the history of America's history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll provide very good performances like Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also as beautiful as Amy Hill Hearth, a white journalist of New York Times who wrote about a sister launched a book, etc.. Many art events and even many of these modern days are very powerful, if not as inspiring as in the book. That is the only real draw, with the fact that certain aspects of the story have not been clearly shown, such as the mother color of the sister and why their father was so violent. But more than that, a very powerful, powerful movie.
