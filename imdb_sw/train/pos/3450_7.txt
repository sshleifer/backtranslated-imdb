Since I have never heard this film until I see the DVD renting me as a very doubtful, there have been many films in the past and well better that they can not do anything of a bad film script, and sometimes they don't seem to be cautious. If you just look there was no reason to give this film for the show, it's good. Many stories in this form can be seen repeatedly but it seems to be a large amount of realism here also which allows the speed of carrying. I was amazed at how Justin Timberlake's work is doing here also for such a great responsibility, he is not really an Oscar material yet, but he will learn with every role and shows LOT's future commitment here. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly surprised in his unexpected role and is obviously the cream of the crop in this film. Finally, just give. you will not despair, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more happy with the final result.
