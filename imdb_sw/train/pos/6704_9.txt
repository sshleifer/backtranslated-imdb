For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden from TGIF (and later, returning to the east of the school day of the school). Each section had a maniac, zany energy and fast-hot pacing which won a constant joke. Melissa Joan Hart used good talent for physical comedy, especially in her face. Two women, playing "direct men," or similar to two witches, would have a comic time with total chemistry and Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to enter into any wrong plan that was interested in it, and one could laugh and pick it up for all because it was, after all, a cat talking. Sabrina's friends interacted with social experience at school, where they also lived "bad" and "humanitarian". Perhaps the most interesting and unique feature of the show was the ability to connect the pop culture (for example, the then groups, Jerry Springer), the human nature of morality (eg the importance of friendship, Christmas spirit), and representation The actual examples of these are related to the magical world. Unfortunately, as it shows most of the time of television, the show reached its peak during the first three years, which was compatible with Sabrina attending high school. From the fourth season, moving to a university could be a dramatic decline in the overall level of the show, especially when the authors chose to set up a rival for Josh and Harvey, and combine a thin excuse for Hilda Heads and Zelda to remain on screens as key players. The last season, where Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was desperate. However, ultimately Sabrina (especially high school years) is still only entering as a mixture of hybrid and magical elements that elevate the price of breathing produced in this type every year.
