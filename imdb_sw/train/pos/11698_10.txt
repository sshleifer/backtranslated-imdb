I would like to say this time, this movie was awesome ... and yes if you're not interested in becoming a Christian, then why you are concerned about looking at it. I saw this movie after being saved and found to be very moving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left series of ... running the comparison around and really are more modern to reach people. I think in order to judge this movie in fact, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if you are wrong ... don't use our opinion to judge, see the movie yourself! ! God will bless you if you are looking for them.
