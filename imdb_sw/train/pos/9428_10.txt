One of my favorite movies so far starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living in the Chulawasse River before it turns into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unknowingly tries its answers in the worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film looks rather like a stage film, the second half carries the viewer to be a completely different story, and our men are forced to make a decision which they know will change their life forever. In the worst way. At the end of the film, everyone will have to deal with the scars of what was just the weekend on the river but got into fighting for survival. The movie (except some good beautiful gold) is well directed to the beauty shooting in a natural paradise that steals your breath. Photography is also good. See, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all the best in showing how one event can destroy in a different way four different lives tied to the same wrong.
