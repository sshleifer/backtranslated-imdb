SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are an old cartoon, with any idea, and almost every moment is a gem. When I must say that this is very poorly compared to the second seat of Tom and Jerry's usual, there is no way you can hate this cartoon. Indeed, it is understandable that this is one of the first events of Tom and Jerry, and I can say that I agree, but the fact of the matter is that all the events of Tom and Jerry are great, but some are better than others. Well, this could get into "others". Here is a plot of Cat Fraidy. Tom listens to horrible radio announcements, and it becomes scared easily. Jerry sees how he is scared, and tries to fear him even more than he is already. He creates a terrible trouble for Tom, and Tom is afraid of his success, and his life. Jerry then puts the paper on the vacuum cleaner and control it, thus making it look like a vacuum is a spirit. Tom sees that Jerry did all this, and dismiss him. Tom then hurt the maid's maiden accident. However, at the end of Jerry ends the person who is afraid after seeing his reflection in the cup of flour. In general, this is far from Tom and Jerry better out there, but this is still fun and entertaining piece of time. It makes me like to have more cartoons like this. The art and gags in this which makes Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but it seemed like something lost in this. It felt much slower than the short of Tom and Jerry. However, this is only a short time that does not last until Tom and Jerry's other cartoons, but still good. <br /> <br /> 7/10
