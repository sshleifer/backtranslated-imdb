I had no idea of ​​the fact this film offers. I remember this situation I accepted the information presented then to the media: something confused close to quiet: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many things, I wonder if something of this caliber has been done. I thought the protagonist was Mr. Chavez but everyone who came to the image / image <br/> was important and eventually the truth of the same entelechy: people, it was good. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
