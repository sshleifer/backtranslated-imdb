This is much better than a moderate movie and still has value to see if you're a fan of silents. However, if you never become a fan of that kind, I tell you try a few other films before watching this. That's because the plot looks just very good planned and hard to believe on advertising. But, despite this, it's still a good film and focus on my interests. A woman with an unfortunate woman was involved in an unworthy person and ran away from her. The film begins five years after realizing that he is a cruel thief. Despite this, he tries to do better and not to sit on how good a life was before this jerk entered into his life. However, the tax is based on no money, so the woman is forced to work. He becomes a private seamstress for a rich woman who tries to swing a business plan. Unfortunately, a woman who were trying to connect a customer who might have a dinner party can not do so and a seamstress is paid well to be a person's date. Well, if Cinderella, she cleans very well and the person has loved her! What to do now - given that she is actually married and fella new wants to marry? Here, look at the movie itself to see how it all sorted. I was not like they had treated the husband, as it seemed to be unpredictable and clich√©d. However, once he came out, I am glad that the film also did not leave the finale of the number and remove the film and a few end. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good film to see, but certainly not great.
