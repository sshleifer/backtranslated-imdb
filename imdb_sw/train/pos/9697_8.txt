This is a hot family movie. It has a very good animal training and "acting" (if you call it like that) too (think about a dog "How Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was a bad training). Paulie's story is very well, produced and generally the characters are also defined. Not more than saying that this is a great MOVIE! My tips: story 8.5 / 10, which makes 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, movie 8/10 movies. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY FAMILY AND MONEY MATTERS!
