I thought this was a very interesting film. This story seems to be a great example of John Waters' writing: The greatest gift of Pecker is his ability to gain beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is doing well in leading, but the best performances are for his grandmother, Mink Stole (formerly hilarious cameo) and, for all, Patty Hearst. I think pensioners leave this foundation. They seem to be taking the worst figure of the Pecker's work as the gospel, while I think the film clearly says that he is the promised artist.
