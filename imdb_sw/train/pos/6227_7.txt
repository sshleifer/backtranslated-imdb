Certainly one of the youngest music of Astaire / Rogers. It is very limited and beaten. It works just a few minutes than the Swing time, for example, but it feels a long feeling. This is because of the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I love Hilliard. He is sweet, and I love at least one of his songs, "But where?" ("Get you behind me Satan", his other number, is weak left from Top Hat, thanks to thanks due to this masterpiece). Follow Fleet would really be a bad film if not for the three talented performances between Astaire and Rogers. Competition play continues to spot on any number of their number. Dance is just wonderful. "I put my eggs in one basket" offers two drums that are not yet sure. Its perfection makes it more complete. And "Let's break down music and dance" is one of the best Irving Berlin songs. So the film is worth looking at its good time.
