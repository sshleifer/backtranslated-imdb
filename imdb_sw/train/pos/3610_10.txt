Girlfight is a story about a skeptical boy named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is struggling with her mother to commit suicide and sex father. Short tempers and lots of fire providers, he is almost run out of school to fight. His brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), is trained by Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in the wallet. Diana is told by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to give the weekly payment for Tiny training. When Diana walks through the exercise, she knows what she wants to do. He wants a box. Diana asks her father for money to train but refuses because she is a girl and should do things more than 'girly'. All Diana wants it to be treated like anyone else. It doesn't look down because she is a woman. He steals money from his father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, physics pure 'effing'. Suggest anyone who needs to see a good movie and no 'monkey business'.
