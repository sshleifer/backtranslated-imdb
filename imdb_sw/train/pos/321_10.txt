I don't know how or why this film has a limited amount on IMD. This film, followed by "I'm Curious: Blue" is a good job. The only thing that will give you down in this film is if you do not like the film process, do not like psychology or you would expect ramming sex. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that you want to look to delete; is a film you want to see as any other hub, on time, attention and service. SUMMARIES, SUMMARY OF THE SECONDS ******* The main thing about this film is that it combines the whole film, inside the film, but it does so with The way that sometimes forget that the fictions are not true. <br /> <br /> The film is as many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. Political document, about the social system in Sweden at the time. Which in many ways is still important today. Interviewed by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. Stories about filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, filming ... is concerned with his star in the film and how he should never cooperate with people who should work with them. <br /> <br /> 3. Film which Vilgot does. It is about a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), who is very young and very strong in politics, makes a document (IE # #.). He is also coming to age and in his sexuality, and that freedom. The beauty and magnificent beauty of "I'm Interested in: Yellow / Blue" is how three elements are cut together. At one time you look at the interview on politics, and next you look at what the respondent is doing behind the events but it does so well that sometimes you forgot that it's a story. Something else is strong between "Yellow" and "Blue", which if you see, you should see another. "Blue" is not quite good. I will try to explain better because I can because of my knowledge, no other films have made it though it's a good way. Think about "Yellow" as a living thing, real events in 14 events. Think full. Think about "Blue" as all items AT THE 14 "Yellow" scenarios that you didn't see, that's a perfect story about yourself. It is basically the same film ... the same story, described in two different ways. It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this was useful for people who are experiencing various effects, because this film changed the way I watched the film. <br /> <br /> thanks for your time.
