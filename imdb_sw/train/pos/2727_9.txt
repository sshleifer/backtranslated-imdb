One of the best crimes of real crime committed by the Truman Capote Book has produced a kind of true crime story. Haunting Quincy Jones logo and acting acting with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, killers. Why Wilson was not going to be a great star after this film was my secret. <br /> <br /> black and white movies and editing in this film is a top frame. The re-creation of the massacre is frightening and because it leaves you with a real murder in your mind, even more horrible than if you would show the player leaving. The movie was held in the real house of the Clutter which was purchased by another person after the murder. The movie has a very feel document --- instead of events in real concrete Clutter home other scenes were movies at gas stations and shop killers actually went. Dear Nancy Clutter, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer will have a big change as a prosecutor in a temporary experimental area that is not only done in a real court room but has a number of real actors of volunteer suicide displaying themselves as a jury for film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it.
