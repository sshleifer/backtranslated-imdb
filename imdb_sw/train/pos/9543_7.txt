Japanese-punk movies have not done much for me, but for the few who I have seen, many have been at least seemingly interesting and at least the most entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINES is not different. The story of the story is about the type of parasite that takes human forces, takes control of their bodies, converts them into "necroborgs", and makes them fight the sole purpose of a fight - looks like a "game" for relaxation. for parasitic bacteria. The film is about a man who is shy and gal who falls to each other, but whose love is reduced by all who are infected with parasites, and are forced to fight. It becomes a test of human love against the control of parasites on their physical bodies ...... / MEATBALL'S MEATBALL will be compared to TETSUO (as many cyber-punk films are), and for good reason . There are obviously some environmental parallels, although the film is definitely different. There is a lot of enjoyable time, splattery in MACHINE MEATBALL, and a creature / borg FX is definitely high-point - a combination of TETSUO-meets-GWAR which both are definitions and discoveries. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINES may or may be your object. If you like hyper-kinetic cyber-punk movies and a splatter health measure - this is for you ... 7/10
