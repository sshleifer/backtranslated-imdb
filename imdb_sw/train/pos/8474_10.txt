I saw this film when I was 13 years old and I liked the dana seed which was later starred in different strokes like a Kimberly drummond. I don't think it was a trash .it didn't mean to be a sequel for either document. is the only movie of cute kids about 3 children who are going after men trying to get a boggy creek monster. men hurt and children save them with the help of a creature. Shotshaunting of Arkansas box and landscape is good. this is a good movie for kids, there is no real violent few causes but good fun for young children.
