I have seen this film 6 times right now. And every time I see it, I'm fascinated by stories and acting. It's like looking at the train problem. It is a trick in its way, but it is best to achieve its goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the middle of the story is very good dichotomy. On the one hand we have a Deputy Director, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) who works without learning from the old boys' network that creates a great leadership of New York's governance and on the other hand we have a master of Zappati squad who deliberately tries to maintain the state of the way all necessary. This situation ends at the end when Zappati commands Alselmo make it easier to commit suicide and Calhoun commanding Pappas to do the same, politically. <br /> <br /> The movie also has some great liner such as (the weakness of my soul): - You don't have a summary of a person at the same time - The only thing in this world is a history that you don't know <br /> <br> All in all, a great movie that deserves a very high level.
