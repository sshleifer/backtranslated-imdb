I must say this movie is awesome and heartwarming. Reese Witherspoon is a delightful and Jason London is not even worse! is looking sweet Dan fall in love and breaks my heart and still reduces my heart at the same time watching the Court fall in love with Maureen. however it looks sweet how it cares Dan. I must admit though I have made a kind of claim to fall in Dan at the end. it's just good to see his fall for him I didn't want to get his heart broken. but the worst disaster I have seen has happened in this film. to see him died he made me cry all day long. I just can't believe it. however any relationship of love is not shown in the movie then Maureen and Dani. they can do it in any way. I give this film 9 because I didn't want the Court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies I saw.
