Gender's Bender Limerick: <br /> <br /> Person or woman? Who knows? It turns out to be 'it's' both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in the soil <br /> <br /> Then all went to <br /> <br> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender's Bender is another great part of the Season 1. I enjoy this because the story is a kind that you are not sure exactly what will happen next. It's quite natural. Teaser is very happy and close to the eye and reflecting on the disco lights. I really need to learn that the trick of the finger that is sexually active. I really like the sky in the little village of Kindred and Mulder and Scully sneaking around midnight. It's very exciting. This is one of the most popular Season 1 sessions. I think the thing that I like about it is how they turn into strangers in the last and left circles. Many people see this as a non-partisan story of an odd alien such as "odd" or "space" but I think this can be easily seen as mythology related. Perhaps gender is like a hunter of foreign virtues and may appear to be seen as anyone. Huh? However I offer 9 out of 10.
