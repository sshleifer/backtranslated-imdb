Finally (I believe) of the film Boys did with Hal Roach, this is also the last true film that they did, before going to the 20th century, which made the talent very good. Although there is a short - business and "lung test", for example, it is a little, ah ... more (but it is important to have, just see "Dr" Jimmy Finlayson) - but generally this flick is a good summary of what The boys brought them to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L & H flicks, and he lives threatening here as defendant Nick Granger. The place where Boys should eat their own food ("It looks good, smells, and maybe it is good.") It is one of my favorite times in oeuvre. Stan & Ollie will always be good friends in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
