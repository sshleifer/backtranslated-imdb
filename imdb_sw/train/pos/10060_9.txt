Wang Bianlian is a former road player who is known as 'King of Masks' for his mastery of Sichuan change. Liang is a famous opera artist of Sichuan and admits Wang as an artist and as a man. Liang is concerned that valuable art should not die with Wang and thus bears the seed of the heir in Wang's mind. The film is about discrimination, male domination, art status, values ​​and very important temperatures. I can't recommend this film enough. The entire film is in loops. Everything is important. His long story that has been so well changed that the film's length is only 91 minutes. Total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film, the following five minutes its sad film, the next five minutes are exciting. It just keeps changing its status as its protagonist changing its face. The last place on the string is a wonderful thing. Stories and script are not available. The characters are brilliant. All characters are artists you can tell how they did. Very interesting. It was not even appointed for Oscars. The year 'English patient' received the best film Oscar and in the film 'foreign film' won. 'Kolya' was similar to the 'little English' patient said better. Watch is 9/10.
