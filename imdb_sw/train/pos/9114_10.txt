Considering the lack of art in African movies (or Black American Cinema). The view looks to look for all kinds in the community provided by hoods and traders. But the strange thing is this is not any goal or even a short story. But it is an unidentified proof of independence from these themes that are more concerned. Ghana is unique and not the most common expectations. It's almost this departure which first takes the eye, so looking at it twice is important. The movie has a quality test that emerges from the true movie art. And this is a true art that has an African voice which is very rare. The film does not have a copy to reach its message, promotes and destroys by the craft of craft fraud (not racism but the basic character), from the authors find that the film is brilliant. Carries a message that includes the development of the fastest character. It should remember this film is less than 10 minutes and manages to establish a character very quickly. Use of color and music colors should also be praised. But according to director, Owen Alik Shahadah included 500 years later, the music is expected. But thanks to the theme-point of view it seems like the idea is to leave but satire is not recommended directly to the social problem ?? brilliant things!
