As a gentle young person who makes the last half of this film, the recent production of Michael Oblowitz has grace, but it is also slow and ponderous. The end of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had a similar problem. It's hard to imagine a shark movie, but somehow it did. Just draw Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was a passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with the wonderful world under the ocean surface. But however it was only possible. The negative view of certain scenes made the production seem normal. With Dolphins and Whale, technology is all but lost. Cloud events and the closest features of the major film subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's 3D capabilities. There are very few detailed events or any kind. The closest pieces of these strange creatures appear only flat and there are often only one in the field of cameras, so there is no distinction. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow the footsteps of his father, but when you get a Shark week on the cable, his preliminary and interesting treatment of his studies is a constant desire.
