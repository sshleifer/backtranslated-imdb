The film shows the exploitation of the Chinese worker - usually female - to make the best from the Chinese business owner who shares his shameless and fraudulent views, an American counterpart as well as a shameless, fraudulent staff who are given a voice. and of course, poor Americans who wear beaded beads without celebrating New Orleans. The wind of hope comes when other Americans are so angry that people who make their beads are paid as $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have the impression that employees may have the opportunity to avoid working in a fiber factory, but perhaps they will do so when they are given a treatment of a popular penalty for the owner of the factory and / or are lost to work up to 20 hours a day of hard work. I have wondered where these beads came, not realizing how to stimulate and reject them completely. I just enjoyed this film because it shows how the United States has been most affected by something that we consider to be guilty in our society for people on the other side of the world. Mr. mentioned goes Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the ice!
