Although I did not like much like Stanley & Iris as a film, I enjoyed it. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are the best in this film. I have never been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is stylish and powerful at the same time. De Niro has the ability to perform every role that shows the gold. He gives good performance to this film and there is a great place that he should take his father at home because he can't take care of it again that will break your heart. I will not recommend this film as a great movie entertainment, but I will tell you you will not see many bettes anywhere.
