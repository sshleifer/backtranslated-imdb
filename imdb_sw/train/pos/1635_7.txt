back in my high school days in Salina Kansas, they chose something called "Weinberg Men's brains" into the country, and the film groups were good for a week. finally, we learned that the film was "On the Academy Academy", and it was a little ummm, "less face" than we were led to believe. I was supposed to see it, because I was there, and the audience of the area seemed to be less happy during the show. I was 17 years old, and I thought it was an unforgettable attempt in the publication of "animal animal", under the fart joke. It looked over many times since, and my opinion has been reduced slightly. is dumb, but sometimes gets the trophy of "mad", at least with "Mad TV" more. Ron Liebman can hate it, but he is almost perfect, and can not be remembered. For me, my favorite time would be a short area in Santa Fe avenue, where I was standing my car, when I bought the guitar rows. It is not so bad to see Pinto's short, usually seen off the TV. have not seen a new DVD, but if my old pinto appears, they have a sale.
