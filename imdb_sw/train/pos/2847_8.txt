As is commonly known, anthology films do not do very well with the American audience (I think they prefer the usual line of the project). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of anthology films related to cities and people living with love in them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I enjoyed very much. The film had several groups, written and / or directed by a different director (most of them were French, but there is a fascinating feature of Joel & Ethan Coen). Such as' Paris', this is also anthology, led by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), And also as' the Parish of Paris and the New York, and why they like the city living. You have a high reputation of sand, including the love of Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki, and also provides frozen veterans like James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some stories come from the truth, and others do not (although I think it will depend on the individual's taste â€” I will not destroy anyone else by revealing what they did to me and what they were not). The word is that the second entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (is Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece out of question?). It has been spoken mainly in English, but it has English and Russian bits and English English titles. It was tested 'R'by MPAA with strong language and sex content
