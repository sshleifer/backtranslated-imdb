It's a wonderful part of this beautiful series. This is the quality of television for the best. The story takes place in 1968 and is done in beauty in black and white colors, close to the film film and its shades and vivid images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to destroy this. It is a common topic for gay people who are faced with the 1960s in America. Written by Tom Pettit very good, and directed by Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their trouble. Taking the matter as sensitive makes this all the most amazing part. Our feelings are broken and sharp as the characters. Chills ran my back spine when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, "Ah, but I was so great then, I am younger than now," as singing by Byrds. This goes beyond 10 and all the way to go to the star. Good.
