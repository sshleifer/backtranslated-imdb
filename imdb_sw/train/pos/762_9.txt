I enjoy watching people who take a break, especially if they do it with the best pictures of this movie that takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially during Christmas, because it also appears "MC Santa Claus". Even if this is an old movie, and even if I have removed a video from the TV, while the Finnish State Storage showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to explore. More interesting on big screen than on TV. Even though many people here think that this look on the big screen is losing money at the cost of tickets, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got money for seeing this, like in the big screen, especially on the line in front of movies, unfamiliar experiences, and better than just video.
