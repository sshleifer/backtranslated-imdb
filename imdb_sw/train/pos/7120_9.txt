Many war wars in the United States during the WWII were very good to watch but were due to the real shortcomings in realistic origin because they were more productive in propaganda value to raise the soul at home than anything else. Not hit these films as many of them are still very visible. However, because they often do not have the originality they are prevented from becoming a true film. The perfect example was the Air Garfield film of John Garfield - which B-17 almost one-handedly takes half of the Japanese army! However, Marini's glory is to leave to entertain you - to install the highest score by showing the true story in the right way. When I saw this film first, I thought it was not a true story as it seemed to be impossible to be true. However, after exploring further I found that it was true for the wonderful story of two men who did much to get the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed to be too wonderful to be true!
