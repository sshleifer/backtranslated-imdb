I don't know if I am just amazing, but I really enjoyed this film. Return to Cabini and Lake is the second direct of my favorite Cabin and Lake films. In fact, I think I enjoyed this film even more than the first. I also thought that cast in this film was good, Judd Nelson is much better! I also enjoyed the whole plot. I loved the fact that this second movie focused on the effectiveness of Stanley's Cabin film to Lake - was not a typical Stanley film to grab other girls and sink. - If you are looking for a deeper meaning, then this film is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch. I've already killed at least to watch this movie. :)
