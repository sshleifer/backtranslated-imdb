When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in drag in this movie, my expectations that I'd look at the whole movie was down. The only reason given to me is Julie Walters good and a friend's recommendations. <br /> <br /> I thought what a broader "Mrs. Doubtfire" kind of farce seemed to be gentle and comedy insight. Pasdar is very honest and sympathetic as a business man who needs to be given a female part of her life by wearing a cross at the time. She presents these needs to the audience in a completely reliable fashion. Julie Walters is good, it's like her character, as a homeowner who teaches unconditional love.
