The second part of the official "Columbo" series ("Killed by the Book," published later, hit the first airwaves). Robert Culp, who would compare Peter Falk's investigation and detention in several phases of the future, is as bright as the short-term head of the modern detective organization that kills the client's wife when he refuses to beat his private projects. The two stars are equally fit in this clever exercise and the mouse is one of the best in the series.
