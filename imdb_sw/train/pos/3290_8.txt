Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is close to adolescence, begins to have fantastic dreams that begin to affect her in real life - especially involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) who meets in her dreams. It is a very unusual dream and some time of real horror. Despite the fact that this is about a little girl and has a rating of PG-13, this is not for children. Also, if you hate fantasies to stay away. But if you are a game for something different this fits the bill. Guided by Bernard Rose and only beautiful music and a few beautiful, awesome. The only thing that prevents this from being a great movie is Burke - not a very good actor (it is not surprising that this has been his only film) and hurt the movie. However, everyone else is great. <br /> <br /> Architects are very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (very well in England) is also very good as Anna's mother and Ben Cross are afraid and compassionate as Anna's father. The sleeping man was given in 1988, since then. That's very bad - it's very good.
