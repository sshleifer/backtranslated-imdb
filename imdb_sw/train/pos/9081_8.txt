If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Old Legends, then you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> Special Effects are the best I have seen since Juarassic Park screwed large screens years ago. While acting may be less than desirable, a line of stories and effects paid for enough for it. <br /> <br /> I would now have seen this on the cinema on theater screen instead of our size 42 inch TV screen. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, amazing pictures, and flavor of stories and rental .... you should see this film !!
