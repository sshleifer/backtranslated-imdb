It started out slowly after the best introduction of animation, as the director had a group of characters and school environments to develop. Once the bet continues, however, the movie takes the speed as it is running against the time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten at 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss certain things with our child: uncomfortable, helping others, mind over something you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Special info is a girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. Kinda managers run away unexpectedly, and while screens are interesting. He is one of those "Hey, he looks familiar" faces, and then I remembered that he was a little girl who Pepsi included 8 years ago. He was also in "Paulie", that movie about a carrot who tries to find his way home. Eisenberg made a lot of television shows and films in '99 -00, but it wasn't very visible for the next few years. She is now 14 and is becoming a good woman. His smile greatly reduces the screen. If he can get a better job he can have a better job (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another third called a child, but without hope without other problems that Osment has been recently. Any / AnyWhozitz, according to my 8's son, who finished reading the story, the film did not seem to follow the book properly, but it was not even entertaining. At the end of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels (How to eat Slugs boiling Style of Escargot Kid?), Which can be something very bad. It was good to take the family to the movies and it is not appropriate to worry about language, violence or sexuality. <br /> <br /> Another beautiful part of the movie was respect / fear derived from the chief Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Movies are now showing the statistical authority of adults as a buffon. When he had one goofy area, he ruled the school with a strong hand. It was also good to see Andrea Martin getting a certain job.
