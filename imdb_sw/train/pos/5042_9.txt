This film makes a good job to explain what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well. It's hard to believe it was the beginning of Bill Paxton's instructions, though some shots look just as the story of the story. Still, there are a few shots that look good and show the realities of the Paxton section. <br /> <br /> It is a good story to lose at the end, several of them, all reliable, all fun, and better, hidden well enough to make them lose real. <br /> <br /> Children in the film performs well, too. I often have concerns about movies and children in star roles because they often come out as Nickelodeon refuses, but all these children are doing a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie does not like. It's not very scary. But it is very, very creepy.
