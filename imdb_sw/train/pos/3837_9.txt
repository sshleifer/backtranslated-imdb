Go back forty years, when movies were touched on issues that are still unacceptable in the "honorable" society, they used the principles considered on the heads of many viewers when informing those who knew only what was deep. Probably no decade of the decade was locked by innuendo as the incredible rage of the Desert Desert, set in a small oasis of gambling called Chuckawalla elsewhere in the California desert. The Proprietress of Saloon's Sage's Purple and casino is an awesome Astor Astronomer, in slacks and games of cigarette holder; in the city gives her beautiful daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking at, in Technicolor, like 20 bucks. made this connection clear. Even more is John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his torpedo of envy. Add Burt Lancaster as a city sheriff, stir, and sit back. Both Lancaster and (amazing) Hodiak fall to Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak was not just changed by Astor, but had a wife who died under a state of doubt. The desert desert cuts the joints up to a boiling point, with many face blows and a huge mixture. Do not raise this hothouse melodrama, full of foreign blooms, if it comes your way; it's a wonderful movie.
