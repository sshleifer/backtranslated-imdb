Amicus made almost half of the half of these anthologies of fear in 70 years, and this, from the author of fear leading Robert Bloch, is one of their best efforts. There are four stories, both suitable, but two - "Sweets For Sweet" and "Way to Kill" - to distinguish themselves as a highly effective journey in fear. In "Candy", Christopher Lee has a patient widow whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) is offended by her apathy and brutal cruelty, so she builds a voodoo doll where she describes her destruction in her ways. Franks is a good figure of evil evil and provides one of the major children's exhibitions in the awesome film since Martin Stephens in the "Non". This period is directed by a great trick and the last fury, which is off-screen, is a time of absolute fear. The "Way to Kill" is about the author of fear (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creation, Dominic anger. This period is quite surprising and frightening. Domicic may or may not be real, so the director Peter Duffell has a good time playing with our expectations. Dominic shots emerged in the pond or seen as a permanent fantasm in the mountain is really haunting. The original poster art, including the sketch of the tray that held the head with the head cut off by Peter Cushing, was a great influence of punters put in fear.
