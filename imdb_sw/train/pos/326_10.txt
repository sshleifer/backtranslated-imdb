"Jag is a yellow" Yellow "is a lot of fun. If at least another consultant, I was, often, laughing loudly. Yellow is a powerful, playful, self-revealing, trying. Don't expect Bergman here. This movie is about young in the early-mid 60 years in Sweden and about issues, read * controversy *, that the nation and the world were faced. Sometimes Yellow looks to be a personal and political document, and Lena, the main character, and others interact with ordinary people and politicians (e.g. Olaf Palme at home). In some cases, yellow seems to be a method of this type of document. All the time, Yellow makes like a personal document to explore the life of Lena - his home life, he likes, his political views, his own views. He is a perfect man? hard, legitimate, opposite, happy, sad, curious. And putting on all this is a wonderful direction of the director, Sjöman, and his staff writing Lena's records. That is, for me, really gives Yellow wings. It is not just a sudden look at some interesting time and in some of the most interesting ways, reminding the viewer that this is a lie and a text, but their presence is itself another layer of film; they are giving birth themselves. I remember the music video of Bjork and the same quality? The music video about creating a music video, ad infinitum, and every iteration to get usirder and more cartoonish. I think Sjöman might have something similar in mind. When the "Jag is" Yellow "it may be a cup of everyone's tea, it is, of course, bold, fun, and real.
