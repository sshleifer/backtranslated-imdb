Would you like to expect from a film called 'Live Christmas' and present as 'happy celebration', something like Ghandi or English patient? There are many things I like about this film, it's funny, it's very good to be thrown and it's superly written. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort but I was worried when I read the plot, it was ridiculous. But the film is not found like that because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays its part fully, one minute is an adult, as an adult who knows that he has found everything in life except what he wants. In fact we see Latham growing in this film, when meeting the problems of those who hate them and realize that their lives are not good, they see that their vote is not bad. <br /> <br /> This film has weak scenes or dud than many other comedies I have seen. The comics are more complex than any type of game, it works or is not recommended by very few authors at all. I especially love the game drama game, where the family takes part of the written reading by Latham. The pleasure is in the comments of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It's a desperate case for Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear pride hats or sing a Christmas tree to get money for money that continues to move the film together. Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) in the story brings an interesting romantic angle, and why not in the Christmas film? Of course it is his corny and generated; he is rich and beautiful, he is good and wife, and therefore is not available and hates to end up with snow and face to face. Great! One thing I would like was the use of festive music to increase the atmosphere but I can't complain. I've got what I wanted.
