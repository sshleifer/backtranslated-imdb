I saw many years of drug abuse at VH1 and I love it. I think it shows the history of the drug very well and the most important ITI OF THE KING OF ALL MONEY. There are wood, there is Joplin's, Hendrix and Jim Morrison deaths, there are many examples of drug abuse and drug abuse. It fully covers the time line and the use of drug abuse in the United States for all good and bad ways. In my opinion this document has been done well and I would like to thank its creators because this is exactly what is required to play on TV in these days. I'm waiting for the release of DVD. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is wonderful - BIG TIME!
