Definition of 'Finding Fish' book. This story is about a small marine ship Antimony Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the story of its history of pain by Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). The first performance of Derek and Luke's performance is always amazing with Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was extraordinary with many levels and I was disappointed that it did not defeat Oscar, I think it's because it was given at the wrong time why it was ignored. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you will be interested in his story and it makes the audience really interested in this young man who is Antione Fisher. If you like loyalty stories, then see Antony Fisher. Thank you
