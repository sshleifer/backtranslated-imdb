If the film opens, two bandits kill another string. When the body is discovered and on power, the doctor knows that although the man was shot dead, he also had a problem with Pneumoniki - an amazing and more unusual version of Bubonic stress! Therefore, it is a race against time to find those who have contacted the dead person and treated them immediately, otherwise disaster can happen. Normally, I know very little about Pneumonic plague, as I taught a series of lectures on my class of history. The film did not do a good job to find out about the disease because it didn't look like people had in the film. The main problem is that this disease is very strange that in 1950 they did not want to be allowed to show it. In fact, there is a high fever and spasm (they have this right) but they also lose blood and vomiting of blood-caused bleeding - as well as many lymph nodes if you could get a bubonic blow - everything that was lost! I can really understand why they didn't go now. Also, I am sure that the federal government would have a greater participation, greater in managing and treating the disease - here in the film was handled at a very local level and everyone seemed to be uncomfortable and not bad. No one seemed to be willing to believe doctors! As for acting, the film had other excellent actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas, respectively, a public health doctor and police chief. Good players but also actors known back in 1950. However, in his first film it is a very serious injury to Jack Palance (still continuing with his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance') and also unknown (at that time) Zero Mostel. Palance was good - very scary and very physically in its own stunts. Mostel played a great job of his original work - a kind of greasy evil and fear. Overall, in spite of not really getting the right information and covering everything a little bit, the film is too long and has a good job - and it is worth looking at.
