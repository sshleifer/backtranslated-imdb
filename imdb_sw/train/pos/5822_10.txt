Three Stooges has always been some of the most actors that I love. I like almost every one that they have done. I love all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All shorts are hilarious and also many many actors and actors who most of them were in short shorts! In my opinion The Three Stooges are some of the most actors ever and are the whole team of comies! <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful Three Stooges short. It is funny and its sand includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey; Stooges did very well in this short! I recommend this!
