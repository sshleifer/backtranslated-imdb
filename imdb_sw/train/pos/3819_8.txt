I have been waiting to see this film for a long time and eventually I could see it at Istanbul film. Maybe because of what I expected so much from this film and that's why I was a little disappointed. I wasn't the best movie from Korea but it's still important to watch. The lesson was good and the film makes you keep looking at it though it is long. But there are obstacles in the movie and jumps from one place to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon acting is very good. It was one of the best exhibitions in the history of the original movie and I think this movie cannot be good if it was not in the lead role.
