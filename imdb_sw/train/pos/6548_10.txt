This is one good movie! I have played all Nancy Drew games and I have read books, and I have never thought of a movie to be exciting and fun! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (The Mystery of the Old Hour) so you can be used for Nancy, then you can watch the film, because in the film, they do not introduce characters' names quickly. ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was very interesting. This is the return of Nancy Drew's previous movies, which Nancy Drew performs were not found to be the same. This movie is like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's very cool! Dear Nancy Drew, you must look at this!
