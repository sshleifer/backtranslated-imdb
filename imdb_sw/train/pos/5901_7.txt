It is a rehash of most recent movies this has a few stars, complicated problems and feel more fuzzy. Abhay and Ritika (played with Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) to meet a friend's wedding where their own marriage (they do not know them) begins their process of organizing. At any time two visitors are married and taken to a foreign camp where they meet with other couples who are doing the same. When they spend time together, secrets are revealed, broken hearts and / or processed with love flowers. If you have seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you have seen this film. The pieces of the plot are the same, there is no single element of surprise in both the two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I just enjoyed it because I had seen 'Darling' (also leading Pastor & Khan) early in the afternoon and enjoying their chemistry so I said “why not” when my sister suggested we borrow 'Just let us down' too. See: Because Kirron Kher star co-operation is a common partner in it. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've had enough for all of the unhappy events of a couple! C +
