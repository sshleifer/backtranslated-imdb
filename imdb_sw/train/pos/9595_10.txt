At the beginning of this film, one of the speakers says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male. But more than that, he has a third strike: he is gay. "You need to be stronger than you thought," he is told. "Paris is Burning" is a document about homosexual and gay people who are tranvestites or male males. The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that Jennie Livingston's director takes something that can be very easy to show freak and allows people in its humanity. We learn their views about homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their desires, their dreams. Some of these dreams are impossible. Many people are very reluctant; <br /> <br /> This is not a film for everyone. There are shots in this film of the women emerging. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this film is not for you. But if you see this film you will see "Paris is Burning" it is not true about wearing women's clothes, it is about a group of people who are often reduced and abandoned by society in general, and what they do to get a sense of society in their lives. I have watched this film four times since it was released in 1991, because it says many things: it is a definition of property in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and what celebrates, about popularity and adulation. "Paris is Burning" is one of many people, and one of the sad movies, which I have ever seen.
