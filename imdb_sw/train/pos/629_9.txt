A 14-year-old child in me is very happy that he can now make good movies to look fantasy, and that they are all angry, what to the Lord of Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia to make money in the box office. This year you will see (and have already seen several) more, especially the Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Patience, according to the novel and Neil Gaiman, was shown on the movie this week and a little more than peep. I didn't see a preview for it, just a few ads. The key reaction is the type of blah. I can't even see if it is not true that I must wait for my friend to see Bondne Ultimatum, and that there is nothing more interesting that is open this weekend. Yes, if you forgive a terrible blow, the stars must be connected correctly, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a great movie like Lord of Rings. The plot line is your primary quest of fantasy (the hero puts out the fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within this basic summary, the story is alive and thoughtful. It's easy to have fun, and a little romance charming. And it succeeds in amazement. There were many great films during this summer, but none of them was almost happy like this. There is a lot going on, but stories are told well and it is very close. It's not a hub, but certainly it can take that kind of soil that something like Princess Mrs. ali (though I don't like it quite like the original film). Many fun being here if you're a fan of type.
