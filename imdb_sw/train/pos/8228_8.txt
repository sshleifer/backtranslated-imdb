it's hard to tell you more about this film without damaging it. I enjoyed it because I did not expect what I saw, but it's a normal sex dance so .... It's a thriller of sex of pscyho, which nothing is seen. It has Emmanuelle Seigner features, no guest for a variety (and for weakness) where her husband, Polanski, has led her. And bad performance (do I say creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). It seems like Bruckner's Pascal meets Roman Polanski (better than the Bitter Month), as Chabrol has disappeared or the exciting Clouzot (I have seen someone pointing to Les Diabolics), but close to Les Yeux sans Visage Georges Franju (Eyes without face, godfather of Dr. Phibes) and more). Gem! I'm just afraid to hit this on the remake of Hollywood as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
