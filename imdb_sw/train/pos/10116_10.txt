The best and accurate Film ... McGovern takes good pain to research and write its records and pays. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though it can draw reviews and improper views from others who as a story are clean and sweet and pleasant. Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston, although he is not in the top position of his career at Hillsborough. I found this movie to be accurate, well done and presented well as Hillsborough and I praise McGovern for its inappropriate writing text. Made well with my hat is far from the author, executives, production workers. Good movies!
