This is a good movie! Most of us have seen the Jurassic Park, where Chaos theory is summarized by telling about the wings of the butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about it (or at least something, don't worry this is not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and I don't believe in pre-ordered things, fate, etc., but this movie certainly makes you wonder if there is a worse chance. The more and more, the acting and the camera is also better, another confirms that it is still possible to make a good film without zillion
