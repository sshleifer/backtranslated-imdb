Unlike some views, my positive. This movie revolves around the dinner table with a group of friends, others you like, others don't. Few are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth one, happy with everyone and everything, a kind of life - such as real life. Some of the story lines do not, it just happens. But as true families and good friends, they keep together. They want-that parents who buy the baby are such holes! You are happy to the end. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a stone to protect himself, his mother, his son, and try to put their lives together. This does not end with a walk of the sun or a house in 'burbs and all live in a world of dreams, but it is a real life of people living day by day, month by month. In general, this is a good story with a great movie !!
