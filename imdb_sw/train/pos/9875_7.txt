Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a good film, but in my opinion it would be better. Judy Garland is as good as always, but some of the events in the film seem to have no place and romance between her and Van Heflin develops very fast. I mean, one minute is ready to beat his butt, but the next minute he likes him. I believe that this production, the film editing, and the script (though photography was good, the environment was good and the clothes were too good) would be better. It feels that the production was fast. Casting was also good, especially Janet Chapman as the second younger daughter Rosie. She was 11 years old, looked very beautiful and was embarrassed that she did not develop to be a young boy actress. He is much better in this film than in his original films like Warner Brothers at the end of the 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, he is very good at it), when he tried to make him in the Shirley / Sybil Jason ring. In general, this film could be better, but finally, Judy gave it all of it.
