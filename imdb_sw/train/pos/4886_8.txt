The end of Bombshell Blond is a bit of entertainment of fluff. Judy Dench has Elizabeth, a widow who was a widow at the end. He has spent his life as a good wife and mother but never really happy. Soon after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth has her regular lunch and date-of-her-children when she is pregnant on the street. This reminds the memory when he was a member of all the girl's swing band in London during World War II. Soon we learn that the band was not a beautiful girl if the farmer was a man dressed like a woman like a woman. Elizabeth removes her sax (which she has been doing secretly in all of her marriage) and joins the power of the guitar on the street. Elizabeth is more talented than a guitar player, and money begins to enter. He does not take money as he is rich and does not need. His play is effective for artistic fulfillment. Elizabeth is one day with Patrick (Ian Holm) who was a player of the port. It seems that Patrick was - and still - a man, and Elizabeth - with only fifteen at the time - was the only member of the club who had no "talent" for Patrick. Elizabeth is headed by her granddaughter to find an old group again by playing for the school's grand school. So it starts a fascinating journey under the line of memory along with the film's features of the humorous road - all of which have been removed and swing with very good blues. I think I am a very happy young actor doing their things, and this film is a trophy of wealth if not just star Judi Dench, but he is used not under Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and hosting the character of British character. All of this has been hit by the wonderful voice of Cleo Laine. Yes, it has a fluff, but it is very happy and quite interesting.
