A quite classic! Valuable direction, acting is just good. Words are not enough for this great job. The most obvious in the Mumbai Police. This movie has stood many times. <br /> <br /> Om Puri offers stellar performance, Smita Patil is not less. All employees have done well and the citizens of the film are always interested in you. This film undermines all of your negative and lets you reflect on many of the issues facing our society. This is the story of a soldier (Om Puri) who starts his work as a faithful person but eventually decreases within the killer. The first voice attempt is found behind the events and discloses the truth of suppression of Mumbai fighters. Kudos to Nihalani !! After this film the killing of sound films was opened which revealed the concept of a criminal politician. So this film was really a set of trends. This situation led the Indian movie to more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was an office box on average. You should see-up for fans of an understanding film.
