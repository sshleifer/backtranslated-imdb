That was, of course, the movie that caused the most that I've ever seen. The first part of the film, though amazing, has the quality of light and exciting. The journey begins in memory as peace, details and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachia mountains. But that's more misleading of faith. The social problems inbreeding and the destruction of rural communities are the first cycle issues. I can still hear Bobby shouting for pain, and I'm busy with thoughts. Lewis's foot made me wince. However, when the movie was, in general, very worried and problematic, asked some interesting questions. When is the moral time, or the right to take someone else's life? What? What ethics can lead us to do, or not, sometimes? And is the glory and integrity of morality more important than life itself? Whatever the conclusion a person can draw from a film, it is a success that has its own rights (despite some things that have been true and terrible).
