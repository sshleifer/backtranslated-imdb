I know some people think that the movie is interesting but I disagree. It is a very difficult and wonderful biography. I loved the characters in the film and I think that leaving the parts of Archie's secret has taken his humanity. I don't think the purpose of good biography should be a description of one's life but instead of problems and relationships that attract them. And what is more attraction than a man who makes himself effective? "Men have what they are dreaming - dreamed." Good work for Mr. Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand stood up as a scandal actor and I hope to see him in more films.
