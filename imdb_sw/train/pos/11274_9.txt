One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its many stages (and graphic). Taking a year or more after Tarzan Ape Man, Holl Niel Hamilton has asked a rich friend financiers to go back to the elephant cemetery to collect ivory horns. His friend comes also carrying clothes and perfumes that Holt expects to conquer Jane from Tarzan. Before leaving Holt finds its stolen map and becomes a dash of shade trying to catch a competitive trip. When finally on taking the thieves finds a dirty party and they are surrounded by themselves. They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon they get out of the pot of cutting and on fire. Finally Tarzan and Jane are shown and everyone has left more adventures. Non-fiction film was widely recognized to reduce gender violence (Indicating the picture even today. Perhaps it would have PG 13) and to remove any dirt point, (there are several minutes of time nude swimming pool involving Jane which is perfect for its severity, was recently repeated. Watching them for a revised version of why this film was reduced by 20 minutes during the TV run. If it stands in its version of this is a very old adult film that is romantic, touching, full-filled and everything else that the movie should be. His amazing film for almost any rate. Best of its kind of film that includes all the well as an adventure adventure, one need to see the first film to enjoy it, but also a film that adds characters to the theme that was introduced in the original film. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> I liked this film very much. If there are any film errors, maybe the film has not been old. The back screen is often very clear, there is a gorilla suit for many children and other effects are more beautiful than convincing. However for almost every other film this film is the top line. <br /> <br /> You are your own right to see this. Make a large bowl of popcorn and panda on the bed and just return to the next time. This is one of the great adventures.
