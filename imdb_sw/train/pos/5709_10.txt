Designed in 1931, this foreign film should appear and enjoy many times. We are opening in a small French-rested village, roaming the sleeping houses of the citizens. Then we hear something that looks like a party. After examining the violence, two neighboring men are told the story of two men, they are thought to be friends, who took two numbers by lottery. <br /> <br /> Our photo star has its number and its friends. When he asks his friend, he could share half of the dough, his ticket should be a winning number, his friend quickly says no. In fact, H.E. The two rods of no hockey! so does he. So when our man sees he has a winning ticket and that is lost, through his own fault, he has no feeling. Everyone finds himself, looking at this ticket, in something as a forerunner of "Great Race." Although this is all flashback, I had all the buttons and got upset about every little thing in this all-for-me-show-me-money-in-the-bank film. See Le Million today!
