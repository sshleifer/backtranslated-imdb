I went to see Ashura as Fickoff of Fantasia 2005. Man, that was very cold. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the first of Canada, but due to health reasons, he is still in Japan ... oh the master I hope he gets better and makes many movies. The plot is very simple, but some of the original ... demons go to Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" kill them and are afraid of regeneration of Ashura, the demon god who sleeps and thinks it the kick. /> <br /> It brings us to Izumo ... some kind of elite warriors called "Demon Slayer" and his friend Jaku who is limited to worldly jealousy ... It seems to be boring? Well now it spreads ... <br /> <br /> Izumo took retirement for killing demons since he sold a little "feeling" that he was a demon, he did not know, but killed him. So Izumo went on with his life and made himself again in Kabuki hall. In the joyaride boats on a beautiful night, Izumo areas search for a girl who hides a bridge and changes her life and resumes killing demons ... for good reason, because of love ... and damn ... boy knows how to handle a sword and pull a kill of entertainment. Izumo carries the movie until the play continues ... he is a general fund ... he knows how to fight (hell yeah knows), is quick, he is intelligent and has a grit. It should never shout: "HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY, IT IS EXAMPLE" The man knows he already has that common meaning. He is really a perfect hero. <br /> <br /> In addition to the movies goes, esthetics is very interesting. It's by far, the movie looks like a manga. Fully filled with special effects and no, at all costs will hinder this movie watching the real ... it's very amazing. There are many colors "photographing" images, except that ... it's straightforward ... but as I said, the main character takes the movie A must see, the hands of hands and hands good
