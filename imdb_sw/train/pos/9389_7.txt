Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage is involved in crime crimes without first knowing, and the rule caused by increased risk, adventure and sensitivity in the West of America in the late 1990s. and sometimes it has hilarious, and Cage removes the mixture with its ordinary sardonic magician and enough ease. <br /> <br /> What! plot on the top? Yes. What? Dennis Hopper is perfect as a skilled, close to an attractive killer? Yes. What? Cage manages space? Well, you should look and see. It will never be too much for you, and to take me in surprise for the first time I saw it. In the second look yesterday, I was amazed at how well you held, how well it was built, and how wonderful it was at the same time. Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is well known for his work on TV, but for Rounders and this film shows the left hand and beautiful plots. Saved by his humor through, and by caricatures. Bar is a sleep, a concern of soldiers. And do not forget the true essays written by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
