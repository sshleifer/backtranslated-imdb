Just enough, all the previous comments just described the beginning and left more details. I feel the importance of confirming that this is a family work, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and the best jazz music was written by the father of Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising it was a very happy, visible time presented and immediately recognized by music. The competition was innocent, and it has been preserved until the end. Robert Hossein, when one of the best European players, was able to separate as a top director and director of action. It still puts a great exhibition of action, for preference for religious subjects.harry carasso, Paris, France
