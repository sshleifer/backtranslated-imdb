A wonderful film of fear filled with popular faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later "Flamingo Road" of the TV) as a good but uncertain example with a gummy smile who is planned to pay for trying to commit suicide by protecting the way to hell! The events of Raines are well-sounded, emotional music is perfect. cooking. Neighbors, including the Meredith Burgess and the husband of kinky Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a lot of diabolical, and Eli Wallach is a great pleasure as a police investigator wily. The movie is almost decorate the color of "Baby Rosemary" and "The Exorcist" - but it is mixed! According to the best supplier by Jeffrey Konvitz, "Sentinel" is a spooky of fun, full of wounds brought well by director Michael Winner, who eliminates stripes with completed ideas and skills. *** 1/2 from ****
