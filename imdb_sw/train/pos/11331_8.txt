I should not be forced to write a review of the film, but the only explanation of this film so far is the same, so I feel it is important to share my opinion. "Christmas" (or as it was known in the playground I saw, "Falling") follows a Latvian Shepherd, trying to learn about a woman who is not trying to stop the bridge, and also the reasons for doing so. That is a brief plot, but this film is not related to the story as it shows the guilt of someone who failed to act. As a detective who investigates this incident tells him, we cannot bother to take care of the unidentified faces we go through every day until death. Comparison with Michaelango Antonioni and "Blowup" will be much more likely in any review you read about "Krisana." The influence of the philosophical and artistic philosophy of Antonioni and the story of "Blowup" is clear and in fact, the author / director Fred Kelemen shows the film's show in events where Matiss tries to know the woman who has broken the bridge, or at least who thinks she did. The only person to share his views on the film prevents the "class of film film" to watch the sound of the film. He or she overlooks the budget constraints that most of the Latvian film faces the film, but the black and white movie and the sound of the sound are achieved at the artistic level to show the matiss ratio. The sound of the wind and the road roads give them a horrible anura and remind one of Fellini's film, whether it is Kelemen's soft or not. The film workers were undoubtedly a bit of money, but this obstacle is used for the benefit of the film. "Krisana" succeeds as a study of behavior and enough humor that you have not felt so much. It can fall easily in secret ways, but it avoids it and becomes a smart film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned with the plot, this film and its end can destroy you. Otherwise, make time to share it. It is good to seek.
