Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until both of them begin to love their neighboring court (Jason London). But it is not after the shocking shock that the two sisters discover that nothing can stop them and that their love for each other does not fail. <br /> <br /> This was a real heart story on first love. Perhaps the most painful story about the little love I have ever seen. All acting is amazing and Reese Witherspoon offers good performance in his first movie. I would like to give Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
