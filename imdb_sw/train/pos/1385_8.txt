I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille only one night after its first public estimates in Paris. Very good movies about three 15-year-olds, all of them are on the same psychological point. Many exhibitions enable us to return to our youthful age and our first impression about sexual relationships. it is possible to assume that the director wants to reduce the first impressions of girls' power to polytheists, but even in that case it is not misleading the story. Sometimes you can find a little film slowly but what makes this atmosphere almost. I am financing the youth of talent, special mention by Floriane and Marie, who are very influential. There are many short notes but this film also enabled me to discover the same swimming is: interesting!
