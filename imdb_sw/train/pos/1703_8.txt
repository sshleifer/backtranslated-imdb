Being from a small town in Illinois myself, I can contact this film immediately. Considering these times, the capital city is looking at the concerns as many people I grew up with. Well plot is so-so. And yes, acting will not be appointed for Oscar anytime soon. But that's not the thing. The step is to stop the truth and just have a FUN. With this movie has many Fun. From a greedy, indifferent debate in good sense, but a deputy deputy, this film was made to enjoy the type of SciFi and a small town where they live. Who can not exciting before Drake Enforcer or Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I would like to have one when I was growing up. In general, based on the technologies that were available at the time, this is a pleasant pleasant in childhood, when you can sit back on Saturday afternoon, Popcorn by hand, and laugh at the weakness of a small town. This is the film that I will watch over and over again, if for some reason there is no fun with my small town.
