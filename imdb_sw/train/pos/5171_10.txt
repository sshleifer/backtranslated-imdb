If I could go back, even as an adult and believe my summer days found camp ... I would be there very soon. The camp I went did not even this big. They were in Texas where mosquitoes brought people but we had horses and fishing. The cinema movie was wonderful, funny and reliable characters especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The character of Sam Raimi and the small antics were of value. So who thought that this film was a crippled ... I am so sorry because they can't stop their unbelief for long enough to think the camp life again as an adult or have never been children. The whole thing is that these people had the opportunity to fix and become new again and so they did all the time. I would like. It was amazing, intellectually written, beautifully written, fully giving back to me so I want to look at it regularly only with the environment. Kinds like Fashion and Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies but the desert becomes characteristic as actors. Buy, see, buy and watch regularly ... you have never been old. ; 0)
