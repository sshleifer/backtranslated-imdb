... and series lets you forget all that. I am almost three years older than the children shown in the series. I was born in 1958, learned to drive during the first shortage of gas, and I got the first job at the university after a shortage of gas in 1979. The 70 was a very bad time to be low - inflation, to compete low-school waterworks and release for thirty-somethings, awesome music, worst clothes. The amazing thing is that this series does not ignore any of these and yet it may seem to be happy for those who are old enough to know well. It can look 70 directly on the face - full with time-real clothes - and still fill the show with the hope of young people and things that make high school and college at the best time and worst times. Then there are parents. Two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - actually have terrible parents with good intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not particularly June and Ward though they are normal for ten years. They represent what happened when 60 came to an end in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have waited in the 1960s to show their whole life to give their legitimacy their legacy. Eric Fez's friends, Kelso, and Jackie move around a group representing hunger, meaninglessness, and ignorance respectively. Hyde is an unusual boy to show up in the neighborhoods, but is largely representing a person who should be playing cards even when the cards are dealt with by parents in a large and innocent way. I strongly recommend all eight seasons even though the eight season is slightly reduced due to Eric's absence.
