First, no one can understand why this film has been properly counted. It's not just this first awesome movie since a very long time for me who is very good boiling for many decades of fear starting with driving through the dark rides (train ghost) as a child. Secondly, the great actor Cheri Christian has a face that can hope you will be a leading actor in the big picture of the future. Third, this woman is very good that I advise the retirement directors of both Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and how the names of the ephemeral fence lamps are implemented. Mrs. Christian is not the light, but the sun. However, "Darkness" is also a major metaphysical importance. They think that pictures depict the creation of the secretary of the secretary between the truth and the “ideas” that are not visible to the eyes of the person is not new. But I have never seen in the film before the beings are seen only on certain people and at certain times. This means that the image is not just a romantic picture of the truth (which the truth turns into a sign), but it becomes a substitute for the truth that can change if it really "true" can. To be a symbol, the image change means that it affects the beaten objects, that is, the sign acts like something. Now, in our normal world of perspective, it is common that things change the sign. F. example, if a person grows a bird, his picture will show him a beard, not without, as it was before. But on the contrary, the change of objects by sign would mean that the image and the beard are first and then the beard grows on that person. This is widely described, the case taken by the image taken by the main character in prison, in this film. This is a new one, and we should be grateful for everything new in awesome movies that often repeat and fix the effects and features that are already identified, especially since the silence.
