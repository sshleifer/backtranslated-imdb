The memory document begins in 1986 in NYC where the white and heavenly Queens hold "balls". That's how they wear yet they like, they put their things in front of the audience and vote. We know many members and see how they all hold together and help each other. If one person says to another - "You have three strikes against you - you are black, gay and brother of drag". These are people who (sadly) are unacceptable in society - just in balls. There they can be anyone and whatever they want and accept. Then the film is reduced to three years later (1989) and you will see how things have changed (sadly for some). Sad but not. Most of the people interviewed are really very funny and get great humor out of their situation. They are well aware of their position in the community and agree with humor - as much as they should. We see that all live in a "house" run by a "mother" range and help each other. Community feelings in this film are interesting. When this film came out in 1990 it was controversial - and a great hit. It won the best documentary awards on many festivals - but they were never even nominated for the Academy Academy. Their reason was "Queens of Black and Artistic not the Academy equipment". Interesting isn't it? Discrimination and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Appearance today is still a good film - with a piece of period. It's not like that again - NY that does not exist anymore. The balls are still amazed but not in the spirit we see here. Drag has also become more "acceptable" in society (for better or worse). And I have heard the house has gone too. That's kind of sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know two have died of AIDS but I don't know about others. And what happened to the age of 13 and 15 years shown? <br /> <br /> However, it is one of a kind - interesting, interesting and interesting document. You must see all the way! Accurate 10. Where to DVD?
