Ben Thomas (Smith) has a IRS member who offers a shop away from everyone's surprise. What kind of an Agent of this IRS? Most of us have heard the line with the IRS Registrar, "Well, I am from IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile spreads to the hatred that says, "Yes, right." When you get more and more in this story, you can't recognize this person. He goes easy for those who are being investigated. What's the reason for it? Does he from another planet, an angel, a rich young man who wants to do good? He is very helpful we want him to be our inspector we must inspect, of course. Hey, IRS, you listen? (childbirth, just giving birth) <br /> <br /> The speed of the movie is full and so that the symptoms have been ignored which would tell me what went on. At speed, repeating carefully, the goal was on Ben and he stays there. The whole movie works for Ben because we are trying to look at him and I didn't have any sign (what are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching DVD movies is the best way to go here. At the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well, it was apparent at that time. And, yes, it's up, but it's still a great story, especially because of Will Smith. Will Smith should be appointed for the best Actor award. Some of the cast were very good too. Yes, on top and in spite of good acting and finally getting all the answers you must know that the message of the film is exactly the same. What is the message? Believe me, you won't need many signs to find them. We don't. Violence: No. Gender: Yes, but nothing exciting. Bland. Discrimination: No. Languages: No.
