In New York, the family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets with his former companion and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) for luck on the street. Charlie became a lonely and shocked after losing his wife and three daughters in the 11th of September when Alan had problems discussing his inner feelings with his wife. Alan's friendship with Charlie and they are close. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, taking him to Angela Oakhurst psychologist (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has a violent response to treatment and sends it to court. <br /> <br /> "Lead on me" is a good game to lose, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is useless for plot; may be a car accident, fire or any other disaster, with sexual abuse of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Burrows of Saffron, for Alan. But family activities are working, shared with Adam Sandler's major exhibitions and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is unlikely to be identified, I do not know if he uses a great pretense to watch the elderly, but his face is strange. My vote is seven. Headline (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
