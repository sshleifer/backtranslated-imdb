"Masks" is a migration film that works on many levels. In its simplest way, it is the story of the smell of a road official who is bound by a small child while trying to pass with his creative art (masks) for the next generation. Although, sometimes the story makes an old man being Job, it is very good (written, acting, directed, wonders of crop production), it is easy to move beyond his difficulty. And, if it depends on it, the film is finally very good and tight. Kudos around. This is a good film for children and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who can't love foreign movies to see!
