This is a well-documented document on the exciting world of Indy Car racing. Photography is very good. The area was Mario Andretti on the road of the old road road under New England on the road laid by old maples, the leaves that were hit by the speed of the car, it's amazing. The film loses some of its beauty on small screens but if you would like to check out the cars that come from its limit you should see this film.
