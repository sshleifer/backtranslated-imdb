For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been gone 'City on the Eternal Thing.' I had liked about 'Menagerie' is that it is the most difficult star of Star Trek and this fascinating story back to the current Trek story. I still think it's very good how Gene Roddenberry included the original experiments in part of two parts. Although the new part of the story is great because of Kirk and a few others (with us) looking at the experiments, the idea of ​​Spock that the martialed court is clever. You can hollow holes in the plot if you want. For example, due to the ability to control Talasia's mind and Captain Pike's situation, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike to their planet? And there are other questions of confusion about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best to think hard about the details and enjoy only two parter.
