He was delighted to watch this film, despite the time I was given a lot of time, that this film was almost imitating Monsters Inc.. There are a few things that are very similar between two, a relationship between an animal / a monster and a small child, other animals trying to break the relationship, etc.. It felt so much in the film, to me. <br /> <br /> One of the features of liberation though, it is Scrat :) very interesting character, even if it doesn't use the purpose.
