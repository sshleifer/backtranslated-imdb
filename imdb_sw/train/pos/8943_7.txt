The 1960 television series has been hit by this idea from this film. This is a movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did right after being cured together in Vertigo and Alfred Hitchcock. This is not as obsessive as that one but Novak is as captivating. <br /> <br /> This was Jack Lemmons movie 10 and he is good at help here with Ernie Kovacs. Film has many good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, almost as good in support here as it was in The Music Man. Sent is very stable. <br /> <br /> This movie has in the late 1950s New York City feel & cat that is like hexing like any feline in any movie. It's good to look at it as a story of love and all feelings of any, & a little magic too boot. It is not that I think because it follows that movie, the audience did not rate it as good as it deserves - surely I am glad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960 series was found. I'm not very happy about what Ferrell will do on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
