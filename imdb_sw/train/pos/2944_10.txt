This is hands under the big show of stand. I've had a lot of standings, I've had a lot of standing stand, and I looked at Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone who can resemble Murphy's skills on this show. Feelings are excellent, skits are good, and time is perfect. You can even tell the crowd you get inside. When he got a few years later it was also very good, but this is # 1 in my book. It also shows that at one time, especially early-mid-eight, that Murphy was funny. My favorite parts of the show are when he shares family and "Ice Cream !!!" Mooommmm !! Ice cream man comes! "Another great place is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
