I had to have only 11 when Mr Peepers started. It was necessary to see the whole family, I believe Sun. at night. Repeated practice were Rob to open his locker (he had to use a bed or a pointer to accelerate the appropriate spot on another locker and do other things, finally hitting the spot where his door opened), and taking pins out of the new shirt (at the beginning of the part he could open the bag with new shirt The dress up for the second show that you get one pin after another that missed the time to erase the shirt, time is everything and pins got a lot of laugh.) I remember aunt who drove Rio as Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientifically . He would think and come up with a "probable half-membrane" or the resulting osmosis would say how wise he was. (you should be there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why did they not keep the series from his POV when Wally left (he was afraid that he was common but at that time it was too late) I never knew. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (one big) was Tiny Tim on Carson's show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (did I ever have a hat for it) and I remember it made a TV cover and have a media in all newspapers and magazines. The Museum of Broadcasting in the NYC years ago was desperate because they had very few events and those who could go now. I still remember it's amazing and I want to be a little old.
