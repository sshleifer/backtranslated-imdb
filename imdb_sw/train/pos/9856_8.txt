(demolition ??) I wasn't sure of thinking of the film. Not too much children's film. It certainly should be looked at by the parent because it involves death and death. But I was surprised that I was very happy with that. I was despised and 81 minutes we had. (even a little without credit) And the trailer makes you think the mouse is the main creature. But alas, they persecute him. Right until the end of the film. These two pieces made 2 stars of film. But I recommend a movie. Even on the other hand. <br /> <br /> <br /> / 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Can Be Delayed: 7/10
