"Pandora's Clock" is an exciting / exciting stimulation that is a cross between the virus and the movie film. This film, which has been revealed in two parts of the NBC at the beginning shown in 1996, refers to a plane-infected aircraft when one of the passengers appears to have this problem. The UN government discusses whether a plane should be destroyed or not, when attempts (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus (Daphne Zuniga) try to think of something to avoid disaster. I am not a big fan of television movies and service services, but I loved "Pandora Hour". It's one of the exciting trips. Jane Leeves ("Frasier" of TV), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as President) also have stars. *** (out of four)
