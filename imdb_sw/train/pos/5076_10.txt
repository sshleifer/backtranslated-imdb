It has been around 5 years since the release of this stylish flicker. I watched this film about 10 times with great effort and Gautham. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-of course..classy.Jyothika played its role as a very comfortable Maya.For the character of her very well suited. Jeevan was eligible for the best of the Villain at ITFA 2004. The help of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others did well. <br /> <br /> Photography of Racy, time and full talk with Gautham. The voice of the sound and Harris Jeyaraj is all wise when BGM fits well to the movie. RD Rajasekhar's view is rich. Peter Hein chose well stunts. Anthony's editorial is correct. <br /> <br /> Even Hollywood film cannot compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... of course.
