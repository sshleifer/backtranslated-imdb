I'm not exhausted to say this is one of the best political incentives made. The story takes place in a false sense, but it is clearly concerned with Kennedy's murder. The true and honest lawyer of the district (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and implemented by one Daslow (= Oswald) and although all other officials want to try the case to continue investigating with his team. br>> <br /> Screenplay is written fast and fast and has tension to the end. The only part involved with the Milgram attempt on authority is (though not uninteresting) a little out of place. The last sequence - describing who is the true Icarus - is slowly attacked and enhanced by the voice of Morricone's voice is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in the film.
