Just see Preem World of Fido at the International Film Festival of Toronto and enjoy it completely. Here we have a reworking welcoming of many kinds of ideas that have been pioneered (in fact 'fleshed out' very and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film and Canadian Director and is a Comedy! And, yes, I think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. It is widely believed and, perhaps even more important, the fun performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and actress K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect will see more in future features. However, I must admit that I have been very happy to return to the flavor of Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor Mr. Theopolis, in fact playing the animation version of Victor Van Dort from Mrs Bibi (or, for those who have seen the film, without t reading so well. as Pride Dead?) and, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly at least animated, but somehow moving the role as a character of the titular. Imagine, he did not want to get this position if it was not for Peter Stormare's promises for Prison Break (as revealed in the Q&A of Thursday night's investigation). I can't help but reflect that the Screens of Screens must have had a lot of inspiration from the 'Dead' Day of the Dead '. I don't care too much when opening the details of the conspiracy during the Comments and I don't start now. It is worth saying that Fido is not one of the zombie photographic films, which you can rely on Romero. Rather it is a film that will be with you constantly being hit by, though (and I needed to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fairly acceptable level of blood and abuse, good humor, a well-enhanced and surreal environment created by Director Currie and its collaborative writers, it may be for a long time to make this seem like a point that should be counted PG-13. I encourage you to go see this small gem of Canuck. I will definitely be buying a DVD once it emerges with hope and second season.
