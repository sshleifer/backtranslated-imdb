Suraj Barjatya is the best in movies on marriage. And here he is; return to its foundations on Vivaah. If the story goes this is a story from the partnership of marriage. Movies you can watch with all your family around you. The movie you hate to watch only. The story is simple, but the music is good, the movie is the best, the direction is better, everything about the movie has its class. There are many cases that will make you cry and sure if you are watching a movie with your partner, both of you will definitely hold each other to the end of the movie. Shahid & Amrita has given us early movies like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie was not well accepted by the public.
