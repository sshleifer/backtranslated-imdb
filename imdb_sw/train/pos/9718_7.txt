WORKSHOP WORKER - Somehow "How to Make Friends ...." is a "hearing person learn to fix, he succeeds and sees that anything else is" more than a story, in a celebrity business. - The end of the advertiser <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book but this comedy provides several good moments. Although I think the latter is done. It felt very fast and suddenly, like something lost. In addition to I would say the movie can not set the maximum. In addition to this you will find a good selection of actors and practitioners of actions and sometimes controversial characteristics. So far I have never seen Pegg different. He is still a very special type though on the screen sometimes he may seem to be worse than the key. Fox showed that he has the ability to play a hot star with his head in the clouds. I don't know if it was hard to do, but his performance was hot and better than during the "Transformers" (the same ... probably not a hard match). Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you can love it (if I have it) or find it. On the other hand you will see Anderson who has proved his ability to work with Jeff Bridges (who is good but maybe he could do a little more power). They all face their behavior well. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a good comedy of celeb and some little funny passages, cast a sweet but the whole end suddenly.
