... than this ;-) What will happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would work together on one movie? This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at some point, the story goes straight to the twilight zone ... to re-create anything new, but it's nothing ... and nothing is fun! Dave and Andrew when they begin to explore their new movie surroundings really interesting ... win heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> however ... this movie was, imho, a great surprise in FantasyFilmFest this year ... <br /> <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher I have given this to be a minimalistic, wonderful but very special design, which makes it difficult to find a place of story or its time ... time without time ...
