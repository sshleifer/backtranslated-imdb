This TV animation series is the only way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology but it will never say. I really think this is the best place for this "educational cartoons". I remember you can find small books and plastic body in several parts: skin, bones, and of course: ingredients. At the same time, you will find: "Il Ã©tait has a fois l" person related to human history from a great bang to the 20th century. (about space and its exploration) but that is more fiction than the details of the fact since it happens later.
