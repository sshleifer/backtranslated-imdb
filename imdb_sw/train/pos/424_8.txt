I love this film because I grew close to running the race. Pat Boone behind sulky reminds me of my father who was attracted to trotters because, unlike the deep jockeys, men of normal length and weight can be drivers. Well, the 1944 House in Indiana is the best movie, but it is also a very different movie. Love of April is slow and easy to watch, the movie will feel good. (Criticism although the views of Pat Boone's values ​​prevented him from kissing a girl! Many changes from today.) Home in Indiana and Walter Brennan (printed in black and white without anyone who will play the songs) takes emphasis and fight and achievements thus making the final access to more but it requires greater emotional investment.
