I can't forget when I saw this title in the video store back at a time. I was a big fan of Weird and when I saw this video I rented and watched it. I was too young to recognize the trickery of Al and Satire at the same time but I remember later later when I was old enough to understand what I looked at. If you are a fan of "Al," especially his original work, you will be quite happy with this film. It is done in the MTV-esque style "Rockumentary" and describes the true story (but sometimes spreads) how Al was when he was in 1985. You will love it if you love his magic and, most importantly, his music.
