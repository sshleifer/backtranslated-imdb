The listener of this night is better than people in general say. It has weaknesses, and it seems to have a conflict of identity type, of course, but I think its attractive landscape and exciting performances makes for this. The whole thing feels like one of these "fires" that happened to a friend of my friend "spirit stories. The main complaint about the movie is pacing: but pacing slow and sometimes awkward is deliberate. Everything going on on this film is taken well into the area of ​​probability, and real life is just a kind of plods together? So there is no end of flashy or loss of land, no "show" events. Thank you Heaven. You must enter the region when you watch this film, forget your discontent and your prospects for what it does (usually) a good film. Williams is not sharp, but easily meets the needs of the story, with its characteristic that should be common ("No Man") if he is Everyman, avatar which we ourselves enter into the story. Tone Collette's functionality should be selected for Oscar (even if it shouldn't be won). Give a shot. For quality and content alone, the Night listener is certainly in twenty percent of the emerging movies nowadays.
