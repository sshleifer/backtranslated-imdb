Often the band will join together in a reunion concert again to find that they can't just get together. Not so here. This festival is the beauty of shear just from start to end. These three singers included before and planning and planning to make sure this was not just a prestigious bash to meet someone's ego. This is evident from the beginning, before they begin the action. Many faces in the crowd were not born when these first guys do. From the first song they capture the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, for his own register, said he had to defend himself for this festival because there were no keyboards, synthesizers etc. so we get to see him for his best. Ginger's Baker shows why many couples today, they say he is like a certain type of guru dance. Jack Bruce just good. In fact they have put a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come. This is 10 for me.
