When I saw trailers I had to see the film. And when I was, I had a feeling that I felt was not good. It was a great movie, don't do me wrong, but I think a great part that has already been on trailers, if you catch my drift. It went very fast and went up, so I never got tired, and I enjoyed watching it. Humor was so great. Contact me first with sloth (.. or something like that).
