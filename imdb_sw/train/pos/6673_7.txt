Most users' comments I saw on the IMDB of this film are not fair. First of all, I would just say that this film should not be taken seriously. It should be a fun, but stupid, film that does not require someone to think, just to enjoy. If you look at this film with a view to see the hub in the creation of film or humor, then you will be very disappointed. However, if you want to just watch a goofy movie with talented actors / talented actors, and some good phrases, then you will enjoy it.
