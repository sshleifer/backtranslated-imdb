Great Britain's Indy Garden! The amazing chemistry among the 3 main characters makes some of the fragments of drugs that cheech and Chong will be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on big screens (even if they have switched sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is amazingly beautiful and treating women! He liked the final clash for being Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after putting himself on fire on photographers! ... he is not doing .... he is a hippe of British brain !!! You have to be a biker to enjoy this and it is directly on my Friday night post-pub repeat collection. Make this film go and you will not be discouraged.
