I loved this film because I have only a husband as a boy in this film. This movie is about Lindsey who meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season does not exist. He loves with love but at the time of the spring comes, he gets a shock of his life when he takes one step under Ben's actions he has put on. It is a very beautiful baseball game that Ben has. We cannot share from what he likes, that is what makes it so funny and why many women can involve Lindsey in real life. Also people who sit with them on baseball games are just as he thinks he is. It is a fun movie and you can't run if you use this.
