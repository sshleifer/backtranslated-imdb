This movie has everything of a fantasy movie should be, romance, clever witticisms, good acting and the right dose of magic. I enjoyed this film and was fascinated by its natural plot (according to Neil Gaiman novel that I now look at reading) with colored characters. One of the most surprising things for me is really what the story is. Unlike many sci-fi fantasy films out there now that leaves the end of the opening and this was a fairy tale, satisfactory and self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> Beginning. Fun. Dream of feeling good.
