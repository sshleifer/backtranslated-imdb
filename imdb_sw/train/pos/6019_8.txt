ZP is closely related to the youth's dream represented by the hippie movement. The university's debate at the beginning of the film says the culture of producing the movement. The explosion Daria thinks, represents the collapse of all social structures and therefore the development of all these major changes that the society suffers and eventually the death of Mark expects the end that A sees for the movement itself. Movies will be easy to understand if we return to that time in life. At 60 'and 70', young people were strong to conduct a major investigation of change. One of the most important changes expected is to get sex outside the bedroom, and I think the events in the desert will not represent orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom will do in a state of the state where there will be no one hiding. I looked at the area where the couple would give sand to each other and accept the best way that A demonstrated that it was impossible to continue to hide the basic human trick. Oppression was a way of "controlling" a sudden social and at the same time, the police are used to stop students. This community is faced with ignorance, and it comes to mind when students get access to arms to fly all fake controls. Discussions between police with a college professor, who have been imprisoned for any reason, show a part of the community that has been interested in this sense of the youth and the most unpleasant part. Presenting the fly as the most accurate sign of freedom, theft of aircraft represents the intention of Mark but, (return or return or return (segun) shows the difficulties of release from these buttons and if I '' said, it shows the death of a dream for problems These win the game.
