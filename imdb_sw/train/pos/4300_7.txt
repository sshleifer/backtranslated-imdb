This film can be one of these common "soap" pertaining to day-to-day events that have always been interlinked? .. broken relationships, creating new friendships, hitting roads, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of the baby was lost under the forest! It's a combination of events! Fortunately the film manufacturer goes beyond these daily events and asks questions to consider though there are no satisfactory answers. He asks ... in this chaotic world to do just things happen, it is only a fortune when things happen right or, taking a glance of oil, is a person who is prepared to be somewhere at a certain time and thus participating in the event and its future coming new? Many of us have experienced this unusual experience. Is it our good ego that makes us believe that it is very important? If one character says? he immediately sat on the edge toward Grand Canyon and was as young as he was. This is not one of my favorite movies but it is good training for human relationships. Danny Glover is the best in the role of compassion.
