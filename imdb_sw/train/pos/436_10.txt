I really liked this film. I don't even know what exactly about it but I think it was strange and should be available for DVD. Women were aliens and were still very good to spend time in Villa in Italy. Anime, in my opinion, did a good job. All characters were very different and are still clever stories that worked. There is humor, drama and relationship issues at all good. This requires verse 10 but I can't think more about saying that I will only continue until I get 10 lines. Sorry about this. What else I have said that has been long since I last saw it. I hope to see again but not available.
