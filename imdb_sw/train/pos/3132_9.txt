I watched the last night with low expectations. Because, I don't usually like "made for TV" movies and I have rarely loved "cast reunion" movies. But, the defendant in Los Angeles Times appeared like this, so I gave the chance. I am glad I did. It was very good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. But, somehow, they were acting like "Batman and Robin" themselves. They were living and did not find themselves, or this movie very seriously. The movie begins with them looking for "George Barris" designed by Batmobile, that someone stole before being auction to the orphanage. While, they are looking for the car, they also remember the series they did together. This is told in flashback. It was done well. The executives, with Ward Ward and Adam West died. And, for the television film, it dropped to the nitty loyalty about their actual behavior and on the screen. I give this 9/10, I loved it very much.
