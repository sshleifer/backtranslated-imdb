I first saw this film at a sundance film this year, and being a boy I've got a movie to be very interesting. These children are out of ordinary and unlikely to be in the film of this stature but with the correct conversation and junk they made the movies have a perfect success. I enjoyed this film more and others but I strongly recommend release and watch this movie. is a combination of magic views and hilarious facts. to receive the essence of secondary school, a high school record has found my list of favorites and hopefully has a chance to be released from the movie. I thank all the children who work hard in making this film, has helped me look at my eyes in laughter.
