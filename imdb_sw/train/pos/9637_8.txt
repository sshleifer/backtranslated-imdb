This film has a special way to tell stories, for the first time I've found it odd as it exploded in time and I had no idea what happens. Even the story of the story was though simple, but still real and touching. You first met someone, you came in love with love, but you broke the end and promoted death. Who did not go through this? but we cannot forget this kind of pain in our lives. I could say that I've been touched if two actors have shown good performance in showing love between characters. I just want the story can be the end of happiness.
