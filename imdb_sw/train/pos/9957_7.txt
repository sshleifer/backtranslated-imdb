This film is being promoted on the IMD. Like many films, this is not Shawshank. But it is very good, if it is predictable, the dance / film competition of personal growth. If you want to spend an hour and a half to watch 8 Mile for a woman's dancer, than I think you would like it. From the IMD testing, I think that this film was approaching 250, and it was "voting for a bomb" and many of the 1, if it happens to many films that do not belong to the group, have no special effects , or include non-color characters or the same. br /> <br /> It's a American film, but it's not a American film. Setting up more in Toronto cues is a trick, and other viewers can think it's put completely in the US just because the final competition is in the city of Detroit border. <br /> <br /> I loved music. I loved the dance (but I do not believe it has $ 50,000 ... but I know what). The characters were simple in the eyes. I agree with the next title. I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and they must have "s". (No, not foreign language). It is not a lot of hate on this film (and let's be honest, 1 vote means hate) so that I just think it is an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that's sad.
