Well ... easily my series of favorite television. I call a mobile phone call, but it includes violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs etc. at the festival and you have already been winning points in my book. Include all of this by doing something that promotes anything that you have ever seen on a small screen, adding the best-to-the-art movies and a lot of text that blows the mind (and a few speaks long) and you've found yourself a show that will be very good to compete with. <br /> <br /> Above all stand two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... like Gandolfini, she fits her roll in ways that words cannot describe, if you don't see her as tony yet see now! I can go on and on about each character in the show, psychological observation, focus on etc etc. but you can't stop me so all I can say is that this is just about show with Seinfeld, that I am capable to watch over again from beginning to end and end up enjoying even more.
