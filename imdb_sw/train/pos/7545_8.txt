I loved very much while reading the comments I was very worried ... But if a fan of anime I can fully understand this work of art though some of them were against my cultures and he believes. But hey, it's a world of art .. !! The beginning of the film is very powerful, wonderful and combining.it it is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the maker. Because a person who is very free can make a bad film. Not so much for children. Even though the characters are beautiful and interesting but they pass through other adventures that cannot be deleted (sorry if spelling is correct) from one reference.
