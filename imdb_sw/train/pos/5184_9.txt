Of course it is very interesting about the adult group (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven, and Diane Lane) who are invited to return one week to Tomawka camp, Ontario Canada and their former partner ( Alan Arkin). The author / director Mike Binder learned his experience in the camp as a great source of the formation of a gentle and accurate understanding. Also, the movie has a lot of funny time, some of which are very strange as I favorite, one involves using masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("Common Accused", "Three Kings") provides a film with some interesting shots of the Canadian Desert. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, the director of the "FACILITIES" and "Gifts", appears here as a man of the right hand of Arkin. Something more, this film assured me that the camp should not be a bloody site.
