Game Mating is a charming, beautiful movie since the past. Hollywood needs to consider the beautiful remake of this film. My wife and I would like to see. It is a good romantic comedy which my wife and I looked at AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall the best. Debbie Reynolds is good, as always. Love it. We plan on importing on DVD to add to our collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Bad movies didn't make movies like this again. Hey / .... it would hit great on silver screens, DVD, and on cable / SATTV. SN Austin, TX
