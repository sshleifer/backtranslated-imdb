I saw "The Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was scared, a good thing. I love horrible movies, and I liked this very much. There were many "amazing" events (what is the English word?) Which made you put on your seat. Although, a lot of noise from the audience made it difficult to laugh. I think the terrible event was ... on the bus, when the face shone and on the window, or when Yoko was walking without his protection. Preparation is also very good. Sometimes you see it there, but it would still look for the freedom of the area. The boy was so beautiful, so nice without make-up and so scary. Sometimes when I hear the noise of the lost I probably feel a good fear ...
