If you liked the Deep Cover, you might like this film too. Many parts of the poem called Fishburne say in the Basic Cover is from the "Once In Life," script for the play screen which Fishburne wrote. If you like Larry as I am, you will love all this film that is Larry, all of the fire, and all that has been hit. Of course there is a play for guns and the use of illegal substances, this is a movie of the gangster type, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even slightly on the flick side. <br /> <br /> AMAZING Movies ... dark, fear, sexy, and exciting. If you have emerged at night or do not sleep in the clubhouse, you will find the correct effect of reduced sets (speaking in the life of the life). Full of ties and difficult relationships, this film is tight ... every feeling appears in the set set and camera shots. GOOD WORK!
