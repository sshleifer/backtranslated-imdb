Kate Beckinsale is as good as not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this film, although I loved Gwyneth Paltrow in another version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale like Emma looks more attractive, almost, though. And I loved a woman who played Harriet Smith in this excellent film, too ... she had a good faith. There are some things I like best about the version of Gwyneth Paltrow, though, like how the humorous side looks more.
