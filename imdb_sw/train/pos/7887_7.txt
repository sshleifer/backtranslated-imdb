If your hard work on Freddy's film then you might not like it. This seems to be a spoof of a series of dreams. Not much to see here. The only reason to hold it is back to Freddy's story. One thing that is most suitable for dream movies is death events. But the death scenes were very crappy in this. The effects of seeing were great and acting was the same but the previous story was better. Freddy's story comes full circle in this. I have read negative comments for this but I really enjoyed this despite its many mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. Dream on Elm Address. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Dead Freddy: Last Fantasy. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Dream on Elm Street 4: Fantasy Teacher. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Dream on Elm Street 3: Warriors Dream. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Dream on Elm Street 5: Dream of a Dream. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Dream on Elm Street 2: Freddy Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend you like to enjoy the series. This is Freddy explained fully but that's all. On my list My Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
