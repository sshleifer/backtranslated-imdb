As his first masterpiece "Man of Elephant" Lynch confirms his defenders that he can tell the story straight, easy without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of a retired old man (named Richard Farnsworth) who decides to climb a tractor in a few countries to pay the last visit to his former guest who is now standing at the door of death. Positive results from the experts, the beautiful picture of rural life (the shots field of the grain field), and the hand of a good director who reveals humanity's basic humanity, is a good piece of life film. Its slow pace can convince other viewers to sleep, but those who live for the trip will be rewarded at the end of the end.
