I originally looked at the 8 simple rules at the Disney UK center for the first series and totally opposed it. While they did not show again the anger, but then abc 1 is full of a series of showings. I hope you continue to produce the most recent exhibitions even though I could watch every thousand times. Kaley couco is my popular character like Bridget of the air and also makes wonderful in Charmed. Rory is also good, shares my name with Grampa too. I will continue to explore it to the end until then I hope to continue as funny as ever
