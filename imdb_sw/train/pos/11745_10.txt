if you have the opportunity to see this film. it is quite surprising in part and it really makes you think about many important issues but not valid. In my opinion it is a piece of art ... beautifully published, beautiful music of many styles, the usual level of drama that someone has gone to expect from BBC Drama. Nathalie's media (so-called Press 'Natalie') confirms in his role as a depressed teen who is used by a male student. Celia Imrie has a good quality assurance which has a stability of sometimes unfavorable action and a viewer comforts to know that someone out there is 'normal', but a real star like always is Timothy Spall - it's certainly one of many actors of our time!
