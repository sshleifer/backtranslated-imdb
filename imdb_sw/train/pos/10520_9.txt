I saw this movie that Jane Austen was addicted to always hearing a doubt about the delivery of the cinematographic of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is just right, intelligent, delicate, attentive, sensible, polite, intense, word, perfect! "Emma" is one of the most beautiful and fantastic novels of Austen, thanks to the most interesting nature and characters. The movie honored the trick hiony craft, not ignoring the comic element (Miss Bates on all). What made me in the novel, and the movie makes it clear, is the detailed knowledge of human life shown by the English writer, and the modern look at which women, men, and their relationships are dealt with, and wondering if we think about how a woman's century 18, who lived close to the secret life, could appreciate the depth and truth about life as he did: that many and still be grateful to me. We can feel modern this movie in the movie: just take the place of clothing, and use more current languages ​​but the situation, emotions, ideas will be very modern. I think of the best interests in the lives of others, or the envy that dominates women's relationships, and is still a problem of revealing, and commenting on someone's feelings, especially love: every situation gets the world and out- the value of time. Posted by talented and gives a very good and very good performer: boy Gwyneth Paltrow is very good for this role (today maybe he would be very mature), Tone Colette is very good. And how I hated them for the wonderful clothes they wore! And then, a breathtaking English country, where every state gets magic as a direction ... an enjoyable and worthy movie.
