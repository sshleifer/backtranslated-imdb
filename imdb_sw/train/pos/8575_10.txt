This is a movie that I can look at again and never never despair, has a lot of laughter, guns, action, crime, good joints, and a good plot, and on top, Donald Sutherland in the role of comediki instead of Assasain. Tia Carerra looks like a fire as she can and can also do, Thomas Ian Griffin is good at this as a leading "Max" Agent DEA Diane is a FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV, playing bad man, "Livingston". The sides of the plot around Max and Diane are trying to catch Livingston when they are fighting with one another about who gets money for the organizations, giving a mixture of Assassain Sutherland, who is a very good one with one good liners, this is a full crime hat, there is a common story. love, but it played a lot differently than you would think of Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, the Italian Mafia, and the China Mafia here thrown into the mixture, the film being shot in Boston, where you have great shots, and locals, beautiful pictures and music in this film, this movie is a crime crime , it has everything that man would want. See Sutherland's toilet in a certain area, very unusual. This film is a riot and it will make you a real complicated 10 with me.
