This movie is not as bad as I heard it. It was fun, interesting and I love that which refers to the holiday season. It's quite me in the Christmas shop situation and listen to the music of the holiday. When this movie comes out of the DVD it will replace the Christmas Holiday in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanks to get thanks to the good state of the year. I heard that Ben's behavior was a few things but I think it only adds to the film and why it is so bad all the time. Take for what it is, the Christmas Comedy and lose love. I enjoyed it. No, it is not the Titanic and it will not make your heart lose in expectation but will bring it to a laugh or two. So go laugh and have a good time :)
