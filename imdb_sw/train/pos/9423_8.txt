I can't say if the comedies after the UK WWII produced in Ealing Studios are a delicious flavor or not, but I am quite old, and Man in White Suit is one of the best. There is no need to go to a conspicuous plot on the clothing industry and textile clothing and fiber, impaired. It deserves to say that the slings and arrows affected by naively Sidney Stratton in search of its vision of polymer makes for the comedic pleasure. Many of the most well-known world-renowned British actors - Cecil Parker's nervous, nervous Michael Gough, and Ernest Thesinger are very brave - they have made a good show. Guinness - as always and forever - it's beautiful, and Joan Greenwood is as beautiful as Daphne (just the way he informs the word "Daddy", makes the movie a whole value to see). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!!!"
