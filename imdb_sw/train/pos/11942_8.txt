At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how difficult he was when he looked for himself. At the same time the dead Joe defines the identity of the London tarot card. He reduces the Reaper and looks for US American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is in the mid-stage of the magic show of Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells him that the murderer is the pastor Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra pulls Sid into his investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is a murderer. However, he loves him and asks questions like Joe Strombel is correct in his logo. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great comedy Woody Allen out of Manhattan, really again in London. Its amazing and mysterious verses are so amazing, and I laughed very much with the fate of the hero in the country where people run "wrong side". Sid Waterman is very funny and Woody Allen is in the best shape as a player. However, his current museum Scarlett Johansson, whom I am a great fan, has more to do with the fury of many times, changing his cohesion to the statement of history. His character is deception and evil, and I was very disappointed with his performance (perhaps for the first time in his film). But this unusual comedy is still an entertaining and valuable entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop Big Scoop")
