My favorite movie in this film is that as Hitchcock films, it is an exciting thing that doesn't matter so much. <br /> Hitchcock understood that people might go to movies to have a good time. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is exciting, but it has a lot to laugh and always has one winking eye on the camera. Rachel McAdams is amazing as always. Cillian Murphy is a creepier than was in Batman Start. In the old days, there were boys who always played bad man. We don't see a lot of these days because I see a Hollywood agent sees it a bad job, but Cillian Murphy is very good to be bad. <br /> <br /> Lead is an amazing style. Stories are good but negotiations could use some lift. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a very enjoyable film and people were celebrating when fast loans started to spread. If you have a pleasant enjoyment, "Red Eye" can be your ticket.
