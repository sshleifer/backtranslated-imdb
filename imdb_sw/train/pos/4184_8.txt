Some of the films are successful where others do not, and that can be judged from different angles. The human way, one where you can feel the crude feelings (fear of being under attack, cooperation between soldiers, experimental people face into them during the fight, etc.). Movies like Das Boot and Midnight are two models of movies that you see relationship with characters in the film. This video is successful with that level as well. It says about "Higher Honor" and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they were polite and it was recognized in a totally unprecedented way to Western ideas, but it was the end of a true story of honor. Movie non-record. According to the true story.
