Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best film directors. That's certainly his best. It does not contain some of the most common features of what we call now film film. Even though the United States has been made, it is completely installed in the UK. You have no fighting. You have no fatale of women. It has no crime. Headline responds to the ad. He is so happy that he will be making money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up the day after the string in a terrible plan. Only a powerful person can live a terrible terrible problem. And Nina Foch gives the impression of a strong woman like Julia. Part of the excitement comes from forming against a variety: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. He is not shouting, a powerful victim. In fact it's a bit and generation, no matter what. This makes the problem of all his behavior possible. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the most interesting features is to make Dame May Witty. He was (and is) very popular with the elegant character of the head in the "Woman Goes out." He has a good and innocent way, a little. But here he is away from the heroine. George Macready is as good as his very heavy child. The whole release, in fact, is good. It seems that this popular and brilliant movie was released near the crash. Of course the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a small budget. That's fun and charm of the film film, the true film of black: It is small, influential under life, and, in this case, it is impossible.
