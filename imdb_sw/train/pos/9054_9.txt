"October Sky" is a film that will carry your heart, fill your mind with a clear picture, and lift your soul. Homer Hickham's story and his dream of creating a rocket seems to be very simple, especially when the film is put in the mining town, where the next time it is clear as a coal in the mine. But Homer can't follow the steps of his father. For Miss Riley's heart, (friendly teacher), members of her father's staff, and her friends, Homer tries to make her dream come true. Even in any true story for life, there are many who leave the way. Director Joe Johnston takes us to the coal mines, where we witness the severe problem of the miners standing under the rock bottom. With the bed hat and the bent position, they resembled the insectoids more visitors than the human in the dark. The hacking of the miners and the surfaced faces is a constant reference to the hazards that miners face their work. The image of the shaft of the mine shaft is a picture of Homer and a rock of his friend's rock. Under the blue sky bowl, missiles are placed on the pad and launched on the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the area when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. Yet what makes the film interesting is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a very powerful man ... but he also has a good side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is also obvious. Best, the film is not recommended. He does not close everything in a good bow. It sounds, lifts you. It continues to state the reality, which is important in the film like this. This video can be considered a full function. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want you to remove it. Then I found it ... that's a good film that makes a man. If it's done, you won't want it to be. And "October Sky" makes it just that.
