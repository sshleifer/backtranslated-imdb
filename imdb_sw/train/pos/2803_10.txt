As 2 times of Karina's Karina Karate, I love movies about sacrifice for games. But this film is closer. This movie is very good. I recently suffered from severe injuries and a severe lack of suffering. Welcome to the lights out to me. And this little senseless movie has touched me very much as if out of the mist reminded me of a life that should be high. This is a movie about living. Live your own life and respect others. Empowerment. God, blessings "Bend as Beckham" I believe it's a real gem.
