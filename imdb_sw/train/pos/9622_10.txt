I just watched this film on Showtime. Absolutely to accidentally. If I had only six hours of sleep for the last two days then I'd like to come home early from work. If I didn't get home early from work I couldn't see this film. I didn't realize what I lost, but I would lose a lot. <br /> <br /> That's the way this movie is. It's almost played on the impact of Kevin Bacon. That's a causality (so my verbiage above). Character ever interacts in some way. Steps, responses, interactions, interactive. This movie is very amazing. I will need to get a copy of the purchase.
