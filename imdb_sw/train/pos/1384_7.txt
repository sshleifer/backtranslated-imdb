Also known as "Water Water" this film tells the story of two girls when they fight their way in the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and which works very well. It provides a lot of time and opportunity to know different characters and grow somewhat. Using a small cast puts extra pressure on people playing as they all have more screen time than usual but people playing in this film hold it well. Everyone is completely trusted. The image layout is huge, especially underwater shots in the swimming pool increases the good effect. Most movies have been made about this subject though this is not quite good for any of them. It draws the "pressure" out of the big cap and works for them. It's not bad, not all, but it's really not big and I feel it would be good if it had taken some of the sky that was not found below. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimming
