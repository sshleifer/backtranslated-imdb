If you have a close and close relationship with the world of Tintin .... do it personally and look at this beautiful document about Hergé and her life to build Tintin. This is a brilliant and very cool production. The whole story of history about Hergé and people and too many situations that were shared with, for good and bad are wonderful. There is a very good and clear relationship between comic books and this only. I will definitely be in my Tintin album again. Also, the movie itself is well-defined and has a very good voice. I believe hope people will get this as amazing as I did!
