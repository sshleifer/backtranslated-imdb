Head boy tries to steal his brothers spirit from death but it only gets half of it and then he goes to the host to get another half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Certainly I don't know what's happening in this film which is full of fantastic pictures, surreal pictures that some parents can get sad, (for example, cat eliminates part of pigs who are traveling with them and deny as a bacon which all three). <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic film that some have compared Hello Kitty on acid, I think more like Hello Kitty as it was done with Dali. (Surely this is more alive than the Destino which was directly based on its work). If you are going to a highly filmed film that will challenge your challenge of things then see this film. Just be ready for other amazing images that will be used in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
