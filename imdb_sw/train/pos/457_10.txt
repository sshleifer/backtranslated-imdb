This program is very fun and the song is very interesting I can't remove my head. I see that as I get older I am attracted to the wrinklies who do things, and these four are the best in their efforts. Some of what they are doing is critically but wisely considering that nowadays and our PC world we will never do it in real life. I always learn something from the exhibition. But if you like secrets, concert, comedy, and a little careful work you will like to show this. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way and Barney Miller in another way they work and interact with them. They gave us a lot but they got a job, and that's what it is.
