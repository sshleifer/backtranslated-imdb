Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is an independent film. It follows its own spirit time, space, and character. There may be conspiracy, but what I understood and what I took from the notes on the Netflix DVD. In fact, it's probably better to know something about the film before watching it, because then the viewer can set aside any expectations. The film seeks that the viewer thinks, but also scoffs at the fact that he cannot get a full understanding. The human heart is a trouble of film. Each picture asks his role, his nature, and his form. The heart is an intruder, of the viewer and the Louis. Louis's behavior is played by Michel Subor and the peace and secrecy needed by the character. In fact, anyone could play with the character of Louis, if he had a willing heart, ready, and beauty. However the subor is one mentioned here; he becomes a film, his identity cannot turn from them. Many films of developing movies in my mind surround his words, sounds but especially physical. <br /> <br /> The Intruder is a poetic in its ability to capture the stability and perfection of movement, but more water than any of the books in the shape of refusing to take. "Amazing" has been a word that is used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasirealistic" is much longer. Nothing in the film is out of the possibility of reality; The simplest score proves that by meditating in music relationship between heart and light light. See the trailer a few times if you are attracted to visual images; see the film to see the result of a combination of line and hold freedom.
