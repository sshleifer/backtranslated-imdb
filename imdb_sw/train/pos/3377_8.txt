Soylent Green is a classic. I've been waiting for someone to do it again. They seem to be fixing the classic sci-fi these days (ie War of the Worlds) and I hope some director / producer will do again Soylent Green. For computer animation and technology today, it would be able to be a beautiful picture. Anti-Utopic films cannot be too far. Human reproduction generates as an unprotected rock to prevent it. We, as human beings, have the opportunity to put a brood on the reproductive nature if it comes out, but there is nothing to control human productivity except ourselves. With all diseases, war, abortion, birth birth, etc.. The community still increases as bacteria in the petri plate. Malthusian Economics says that any species, including humans, will increase their livelihoods. 6 billion to grow .... that's bad.
