This is a good example of what can be done on a small movie budget. Acting is best to consider the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. Gore is well and used less (see the best death of the wire) and the point is punchy when used. It is true that there are dodgy lines in the script sometimes, but compared to other movies on the same budget (or great!), It doesn't seem quite. In general, this is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
