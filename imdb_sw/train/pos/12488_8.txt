I'm not at all about horrible movies, and I'm interested in looking at everything. That does not mean that I intend to look at most of them, or that I will not accuse them. This movie is interesting, and is well done. In fact, I think this film could make two beautiful bills with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I have to mention, before I get my opinion, that I watched this only. I began to look before I went to bed, and I got 15 minutes before I realized that it was very effective, so I saved all that morning. Even when looking at it in the afternoon, it was still interesting. However, I can't prove how good it will be when looking at a large group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple move to a distant cabin as a way of trying to come up with words and death. Let me know this death - this is one of the most common movies that do not prevent the death of a child. This is more important, since it makes a voice, and it describes a lot of acting that is facing a film. They do not do well. The wife is away from the relationship, and the husband does what she can to try to bring him back. While some comments have complained about their acting - one special that they make more like a father and daughter than husband and wife, and that's legitimate. She is trying to give him more guidance. It is a responsibility that men take sometimes. There are various events in the film, and many are fairly non-violent, though they are in other ways. The story itself feels directly to many films, and takes an unusual dimension around the end. While that side is not strange, certainly not what you expected from the way things were going on. Moody, atmosphere, and very good for something that appears to be hit on the video.
