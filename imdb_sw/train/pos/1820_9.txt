I can remember this film since I was a little child, I loved it yet and I will do it now. I was able to find it on DVD on my 18th birthday and was very happy because I was very difficult to find it before and was only planned when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. Movies are full of songs and music. Animation is brilliant and characteristic is perfect. This movie has always been tears for me but I think that if I haven't seen movies when I was a little then I didn't want to be brilliant and amazing as I still though I still believe that I would still because I am really in animation movies.
