Michelle Rodriguez is an elaborate actor who can be the power of charge for other observers. He has the courage to put himself in the role of the most difficult friends in the early work of his (and wipe), which must be not recognized. Although his future films have emerged for the same role, this film was made with his difficulty. His / her character is a boyfriend / fighter / partner, struggling to overcome his immortal life in projects, which are a little intervention in the film ... but not for the girl. The feature of this film is not original, but the story goes deeper when the warm relationship that this girl should deal with and come up with her high temperatures takes. I / I 't see the actor taking a stance in the making of movies yet, and I'm glad that he gets the original peak in Hollywood. This movie got 7 from me because of the story of a young ghetto story, but it has a very good actor who shows a regular role in a small movie budget. Great job.
