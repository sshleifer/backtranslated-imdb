The question: What? How does the area come from an expert specialist area of ​​expertise Walther Mathau in the full system of Opportunity, Furious and Brilliant Old Man? Answer: quietly, gray, and in good time as George Burns does here. I don't know anything about Vaudeville but this remains the proposed film, two trends are hilarious, funny script, direction and very good enhancement. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a good man - trying to get Burns through the window etc. Even a small part is good. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting events, Matters banning commercial, Burns repeating its answers as senile ... <br /> <br /> fun. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrrr!
