Hope scores have been changed now due to my brilliant and amazing review which convinces you all to go and watch the film and create an instant chorus of "8" s, the true color of this film. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Before going to see this film I was not on top of it but now I am mixing at Chris Rock's web doors asking him to take me as his protein. This film is realistic, if you do not get this wonderful film you need a real cure and a hull that intends to all parts of the community including race (predictably), class divisions, love, wealth, jobs, dreams, comedy stand. The list continues. It was one desire for me however. This is that in entering this film I did not know that it was really a remake of "heaven could wait" another very good movie made in 1971 by Warren Beatty. So I was so surprised when I watched this film and suddenly the plot started to be the same as the old movie I watched on the TV a few weeks ago. Regardless of this movie is in my opinion the best version out of just two of them because of the various sites mentioned by the fact that Chris Rock is a funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any week of any year of any ... you can get a picture. Similar to the actual plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your own experience! Don't read the plot! Just go and watch the movie because there have been two reviews on the IMD so far that are angry about it, go to see because it's a funniest thing you would see for a long time, go and see because it is a movie experience that hasn't stopped you nauseum at the cost of movie tickets. Go see because it's a good movie!
