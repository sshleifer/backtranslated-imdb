Since seeing this film as a child, over 30 years ago, I have never been looking. From the opening events in the ivory factory, by the car of the car running from the back of the car, Ollie responding to the phone and knocking out the window with Stan, I think this was perhaps their last day film. After this they moved to Fox's 20th century, and when the films were not bad, they had no comic time for this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long hair, in her last appearance with the boys, showing whether the Doctor is good! quote: "I told goat milk" his answer to Stan to ask him how you beat the soul! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show! I would like to say both in one of my L & H. discussions.
