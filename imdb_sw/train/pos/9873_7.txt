Lily Mars, a young girl living in Indiana, dreaming of a great deal on Broadway and her prospects are offered when Broadway producers John Thornway returns to her home for a visit. Lily tries everything she can get Thornway to look at, but she just wants her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to prepare his show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway finally gives him a small chance in his next show, just like kindness to his family, however Thornway begins to fall for these young girls with romance flowers , which makes the leading woman, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets John-Lily romance causing friction and show, he leaves, and John decides to make Lily star. Isabel is coming back, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has joined her small role in play, which can also destroy romance. A very interesting film, with a pleasant change to see Garland put a sense of comedic in his role (read his Lady MacBeth, when he had to be humorous, never threatening his work of singing) I enjoyed the character of Heflin when Thorned and Lily instead of being romantic . The film had to be predictable and events did not mix well together, but the most enjoyable film. Testing, 7.
