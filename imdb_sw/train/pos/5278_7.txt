What begins as a generation of generations in this movie, concludes understanding, mission and grace. The movie meanders through Europe and the father and young child have decreased in the car more than 3000 miles. The lifetime of destruction, faith and life skills intervention. Surely there is no clear winner. It all adds to the end as an experience, experience of many layers of life. For those who want to understand Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle approach, without being pushy about the agenda. It is coming to the story of the age of the little child, its disregarding and vicious nature that turns out to more ways of life.
