This 370-minute movie was released by the Italian television public during the early seven years. Tells you the story of Homer's home of the Odysseus Journey after Troy's war. It is an epic story about the ancient civilization of Minoan and Mycenaean, told on the list 500 years after these events, around 1100 BC. It is a 1969 movie, so if you buy a DVD version you would see that the voice is just mono and no other language than Italian, even the closest details are Italian. It's compassionate. Most people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had a list of English titles. But if this is not a problem for you, than I recommend very much to watch this film.
