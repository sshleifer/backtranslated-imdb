I saw this film several weeks ago, and it has been a headache since my head. It is the two star letters of light in what is unfortunately a common document. To get a true story of Beales, I had to pass through all the DVD material and comments and search the web. Though Maysles and their fans (not mentioning Edith and Edie themselves) are disappointed in the view that this film is operating, this is exploitation for the truest sense of the word. Very little effort is to be made to describe Beales or how they got to the situation they had - the way of Maysles seems to be just going back to the camera and waiting Edith and Edie to say something wrong. Sounds, even on the opening of Criteri are poor and hard to follow. Although I am enjoying this film earlier in the history of the film's memory, it is amazing to compare the most distant series of Geraldo Rivera (!) On the sexual abuse of lost patients in the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island since the year of 1972, four years before Gray Gardens was beaten. To compare the review to New Yorker, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and the document was not one of them. <br /> <br> To Edith and Edie, something that I kept thinking when watching the film was "where hell is their family"? They were living in a dangerous, unhealthy, and safe environment. Is it that Jackie O, married to one of the richest people in the world (or a rich family of Bouvier) could not find Edith and Edie beautiful house? Or at least employ a temporary house or guardian to enter and watch both efforts? It is a shame and embarrassment to the whole family of Bouvier. Although these reviews may hear negative I would strongly recommend Gray Gardens for anyone who enjoys the document. Maybe one day someone will come and make a document about this document - bring back the rich (and after) of Beales and the whole passage of the Hamptons community in the 1970s.
