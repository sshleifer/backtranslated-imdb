PLANET is one of the best models of Hollywood SF films. His influence felt over a decade. However, other elements matching how this series of entertainment was planned for the mid-fifty audience that has now gone has spoken for a while, and sometimes the film is not recommended. But, the basic idea of ​​compelling the story involving the old Krell civilization, and the "leaders from Id" did not lose the appeal and continue to make this film a "must ione" movie. What I am very interested to say here is that the current DVD movie is awesome. The movie has never been considered good on home video and things are in great need to be restored. I hope that it will happen soon and we get a special version of this classic SF.
