It is easy to make general comments about this film. The fact that it is just one of the remaining Japanese films from this time causes people to say that "started the Japanese movie" and was "different from anything made in the west." At the end of these two comments are particularly false as Kinugasa himself admitted to remove "Caligari" for more than one event. But the style was meant to be followed, and does not remove the importance of this film. We have here is a theme and experimental experiments built on the already stylish styles, opening doors for real-time surveillance stories and real things. For this purpose, madhouse is a good environment, and the authors knew this. This is a popular film, and all efforts should be made to monitor. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 - It's important
