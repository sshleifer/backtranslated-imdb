As part of our 1950s vocabulary, we knew well Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc.. on the big show "Bonanza." It came on Saturday night and everyone had gone on television. This was a real show of family values. There may be a weekly crisis, but it was a strong family situation that drew everyone. Lorne Greene was the head of the family. His words showed wisdom. We were often left to ask ourselves that Ben Cartwright, a widow, must be a better husband than his poor wife of the dead. He had good children. Normally, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts came out of the show. The show was mine gold and Roberts devoted money when he left. His work has never been left as he was as a child of Cartwright. He should try to return to the series. Indeed he lost bonanza to stop.
