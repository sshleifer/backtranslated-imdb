In the city of Cowboy John Travolta who is one of the most powerful men of the dawn who has been shown on the big screen. He is a good child who leaves his parent's house and beat Dallas's capital where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to work in the petrochemical industry. In 1980 it started to increase in Texas and it was evident in the United States. Travolta is doing a good job by making us listeners to care about her behavior when it comes down is a sex pig. She meets to get married to Debra Winger, who is from the situation, but she has ideas that women should not be the shadow of their husbands. And when he strikes the cows of Gilley's cow, the player of the person, that's for him. Scott Glenn who is a former defendant working for Gilley and this film was his role to break. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets a Travolta goat for just looking and gets into Winger. Travolta in turn takes a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne who drives Gilley. In spite of the characters, in Cowboy town was really a very big business with the world's most reliable tons. Gilley is no longer in the Pasadena town of Texas, but the record continues. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the best country / western songs mentioned in the film. I don't know if some of these songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think why the Motion Photo Center has ignored the music of this film. I loved more than Johnny Lee's Looking For Love, if it was written specifically for this film, it's a shame that it was not chosen for Best Song. <br /> <br /> I loved Debra Winger's best character in this film. We do not lose feminine, but she stands to Travolta and does in fashion. And these adjustments have been dedicated to it still as an unknown woman who one day became the first cow-lover of the Bull Riders students.
