The "abandoned invaders" is one of the funniest movies, which have been seen. I don't know, why this film did not find the best critics, it is interesting, innocent and sweet. I looked at it first, when I was 11 years old, and I loved it ... 2 days later, I got VHS :-P To this day, I have shown many friends, and they all liked it, but no one knew the movie before. I think, that's a problem, almost no one knows, so almost no one can like ... this movie will never get a real place, that's sad, "SI" has really the ability to comedy as "Monsters Inc." Or "Spaceballs". Ok, enough anger - what I wanted to say, is that, if you want to laugh your head, look! Even if you can't be mad about it, it's worth checking! -> Prepare to laugh, the soil of the world!
