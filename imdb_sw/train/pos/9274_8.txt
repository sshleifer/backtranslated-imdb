Another amazing film from the country, where for decades of repression from the primary government, has no problem in creating a passionate interest. Panahi takes a different way at this time with a combination of wonderful and pleasant comedy, non-academic cast. While he still gets his message of what he sees as bad for his native country, he does so without the need for a heavy story. It is positive to take the country, especially its people, that the number of Iranian needs very much. Great mercy will not be given in. The Secretary of the Iranian government has said that a good manufacturer of the film is only successful outside the country because he is part of a global fraud scheme. After growing in the middle of the revolution and looking at professionals, artists and education 'disappeared' over the past 25 years she shows great courage in continuing to keep her work out there. The authenticity of the shooting at the real world cup of truth actually takes you to the event. The fact that he has 35mm is amazing is that many will only try this project using digital format. It looks amazing. His emphasis on using non-professional actors also works in this film. Good performances all around. After watching many of the films of Iran and the news media telling the truth, we can convince people and the government. This film has the opposite. It shows that they still love the same things as that by cutting themselves with the wonderful rules of sharia law which perhaps change better is not too far. Some call Panahi to be a female filmmaker but I think she is only a battle for the number of people being oppressed in Iran. Youth, free women.
