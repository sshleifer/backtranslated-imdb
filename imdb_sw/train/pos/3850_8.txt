This is the last Dutch film Paul Verhoeven made before making a standard Hollywood film "Basic Instinct," "Robocop," and "Total Remember," among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with the black spider to infect the prey on his web site before meeting Gerard Reve, a self-motivated writer and evil ideas. Gerard has been invited to be a guest attendant at the Book Books Book in the city of the seaside hour or more from Amsterdam. Verhoeven enables us to see how Gerard's ideas come true. When asked if the authors are close to dating he agrees when he reads the newspaper "and says" boom "I read" the penalty, "when it says 'flood' I read 'blood,' when it says 'red' I see 'dead.' immediately begins to believe; "I am telling the truth." He agrees to be a once-off guest of the club, a good owner of the salon. When she learns and learns that her husband is dead, she begins to think she is a 'black widow.' Is this more than his fact of being lost or is he a murderer? This is a psychological game and in describing which of these old films has focused on my memory, I thought it was my favorite sex. Looking at his body of work also seems to be Paul Verhoeven too, and he is a master in making us question our understanding of the truth. It is a good change of speed from the usual mobile price. I saw it in 1983 and is a film that has "been stuck."
