I first noticed the thief as a child that makes it almost as old as Jinn think. As any child would be, I was happy with the ideas, creativity and the power of the film. A few years later, I realized how much satire and wit of the script I missed on that first glance. I have never had the opportunity to look at it in any age. In addition to the script, production eliminates fantasy genre. This is Korda, the author of the story very best. When you see a thief like a child you know that you have had a good time. When you see a thief as an adult you know that you have seen a jewel. It doesn't matter if the story is involved. Amazing work. Thomas / McCarthy
