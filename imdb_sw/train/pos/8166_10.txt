This movie is very good! Acting is good, with good casting for Corbin Bernsen as a perfect dentist who runs and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife and man, and then goes things. He also takes revenge on his wife and man, as well as the sick he inflicts. More specific effects are also positive, although some are really fake (like lost language, laid out for 1 night out, and still red in the morning). But incidents of torture are done well. Although this film has a weak action which is very slow; among the heaviest parts is sometimes the most ignored parts. But with real sense / fan-fan this must-look!
