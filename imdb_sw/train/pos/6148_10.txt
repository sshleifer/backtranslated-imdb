KILLING DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) As I watched this film for the first time I was 4 years old and was fascinated by this story of witches in World War 2. The area, which insisted me further, was a war between Nazi soldiers and the central army. It was strange to see this army without walking to the body to fight with their singing. This movie is wonderful, from the trip to Portobello Road (which was to me the most favorable place of London) to go to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a wonderful couple. She is very beautiful, apparently a family of David and David with all her amazing face is a good protagonist. we'll miss a lot.
