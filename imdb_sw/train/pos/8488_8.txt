I just need to give my two cents. Rest, it's comedy. It is for the most part that characters are written and acted. I can't imagine many comedies where they are not. This is not a new release, located on video and air on the cable almost every week. Will I see it on the playground? Indeed, I did, when it first came out. It's funny ... which should be enough. Even if I didn't like it yet I would like to look at the cable for Michael Keaton. He is the lowest and accepted actor. I can't imagine someone else who has the most ability in all kinds. And I can't think of someone who has succeeded. Comedic actor who is also a star of action (short lived but still), who is also a romantic guide, who is also an amazing actor; host and hero. I can't imagine any, at least not on Hollywood. Certainly no one has succeeded in all these types. I mean there is Tom Cruise but for me it is better that Tom Cruise than that character. However this is not about Michael Keaton against Tom Cruise so I will continue. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho should hire, gives you the purchase value since you can probably find it at $ 10.00 or less at the shops like Wal-Mart. It's worth looking at the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). It is one of those fun to watch movies. You can keep your brain pause, and just relax, and chuckle away. <br /> <br /> Asking more, in my opinion, is really asking.
