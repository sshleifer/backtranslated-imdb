I bought this game on eBay I heard that it was the same game for scholars. Gameplay is very realistic, and is very addictive. When I used it several times, I came back on eBay and bought a copy for all my children so they could join fun too .... I played this game in one way and story story makes you feel like you are actually on the film, it's brilliant. If you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the background of the storyline obstacle in one player game, just set up a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do with the app included) and play for your heart content. There are still a lot of Freelancer servers on the web, so many players have no problem and not all threatening, because they say other players unless you want. So go get a copy of this game, learn by playing one player's game, then start the online presence and enjoy it. Playing this game is amazing, and large systems to explore and lose to get, with all sorts of other discoveries - hidden planets, ulcers, hidden grounds, the list is almost endless. Wonderful game and especially if you can get for several quid on eBay. Get one with a full text guide if you can (a blue box, not a red box of Xplosiv), is the best load!
