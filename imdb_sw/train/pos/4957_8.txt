INFORMATION 10 or LIL was made in two weeks on the budget cuts by author / director Brad Silberling, only a small film made on Carson, CA which feels like the whole story was done ... in good sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate to play former former Morgan Morgan Freeman performers, among his major projects, and Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a conversation between two people from different vantages who can strengthen another's life. Morgan Freeman appears himself - but part of the comedy is that he is shown as an actor who has been out of work for four years, looking at the scene for a small filing film to come back to the flow of things. 'His role' is that of the market manager and he has been reduced to the seed market in Carson where it meets, among others, a single Scarlet, a girl in line 10 or a few of Checkout. Not only that Scarlet is tired of his static work, he is also generally angry about her hateful husband (Bobby Cannavale), now sleeping with a lazy employee Scarlet (Anne Dudek), and his lack of ability to find a good job elsewhere. The two partners after a number of problems have been involved with them, they go to a 'road trip' which causes each of the characters to grow due to the presence and story of another's life. <br /> <br /> It is a simple story, just told, but because of the tender relationship between Freeman and Paz works very well. This is one of those small films about human relationships where the possibility of change and exchange is a message. It is good to watch, and this is a DVD that has touchings, information, and comic - pleasure to see. Grady Harp
