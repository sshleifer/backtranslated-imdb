First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take a lot of movies you will see that the characters have this time when it's okay. Her character in this movie is far beyond each one so far ... and counting. The story begins in the future (not far away) where a man is sent in the past to get the source of the virus that has taken many people from the face of the earth. Stories seem to go towards SF but I think it's close to the game because of the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Films are slow and slow in some points and develop further towards the end than at the beginning but as you see this film you will be aware of this regular rhythm of the story and reveal the truth that does not accelerate or decrease. It's one speed and one that flows gently and beautiful. But that does not mean that the last line draws your nerves, causing good reason. In addition to ongoing trends, it is the administrator. Such films are easily damaged by bad leadership but this has been better. So, if you are preparing to see a movie of Sci-Fi or some point, you will get lost. B There must be more movies like this.
