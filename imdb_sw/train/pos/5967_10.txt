Sammi, the curr god of iron rocks, tried to stop him, tried to forbid him, tried to examine his music! (such as the real life Dee Snider, from the beaten sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) was killed by fire, Sammi Cure thought to play on Halloween in her old dance school for dance. Now Eddie Weinbauer, Fan 1, and the only one knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or did?) Nuke, dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives only a copy of Sammi Eddie's final record. But when Eddie tries to play the record back , he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead, and tells him what to do to get back to attackers in his school who hate him and his music. Everything works until Sammi begins to kill !! The mainstream and you must see for fans of heavy hair hair, and a loud voice and Fastway, and only if you don't know what songs seem like or know Fastway and don't like them, change them there a little bit and there is also a style like sound like Cinderella more known, or Ratt. The movie is a real movie of fear? Well that depends on what you call the movie of fear, to me the movie of real fear is a slasher, with lots of killings, or it's just plain scary. This movie is not, not enough deaths, but can not be called work, comedy, celebration , doubts, or exciting, therefore that's the reason I think it should be scared. So if you want to "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' midnight steel soul !!" There was Sammi Curr and Trick or treat it for you. I mean "what you fear? It's Rock 'N' Roll just !!!"
