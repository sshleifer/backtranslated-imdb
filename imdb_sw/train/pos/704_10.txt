This film, as small as possible, is one of the most exciting psychological experiences I have ever seen. If you agree that it is a low budget from the beginning, you can know how good the story is, how well it is written script, and how a movie player can produce something very wonderful for a very little money. > <br /> All the elements of the popular film here. The tests, though they were hit on the digital, were good in areas. The strange, interesting view of the film is taken particularly in the area with the dog talking, the scene was just amazing. It is such a work of trippy, but it has not been done in an active way, and because I respect this film very much. It comes highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and interesting, and unlike many of the most repetitious films.
