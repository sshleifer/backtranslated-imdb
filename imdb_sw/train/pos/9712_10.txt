Another review likened this cross group between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also accurately. However, some reviews have described the difference between the comedy we enjoy the comedy and black, also should take into account. See the whole thing, all three series. In the end, all the characters are locked and pieces of the puzzle are holding a place like the Douglas Adams novel. Definition and solution are amazing. Especially after modernization. Evil, and surprising. Not for children. It is not for those with thin skin or who have no goals. Stimulate ideas. Once real, typical, and surreal in terrifying ways. The blackest comedy I can remember. It is very likely the most wonderful thing I will see.
