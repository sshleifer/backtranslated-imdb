Japanese Indian film and humor and philosophy in which three main characters run almost completely through the entire film, being taken because of a strange and unfortunate situation. When they are running, we see what is going on in their minds and where they are now. Running is an example of this life of the people. In some way, what they are stirring is not what they were dismissing, but in their lives and avoiding their personal problems and dreams that are broken. Running makes them all feel real. Great planning of life when you are in the middle of something big, cruel, and sad that is funny in a wise way. One of my films that are always popular with the Sabu's director.
