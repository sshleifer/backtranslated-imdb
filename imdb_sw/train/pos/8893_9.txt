The 60 is a good mini-mini between historical truth and good plot. In four births, we follow the North American family, with 3 members. But we don't just see. We also follow the story of several characters as a black pastor, leader of the competitor, student and Vietnam soldiers. The film is just amazing. In the first chapters, we see some shots of Vietnam war, in the middle of events. Next chapter, it does not start where the end ends, it starts time after, giving a little secret about what happened. In general, the 60-day series, you must see, not just for hippies fighters, but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic.
