When it's up and for many do not know, that day now. In this last film for the story actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a wonderful attraction. Many films and environmentalists believe this is our last history. The film is taken from a novel titled, 'Make a chance, make a chance' but who did the head work changed to "Solent Green". The story refers to the Earth as it changes in the future and the environmental problems of the world become a minority of destruction. The natural resources of the planet are exhausted and the basic food has been reduced by a simple crop. They come in various colors, such as Solent Yellow, Red Solent, and now 'Solent Green'. However there are those who know the 'true' link in the Green Solution and are responsible for their own crimes and fear of God's payment. The first is the food manager named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). On his death, a volunteer police investigator named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) is really trying after his own suicide. Although bribes go up, it starts with Simonsons' Bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Head of Donnovan Head (Roy Jenson) who seeks Thorn for the Disposal Factory. Thorn Lord, Lt Pastor (Brock Peters) believes his suspicion but warns of those 'Top and Fire' who want the case closed, but Thorn will not be a threat to "Employment" in an easy way. What Thorn gets a mark of death, but as a film, awaits the final warning. ****
