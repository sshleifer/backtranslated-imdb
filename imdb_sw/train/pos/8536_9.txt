I recently got a chance to watch "Water Water", and love it completely. I don't know why it is called if there is no rhythm going on there, except maybe by playing on the strip of clubs near the end. We are described by the main characters in the same movie, not recommended in the hospital. The story shows the love of a strong physical man with a healthy woman, which is a very good story. Unfortunately, you can't see such movies today. I am not "stuck during the war", I did not say that everything during the 80's and early 90s was much better than today, but I think the film industry is growing and there is a lot we can learn from old movies and old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998.
