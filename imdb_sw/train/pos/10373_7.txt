The Spirogolou family (Toby Malone) know that it is a talented player, and he is happy when he takes the pressure to join a big club. They expect that when he comes to the city, his cousin will look for him. But the cousin is like a chalk and cheese: one of the young man of the vineyard, the other is a road player who has been able to get mixed up with drug dealers and groups. Mat is possible to have a quiet evening before his big day. Having missed her cousin George (Damien Robertson) when she arrived in the city, Mat meets with the trouble when a young biker takes her on a journey more than one. Toby Malone, probably known for his work in the theater, puts good performance as a young boy. There are minimal budget signals, but as with most low budget movies there is much more fun, more visible, and more charm, than seen in the typical Hollywood blockbuster.
