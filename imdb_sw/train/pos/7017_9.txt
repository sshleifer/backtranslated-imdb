Do you spend more than this two-hour film you wonder "what is the story about leadership behavior?" Will / Smith, as the bottom key "Ben Thomas" will make you come. The end of 20-25 minutes is when you get, and it's a shocker .... but you knew something big would be revealed. Until then, Smith, he has fun, near people who refuse. You know he has a good reason to do that, but it is not explained, again, to put us to the end. <br /> <br /> All of this, including again / stopping but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") may make other viewers anxious or want to leave this film ... but not because The last part of the long incorporates all the pieces of this puzzle. This is a two-hour film and not the eyes of the eyes of Will Smith. In fact, the scary feature can see the sad, sad face of Smith in this story. It almost doesn't look like he in several shots. He seems to have lost weight and is sick. Smith is doing a good job that shows someone who is very sad. <br /> <br /> As a good film often makes, this film will stop thinking long after the last credit.
