Kurosawa presents a story that deals with the characters as different from any Shakespearean ceremony, and acting is true to the story, and each star plays its role as part of a great story. It's touching, exciting and exciting in all places. The development of behavior is approaching completeness, the movie is clear and relevant, and the story is inviting you. I would like to say that "Samurai freaks" and those dynastic focus on the 18th and 19th century Japanese stories can make this film not the best works of Kurosawa. Maybe it's not the best, but even for its worst Kurosawa is better than most of the best. This story depends on raising the normal life of ordinary people during a major change, that is timeless, despite setting in a distant distance. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this heart to any buff of the movie, and especially for those who are likely to continue reading the novel which the film is based on.
