In fact, Tenko is undoubtedly better than the TV show at any time, exhibition, lead, throw, doubts, drama ..... everything is fantastic about it. Even though the show collapsed later later in its last season, this last movie took a fiber well and it became a good story for fans of show and newbies. I can't recommend this film more, get it and watch it. But I advise to look at the first series, as the first 2 season is better than this amazing film. It is clear (10/10)
