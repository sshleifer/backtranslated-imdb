I didn't see BSG, I tried to look at it right in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it. However, I saw the Rebirth of Caprica yesterday I felt a little lost, so I decided to look at Pilot today and I must say I was very happy. I think this is a reliable show and just one side on me is that I now want to look at BSG too. But what I liked most is that I don't need to be hardcore BSG fan to understand what's going on in Caprica. From what I had read on the net, they were trying to reach the number of women since BSG reached more than a male way, and at least in my case it worked. However, I advise that if you are dealing with it to watch the festival to do so from the start of the trial and experiment.
