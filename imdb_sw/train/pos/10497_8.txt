I just thought it was better and I still did it. I am grateful yet we can see different things from what Hollywood is approaching. The Grace Salvation is wise and enjoyable - those who feel something of marijuana better go to see the American movie film. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a wonderful movie does not have to be stupid. I laughed my donkey during most of the time but also pondered questions about what the woman's behavior was required to pay for her husband's debt. In short - the story of magic and common English humor and acting good and leading. You can't ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
