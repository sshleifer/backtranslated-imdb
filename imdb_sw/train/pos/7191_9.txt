Reed Hadley makes Don Diego better than Zorro's performer and tell him, but that's close to action because this serial shows the song of the bar-no better of any serial, ever - and the best of the most famous Yakima Canutt hitting stream. There are some good stunts, and a lot of steps, and a lot of hair-raising cliff-hanger issue end, but if for no other reason, you must see this film to watch stunt stagecoach, then look again in slow motion. It's amazing, and, despite the low budget to play this chapter, Yak returns better to take a stunt here than he did in the most popular festive film "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: This is a real deal!
