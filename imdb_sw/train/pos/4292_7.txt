He did not know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was "no expectations" that helped me to endure first and later as much as I expected. <br /> <br /> The layout was awesome, amazing but interesting. The storyline had shortcomings / jump that I think it blows the audience off a bit. No loud voice sounds backward, creating a "romantic" motion. But they were all meaningless. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Emma and Luis was very good. There was an unusual chemistry that cannot resist; I loved it and here I am, writing this comment. The trick love shown by two actors was very good, and I believe, that's the basis of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a romantic comedy every day; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit at a time and then slowly began to understand the little things I didn't get first. I can't guarantee everyone will, but I hope you do.
