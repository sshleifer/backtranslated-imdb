I thought it was one of the best sequels I saw in time. Sometimes I felt like I would just want someone to die, Stanley was killed and desperate people were brilliant. It was a very good movie that you enjoyed at that time and so you died. My only problem was that it was like someone with a home camera was photographed and it was wonderful. Judd Nelson is good, at least in my opinion and was better in the role as Stanley Caldwell. A brilliant film.
