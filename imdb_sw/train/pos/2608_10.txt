Roseanne's last season was a basketball trip. This last session is doing what the original opinion says, tells us that as we thought we know the characters we didn't. Roseanne reaches back to one season, and tells us that this show has been her scope of her life. He says in this last period that he changed events and people as he deserves. Scott did not have Leon, but was there. Mark and David married married to him in a real life, and Dan died when he made him alive. As events that happened in his life, he changed in his writing. Not all of us want to do that. Do we all have time for the time we want we will only use the eraser and change it to our will. This is what he did for the whole part. And in other opinion I will say that I do not feel, the family was real in my mind, he just changed how events occurred in their lives. An + ends with A + show !!!!
