Recap: The morning after his bachelor's association Paul is recommended by his mother-in-law and he knows that there is a woman lying next to him. Unfortunately her waitress from the bar, and not her fianc√©e. And suddenly she turns everywhere ... booth booth on the free street and for her mother-in-law dinner. And it is difficult to keep secret when his former lover of jealousy followed him and photographed. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about to live. <br /> <br /> Feedback: In fact it's better than expected. It's not a romantic romantic comedy I expected, but something of funnier, something with a little edge. This movie was not afraid to take a little bit more joke. And Jason Lee does how to give girls, especially when his behavior is half-frightened and very difficult, as it is here. And she got good support from beautiful women Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And I really thought Lochlyn Munro made a good place like the old. <br /> Therefore, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the final result was good. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
