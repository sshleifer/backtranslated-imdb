This is a film that the usual market will probably not reach if it should not be easy to view the viewer. A story about the pastor who is concerned with his friend Heaton is not a Friday night film but still has its own special edge and I have found it to be fun. There is a time of caution because the film was hit on a low budget, such as a spike aerosol. However I had no real knowledge of the relationship between Spike and Heaton and being honest to make me use many films to try to work. And I also did not like the fact that most of the films are used by two friends to talk and not "very much". It's a small film that is hard to watch and that's what makes it interesting.
