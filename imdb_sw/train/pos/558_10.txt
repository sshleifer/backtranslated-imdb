The casual player / action of the west and the amazing movies that are well before time (1954). Production is very good and you can explain that it was done with pride and love. The only specialty in North America's WEST pioneers is very educated and entertaining. and somewhat misled / degraded as many developed countries today. The step-by-step can be more realistic though still, this movie needs particularly important things. with a sense of history and philosophy .......
