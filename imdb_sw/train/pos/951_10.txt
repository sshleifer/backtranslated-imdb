I know many people are very happy with the Alistair Sim version of Dickens's story, but for me, this 1984 edition is one of the beat. My wife and I have a copy of this film on VHS, and we look at it together every Christmas day. I often say that we can look at Halloween too, because it is a story of a wonderful spirit. <br /> <br /> Scott - a model like Scrooge - means a lot and it's bad, making all its miraculous changes and moving. I think it's up there with his performance at Patton. All spirits are effective, everyone who has a creepier than the end. Look at the dark, rotating atmosphere of the Christmas Spirit, yet it comes to send down my spine every year. And what help help! David Warner, in particular, is in a high position like Bob Cratchit, such as Susannah York as his wife. I have found to remember that this version is closer to the original story than many others - but I can be wrong, as it was several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a classic classic Christmas.
