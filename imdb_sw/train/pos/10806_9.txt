I heard this film - around. I am very pleased with Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a common mix of Aussie's gentle approach, with an excellent and very durable amount. He loved the movies and trends. The play was the same and almost all the characters' performances were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Gosh, did not have Russell's talent even in 1993 to shine! .. and still haven't seen Gladiator.
