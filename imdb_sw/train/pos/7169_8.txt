Typically, the "children's" films tend to have a good quality that also makes a way to sappy and failure of more than 13 people. But again, that's before Holes hit the area. Indeed, it has a very long time that often gives children the quality of the quality shown earlier, but this film has a good job to stay away from these gatherings. Acting was an honor, and the dynamic dynamics that Stanley had had and some of the other groups were more realistic than what most movies had to do. I really liked this film is the fact that this film does not attempt to break your heart or cry. The emotional power was more natural than many thought, such as Shawshank's deliverance in many ways (which Holon is similar to redemption). Just below? Hokey watches tears. In general, however, 8/10.
