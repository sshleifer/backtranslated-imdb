At the first of its information, Denzel Washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very complex story and brings it to the screen for the trust we have been looking for from the efforts of Washington's efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. We have recently seen some of the negative consequences of children who have fallen through public protection cracks. This story says about the existence of a dream that leaves the scars of horror but shows the victory of the human soul to the end. We can choose some of the first attempts and many ups and not better to edit these events but the simplicity of other events that provide such power that cannot be reduced. If the academy is watching this film will be the following. This movie is not suitable for a punch and it goes to a difficult hard case of stories and cleanliness which is usually not recommended from novel to screens. This, of course, is a tax for the Director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy so go going to see and tell your friends to go see too!
