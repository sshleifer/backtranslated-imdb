Mr. Bhandarkar gave all raw. But the best part has not forgotten to give links. It has come with a spectacular viewer and is the audience to make a choice now. It is a revelation of the reality of nakedness regardless of the illusion associated with it. Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and enjoys his work. A simple and peaceful life is with a caring young man with a good roommate. Addressing the Page of the Man (Celebrity) of the Nation Today, where he has a very helpful editor for Deepak Suri (Boman Irani.) But life takes his side as he strikes early and pulls away from a little crime. Omigosh! the whole new world was waiting for him there. Surprised, excited, surprised by revelation. His experience has led to loss of work. At the end she returns to page 3. Now when she meets anyone who likes to the celebration, she knows the exact appearance of each other, hidden under an imaginary face. <br /> <br /> The movie has a message and is odd. The audience should find their own color. Theme and screenplay was amazing. There are some very good ideas to be used to organize viewers. As a foreplay club is shown in front of the pedophiliac exhibition, a temporary suspicion before gay acts in the bathroom. Conversations are powerful and executives are very good to open them. The 2 words of Charu Mohanty talk a lot and they are very successful in giving these two terms and skills, contributing to the impact. The selection would have been better. The songs did not stop anywhere; but they needed back. Atul Kulkarni has a small role with great impact. There were several errors. Atul Kulkarni explaining Konkan Sharma to be honest should be identified with the mind. There may be a better conversation if this looks like preaching. The meeting between Thapar and his daughter does not act. The situation seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a compulsory movie to watch and selected options before the event of pedophilia. That can damage your feelings.
