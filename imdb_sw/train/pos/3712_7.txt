Robert Altman should not make this film like this, but the fact that he did- and that seems to be very good and tightly-wound thriller in the traditional jadibackback-Grisham exciting- shows the versatility which is proposed. In Gingerbread Man he actually works with something that, unfortunately, he is always not very successful, or at least not the first thing on his list as director: plot. There is one of its big sunny water fields where a ignorant lawyer finds a very young woman and then a woman with a good relationship that the woman is connected and enters their lives in amazing ways, losing and conspiracy occurs, yada. And it's amazing that Altman wants to take one of these "I saw that come back behind!" The rest, or just the usual normal event. But it is a surprise that pays for because, enough, Altman can get some very good behavior, or maybe he can do without pretending to coax out of a well-cast cast, of a small town Village environment. The film goes with the atmosphere (if not the most of modern crafts, sometimes it's good and sometimes very good for Altman), since Savannah is likely to go hit by a great disaster and rain and dams and rain puts things with muggy and humid. . So the atmosphere is powerful, but it is also an exhibition from (sometimes) of hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as a 'woman' whose lawyer Branaugh gets, and Robert Downey Jr (when does he not * good?) As a private detective in use Branaugh. What? I have rejected Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of the screen makes the same impression of the wrong image? As described, some of the conspiracy is very weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is denied, war-offs, unwanted children and deserving children), but at the same time I think Altman saw something more attractive in material, more darker than the other Grisham functions that have somehow. If it is not quite proficient, it still operates on its limited terms as a secret-coming-next-secret-black.
