You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, an American secret soldier who has been sent to cancel the secret of Nazi and turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from the closure of the Nazi shaft to prevent the war machine of Hitler and even Fuhrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is the most likely game of its time. That is because it is affected by lies. Many games were available at this time and even more today, but often they get a real trap. This is one of them. Just like the Tetris before it and the most recent GTA III in 2002. Yes, the penalty is better almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world that led to one of the great gaming games were hit by B.J Blazkowicz. Marine's Space, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and other forces should exist for boys in ID. If directly or, often, correctly, but still do. <br /> <br /> Even with his old look, very old pictures, super simple gameplay (this is a real game, games are now on the "experience" level ") and very rectangular levels, the scope of all six scenarios discovering these secrets for treasure and chaingun in them. Also: "Put!" * bang! bang! bang! * "AARRGHGH !!!" never grow. --- 8/10 <br /> <br / > It is very different when compared to what games today.
