I recently had the pleasure of seeing bad swimming for Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say it is the best film that I have seen throughout the year and the only film I have ever inspired inspired to comment / review. This film was guided by beauty and has included a script and a realistic conversation, a better acting, and a stirring message. Normal life comes together in an adult swimming class and is a wonder in the life diversity of life. This is clearly shown with the picture in the first minute of this fascinating film that we see only the feet and torso of individuals in different shapes and sizes into the pool of water. This film is explicitly displayed as administrators are placed and placed in attractive images, which focus on your thoughts and ideas.
