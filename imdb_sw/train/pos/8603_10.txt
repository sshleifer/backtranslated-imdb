The movie is fantasy. The story line is narrower but it serves as a composition of some amazing songs singing and singing. (I still can't believe that interesting and attractive people can sing this well.) Some of the conversations are very strange. These things made me feel like I was watching the show of the top fashion from 1942. Movies are designed to serve various purposes. This is designed to attract and certainly does not. If I have one negative view that Nelson Eddy was too old to have a good vote. Some buttons made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing beautiful. However, Jeanette MacDonald was such as amazing. He makes an impressive angel. <br /> <br /> This type is well before my time, and I am new to Jeanette MacDonald's / Nelson Eddy's films and related conversations. Music in this film is good. As I like traditional rock music filling many modern movies, there is no question in my mind that this music is simple and completely memorable, more interesting, better. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see on today's movies. With Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of plastic surgery Beverly Hills, it was more beautiful than the stars I saw today. I don't know why many other banners say it is fun to love this film and generally for this movie. They say it's dated and try to explain why it is so. And those who do not like to say it is not very good but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly be still entertaining people when many movies are long forgotten. There is a very good quality for every way in this film so it should not be remembered and enjoy. I recommend this movie without a reservation for anyone who loves great talent, great beauty and good music.
