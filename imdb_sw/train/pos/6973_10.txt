BSG is one of the best of my TV all the time. I was lucky to start watching it as the series came to the last season. It was a marathon from beginning to end for me and it was a wonderful journey! Once I saw an attempt at Hulu I knew exactly what I was just for - Caprica! However, some things do not add when you compare the entire series are still done well. There is no mention of the men of the hall in Battlestar Galactica or mentioned to the ordinary world but perhaps I have never been so much in their series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the world, technology, and alternative fantasies of our world. Show this is very interesting and you will want to look more!
