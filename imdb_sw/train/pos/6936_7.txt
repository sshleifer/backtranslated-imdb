Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics to restore the West after WWII. Director Anthony Mann must have a large loan in its best direction. Jimmy Stewart is doing a good job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire stealing the film with their pictures of the two bad guys involved in the top game of the poker stack and Winchester Treasure 73 go to the winner. This is a good script with several developing stories at the same time. See the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, with a few years, we will begin to allow the Indians to play in western films. The film is black and white and shot at Tucson Arizona. I can't put Winchester 73 in Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but gets high recommendations from me. <br /> <br />.
