David Duchovny is responsible for leading this film. For many people when they know the truth there will be no concern to investigate it. Nor did the right to say little. David made his name on x files and is a good actor. Dr Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a pharmacist who was beaten by fraud. For a serious accident he becomes a private doctor to a criminal owner Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie is thrown into the role of support-group groups. He puts in a stable performance. Timothy Hutton play Blossom is good and very self-jewelry in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people think and at the end I would like his level of reliable performance.
