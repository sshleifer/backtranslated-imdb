I saw the last half of this film about a year ago and I was delighted to get the document on DVD. Recently, I have looked at several real series on PBS about running, etc.. Not one of them was about to tell stories like this film does. Depending on the REAL situation, without the restrictions, positive, happy, pain and brightness, this is a movie that should be shown to students or anyone who wants to live early. Good work for the Rip Torn section and Conchata Ferrell add on the script properly. The opening loan says that it was made even though the funds provided through the National Capacity for Human Rights. If this is a type of tax item it can go for I would like to see more. I highly recommend it and I encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen and enjoy the film.
