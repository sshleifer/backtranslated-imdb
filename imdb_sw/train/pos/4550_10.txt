Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor. Snob aristocratic English in A Room For View, passionate Irish thief in the Name of the Father, pastor of pride, bright in the Gangs of New York (in ten-fold performance than Adrian Brody in Pianist) and as Cristy outrageous Brown with brain cuts My left leg (just a few name). All its roles affect eachother, but each is different, and quite unique. He changes completely, and every character goes on. And I begin to believe that he can act like anything. Anything. <br /> <br /> Like Cristy Brown she is stunning. He did not behave, and they have no compassion for the character. Hard success. And Cristy Brown is coming. Good man. An angry person. Human. <br /> <br /> This movie, in spite of the serious misconduct changes and so on, is inspiring. Yes, it is predictable. But is it so foolish? No. I cut it. I cried. Not one time cheese. Proof that this is not a movie of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My favorite place is a place in a restaurant, while Cristy is talking about color writers and Eileen, Peter and his friends. Here is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches its climax. "I will stir you in the only part of your anatomy that has lived." "Wheel out of disability!" And its performance does not deteriorate, it cannot be lost, and it is good. Just. He has a lot of time screens here. I look again, and I've never been tired of the eyes of Cristy's eyes, talks and intestines. <br /> <br /> You must see. Fo sho, yo!
