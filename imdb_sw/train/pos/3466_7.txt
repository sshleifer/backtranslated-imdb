this was a real pleasure of guilt ... I saw the trailer and all the advertising, so I thought 'why don't you watch this vh1 film?' and, as they said in.m., 'I can't believe I look at everything!' quinn and harris were reliable boys, and, though the inspiration was over and it was difficult to wipe it sometimes, I found that the discussion is also believed. The film touched the good relationship of len / mc and showed how, at the bottom, they were just two boys who were close together and shared passion for music - coming to them, though, with different sets of issues and personal needs. you find yourself wanting to get into the cab to make an impromptu cooperation that would make the world socks away, but also get more thanks for what they did not do
