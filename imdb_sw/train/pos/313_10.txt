I am an American black and I have loved this soap opera. I looked at it in Spanish in Telemundo, about 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story about a black slave who loves something and a white commander led by his leadership and candidate, a way to live. He took what he had, nothing, and saw his possibilities. Many would say that he sold himself - but he was trying to find his secrets and his future children. <br /> <br /> It was a very good opera soap, that I thought it would be released on the DVD, but not given. This soap opera was the best opera of soap. We need it to be given on DVD or advertisement on TV again. It is played on the American Aztec right now, which is only available in Mexico or the US for a paid cable. We need to be redirected to Telemundo.
