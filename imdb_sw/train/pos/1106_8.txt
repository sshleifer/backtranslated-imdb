If you are a fan of a great Altman set, as evidenced in a big film like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and small films that look like a wedding, then you will certainly agree with HealtH. It was close to the Health Charter where two women fled the President, HealtH has a total of 70 people of the last Altman as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett, and Henry Gibson, with top Altman guests like Lauren Bacall , James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. If a lot of the collective of Altman's film is a little part of this film, but it is not as close as a film like Nashville or Wedding, but it has more feel, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is the satire of the apparent movement of Health, filled with top, on characters, characters, and stars of visitors like Dick Cavett to give the definition of wry on the whole thing. Describing the entire electoral process is the ambition of Altman's attitude towards politics and public appeals but what is more interesting about this film is very happy people are most likely to have. This will be one of the last Altman movies like this for a while!
