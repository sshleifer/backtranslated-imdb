This video has fallen! Eddie is one of the funniest artists I have ever seen. Not only does he have a class, he performs funniest performances on history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the original and most intelligent comic I have seen for so long. Tell all other actors to get a step up and let this "executive" rule!
