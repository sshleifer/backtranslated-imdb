What the best movie is this is not the words to describe. I don't know how the rating of the movie is 7.3 should be 9.3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and act with Akshay it's just the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie really has an endless anticipation that makes the movie full. you should watch this film once, I think twice well. Anyways I love this movie and not just sad and funny but it also gives you a very good sense and what you should do so I think this is one of the best movie in bollywood history. but I know people who choose choose. The only thing I don't like about this film is music and natural music is good but the songs are not very good I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director but anyways we can't do anything about that.
