I thought that the servant would be an unfamiliar movie. Finally I saw it, I got a good surprise.The movie is not a big thing but it's very fun and practical events have been done well. and you remind me, of the excitement of Wolfgang Petersen In the line of fire.If you expect one of the most original and direct presentations in the movie history, you will be broken. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
