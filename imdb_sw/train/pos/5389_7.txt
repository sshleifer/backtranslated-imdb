The kind of first-class "General Hospital" placed in the reproductive ward (and one for the most difficult case), this fast-moving program has an emotional impact on effect - especially because Eric Linden, as a young man in The main plot, is to fall carefully, and for very good reasons. His prospective wife, Loretta Young, has been brought to the ward during a 20-year prison sentence for betraying a lecher who perhaps had come to her; Mrs. Young, as always, does not do anything to overcome the sympathy of the audience, and she is very good to be true, though it is kind and good to see, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationship with other ward girls creates the heart of the film, and the result - not quite happy - feels right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few artists of the cinema," with the beautiful words of the movie historian David Thomson, warmth and authority as the chief nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a mother-in-law, and also croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drinking club. Frank McHugh's figures in another small section, and gets more show than Warners often allowed. It is fast and fast, and Linden's dad is sitting with you for a day - this kind of part was often played for laughing, but he is a little frightening child in trouble, and is very persuasive.
