I might be getting myself here, but though the film itself was a technical hub for its time, I watched a piece for a piece of TCM last night, the question came to me: Why did they do it? put their lives at risk, many of them died in the journey, why they make a dangerous journey to life, to get food for their animals (!) once they came to the "land of milk and honey", why didn ' they just sit there? Can you risk your life, and your whole community, to get feed for animals? As risky as it was, doing it for the sole purpose, it shows the inner ease of these types of people. Risk of death for cattle? They better than me!
