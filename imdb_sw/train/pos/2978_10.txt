BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have seen. It is a remote-wall movie that attracts the creators of South Park Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two friends of a slacker who creates games on their way to becoming a national feeling. Most of the gags are actually hilarious but the funniest part of the movie is when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule over what is not allowed, so it usually does things that are possible. One of these movies is that the speed is the fastest way, and after watching about half an hour I found myself asking "Is this about already?" Another hilarious part of the film was how Joe and Doug had treated Squeak on a regular basis, who is a little boy. BASEketball is a classic comedic with some very quotable lines, and it's very fun to watch!
