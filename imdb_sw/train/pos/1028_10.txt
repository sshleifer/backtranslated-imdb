I tell you, from the beginning, when I was watching a movie of the Stargate movie I was not cut off or anything was like the average movie, and a lot of POTENTIAL, although movies were not like, wonderful, amazing as other documents such as star wars or visitors, which if you are sci fi fanatic you will accept one of these two names is amazing, although I don't like a hardcore sci fi fan like other people, I don't know Remember one line from one of these movies, not a big fan to wear starring shirts , in fact if you see me, I will look like a normal person to you, get a little bit here, well my point is that it shouldn't be a good fan of hard work to please this great series, which unfortunately ended after an amazing 10 season without a drop in its quality as it was close to its end, in 2006. <br /> <br /> Though I didn't have too many movies I was looking at the first season in 1997, and the to tell you, special effects were just one of the most improper elements on the series, the chemistry among the characters just to cut off the special effects, it was good if not better than most of the performances today. I admit that I have never been to Sci fi if it is not for stargate, and my father, who actually got me sci fi when I was like 6, and I'm glad he did, another wise i have seen a brilliant exhibition like SG1, which now in my opinion puts a score of almost every sci fi series and movies, basically as a new sci fi is not better or good as SG1, its not worth looking. basically this is better now so far, and if you look at this, then you don't know what you're missing!
