On the surface, "Written on Wind" is lurid, soft opera soap about the sex dysfunctions of the family of Texas. But underneath it all is a detailed definition of social life in 1950. Douglas director Sirk returns again with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack likes to love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that the best Pack, Rock Hudson, likes too. When the stack finds that it is fertilizer and Bacall takes pregnant, the fire works jump. And, Dorothy Malone all the very best won Oscar for her photos of Texas' big boom that is blocked by Hudson. A good soap manufacturer.
