I've read several comments and I'm kinda sad that many stories seem to be high. It is easy to do because it is not the Book, its movies and there is so much that can be made in the movie-USA or Canada- or wherever. Colm Feore does, at least by recovering "F @ g-Hag" as myself, a great job of not just playing 'friend' neighbor - but playing sick. I mean, you can't get more colors! Although, you may never know from the ground down by ... um, the end. If you need to be reduced, there are small Sking movies that you might like. Being a daughter of Accepting Alchoholic, drug addicts [David Cubitt] was a trick to me. I will give you cred, grew fast-and believe that it's good. And, as a powerful, authoritative writer, I can dig a lot of insight and a brief description. But I feel more than poetry. I would like to be easy to please, but I liked it. Very good stories are included with Canada, what a surprise. Just sprayed the "Modern week, and it was rather a cleverness to be shown.
