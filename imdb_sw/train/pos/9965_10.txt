It is ideal for families with young children who are looking for non-violent films and cheerful for the child and, for example, for adults. Not a bad film for low-budget work. The children will be surprised by the seminar of Santa and the "magic" that makes him enter the house through the chimney that seems to be too small, or even non-chimneys houses! Children will enjoy Santa's success in stopping the evil devil called Pitch (perfect in the usual red dress and horn and tail!). They will be kind to the little girl who is so passionate about having a little love doll. And a rich young man who just wants to spend time with his eternal parents. And what child does not know someone at school who is like good boys who have joined the pitch to help catch Santa and destroy Christmas? At the end, everyone, including good boys, get what they deserve for Christmas! The film will love children with Santa and the message of love he gives people around the world. <Br /> <br />
