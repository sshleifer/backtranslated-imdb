PAGE 3 **** between 4 Stars / <br /> <br /> <br /> The house of her boyfriend and empty her. He looks here and there and then gets into his room and gets pictures - 'Ah! another girl? that baddie twice and yes he really doubled it but it's a GUY this time around. And I say 'Brilliant!' <br /> <br /> End of SPOILERS (The above section is not a real spoiler ... but for me it was so I didn't want to take place) <br /> <br /> When asked if this film was, my friend replied 'oh , it's just plain P3 people that makes me believe that the patient checks a stupid movie if nothing more. When I came to the theater, I thought myself 'I am better to get a pen and paper to stop bad things about this film' but I was completely confirmed? and then some because I could just sell products. This film was good. Great, not because it is an unfamiliar and non-traditional movie as a story story but because of cunning in the screens and how this film tells you how to handle the film with care that can be a dumb and idle film if the wrong hand. <Br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is pretty good who wrapped her work perfectly as if she was born to play this part. One of the most loving actors I have ever seen. But this is not just a performance that is good in the film, there is Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul who gives fire only screens. (And I think what even the Tara Sharma helped in a non-speaking time speaks normally) The movie stars with small old hush-hush fans of the film industry and al and you get an idea of ​​what this is The movies will be close. And for half an hour through the film you feel the same. But then the movie takes the speed of inserting into the story of a beautiful story and never can allow it. Even Boman Irani agrees with the statement? 'It was a good story, Madhvi'. (Thank you). The main thing is that it deals with the issue of how these brave people are and are no longer working and also dealing with social issues and not making them boring. Finally all his trips to Madhvi tell us that only by exciting to all these people. Just because I like watching the movie. Make the film deliberately. Screenplay is beautiful, clever and cunning.
