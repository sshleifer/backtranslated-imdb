This essay is essentially a series of events organized in time held on 10 April 2002 to April 14, 2002 in the Palace of Venezuela President, Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The transmission of the movie is real and one feels pain, sadness and joy of the people who lived through the fight against President Hugo Chavez. One comes away from watching this film which Hugo Chavez is a great historical example. Hugo Chavez a persona brought people of Venezuelan to lose a three-day squad of the three-day army and re-establish the democratic government of democracy. It is obvious from the pictures of George W Bush supported and opposed the independence of Venezuela. That the usual media helped and accusing George W Bush is not surprising. What is amazing is how few people have seen this film and how few people are aware of the total media coverage of America. It took just 20 years for Ronald Reagan to overcome the Doctrine of Accuracy in 1986 to return to America to be blind and powerless. Hugo Chavez May the eyes of Americans will open the truth and the beauty of the true American vision.
