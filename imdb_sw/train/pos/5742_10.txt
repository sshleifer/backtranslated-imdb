TOM HULCE * returns to another Oscar performance as he deserves as Dominick Luciano, a man who has been damaged by a brain who helps him take his brother (Ray Liotta as Eugene) through a medical school. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for all film lovers and all lovers of life and people! * From a small studder to the playing to the horizontal, with regular expressions "Oh, Jeez" whenever Nicky is bound, the trust of Tom's performance is so much better that you will have to carefully remember that it is an actor on the screen!
