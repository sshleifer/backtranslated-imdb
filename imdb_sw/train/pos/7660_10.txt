This film is not a short, dark, static. I may have a preference, as the era of oppression is a place that I have felt. But I would say it is the same as the Liberty and Crying for the Dear Country. Unfortunately for the last few days I have never heard of this film. Inside it is one of the films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I never heard before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite characters, is honest and wonderful, Nigel Hawthorne has a role of dastardly well. Don't wait for humor in this film, no. It is true, savage and trust to the end, and with good intentions I would bring a box of tissue. But movies are as good as this makes you wonder, why is that the biggest movies have never heard?
