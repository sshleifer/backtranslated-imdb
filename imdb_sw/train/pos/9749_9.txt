I watched this film with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I certainly did not have an interest in opera at the time, but changed my opinion. I enjoyed this film very much and enjoyed the opera ever since. I even bought several of his CD. Who cares about his ability to act, was basically just played himself, which was so interesting. He was very interesting, so it is charismatic; I really wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that many are abusive to him. It was the same, not accepting people to arrest him or judge him for his actions. He deserves to be honored and interested in his talent. She definitely missed !!!
