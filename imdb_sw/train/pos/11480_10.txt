Refusing to expel: This is one of the most amazing, very sensitive movies I have seen for a long time. The first movie in years that has completely abandoned me. I could feel my way out of the theater, I was very upset. I've been looking at the screen for fifteen minutes trying to find a way to explain the power of this film, and just fail. Display any single feature - the text form of the video style of the text, unlimited picture of events, the power of the characters - it seems only to reduce all. Others may feel that anger can be as common as any killer. But then not all murderers enjoy lunatics spraying the mouth. Many are ordinary, unworthy. They are wired different. It is probably the most interesting ideas of all.
