Due to the invention of "Internal Collar", zombies-eating meat brings down control, and become members of community production; However, they do poor work. The dead attendants attend those who live in the United States-1950s, when they cannot walk around the "Wild Zone". In the city of "Willard", before the boy K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, Robinsons are the only family on their roads that have no zombie; Their new neighbors, Water, have six. So, to continue, Robinsons finds the zombie Billy Connolly (like Fido). Unfortunately, the Connolly "Internal Collar" has been destroyed by a woman's old woman, and she eats; then, new zombies and hunger decreases the city. At the same time, the little baby Ray has grown on Connolly's relationship (the boy and his zombie is like "Timmy and Lassie" of the TV) and the family of Robinson gets hard to cooperate with the "Zomcom" authority. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go too far into its "Wild Zone"; but, it is a colorful color, delicate, and exciting interesting film of a zombie. Ray and cast makes well, each one; and the nubile woman Sonja Bennett (like Tammy) and the owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) a memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and staff, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music), and James Willcock (design), won prize awards. <3 <3 \ t
