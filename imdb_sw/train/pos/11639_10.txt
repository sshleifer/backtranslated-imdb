I saw the top observation of this film tonight. I really liked it. The movie has placed me beside my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is very creepy like a villain. For those who have seen the Batman Begins, his behavior was very bad in this film. He played his character very well. Worst "bad man," I have seen for a short time. Rachel McAdams was good. Everyone in the audience laughed, threw it and cheered at the same time, as we had found it. The defendant takes place through the outside of the movie. That amazing part is that the end did not have to deal with the weather. I had no desire to end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not make movie movie. The movie is better than the trailer showed. Don't wait for this movie to come out of the video. Go see it. Although, I didn't have to pay to see this film, I'd like to give happiness 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
