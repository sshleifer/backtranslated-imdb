Despite good and interesting animations, this is probably one of the most Disney films that are not available and I have seen it, and so often disney movies. The spirit is a wild stallion who constantly gets captured, either by horsemen or by Indians, all who are trying to "break". The Spirit ends up making collateral with India, and that, in short, is a story. Except for a good horse animation, neither I nor my five-year-old were very leading or excited about this film. It is surprising that it is called "Spirit", as the spirit is what this film could be used a little more. An additional step was given out loud, which was enjoyable, and Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer songs. And although this film has been counted G, it will still continue to explain what "breaking the horse" means your age of five. I did. <br /> <br />
