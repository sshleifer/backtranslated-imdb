Unusual movies from Lam Ringo and one that is wonderful under-appreciated. The combination of fantasy kung-fu and the more realistic direction of swords and spears run by body bodies is particularly amazing during the first ten minutes. Riders are pulled in two with his waist and legs continue to ride the horse. Several horses are pulled. It's very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his brothers Shaolin are arrested by the maniac head of the clever and imprisoned the Red Lotus prison which appears to be a torture room then the temple. Great resembles Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts the warp warped and makes painting paintings and human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very amazing and the environment is broken. Blood is everywhere. This action has been done well and is largely unlike most of HK's time events. Sometimes the movie shows that he does not know or the effects are cheesy but has never been bad to destroy the film. This is one of the best HK kung fu movies since the early nineties. Just remember not a child friendly.
