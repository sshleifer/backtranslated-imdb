This is one of the best Talkies Joan Crawford. It was the first to connect Gable-Crawford, and made it clear to MGM and to the audience that they were an amazing team, causing the studio to make them seven films with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows the slide below the brothers and sisters who, after their father lost everything in the stock market accident, must make themselves and work for survival. Life is complicated in Depression, and soon their attempts to find a legitimate job were not important, and they use the lowest world. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is ideal as a community-turned-moll community. He is smart, complex, and reliable. It even makes the difficulty of displaying another style of Talkie characters in advance. Clark's car is a class-in-bad, masculine and gruff as a no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with the Crawford character. In the same year he will have the same role that was more successful against Norma Shearer in the "Soul Free", getting its position as a sign on male sex in MGM. <br /> <br /> If you would like Crawford in this kind of role, do not miss "paid", which made a year ago, which is also among its original Talkie shows. <br /> <br />
