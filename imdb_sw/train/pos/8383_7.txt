Robot Jox tries hard, but essentially it is a series of combat-linked combinations of robot against a robot, man against man, man against woman. The cluster was capable, but apparently the script was not given a few more than needed. However, it was very good, for a false false film. Its part is because the script was with Joe Haldeman. For those who do not know that name, Haldeman wrote a novel science award "Eternal War." It is considered to be one of the best weapons of warfare, above and "Starship Troopers" of Robert Heinlein and John Steakley's "Weapons". With this movie is really like a great film of weapons weapons, instead of big robots. It is close to fans who would prefer rather than the destruction that was the "Starship Troopers" of Paul Verhoeven, which had just resembled a set of novels. <br /> <br /> With other ideas, this is not true 's according to the "Iliad" of Homer. Several names are all they had. Achilles had a foot of the robot was cut off had no parallel in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. Neither the ancient Achilles was not a good hero. He was more powerful, but he also had revenge and less. Even the jock robot was killed in the first place is not recommended. He was called Hercules, when the Greek Iliad would have Herakles. The results were good for time and budget. True, it was not the same as "Terminator 2" a year later, but that movie decreased ten times. The stop motion was as good as the robotic walkers in the "Empire Go Back" and "Return to the Jedi." Better, in fact, than a lot of animation of Ray Harryhausen, which looks very much, but of completely dated. Do not bring great expectations in this and may not be discouraged. It is better than many other low budgets and other major budget budgets that have excellent effects but the worst scripts.
