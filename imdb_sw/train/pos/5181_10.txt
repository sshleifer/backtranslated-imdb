I thoroughly enjoyed this film in general, but four things are true: Sam Raimi's full time comic time and performance as a handy camp? The beautiful tons of external events put me in the film as the sun on the sea draws me to my summer memories. Conversation and feeling feel normal and reliable. Other viewers criticize the lack of a "comprehensive" script. For me, the lack of this film makes it work. The characters and their problems seem real and because of it, I care about what is happening to them. The bottom of the bottom is that all parts come to create a whole that feels right.
