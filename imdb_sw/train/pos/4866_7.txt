First of all, in protecting JOAN FONTAINE, it must have been said that Ginger Rogers would have been very clear as Alyce, a young British woman responsible for the title. Fontaine makes a picture of stimulating as a heroine here, but her skills show poorly and her play is best left unnamed. Fortunately, he continued with good things. <br /> <br /> But here's a FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the highest bills - and it's the best. Burns & Allen fans will be amazed at how well they are in the way of Astaire dance. Especially interesting is a great house of fun house which won the Hermes Pond Oscar Pans. They join Astaire in what should be an example of film innovation. Unfortunately, not much can be mentioned at a slow pace of the story - nor some stale situations that call for a lot of patience from the viewer. It should be said that some humor will fall flat and the usual variation in romance that occurs in any film of Fred Astaire of this period is given regular treatment. Only among the music provides the story of the lift requires. Some of the good Gershwin fruits are growing once in a while but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. The best assistant includes Reginald Gardiner, better in the comic performance like the police, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father was mistaken as gardeners and Astaire). when Burns & Allen are coming to remind us of how they were on their radio and television days. Both are very surprising in dealing with the footwork of Astaire. Director George Stevens ensures that the number of the village of Joan Fontaine and Fred is performed at a reasonable distance but the clever work of a clever camera cannot hide the fact that he is out of his element as a dance actor of Astaire, something that looks like pain.
