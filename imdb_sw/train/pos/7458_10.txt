This game is a bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and it should be on great hits. When I got an Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game but then Nightfire came up and that was the best, but now there is a new type of game James Bond. While this is the third person shooter and there are more than 12 messages, the game's graphics are out of this house. Even all actors and characters in this game as Pierce Bronsan once again James Bond, William Dafoe as Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive all if I am wrong). This match will be itself as a great game of James Bond around. <br /> <br /> I offer this 10/10
