This film was not just one of John Ford's private centers but also had directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his top assistants. Surprisingly, I just took upon myself through the Secret 2 of the Recent Criterion Disc after being lost to the original language screening on Italian TV several years ago and rarely on television at Hollywood! It was the first sign of nine partnership with Henry Fonda and also an example of the quintessential of the American folksy of the vein. A piece of work designed by a very good example, a court room (and final revelation) in its second half is still inserting a packet, except to give a good actor Donald Meek a role to be remembered as a prosecutor. It is, in fact, completely cast as an attacking, skilled but powerful and humanitarian lawyer who was scheduled to be President; Fonda will continue to describe other false politicians on the film - especially in Franklin J. Schaffner of BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet of FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising now to learn that he was concerned at that time about accepting the role of Lincoln since, in his opinion, was "like playing God"! It is interesting to note here that Ford had found Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in MVUNZI SHARK ISLAND (1936), a good but perhaps unlikely gem that has just been released as a special version of the DVD and stand for UK, Eureka's "Masters Of Cinema "studio. Besides, I also have two films of Ibrahim Lincoln in my collection of DVDs that I have never seen and, incidentally, both were led by DW Griffith - LIFE NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and not just received A group of films that I have never seen before, I would like to give them a spin based on my experience of very satisfied with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
