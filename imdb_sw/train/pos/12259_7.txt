"Family Happiness" takes us to a difficult time in America. It's amazing to see how everything was different then. It was an innocent time in our country and we look at the family 'work' dealing in things together. The film also symbolizes the beginning of a series involving Hardy family. The film, directed by George Seitz, depends on the successful success. Judge James Hardy, and his wife Emmily, are faced with an internal crisis that must be addressed. Bian daughter Joan returns home after making a social offense with her husband holding her. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home beau, who is obviously going to communicate with her father. A happy and Andy child, seems to be the only one without trouble until his mother takes away Polly in the dance, something she refuses to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows well if he sets the plan in action to connect everyone again. After all, he is a person who understands, not just rules, but how to deal with those foreign forces that threaten his position in society and what makes his family happy. Lionel Barrymore plays Justice Hardy by faith. He is a glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington looks like Emily, mother. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this film, but he's like all the time, it's fun to enjoy. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon seemed like a daughter, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also seen in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly, a wonderful girl Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> "Family Affairs" is a good way to explore our past things with a beautiful picture of the family of the United States.
