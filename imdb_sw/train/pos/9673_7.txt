Paulie looks like a more saccharin, the most beautiful and pleasant garbage that you could find, but it's better than you expect. The tracking of the plot could put the sound on the entire film, but in fact many other films are interesting. If you are wondering, Paulie is a pastor. She was raped by a little girl with speech problems, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on his shoulder during medical training, and eventually becomes a very intelligent speaker. However, Paulie is sent by a little girl's mother and uses all the films trying to get from NYC to LA to connect with her. So, why is this sad film sound successful well? First, it shows some interesting effects of animatronic. Second (and much more) it has the courage to agree with the false Force and describes the true, exciting, realistic story of the truth in the story. Third, it has several amazing exhibitions, including Jay Mohr as a urine urine, Gena Rowlands as a beautiful woman, and Cheech Marin (yes, dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) As a music migrant. It may not be normal, but Paulie is a perfect recreation for children of all ages.
