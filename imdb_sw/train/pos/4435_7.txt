This is a good criminal player who takes a lot of time in 65 minutes. , a fighter killer and even love Tobin for the image of Mary Botanist (Patricia Wright) who helps to solve crime. There is also a strong finale shot that takes place in the yard of the stone ward. Look for a goof close near the beginning of this film where Lt. Corrigan refers to a dead woman as 'Tatooed Tilly' Before the coroner shows that she had a tattoo (confusion huh?). Also later when Tobin chases the killer back to the rear level he is shown suddenly to the wrong direction at the same time - not surprising!
