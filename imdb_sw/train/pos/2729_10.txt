I voted the best for how the act was, not for content. It still gives me energy after reading the book, then watching the film. The two former travelers travel to their homes to steal money from the safe to learn about prison time. During the journey, the tension begins to increase, as the sound of the voice in the movie adds to the general expectation. After the execution of their work on the farm, the next morning the remains of the family are found by a friend of the daughter church. The blood player screams, like the pans of the area on the phone and the cut string, has made my blood run cold and gives me a cold. That the killers met with their compensation is a little comfort for this broken family. Robert Blake was the best in his show of Perry Smith. The book was also well written by Truman Capote.
