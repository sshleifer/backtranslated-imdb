Eskimo is a great movie about a cultural mix between indigenous peoples and an impressive man. Although it has been done in a visual and non-professional style, Eskimo is a skilled producer that has a reliable story for the audience to see through the last shot. The Eskimo level of nature has different beliefs and behaviors over women and life than those of the scary whalers. When Eskimo's man has lost his partner, it is common that some people share their women and friends. It is also common for women to want to replace the lost wife. All of this seems natural in the setting of the destruction of the Arctic landscape. Eskimo level is characterized by white whalers (many European sympathetic whalers) that do not see these same locals alike. Fraud, drunkenness, rape, and death occurs after men of Eskimo leave to work in the cold sea. Finally the leading Eskimo (Mala) knows that he is separated and takes revenge. The spectators would be delighted in the 1930 movies. Enter the Royal Canadian Police and the moral problem to bring him back for trial. Mounties are played if the police feel they know this is not a broken and dry case. What? Mounties will find someone? Is it right to hold Mala to the code of behavior outside its traditional community? Is there a way that does not provide Mala? Is it impossible for a white man's law to stand up? Is there no hope of innocence? This is not a great movie, but one that you will enjoy with the depth of the issue discussed in a very different environment. I testify that the monitoring of the sequence of animals and animals was done before the despair of today that no one was injured in making the film - so beware of the natural raw process. It is highly recommended.
