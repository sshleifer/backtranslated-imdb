Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at the same time as the Challenger Explosion. Which really gives birth when bringing out or even if they should, bring it out. I am glad they did. I looked at SpaceCamp's first place on a car film. Which really strengthened the view of a lot. I heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I've never heard of others in the movies. So, it was a great challenge for me to find those young people, and do very well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was good too. I liked the events, where the children were shown how to act, as a team. Children's events ready for the trip could only hope. The real launch of the aircraft, it is true, the old news to us. However, this was different. All in all, this is one of the most valuable films. Escapist perhaps, but it was good for half of the space like me. After some time the lease is 30 - 40. I finally found it in a shop and bought it. Now, if it just comes from the DVD. I probably have forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
