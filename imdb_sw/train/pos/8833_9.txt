I was stunned by the head, so when a little sleep (from my curiosity ...), I sat and watched it. Then I looked at my television list and watched it again! There is a clear understanding of what happened to me when I saw this film - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., young people everywhere are the same. The children from Belgrade could be transported to, let's say, somewhere in the Midwest of the United States at the same time, with different language differences, it would not be possible to tell them away from any young people of that time. In fact they expressed the growing pain similar to anxiety, politics aside: Music, sex, film statues, music, drinking, sports, music ... In fact, many things that take place during my growing in Southern California of 1970 This was a story with interesting, but the joy of the youth made it very enjoyable. Characters, especially small actors, were quite honest too. I will not say this was Yugoslavia "American Graffiti", but I will say it looks similar to other 50 movies.
