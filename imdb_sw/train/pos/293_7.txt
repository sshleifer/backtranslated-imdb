What could be more insidious than the idea of ​​individual spies working with women who think they are spies? And many conversations as written are completely prohibited. But the characters turn the conversation into something that is relevant. You can see real people behind false lines. And the lead is amazing. Every area is only doing what is needed and what is coming without a long time for fun. <br /> <br /> I showed this to several friends in the mid-80's because I was worried about how bad material could be made in such a beautiful movie. Friends also enjoyed it.
