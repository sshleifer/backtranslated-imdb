When I saw this film a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. His greatness made my mind so much that I stretched out all my thoughts for all time. I would like to see not only for fans of anime, but for anyone who likes a popular film (or who loves things too wonderful). The style of art is beautiful, sound is perfect, and the sign in it is breathing. I have heard complaints about the incredible entry of English literature in the movies, but I think the way it was is to complement the wonderful style of film. Independent description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not have the right to this epic epic number. I would like to get more work with anyone who did this, and see them.
