This was a very good film. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought that the performances of the actors were excellent. I had to think about the film for too long. I think every student should see this film so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I loved the film because it told me and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I liked it very much because it told me something about relationships and that's what I liked to see in the film. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, the singer. If you put these three films together, you have to see before what happened during the war. We should remember something as a war for eternity.
