I don't think this movie is for everyone. But I saw this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was very difficult. I did not laugh hard during the film for a long time. I thought the whole stroke made a big job. You will find yourself cutting from the first minute through the very last location. I criticize some of the film people (especially those who find themselves WAY very seriously) will be choked with this humor. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. And the whole reminder was moving around with a laugh when I went to the one that made me think that most people enjoyed themselves and enjoyed having a good time on movies for change. I can't wait to see it again! If you have a feeling for LOL then this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
