Although John Woo's problem is boiling is my favorite movie number 1. But I tell you the story of the police is my movie number 2 favorite. I say this because stunts, fights and steps that favorite my part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps over the rail on esculator in grabs stores on pole surrounded by Chrismas lights and falling down the pole fell through the sky and finally landing behind it on the hard floor of marble. HOW! Buy on amazon.com at 14:98. (Or something of $ 14.) VHS a new video line at home. Any questions or comments please feel free to answer. (I have only 14 but I know where you can find any made movie.) If you are looking everywhere for a movie and you can't find it please answer. Thank you and good night!
