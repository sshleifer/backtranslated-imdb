I chose this film based on the summary of the plot and quotes of critics behind the box. It's not great in foreign films, and I don't know what to expect. I don't care especially for the headings that have. But I really liked it! It has a simple, popular character that makes you feel good about life. I found myself laughing loudly. I would like to recommend this picture to anyone, even those who love foreign movies and subtitles. This makes it worth the effort.
