I saw this very small film at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when it was announced in CBS. I did not know that it was in the playground all the time. Measuring the scale from the children's perspective I could give 4 out of 5 stars, because being a little boy at the time, it seemed "little". The view of the situation where Gazooks convince every day for everyone there was a little problem at a time but you came out of it. When I discovered the Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to go through it again! I still loved it despite the fact that it seems a little "old". I don't know where another viewer here has the idea that it was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. It is even possible to have a DVD for now, at least I hope. I want to cooperate with my children one day! 10 stars here, still a great children's film. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a copy of VHS! Woo-so!
