I liked so much to deal with the Check-Up screen that it remained true for novel! Great movie! As a strict reader, I find the worst thing about film change that the book somehow loses in translating. You can tell the Angel Angel team was careful to let this appear to this film. Ellen Burstyn was the best choice for throwing for Hagar's position and she is definitely a star of the movie. However, I think the Canadian actor (Christine Horne) who was chosen to play Hagar in her younger years also did a wonderful job that allows great reputation. I have not seen any previous Horne work but I will look after him after seeing his Angel Angel. I heard the release of the Canadian exhibition of Angel Stone will happen in Spring or Summer 2008. I can't wait to see on the big screen again!
