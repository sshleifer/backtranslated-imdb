I saw the film first climbing a US cable a year after it happened. It struck my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first wave of music that I had heard, after being very bad, a teenager of growing age. Music played music, such as the sound of Hazel O'Connor's sound and a scandalous sound show, and Phil Daniels' tough but a Cockney good shepherd stole my heart. But I think my favorite character is Jonathan Pryce's drugged out player plate. He was out of place in the band and so uncomfortable with anxiety, he just prayed for mercy. Interesting events, performance when the lights come out, and the love area on the train. Okay, so the movie is not Rose! But it was very good for its limited budget and for its transparency in the early 80s of the United States, wrestling with the rebel youth, looking for a way out of the dollar queue. I went to England a few years later and I found that the film has been a great reflection on the situation I had when I was there. If you get an opportunity, see. It is a good movie, with amazing performances, and music will beat off. <br /> <br />
