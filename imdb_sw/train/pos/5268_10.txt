Traders probably not the best film that any of us has seen, but really ???? ........ It is very funny ...... I can't write how I laughed when I first noticed. The director really wanted to make a great movie adventure, but it's also misable .... bad that it's one of The funniest movies that you have ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see ..... and if you alredy did, sew again !!!!!!!
