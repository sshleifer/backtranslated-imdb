Mr. Jim isn't really a boxing box. It's an Errol Flynn car like Jim Corbett. But after saying that, the boxes of boxing are a stimulating stimulus for a modern viewer. No 12 rounds, shows the choices here. Errol Flynn writes an Irish bank clerk who gets shot at the world of heavyweight. Flynn fits for the role of suave but unknown Corbett. His opponent John Sullivan is still better, the former school player played with Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie theme is someone who plays a great deal. Corbett leaves his usual life and builds a new persona like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a player who can cope with any social environment. He is a liar and a fool. Sullivan's champion of heavy pigs is shown as little but his loyalty and sports games differ from the main character. There is a step and more excitement and a wonderful end to the liberation of all for them. And Errol Flynn gets a girl.
