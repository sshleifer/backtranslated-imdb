This was amazing for a TV movie, and it is true for my own experience of bulimia. It was really a good research, and I can just think it's written by someone who has experienced the same experience, because it had all the little details. The characters were well-liked, and the Winningham and Alison Lohman exhibitions were good. I think that what I like most is that they made them special and wise, and there was no reason to sleep because of Beth's bulk (it was not "perishable" food, caused by the pressure imposed on girls and the media, pressure we could not deal with ... "His mother was not clueless at all - often on TV they will take the matter that everyone has a sense of and trying to tell us that their characters are the last people who remain on the earth who are not (" Diabetes? What? Oh, my whole world is right, doctor, please praise me if I am a young child ", etc.) It was a brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even did not see a sign. And the events where Beth was throwing are not emotionally emotional and emotional, and concentrated on the need for revelation The location of the bulimics, and their external control. The place where Beth tells her mother is the bulimic would have made me cry if there were no other people in the ch. created. Okay, so I liked those bits. Something that didn't work for me is very good, which turned to the movie movie area we know and doesn't like, but I think they had to close it. "You, too, can treat your child's illness, if you have lots and lots of money and live in America ..." And I can say again that I love Mare Winhamham. He is good.
