Sabrina Pastor's Youth was one of my exhibitions of T.V's life: D I was looking back to the daily sessions when I got home from school. So far I think I have looked at every section at once once and in a whole 3 or 4 times. She is funny, smart, outgoing, wizard, and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick are all working well with Sabrina girls. Zelda, an intelligent scientist, and Hilda mad, one wacky makes perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I must agree that college years are not as good as their high school years, but that does not mean that it is still not good. I think the end was surprising though it was not what I expected, it was meant to be my favorite. :)
