Although I live in Minnesota, I have been learning in France recently and I have seen a wonderful gem of film. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, say a bit. Creative and unique films, different directors each gave something different from their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first movie is trying to deal with each of these small stories in the general story, as well as can be done with the Love of 2003 in fact. This attempt, however, makes the magic of every part of the individual impossible. If it is taken from the value of the face, and every small part to be considered as its own film, love stories together tell a good message. The video is awesome at all times - often to the point of frustration - and every part of a person can be hard to follow. However, for a player who focuses on each group's groups, a short line of lines becomes clear after a short time. The mixture is almost exciting; puts you on the edge of your seat to wait what will come next. Standing viewer inquiring, "Is that just done?" but it also leaves them satisfied that they did, in fact, happen. It's a kind of movie where the viewer, after leaving the theater, can not decide whether they liked it or liked it. The earliest ears are going and looking at it regularly, so we can see this individual life connected to the cinema. The most interesting decision to make a variety of films adds something to the scope of people who may involve. Increases the reality of the film - here, the American tourists speak English, the French Paris, and so on. The number of people that the film includes leads to understanding the international language of love. From a common disease, the parents' love for men's love, this film covers all the basis of romantic story. In his great and wonderful way, every special event goes to the story of the story: that of every kind, size, nation, and love of love.
