There are several wrong things, though this is not very important since what happened to who is still a conflict. The greatest freedom and reality I think is when they start playing in Kaiserkeller Bruno Koschmidder, when they actually play in Indra and move to Kaiserkeller later. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was personalized for the Best Pete version, but if she's a storytelling then I think she calls shots. I also agree with Semprinni that record Pete Best plays on saying the last word on the subject of why she was expelled. Even though the film is not produced as a flavor like the future film "Backbeat", I love this film because it has more accurate, and because it has a better script and more features. There is a lot in the film that is very big - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he has been a "valley-valley," just knowing that the band knew he was Gay around. Touch a bit like a band into the caf√© and command "Maize and Milk Crops." My favorite part, which has some basic, is where in the Stuart Sutcliffe observation rejects its bass guitar but can not play, so she stands behind it for impresario and tries to do it, but it gets. That's rock 'rock'. You should watch.
