I would first say that somehow I remember seeing this film in my childhood, I couldn't read the headlines and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really like the concept. If you are unable to stop your discrimination to some extent and agree with your age of seven years you would like to avoid this film. That said, after just checking the 137-minute version of the DVD, I said I enjoyed it, though not as I had seven (I remembered the end). There are elements of the movie that deserve to be charged, the first 15 minutes and the last last minute have a certain comic time, my favorite that the difference between events took place in the last 10 minutes and elections curious to support the music (listen to the sound). It is a great action plan to focus on personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the problems of travel on time takes cost. At the end of the film I decided that this was a good thing, when seven I though 'relationship' guff was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> With the action film there is also a lot of exciting gory action, especially a couple of epic battles between the squad and the forces of the Shogun era. The creators of movies have made sure that as many deaths as possible are blood and, facing face, humorous. I thought this was a good feature of the movie when I was a child, and I don't see that I'm still doing. I also love the fact that modern-day soldiers offer 't use a movie to walk on egg shells trying to avoid changing the space of continuous time, they got heavy machine guns, lids, rocket launchers, tank and helicopters and they are hell to focus on making their feudal Japan. What I would like to think of any powerful IMDb user will do in their boots. The short film suitable to watch, makes the viewer see that there are no more movies done by the same premise, and at the same time give a good idea of ​​why film as GI Samurai is very unique.
