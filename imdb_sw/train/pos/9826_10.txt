This thriller's budget budget has some good points, but much more bad. The plan involves a female lawyer trying to release her partner who is sentenced to kill his wife. Become a soft-core film, which involves going down to the club club and having sex with suspects possible. As plots that go to this type of type, it's not bad. The script is the same, and the story makes enough sense to anyone up to 2 AM looking at this without realizing the holes of the plot. But everything else in the film seems to be cheaper. Lead artists are not bad, but largely all those who support them are very bad (one girl looks like drunk and / or over). Style looks good, and everything looks dirty and bad. Sounds are so terrible that you can't hear what people say. The worst thing in this film is because you look at it sexually. Because people are looking at these things is for hot sex events which involve girls of real fire in the Red Shoe Diary mode. Sex scenes are not suitable they are sleazy, beaten in a porno style where everything is just a shot of two people going with it. Woman also looks like they are refuges from the porn shoot. I don't try to be bad or mean here, but they all have breastfeeding and checking out. Even the head, "Obsession Deviant", looks like Flick Hardcore. It's not that I have nothing against the porn - in fact I love it. But I want to separate my soft-core and my hard core. What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Who can do and who will raise you completely? And what happened to the erotic B stimulation like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to kill. Indeed, none of these where art works, but at least felt like movies. In addition, they were enriching the envelope, going beyond Hollywood's high sexuality, sexual violence and perversion. Now they are making complicated films without complicated sex.
