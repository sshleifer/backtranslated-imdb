Kafkaesque happy to abandon the paranoia. Well done with Polanski performs well as an intident introvert struggling to cope with his sleeping accommodations of Paris and fellow guests. Horrible fears for early because of the most meaningful and self-reliant colleagues and the future terror after developing his defense which will ultimately be its destruction. Of course I could do without a piece of crossing but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, remembering the storyline. However it would have worked without it would have taken away a little element of the exhibition, but maybe that was intended for the reason the flower looked to take a look at the theater at the end. I can't help you feel that there are more than a few of the impressions of the director that it's not 'true' French and the boot Jews. However, there is much to enjoy here including good performance from the beautiful Isabelle Adjani look and good old Shelly Winters are reliable as ever.
