For all consultants on this page, I'd say this movie fit to see. So it was done in 1972, so what is it. The style in the movie was the same style of time. People who have not learned the culture of decades will think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared with the modern series, 'Left Back,' (That's our time right now) looks cheezy. However, the only part of the movie is fashionable, which again was over 30 years ago. But. The message you are sent to this film is very powerful, and is carefully stored. There's just a lot to say, but I refuse to say. (for fear of destroying it) So walk and see this film! If you do not like the message you send, then you have problems, which require caution!
