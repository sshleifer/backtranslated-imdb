It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite I remembered to see the Cracker Fund. Just beautiful and still not standing to be soppy. There are some great movies and a leading girl is quite brilliant. It catches more of the pride of time. It has a real heart. It is the wound of Achilles of childhood which is beautiful and bitter. Simple stories always fit when done properly. This glendyn Ivin has a great future with me for one, I look out for his upcoming project. Monitoring is always a problem. It's like blues of the second album for many people. <br /> <br /> I hope that his next film is not a cracked thing like a shark film. He loves all. Enjoy your movies.
