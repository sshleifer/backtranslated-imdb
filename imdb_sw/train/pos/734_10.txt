This film is the jolt of the donkey ass, from the beginning to the end. Ramones, heads of the late 70-punk rock, seem like themselves. PJ Landing stars like Riff Randle, a high school girl who is living and breathing rock 'n roll. Riff is faced with songs for Ramones, its rock port. He keeps the school's rockin ', and encourages his colleagues to join him in his fun antics. At the same time a school that Riff attends, has just taken a new General Head, called Bi Togar. She is tall, fearing the lady of the lady. And he promises to make a toe-line-students'. He even has several students working as observers, who return to dirt for their classmates. The Togar Bio is interested in especially for nab riff, and set to stop Rhin's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has a sensible way to tackle Togar, on each side. Kudos for good performance of Mary Woronov, in its place as General Togar. Mary is an actor B story story. And in this film, plays Mrs Togar, a woman of fascist. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into an exciting performance. Clint Howard as an Eaglebauer of fraud, has a great pleasure and his role. Ramones makes many songs to hit in this film. And so the viewer sees what Ramones had a great influence, in the 70 Punk rock area. Indeed, this is a good film for fans of Ramones. But even if you don't have into Ramones, or a punk rock, this film is a blast (literally) blast of effort.
