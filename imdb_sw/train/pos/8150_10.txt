My, Speed ​​Lemmings is certainly a good looking woman. This film is a lost gem, a satire of the death of the early 90s of Hip Hop, while MC Hammer had just dropped that good night. We follow three members of the NWH when they start their picaresque journey of wealth and reputation. And as Nickolas Nickleby, last, they finished their journey away from where they started, but at least a little wise and less little naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard, but is a kind of film you like or dislike, much like "Company Company" in this regard. I look at this film as the 1000 islands of northern New York: it is a very mysterious secret you want to keep.
