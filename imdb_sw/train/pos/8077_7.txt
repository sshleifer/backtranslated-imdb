Movie made for modern audiences. Residents get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensuous scenes too. This is not exactly a movie that one can feel good looking with the whole family. Not for the eyes of children. I had to move forward a number of events. If it's just the entertainment you are looking for, then this movie has all. These songs are interesting. Proper production, I must add. However, the message is not all. It insists on the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you'll get good. And if you do evil, you will find evil. The fruit of good works is good, when the fruit of evil is evil. In a real life, this is not true. It is known that many people are not fair in this world. While it is true that some bad people meet the worst end, there are many who run away. And then, there are many people who do good, and so they meet with a slow end. If you don't care about the message, and all you want is to escape from the world, this film is good for entertainment.
