"Atlantis: The lost dollar" was everything that the preview showed would be. Not often find that. Often, the verification of the review shows only the best pieces and then all the movies are awesome. Not for this. I was happy with the original conspiracy, although the lower stadiums were not available. Animation did not break as "Shrek" but it was good, none at all. The plan and line of stories were presented well and there were only a few ads in them. This makes you interested. I found myself enjoying this. "Atlantis" finds and considers. You should also think a little, but not too much. Once you think about it a little, you can think of what is needed but you don't really know how it will happen. <br /> <br /> Strike was also good. Michael J. Fox, as Milo was the best choice. His personality is very useful. Rurke's natural commander was well chosen by James Garner. His character reminded his performance in the "Maverick" I loved too. I was very much loved by the Christian Claudia as Helga Sinclair. His ability to play no empty sensation makes the film more interesting. It's very bad he is a villain. Above all, definitely worth you when (8 out of 10).
