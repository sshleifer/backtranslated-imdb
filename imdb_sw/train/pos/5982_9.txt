One of my favorite films. It has everything - the sound of the sound, in honor of Eddie Clark, the former Motorhead, the luggage of loads, loads of laughter, a completely ridiculous plot and the most incredible '80 character as characters. Eddie, a good boy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (about rain as they arrive), Nuke (rock burned out), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzy as a preacher (surely he is in America? ). Then there are boys (rich, clever and stupid) and girls (open, free and stupid). What more can you ask? Well, first of all, there is Sammi Curr, rock star, a combination of every 80 rock badger you can imagine. What about the rocket that claims the guitar? Then there is a place where Sammi draws an old woman through TV screens and beating him. And what does Roger do? Why, tell him, if a good geek would. My favorite part is where Tim Hainey gets a long reward from Sammi through the finger of the rain in the plug! If you were a rock in '80 years or just you like the films like me, then look at this out. Available on DVD and very cheap (trick or) treat.
