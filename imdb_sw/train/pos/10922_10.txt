When I was very young, at a local TV station, they would show a kung fu film every Saturday. I saw many films of Kung Fu at the weekend. I remember lots of lots. so open.Me and the dad were just lunch in the King.We were a runner at home to see what film that would have this Saturday. We ran home and jumped on the bed, we turned and put it on 56. A common introduction to many films of kung fu back and words Kung Fu on Saturday at the same time was the Title of the film. I bit in my amused burger with a loan before credit. I loved this minute's movie came on.My favorite character was the Spot Pills. I am crying when every business comes and soon 2 hours of the best movie I have seen.
