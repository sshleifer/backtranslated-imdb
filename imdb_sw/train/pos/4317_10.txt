I loved this film when it was released, and I will still do it, because the story of the story makes you hope about life in general, and people alsoâ€¦ one of the things I like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to good vibes from the film, there are other reasons to love the Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has excellent casting ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, a very popular film that has won Oscar for the best photos, was similar to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon makes you feel that it is positive. Crash had a different effect to me; it was very dark. I would like to choose Grand Canyon on Crash any day.
