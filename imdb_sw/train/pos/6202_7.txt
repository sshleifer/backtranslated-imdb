When I began to look "Fay Grim", I did not know that it was good for "Henry Fool". Now, that end is not the film that I wanted to be good. But one has arrived, and it is quite good. I think you have seen nature, so I will not explain. This begins with Fay (Parker Posey) who lives with his son, Henry Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day, the child is expelled by bringing a toy to thank the school. But this is not an ordinary toy. It has a mystery that describes a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this mystery creates more in geopolitics than "Syriana". Let me say that I am attracted to what Hal Hartley has completed here. Maybe this does not reach the original quality, but certainly examines what is going on in the world. And the latter opens the possibility for another good. <br /> <br /> Also has star Jeff Goldblum.
