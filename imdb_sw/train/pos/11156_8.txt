I usually do not like the reality that shows, especially those who benefit from the success of "American Idol". But this I can live with. <br /> <br /> Developers from around the world make a short schedule for the most famous callers, and if they like it, those boys will be sent to make a real audience view. Then ten or twelve quests are selected to live in a house and make a "Survivor fashion" competition using comedic techniques. Then one will be recognized as "Last Comic Standing." I like to stand the comedy, so this is one real show must be interested in my interests. There are usually some of the most interesting places selected through. It started a talented staff like Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May, and Josh Blue. My worst complaint is the fact that a lot of these artists were chosen for their contribution to the reality show game. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother," but now they have stopped it, thank God. And there are many people of comedians that I felt, they were not only chosen because they are funny, but because of color, ethnicity, behavior, sex, etc. when reporters should clearly be beaten out. But in general, it is actually a well-made exhibition, which is two terms so far I thought it was oxymoron.
