I work on a movie shop, and as such, I am always looking for a better movie. I decided to explore Nothing in our part of Canada, and I have been trying to help my country's cinema industry. I was surprised. The film comprises David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in an entertaining story which seems to enter into many ideas and relationships ... without working hard. It is a series of interactive interactions with two characters, with different funny exchanges ("We can't die, we have a cable!"). What's more I can say without realizing that it's worth the shot, even if you stop within the first half of the hour.
