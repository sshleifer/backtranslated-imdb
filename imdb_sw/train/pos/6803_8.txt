In one of his first movies, Romy Schneider shines as a young king of England, coming into the throne at the age of 18, learns to rule in spite of the demolition of politicians, and finally gets married to Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though surprising for the loyalty to real events), this romantic piece is a barrier. Watching this film about the British royals spoken in German adds to its amazing charm. In front of that, someone wonders why the Austrian movie was made about the English queen; but one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still under working with collaborators, including Britain. Maybe this was one of the reasons for this film.
