I just had to see this last Friday at the end of the Los Angeles film festival in Laemlee at Beverly. This film enjoyed all the films in the evening. Given that two music videos were first opened, I did not know what to expect since they were trying to quickly and carefully, I was not sure that I was ready for a short time. But to my surprise I was very excited about this. I thought the main character of the demon was very good. I was so impressed by his work that I looked at his name. I was surprised to see that he was a Witchblade witch. He has been very good since then! Maybe that or was given lousy responsibilities or has been influenced by the hard director for this short time. The girl did a good job. I think its hard since it was its first performance and very limited. Dad did well too. There was a very good job of cg for a short time, for this and a short playing next "Mexican Hat" which was also good, but I enjoyed this because it was more detailed and impressed and I really care about the characters. Another was a very simple story. The story was a perfect and totally dark! It dealt with the real theme using more fantasy as a technique to keep ADD people like I intended. We can't even talk about the last film in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I just want to see more of the demonic character and a little bit of start, that's why I gave 9 out of 10. I thought too that the end of the credit went slower. Otherwise it was well explained, directed and modified. Time was very good and a complete change from MTV's quick editing done every day today. There will be more from this future director and also actress. I will now think of it as a lost lost player is not a witch of witch.
