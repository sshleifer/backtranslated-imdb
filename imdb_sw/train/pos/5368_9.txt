This is an amazing action video with multiple signals from Arnie! It is delicate to be made, for many steps to keep one satisfaction. The characters were awesome, and Richard Dawson, very frightened as a great woman. Yes it has tons of conspiracy holes, however it is very entertaining, and too much. It had a good story, too, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had a great chemistry together. Characteristics were also very good, and, some of the best performances. Redirect is the best !. Paul Michael Glaser, doing a great job here, with amazing coloring, styling all around, amazing camera corners, and generally putting the film at a fast pace! good work. There is a bit of a year. We get a few gun injuries, headache, cut throat, blood clots, bloodless skin, and implants. Work is good !. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an AMAZING as always, he is the best in the acting department, has a ton of hilarious one liners, kicks ass, and as always a great physical presence, and it was a ton of fun to look! (Arnie Code!). Maria Conchita Alonso, doing well here, was very good, and had a good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, is an honor here, and what he should do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, is as good as a kind of geeky boy, was cool! Richard Dawson is a surprise as a great woman, and he was very dangerous, and was happy to look. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch, and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they should do as well as stalkers. Generally you need to see! **** 1/2 out of 5
