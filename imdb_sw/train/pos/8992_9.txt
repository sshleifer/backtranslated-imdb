Flick real cool. Must be for any music snob. You don't really know about the band to enjoy the film. Before the movie, I just heard only two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only thing needed is a clear mind. <br /> <br /> cinematic stations near Brian Jonestown's murder. The Warhols of Dandy has a role in the film, like "rival band," but it is a second fiddle for BJM. The Dandy Warhols should not have a great role in the film as I wanted, but again, he had no excitement and uncertainty of BJM. In itself, it is a film with a knowledge and research in the music industry. Just watch this film and enjoy it.
