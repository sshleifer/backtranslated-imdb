I saw last night, was being advertised in the Canadian 'Eye of the Eye'. Recently displayed (September 2003) at Toronto's International Film Festival with many others. It's a fantastic film. Representatives of the film stumbled in the story, being there making a document about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the midst of events as a revolution occurred. They had unfamiliar access to events with people and, for the most part, allowing the story to be revealed as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they do obviously) but they put themselves behind and instead try to focus on events, people, and history and history leading to the revolution. If the film, not to break the ground with a stylistic or aesthetic feeling, and that's it, I think, how it should be. What we can see what 'journalism' should be. What we see is a wonderful account of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who cares for his people ... a story about strength and greed as a partnership of a company / military interest / media combining leading leader of a chosen leader democracy ... and abnormal access to a historical event as it happens. <br /> <br />
