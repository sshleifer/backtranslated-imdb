Yes, if other critics have already said, this may not be the L & H harvest but it is far from being their worst job than the 20th century stupid ... I mean Fox. In fact this film has all the basic elements of things going wrong for boys. But it is their great technique and decision that makes them funny. They do not play for laughing as other girls can but they take their work and their status very seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with basic issues that can actually meet any of us today, ie work problems. First, we'll explore with a doctor and he could import others to rest and maybe stay in the sea. That's where the surrealness comes in all of this. L & H always takes the best condition of the situation and spreads but it should not be strange, but maybe once a time. This makes us laugh because we can engage with themselves caused by experiments and experiments. That's what makes Stan and Ollie all in their appeal. In this film all these parts are presented in a beautiful and beautiful way. It is not good to compare their earlier work perhaps because this was the last real film they did for Roach because he wanted to give birth to a "big" label and to go to the only features and also wanted to hurry and finish their contract duties. BIG MISTAKE! They should be all sitting together and continuing for perhaps five more years. What the world can be missed in them do not consider this as an option. Look, laugh, and enjoy this as their ultimate great performance.
