Warning! Free Spoilers Before! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I find it difficult to destroy the historical document, but I reveal some backstory and techniques.) <br /> <br /> This is a unique documentary not only because of the amazing footage but also from the story behind it. Because Naudets has not come to tell the story of 9/11, but instead of a rookie provider, the feelings of men and the audience of the audience are more realistic and more powerful than they could be in a normal restoration situation. <br /> <br /> In the film's sense, "9/11" is a book. If the events were a real script, it would have been very good, if the characters were created, then cast the corners that they should respond to. This is the most amazing thing to consider the pain and feelings of written scripts that the directors had to walk through this story together. The first part of the film provides a view of life within the fire station; in particular, how rookie inavilates himself to become a veterans staff. That part alone is very good, and it had a permissible document to run its planned course, perhaps it would be stable. The brother appears to be obvious to the process of being the fire of the NYC. Then, of course, all hell breaks. The disruption caused by the WTC attacks appears to be good, as the various characters we know find in horrible situations. Seeing is not just an attack, but also the first effect is a very moving image of a strong human feeling. Later, which fire fighters are found to be lost and found, is a humanitarian game at its peak. Life and death depend on equality. Unlike many films, the observer does not know who will live and die, but he really cares. Any bad thing I say about this is that Robert DeNiro (whom I love) blurbs had no knowledge, no need, and he did not develop stories all the time. They had just added to attract more television viewers. The bottom of the bottom: the best document I have ever seen. Nonpareil items of human sensitivity and color. 9.5 out of 10.
