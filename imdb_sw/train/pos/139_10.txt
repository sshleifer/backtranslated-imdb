First, Riget is amazing. Good comedy and thriller of secrets simultaneously. A good mix of amazing style of story teaching with good music and chief executives. But unfortunately no "end". And I don't accept it. I thought ... how would it be easier to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have the idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I am sure that part 3 without Helmer cannot be the same. So here is my opinion. A little stupid little, maybe not. I know Lars likes to try. So why not try to use Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create a puppet animation (such as "American team" and Trey Parker) or even a 3D animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but for the principle I believe it can work ... just this way it is possible to make executives live again. For the fans of this Riget should not be very different - if the animation will be done in a good way of 'observer' you will see that it is only normal after the first few shots of the movie. The most important thing is now the story. It is quite understandable that it is impossible to create Riget 3 with actors today. So it's not playing with animation? And ... look for the possibilities that gives you! Even one marketing! The general director has completed his trilogy after 10 years using the puppet animation. Just a dream? <br /> <br /> I hope to see one day of Riget ... or even just see the script. I know how stories are approaching ... and if I expect - everyone here will do. He / she surrenders, slaj.
