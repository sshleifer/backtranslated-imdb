David Lynch's story (1999) of John Roach's story / Mary Sweeney has been installed in Iowa and Wisconsin some time before the release of the film. We get into the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) at the end of life. His medical condition is poor, his life is behind him and he knows. What this makes what he chooses to do, even more wonderful and interesting. He decides (and every time in his film his name corrects through his actions) to put a few things on. Alvin is, at this time in his life, a person with a great experience but ordinary means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with the problem of speaking which makes communication a great effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it, because the story of Rose can't help but come out as the film continues. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of a journey. But if all trips are in a geographical state and in human terms. Earlier in the film, we begin to understand that this is an epic journey, which no old Alvin old age should do. But on the way, we learn slowly how Alvin has many features that enable it to achieve its impossible goal. Its goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and possibly dying and wants to visit him. He has fallen with him many years ago and have not talked for too long. On the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he does them and the benefits they get from knowing him is the essence of this film. We're coming to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film, we know who we are.
