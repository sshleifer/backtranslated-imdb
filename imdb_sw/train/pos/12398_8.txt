What was missing and Matrix's story is how things were in the real world. Say again, because this part of the story was covered beyond the foundations. What is very interesting is how politically it was, perhaps even a cheap shot in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things that one could think about the anti-horde of the robotic, which were meant to be no human servants. I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was developed by the idea of ​​an unknown. We as human beings tend to fall into that trap often, allowing the lack of logic and imagination gets us because people cannot believe the opposite. Sustained and put together, this is a true covenant of how ignorant people can be.
