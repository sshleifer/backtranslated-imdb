Well they have been a year and I am under review to the last film of 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) has been second in the recent Metro Manila film. As expected, it did not do very well at the box office as it was also very common for ordinary casual carers since MMFF is a season where many families come from watching movies. It was awesome to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English playing out of the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did all the good work as a star and director. His great vision and creativity helped this film. He was also very effective as a leading star and was able to describe the different emotions that were needed for the film. Also doing well was a little actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a good job showing Bikay, a young sister of Duroy. I hope to see him in many film projects in the future perhaps to indulge in other forms. I think that the fact that this film was in his native language has helped him a lot. Some image campaigns on films were done very well. The beauty was made even though I feel that if a little effort would seem quite different. For the story of the story I see that the authors can have more definitions in the lives of the lower characters in the film. I certainly won't raving on the story of this film.
