I enjoyed this film, probably because I didn't see any comments, etc.. It was fun and a bit of 'romp'. I don't know why you didn't do more than splash than it did. As far as the story goes, I could relate to certain aspects of Paul's character Reiser, and I could "see my father" in the Falk character. I did a lot of memories of the past when I was a child and listening to my parents too. If you enjoyed a movie like Old Grumpy Men or a Golden Wall, this is your movie. "Sleeping", in my opinion, and one of those stories feel-good. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many tussles of strange words, but nothing went by. I would say at least 8 levels, maybe higher.
