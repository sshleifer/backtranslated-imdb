Police story is a wonderful series of pieces to put on Jackie Chan to show her unique talents and courage. Some of the stunts here are among the best and most dangerous of Jackie all the fight with finale maybe Jackie's one big fight sequence, more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or drink Master at the end of the battle you can almost feel the pain of effect. But unfortunately the remaining film does not fit with this quality as a thriller of copi form instead of other comedy elements. I always prefer JC in the film as Project A where its natural talents reflect. In many of the other aspects of the Police Story it does not work for me. He said that although this is still on top of the best Jackies films due to amazing amazing work and great concert. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies to avoid the DVD version of dubbed English as it is a very large stick head down. Good / beautiful, start-up mirror is a good starting point if you haven't seen the movie JC before and well look at any of the movie 7/10 fan
