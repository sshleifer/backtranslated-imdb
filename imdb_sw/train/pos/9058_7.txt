I read this book in Grade 5 and now a few years later I saw a movie. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was thinking to eat food for 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms a day at 7:00 pm. 2.Billy thinks to get 30 dollars after eating all worms. In the film after Billy ate all worms, Joe should go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe thinks that some fake worms but in the film, they don't even have. Even though there are changes, this film is still one that children will enjoy.
