Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. It has been a very long time since it was seen on the film, and it's a movie what this was, it was 24 no, but it's very surprising, especially for pro like Michael Douglas who led as a secret partner of the secret Service. Kiefer's character is the expelling of Michael Douglas the entire movie, the partner of Kiefer, the Eva Longoria, the Desperate houswife. wow he can actually act instead of playing and always looking good, I would although Kim Bassinger had a greater responsibility, but moreover, I actually think the whole movie was blasting from beginning to end. This movie is what I think is a political excitement, everyone played its part. there is nothing revealed to sooon in the movie, so you can assume at all. and in fact I think Kiefer worked one here on this film, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had a performance of a series of days, thumbs up.
