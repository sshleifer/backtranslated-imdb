I only saw the first part of this series when it began to return at the end of the 90s and recently had the opportunity to view all three sites via Netflix (easy service through). Anything, I liked this lighter heart, sometimes challenging, mini series. The story of the little man fall of the old woman seems to work with all the artists alike. Yes, it has a romantic clich√©s to run the rain or train station, but the characters have the opportunity to be explored so it does not seem to be cheesy, if it would have been like this was Tom Hanks car or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separation-birth-born Scott Bakula does a good job of a man who is head on the heels with love and tap with a wave of disappointment and refusal gives us a success in the price obtained. Personally, I think the same series can be done with two periods, but that's about the discussion I think. It seems, there is a sequel, and that should come tomorrow via Netflix.
