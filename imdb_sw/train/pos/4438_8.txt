Director Edward Montagne gets at more than an hour what another film, more expensive and hyped fails to do. Mr. Montagne shows us the story of the police written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. while, not one of the best kind of type, puts the viewer involved in everything going on. <br /> <br /> This is a clear B movie type. In fact, the best thing that goes to the "Tattooed Physician" is the opportunity to take the road along New York's look at those years. William O. Steiner's show, or has been stored for years, or has been restored in love. <br /> <br /> There are good views of New York in the opening sequence. Later we are taken to Brooklyn in the Dumbo section and finally on a film trip to the Bronx area and Gun Hill Road and its memorial centers in the area. John Miles and Walter Kinsella worked on a big detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a botanist from the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who went to great things in his work, looked at the role of speaking. It was very fun to watch the city, as it was, because it is no longer.
