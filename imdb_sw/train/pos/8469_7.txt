I usually like this kind of Charlie Chan movie of the 1930s, and this is no different. However, something seems wrong with this film. The last attempt to switch from Fire-based movies was based on plot plans on the salad bar destroyed by the comedy aid which is like relieving pain feet. A typical book that appears to appear anywhere in English who is stupid who plays detective, and even other characters seem to be included in providing comedy aid. The plan may seem odd or unfamiliar to us today, but at that time the possibility of the basketball discoveries was not only real, but a common event.
