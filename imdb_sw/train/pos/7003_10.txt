The emotional impact of this movie makes words. It is elegant, cunning, beautiful, and all sadness is locked in two hours. This is Will Smith as he develops in his ability to act, his full scope. Who knew? I saw the Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this should be a fluke for blockbuster, over-top-actress, Smith. His exhibition in both movies shows another dimension for Smith, talent improvement, scripture choice, I don't know, but I see a difference to him now. The seven are one of these movies to fully enjoy its essence you should stop your faith. Don't look at the plot, look at the human heart's desire, both true and romantic. It is the story of human guilt, reconciliation, love, and sacrifice.
