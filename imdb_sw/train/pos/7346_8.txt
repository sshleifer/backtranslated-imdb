When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15 years old) I was fascinated! It has a completely different style compared to japan animation and I like it more.

With its dark pictures, the views of the strange animals and the sense of magic, it looks like one of the ancient Scandinavian stories, full of violence and terrible creators, colorful forests and heavy caves, inhabited by dragons, throlls, orks. and a wonderful hero to stop evil ...
