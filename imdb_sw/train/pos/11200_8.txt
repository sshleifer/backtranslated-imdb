This original film has its faults - a predictable plot and some of the most important events - but it is already clear to Hitchcock's leadership to edit and use powerful images. It is also among the most speakers of its stylistically films; A note, for example, a strange deviation that he uses during a party chain with regular echoes of head and plot in the picture. Its foundation, however, remains the last match, which is still among the most exciting boxing models of movies. Although you know that the hero should win, it becomes quite clear that he will lose, and his wife's movement from the corner of his champion, and stimulating to pay for the plot, is very well developed and match. The importation of the stopwatch makes what they should; you can almost hear ticking (although this is a silent film, the exhibition often has a feel to feel their hearing). The planning becomes very fast, and the viewer gets sucked in the excitement and brutality of all matches and sexual jealousy that takes place. <br /> <br /> Only DVD release which I am familiar to is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with Hitchcock's silence they have provided, they have integrated a variety of music, more orchistral, for action. Sound editing is often interesting, and the quality of the sound varies greatly, but some realistic service seems to have entered into the greatest choice, and the music that matches the final match works very well; it is not possible that this series will be the best that accompanies here. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting movie than current access to the show. It deserves a place of honor in the Hitchcock canon and a small list of suitable boxing films.
