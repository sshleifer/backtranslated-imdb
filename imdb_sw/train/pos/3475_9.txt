Being Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached two of us for a mix of fear and fascination. After seeing 'In His Life: John Lennon's Story', I was very worried that two of us would be no better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris will not see anything like John Lennon and Paul McCartney? even with some make-up and proper hair? did not help a little. <br /> <br /> but I was more than a little surprised. It is possible because of the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who ordered Let Uwe in 1970 and so probably knew John and Paul well, that the characters and discussions came as they persuaded as they did. (Our Two Loans are given to a man named Mark Stanfield, whom I do not know at all, I feel that the director Lindsay-Hogg had a little more to do with the script.) Two of us are not biography of Beatles; has a very limited program, in fact, and happens every day in New York City. What is doing is to think of a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, when John lived in New York. The meeting is totally false, of course? although it cannot really deny that the meeting was actually done. But through the dialogue that thinks it gives us a glimpse into the characteristics of these two musicians? their minds, their sense of humor, their distinctive response and skill, and beyond their all-relationships; what made them a big team, and what broke it. It is a movie talk, there is nothing except to talk between two characters for an hour and a half, it is possible to bear all but true fans of Beatles; but it's a piece of writing and story writing, and it's informative and touching. For those who are interested in these two music people, you will soon find out how shocked the actors seem to be from their peers and feel like John and Paul had lived? so close to lobby is the script, and so interested are executives. Two of us gives you an infinite understanding in the lives of two scholars, and a story that is sad and mysterious. Certainly it was proposed.
