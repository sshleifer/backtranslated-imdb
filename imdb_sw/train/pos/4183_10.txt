I had seen this film for a long time back, but I've found amazing and up to this day it has never stopped surprising. A beautiful movie that describes a group of Australian command groups who tried to sink Japanese Ships at Singapore port at WW2 height. These commands are taken in plain clothes and are considered to be spies and Japanese prisoners. But something that has not been so much in the WW2 mobile movie that I have seen. <br /> They begin to mutual respect, while the captain of the Australian soldiers have become the best widows and the Japanese prison guards. This is the most amazing part of the entire movie and it touches your heart. Recently, one day as two friends talk, Aussie's captain learns that other slaves will be tested and killed by the shipping of Japanese ships in Singapore. He says that it was his team and not that of others that had dropped the ship to his Japanese friend, and after hearing this Japanese defender says he should keep quiet if it could cause his whole group to be killed. But the captain still insists on this confession to the Japanese authorities / <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities judge them in a more respectful manner according to their laws. This is the highest honor given by Japanese fighters. This is the most amazing part of the film where Aussie's soldiers are waiting for their deaths close to the brutal destruction of the Japanese friendly watchmen who are still not willing to believe why his friend Aussie admitted guilty . <br /> <br /> I can't give the last here. But it's more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one with tears. <br /> <br /> For all, the best movie underrated that perhaps was not recognized that it is eligible for international. Get one copy today and count.
