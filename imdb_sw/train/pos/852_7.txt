MATADOR is a hit-movie movie lite .... if you can say so about a hit-person movie. Violence has never been shown but often brought. At first I was afraid I was in another rejead between the mid-90s 90s of the comedy gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark BUT was surprised to be surprised when I realized that this is just a beautiful and interesting story about friendship. There is no very exciting experience in this film but every little thing is stored. Three events have the best chemistry screens released in recent years and it looks like they had a good time to make this film together. The writing is sharp though you often felt like a script has been changed from a step-by-step because of one set of conversations. This is a good film that I probably don't remember for a long time but at that time it was perfect fun. Good movies.
