Yes this film is predictable and definitely not a prize-material. But it doesn't try to be anything that is not. Loss of happiness emerges with direct links to funny, stellar and very good performance by Peter O'Toole, calming and down to world performance from Joan Plowright. The performance of the band was on the spot, each with its role in attacking, interesting. Music was good though it was not good but saturated with a good film. Due to some of the negative views I have found that some delicacies went on their heads. A good example is a comment about the "amazing game of the baseball club", well my dear American, which was a cricket-from which baseball has been taken- by explaining to the US master's ignorant is very funny for those who know cricket. Also, you didn't have to delete when Carl struck the window; was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" earn more money for breaking and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also referring to money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must explain to others ... All in all I enjoyed and I was so laughing! Well worth seeing.
