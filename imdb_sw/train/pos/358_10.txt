The color of the color is on the struggle of life and love that helps those people most affected by the struggle of life. Each character had a purple color in them. Movie takes love, loss, hope, hatred, and victory. If Celie has lived in Hell and lost her sister, and Shug came to her life to show her love again, Albert was not a human being with the right to visit Celie, Shug rejected by her father and confessed her last, Sofia and her good and bad brain, and even Nettie, they had weaknesses and problems through the film but they failed at the end and that's a good film. Good jobs for all who are sent by staff.
