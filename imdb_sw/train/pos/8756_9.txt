I got this movie by accident on the cable in the middle of it and I had to hire it to see it complete and I'm happy I did. Once I was attracted to stories and caring about the girls involved. High school graduates, best friends since childhood, go to high school and are taken by a man named Nick who puts them into great trouble. They are used as a group of sacrifice in the heroin's fraudulent ring. They are taken into custody girls learn to cope with their imprisonment while trying to find a way out of their trouble. Everything that they are trying to help themselves falls when the Thai criminal justice system shows the shortcomings and girls are living in more trouble and losing their US lawyer "Yankee Hank". Hank stops trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the Thai woman of Hank's mother feels the mice in the case and is doing more than the foot of the investigation and sees that the girls actually were affected. At the end of the movie when Alice does an act of defense to save Darlene (Beckinsale) gave me a tear. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it.
