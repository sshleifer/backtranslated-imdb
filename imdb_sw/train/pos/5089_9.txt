True, it does not follow the book very closely, but it is still very entertaining to take the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided the "ignorant woman from the depths of the wilderness" shows many of us expected (see Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom"). At any rate, it is much more amazing than the pair of Richard Chamberlain's awesome Quatermain. It reminds a lot of west in many ways. The only thing I didn't care was anything, but I think it's part of that kind. If "how can you have a story of an African adventure without the teaching of witches and a wise predecessor?" Heh.
