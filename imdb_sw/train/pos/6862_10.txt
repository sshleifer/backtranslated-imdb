When people ask me why I like so many movies, they often answer, "you have seen a series of art art in De Palma wearing to kill?" The event alone, represents everything I want to see in the film. If I was a film director, that's the kind of thing I would like to do. "Fresh Style" is one way to describe the sequence, and it's amazing to see how the director De De Palma works in the modern art of the art. It's a dream of a dream, as clever like hell, and for more zest and more intelligent than a dozen films put together. I think the movie raises an important thing that will always be a fierce debate: do you? The film can only depend on the technique and is still considered to be the artistic achievement? The film has no message to say, acting is good but it is in the style of fashion, and the script is short on logic. De Palma's movie makes a very good case in which the style, while being handled properly, can maintain the film's length feature. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon offers good performances, but this is the movie's director to the end. It is a pleasant demonstration of the possibilities of the middle of the film. I will not tell you what Hitchcock's film boasts (I don't want to destroy any surprises), but I think De Palma goes through the arc of the story, and can create a film that shortens all his work. Not in a desperate heart!
