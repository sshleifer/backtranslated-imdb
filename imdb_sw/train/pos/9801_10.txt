The original shade of the Dark Knight returns to this adventure adventure adventure in which Mask's opponents of Phantasm in its cool. There is a lot of style and intelligence in the Mystery of Batwoman, beyond Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There are new crime fighters on Gotham streets. She dresses as a bat but she is not a whole batgirl. And Batman rejects any relationship with him. At the same time Bruce Wayne should deal with the usual romances and detective work. But Penguin, Bain and the inner Mob make things more difficult. I did not have much hope for this' un since very hard but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn t much more here!) but I enjoyed it with exciting and exciting pieces, clever plot and feeling of humor. This is definitely no movie no fan of Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a very interesting song called 'Betcha Neva' which looks in a way that is sufficient for the outside. <br /> <br /> It is a disgraceful DVD cannot be too much. Do not misuse there are a lot of features (short 'Chase Me' is amazing) with a very cool sound of Dolby 5.1 but ... movies are presented on Pan and Scan. Batman: The secret of Batwoman was developed and shot in 1.85: 1 but this DVD has been submitted to 1.33: 1 year in comparison with the color-colored sections shown on the features that IS photo has been cut off both. I find this very exciting to consider the Mask of Phantasm presented on the widescreen of widescreen. Warner had to reinstate several movies on the DVD because people have complained about the lack of the original Model Pattern found in other titles. Why did they choose to make the same mistake here again is more than me. I would like to give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings a total score to 4/5. It's a shame because a large glass can complete a big DVD bag.
