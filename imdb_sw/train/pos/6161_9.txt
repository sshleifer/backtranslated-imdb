Setting time for WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is fun to fill a fantasy for kids, with a teacher learning Angela Lansbury who, with the help of three children of evacuee and 'Hunting Professor,' hits Nazi invasion. <br /> Brilliant invention, cutting, this film will enjoy children of all ages and characters, exciting stories and interesting tunes. Lansbury is as perfect as Eglantine, a non-sorcerer who takes three children in a lifetime adventure, and his three-star boyfriend (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) also attract as Cockney supporters who help in the fight and Hun Hun rough. Specific effects are somewhat, but let's say, children don't care too much about these things, as long as they are interested. And welcome, they will be. With some amazing scenes that combine carefully the live action and animation for a great impact, and the more magic of the film than Harry Potters a hundred, it will be hard not to enjoy this amazing piece of run by the cinema. In fact, only the number of music offered by Portobello Road is the full complement of the film, but for some enjoyment, it can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> And moreover, any film shared by British TV story Bruce Forsyth as 'Flash' Harry style spiv is sure a good rating from me.
