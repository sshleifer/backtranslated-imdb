I should recommend reading a book before watching the movie. This book is a winning book of the Book Book of 1978 and it reads a lot (pun is not intended). It is not difficult to read for those who have not read so often so do not be afraid! This book seems to capture the desire of more relationships than the movie and the movie will make the most prudent after reading the book. After growing up in Melbourne I could relate to this book and the movie. A few Australian female authors were close to 70 years so very little written about the way of life for women in urban cities in Australia at this time or class. It is a valuable piece of the history of Melbourne. It is a shame that it is written as a kind of soft 80 soft film. It is far from it and if another auditor has mentioned it please do not read the DVD jack, it does not show what the film is approaching. Those who prepare the movie according to this information will only be disappointed. Just remember this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect Hollywood on the drama which seems to insert these days. This is what I like about it. It is also nice to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she is just as wonderful as Nora and is looking to look at her really acting, for if you are close to my age you will better remember her stints on Playschool and Better House and Garden. Who knew he hid this talent? This movie will give you a completely new impression. An ancient story of Australia!
