Many people know Paul Verhoeven as the most beautiful film director (and bad) sci-fi in Hollywood. But long before he was emerging outside his native country. The story is the foundation of fatale women, nothing new or amazing. Verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding a series of dreams, which instead of defining our main character and condition, is used only as a way to advance predictable plot. Screenplay was a stable, dialogue that helps the pad effects of the bland story. What made the movie be the least good was the hard work. Jereone Krabbe was as strange as "tortured artist", and supporters were good too. Also, the film of Jan De Bont adds at least some life to the film, and helps Verhoeven look at the least potential as a director. 0/10 / / * * / 1 / * * *
