I thought the movie "I Do They Do Not" was amazing. In the past I watched Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place" and liked to see them again in "I Don't Have". They have great chemistry together (I think that marriage in real life helps that!) - in their movie both the widow and the children and the work and they fall in love and try to combine their families already trouble the chaos together without leaving the ball. Of course they are caught, but they put together what is working and raising the family is high. Many people have been talking about this film - all good! - and the movie left us want more. This would make a great series - it's interesting for many years! - it would be very nice to see real life, down to the earth, to show a family like this depicting the realities of our life today - instead of what is known as "Reality TV" that all centers are destroying us with these days. Someone tells people in the ABC Family have a beginning of a new series here!
