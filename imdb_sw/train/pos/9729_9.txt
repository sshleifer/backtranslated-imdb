Put start, middle firm, finish with wonder. That's my feeling of this film, however. I loved Simon Pegg in two films I saw in Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, though, took it completely back. It shows its kind as an actor, but yet I did not like it very much as it was shown at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor that I call "comedy confusion". Its "Jokes" are required and wit is actually more short and painful. Much like the character of beans Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are other comedic characters who show similar characters too. I don't mean to beat here, so it won't be. But show that if you are like me, and do not love the hero and evil that is evil, Pegg shows such behavior for the first third of this film. It makes it better, however. <br /> <br /> Read somewhere that this depends on the true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The story of the film stopped despair, and it became a kind of "little guy" victory in the last three. I don't need all the films to be sugar and light â€” but unfortunately, if this film was better, it also started to have the most fun. It was also a pleasure to see a loved one of old, Jeff Bridges, playing the role of skill. I loved "Iron Man," but I was sad for the fact that Bridges bridges behavior was mad. Certainly personal taste, of course, if its acting in it was good. However, he was wonderful here as the Great Man of Vision Vision, the publisher of Sharps. It was good to see him in the role I was able to really enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked it! I just want to have 40 minutes at the weekend, and I have lost the first.
