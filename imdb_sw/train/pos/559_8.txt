Good films and - at the right time - a harsh, hitting, rather than dark way of reminding them of John Ford's advisers though not at all. Story begins quickly and does not allow, with several scenes of good conversation between (Stewart) Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is somewhat reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also the work of Mann-Stewart, but I found that it is very small and interesting. There are few buttons: too fast-fast (and instead of feeling) end up; The 24-year-old Corrine Calvert cannot be as much as a French boy with ignorance, and of course the film is done in the West of Mythic, a country of legends where the real laws of nations and physics are not used. But these are little concerns. James Stewart is amazing as a black, lost person who thinks he doesn't know anyone but himself, and the mountain environment cannot be beaten. Good match of Western dress.
