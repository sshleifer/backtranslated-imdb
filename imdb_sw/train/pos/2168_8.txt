I saw this film on television at the end of the last year, but it was an inclusive experience that sat with me to this day. Cluster may seem odd - due to an earthquake, secretive underground storage of poisoning agent in the mountains over a small town is broken, and a large amount of substances gets its way into their supply of food. The residents of the city begin to lose their self-control over every desire and desire that lurks around our minds from time to time, and that we usually know we must just do it. The speed of the movie is slow, but for me which has just been added to the increase in the decline if the urban behavior starts slowly. There are several surreal and exciting events that have remained in my memory this time. It brings interesting questions about what we can all be able to if we are dedicated to our feral nature. I enjoyed it? I don't know 'enjoy' is the right word. What? Make me think? Certainly. I still think about it. Horrible things.
