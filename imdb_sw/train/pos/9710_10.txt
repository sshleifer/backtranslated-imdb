This is what makes me proud to be Britain. This is the most funniest thing on TV. The league has Jeremy dyson, Steve pemberton, the title of the gatiss and the beautiful brass Reece. Absolutely underrated, this horror-comedy is perfect. Anime is iconic and amazing catchphrases, "Hello Dave". It is a comedy that everyone must look at. The best thing about the league's tops is that it's always clean, and always strikes. It does not need to rely on catchphrases (unlike UK slightly) for it is funny. The fact that the league has agreed to kill their famous and romantic characters, shows us that they have iron balls.
