Vincent Cassel has a part of Paul, a former office worker where he meets Carla, a completely deaf secretary, when he has his help to hear in the deaf? while not (play with Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help develop as people. What's more interesting about this film was the hardest of the characters? is not suitable in a clear situation. Paul seems to be bad in the office environment, is that he not only cut out of work? This belief has been rejected when it gets on the bar and shines. The movie has some amethystations that I find to restore and show how easy to commit a crime act, even if we think it is legitimate or just. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a full-time film 'both touching and exciting. One is when Carla uses the baby and tries to comfort the child who is shouting. He keeps doing it? but it takes the hearing material for its own comfort.
