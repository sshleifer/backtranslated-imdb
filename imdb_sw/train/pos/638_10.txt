For anyone who can imagine this show is not for them, please try. The television network has led to the exhibitions which are clones of clones or are the basic performances from other uncertain people. This period is the return of TV directed to families where emphasis is on learning life lessons, learning what true friends and family are on, and maybe even learning a little about our national time. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most active young people in today's business, and he is fully beaten as a young boy, who is a new slick Kingdom of New York (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storms round out of the main cast, and all are unique. This view deserves a chance to be infected and seen. We hope it will continue to move around for a few seasons and we can look at the Young Pete (characteristic of Sumpter) to learn and grow.
