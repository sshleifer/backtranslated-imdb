The film is designed to affect the audience and this film has left me without saying. The beauty of photography and well-being and dialogue that approaches the film poems involves greed, hatred, murder, rape, theft and fraud. It sets the edge of the network you have left me cannot take my eyes off the screen until you reach credit. Stories spread. It takes viewers from the evil of the Spanish Civil War to humanity left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two small actors who command screenshots. Assisting players is best cast and give real credit. Sets, lights, settings and movies are amazing. I totally love the picture.
