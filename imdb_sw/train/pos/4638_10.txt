I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. My Hebrew is not correct, so the headlines were very important, I didn't feel lost at any time in the movie. You like to be used for subtitles after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie hit me off !!!!!! It shows two of the most famous monuments in the Middle East today: The homosexual relationship between Israel and Palestine. It allows a person to enter both situations at the same time. Trouble, feelings inside. The movie climaxes in a tragedy when angry and angry driving one of the lovers on one side of the cruelty! you must completely see !!
