Welcome to the whole film takes place in public bathhouse in China. There is no set of concepts, explosions or delightful people - just good to write, act and direction (Hollywood, discover!). The son who was a stranger returns home when he believes his father dies. She wonders to see that the father looks good and keeps running the family business as usual. In fact, he finds that his father and his lost brother have built a close and caring relationship and soon becomes apparent that he is out of the loop! The father is traditional and this child visits the capital and does not see the value of the old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is unique and reliable. I was delighted to see that not every Chinese movie is a picture of action (such as those looking at Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Secret Dragon), since I don't care particularly for these frenetic films. Shower with Springtime In Good City are two wonderful examples of beautiful Chinese films about PEOPLE!
