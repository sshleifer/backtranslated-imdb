This is a CGI animation film according to the French 2D animation series. The series came out briefly on the Cartoon Network, but his flight was too short to be his one of Oscar electors for the best film this year left many people I know to go "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, cardiovascular heartbeat, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, which with Hector's fires of the dragon, becomes like a dog. Traveling the world to provide their services as a hunter of the dragon but he never did. In their life comes Zoe, the story of the boy's love of the king who is going blind. It seems the world is destroyed by a huge monster and all of the knights that the king has sent did not come back or if they return to return as ashes. To despair the king employs the hunter of the dragon to prevent the world of eating. Zoe of course tags together ... What can I say and why this film hides under the rock? This is a very good film that is not very suitable for radar unless it is a defendant of Oscar probability. Its a beautiful, amazing film (The world is occupied by surrounding countries and creatures of creation) which have often done me "Wow" there. The English voice has been sent by Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best voice sounds I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (thinks Steve Bucsemi) is the first level. It is also a script that does not speak to its audience, using real-life words that are not usually heard in animation films (not Disney or Pixar). Its all done well. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits go very long, but at the same time it is a great entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you get the opportunity to see this. It is one of the best films from 2008, and continues on my list of good surprises for 2009.
