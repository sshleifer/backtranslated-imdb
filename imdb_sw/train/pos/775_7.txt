It's a wonderful story, but somehow interesting, about love. My people, I have never run on that story of deviation in real life. But, I can see the picture there. It is a story that proves to be "sick" from the head. But, after looking at it, I didn't have this feeling of "disease" that I would have about social laws. It is a good thing in this film ... an amazing thing ... that I can't contradict and use any code of ethics or society. <br /> <br /> Movie takes into consideration the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, goes on and finally ends. You feel at a time when this love is producing, the first concern, touching. You feel the connection. And no time I though this is fornication. You also hope that it will not die at the end .... you can't break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of a broken hart at the end ... But, I also need to add a negative spin to these comments ... I don't know if the story is not somehow * demonstrated * to give the impression that this relationship is just sick in form, but not in content. You have no general stories, but just pieces. When the movie started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was ready. Therefore, there is no clue about the relationship status. You just feel the tension between them ... fight between the need for love and desire to break this relationship. I think Kiki's line to Sandu says all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do if I ask you." <br /> <br /> This film can cause some questions about What? What love is and have values ​​... and where to limit them. I don't know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers all ... even social standards and values" or "love is good ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this film has already succeeded for a simple reason that makes you think ...
