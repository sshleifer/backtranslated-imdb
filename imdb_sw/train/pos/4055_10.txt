This film is amazing and I would like to recommend to children and adults alike. Animation is good, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is interesting; better than anything that the American studio produced at that time. However, there are several monuments in this statement. It is a disgrace that Disney bought a back list of Studio Ghibli and then continued to wipe it. My main thing is, Disney again wrote the film, despite the original English version of it. Produced new by Van Der Beek et al impaired and taking off very interesting of the characters.m. Pazu and Sheeta came out of ignorant friends to the best color. The original music logo is also better than the Disney remix. It asks you a question why Disney made that change? It seems to me that with Van Der Beek and al cast then Disney can draw more money, which is fair enough, but in their painted film process. It's still a good film and still I would recommend to anyone. My great pig is that Disney has destroyed the film from the childhood I have loved and still love it. I am fortunate to have original Japanese imports and original English dub which I will now keep with my life!
