The interesting story of 2 people crosses the way if they are preparing for their wedding. The former police officer and a public school teacher are faced with this beautiful york situation, although they are married to other people.

And hey for guys - sell angle Natasha Henstridge, and gals - to sell romance r computer, everyone wins!
