Okay, first and foremost I got this movie as now Christmas so it was free! First - This movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3D. It's for the most part, but at any time the main character is located in his car movie falls to 2D! What?!?! It's not hard for the film in the car! SECOND - Story is not very good. There are many bad things with it. THIRD - Why show all deaths at the beginning of the movie! It made the movie enjoy any time going to be killed !!! Look for a good laugh, but don't waste your time to buy. Just download or something for cheap.
