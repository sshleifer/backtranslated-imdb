I will begin to say I have been very excited about the top of Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please do not destroy it by doing the following years from now or prequel. Leave us alone. Right ... keep up. As talented and confident as Matt Damon is ... it looks like he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed with the third phase. It stays with what works and adds a little more. I was so happy to see how all the information we get in 'Identity' and 'All' are on 'Ultimatum' to finally draw a full picture of Jason Bourne. The process of action is fast and puts you on the edge of your seat. The struggle between Bourne and the killers is always enjoyable. I've been a fan of movies circulating CIA agents and how CIA collects their Intel and this movie fits on the same road, making it even exciting to me. If you'd like to watch Bourne Ultimatum without checking the previous 2 tests you will still like to enjoy movies but still I would recommend you look at them first. This will allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and to be connected to being part of his world. This lets you appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I don't know it's better than the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' may, just MWE, have an edge when comparing trilogy.
