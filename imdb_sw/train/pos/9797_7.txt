Batman: The Secret of Batwoman is the most recent Batman video on video / video DVD released. (Spoilers Few Before) The program involves almost a new criminal offender, Batwoman, who appears to be involved himself, for any reason, in stopping a large weapon of weapons. Although movies are not enough, it's not like 'Mask of Phantasm,' 'Sub-Zero,' or 'Return to Joker.' The main reason is that it does not provide the emotional appeal that other movies did. At the end of this film, we don't feel anyone like we did to others, in particular, 'Low Zero'. There is no real tragedy that made some movie animations for us. Even Batwoman is not a 'bad' character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm were). Not only, but Batwoman's decision seems to be "very shocking" and not so bad that the observer is not particularly concerned about what has happened to him that has caused the mask or what happens to him at the end and therefore there is a great reason we do not get an emotional appeal. Do not get wrong, I got an enjoyable movie. It has its time, as well, when viewers know who is Batwoman who is real and sees the return to the villain who appeared last in the 'Batman: Series Series'. The action is also enjoyable and at some point a lot of emphasis. <br /> <br /> As the history of Batwoman was more interesting, this film would be better than the 'Return of Joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4 (out of 4). <br /> <br /> About the animation, it is similar to the cartoon of New Batman Adventures from mid-late 1990s. The mark is not remembered as the previous batman 3 previous movies, but it's still good. I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its errors, it's fun. But just remember, it is not the same as other Batman animation movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
