Taking on the Street Address (1953), led by the film's Samuel Fuller, has an amazing opening that creates two problems. Pipi's rider (Susan Peters) is hit by Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark has been included in Sinatra cool shades). He does not know that he carries a significant microfilm; McCoy does not do it. Both of them do not know that they see two federal agents. So grift puts the course of skill. Sweets are looked at twice (Luke and the police) and therefore are not available; Skip, a very small thief, does not know, followed by federal agents; feds, they all know, eventually do not help. He cannot stop "passing" to government secrets or the spread of Communism.
