I love this part of Columbo. Maybe it is because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is as wonderful as the secret writer of Abigail Mitchell, the American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is a delicious look like a perky writer, lovable who got a great loss when her nephew died in a crash accident. She blames her husband's husband, nephew. He plans to kill him to take revenge for his death since police left him. I would like to love someone other than Mariette Hartley playing Veronica. I never did like Hartley for anything private. And in fact with Columbo, there are some laughs as when he asks Veronica in a dimba-dancing class. Ruth's Ruth is very foolish and she resembles a call and Columbo has always played with surprise by Peter Falk.
