It may not have been awarded professional prize and indeed, it is very good, but it's very fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Loved, optimistic, and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a good way to delete. Even though I Like Wonderful Best, The Bogus Journey is funnier to me. Death is a hilarious flippin and Bill and Ted love more. People give me sadness for loving this film, but only wise proponents of the film will say it is not even entertainment. If you would like this, you may also be a fan of Wayne's world, Dude where my car, and dumb and dumber. Accepting, though it is folly, makes you grin and turn your box. Therefore, look for them for captivity and hard!
