I have never seen this program before even though it came too much for my family members. Happily, my partner lives in Hadfield (the scene of photography) and showed several marks when I first visited. This was my interest and so I bought the first series on the video and I sat up. In addition to identifying some areas, I found myself not a little surprised. Once again the BBC was responsible for producing another model of the world's best comedy. TLOG comes easily with Red, Red Towers and Monty Python as perhaps the best. It is worth saying I have appeared in the app now. The characters are the best and show the depth of the time when you remain the edge of the truth. The appearance and feel of the program is complete and expresses the feelings of sometimes north (without respecting the Hadfield which I have had a chance to invite and very warm). I only hope that it develops its origin in its flight (which depends on the series of 2 which concluded its return to the UK last night, it certainly is).
