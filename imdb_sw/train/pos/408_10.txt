I can't tell you all I love this movie. I have read a review that says that this argument is "also combining" or "like swimming in cement drying". I say that these viewers have no ideas! For anyone who loves Fiction Fantasy, this film is for you. If you have ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this film is for you, (especially if you're logged in to the East Adventures) I'm just sorry I didn't come to see this movie on the big screen. (More motivation to get my own screen t.v. :-)
