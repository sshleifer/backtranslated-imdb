While browsing the Internet at the original sale prices, I fled this comment. Why are all so bad? It's a unique movie and not a sex image. I got this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I am always happy with it. I have shown them to many of my friends and all they loved too. I feel the privilege of possessing this original Shirley's 1932 black and white film before becoming popular or special. After reading other comments, I agree that the film is "racy". Great plan! I just liked it a long time. It seems that I must be the only person who has this nature, by selling at least, so I wonder how much worth it is?
