Since teaching Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps someone who likes to find the synch and her female side is very enormous. I have never believed his behavior in the hands of a small actor, but Walters takes away with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives its best performance now in male leadership.
