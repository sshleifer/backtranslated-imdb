'Luzhin Defense' is a good film, but a lot of novels and not a film of films shining. It felt through many films that characters have been helped to push notes. Marlene Gorris could probably examine the psyche of Luzhin, instead of showing him as an innocent victim who was misled by the wrong motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adopting books to the screen is a clear task hard, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film is not widely available in the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's tension and mother are full of disagreement with mother and mother instead of a big flashpoint in the film. I felt that I passed through the pain of Luzhin and the end of the horrible, without receiving the pleasure of having an extraordinary and difficult personality. However, this was a moving and fun film but certainly not a big one.
