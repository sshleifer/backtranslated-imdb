This film was modern. I did not laugh at them for a long time. I mean, not "Good Hunting," but it had to be? I really got into the top investigation you expect very little and I was very happy. Comedy facing hard and is normal. Amanda Peet is hot and amazing. All the audience I watched and seemed to enjoy the film as I did.
