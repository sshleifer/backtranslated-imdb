I loved BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought that you had to feel the performances and that it was given the Collora space could make a good film. This trailer did not give you exactly the same feeling. The story line, or the line of the story, the best possible but due to the effectiveness of the specific and special effects left me feeling like this could make a good film or television. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not a good Superman. In fact I thought he, for his short appearance, made Clark Kent respectable. Sorry, just think of SuperMan as that buff. Kent's suit was wearing its size. Batman can have the body of the creator of the body but not Superman. Supes are toned of course but not quantity. However, I did not care about everything and change it from Kent to Superman seemed cheezy. Now this may be just O'Hearn's fault, Collora can take some credit to poor scripting and direction. Secondly, the special effects of flying were cheezy. Superman is going to the sky. If it was obvious that the Superman had climbed to the ground, with telephone cables and buildings on it. I don't think there were full shots of the body of the flying Superman. In fact connecting with the trap focuses on O'Hearn must be in its low torso. It was all good trailer. I would like to see a film, if it's done, and it would certainly make it on television. Story story, the collaboration between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, the jealous Superman of Lois by Wayne, Lex and Twoface are trying to beat Superman and connecting power between Batman & Superman is good. I am sure the big budget and the adoption of the full Collora and the company, even O'Hearn can provide a good film. Indeed one is better than most of the comic pages from Hollywood soon.
