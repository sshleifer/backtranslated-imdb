The verse, of course, is from the Lord's Prayer - "Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven". Sweden, especially in their north, is not my idea of ​​heaven -30 degrees C cold winter is a little less for me, but good people living there undoubtedly think it is God's land. <br /> <br /> Story story here is normal. International international singer Daniel lacks health care in the middle of work, returning to a small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Recommended by the local pastor to help with the church church, he returns to some impossible talent in the class act, and he enters the competition in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the band "Brassed Off" models of "Calendar Girls" and "Full Monty" players. But of course it is caused by emotional concern as some of the most affected villagers know the value and rebellion against their opponents. He is faced with hate men and the pastor who is increasingly worried, but nothing but death prevents him. Though some stories of corny, we know and as many characters, they come as people instead of caricatures in spite of many of them being identified "forms." I wondered about the wife-beater being punished for long? Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty much desperate (he was also limited to being one of the young heroes of Daniel) and the pastor of puritanical and secret passion for the girlie magazines was just a little of the exhibition, but realized by the amazing Niklas Falk . Michael Nyqvist is just amazing as Daniel, a weak but runner, and there is also good music too. I was coming for two hours. Finally what you are doing, I think, but it's not a destruction to say Daniel does what he did to do.
