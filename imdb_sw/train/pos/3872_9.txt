After seeing this small and interesting film, you will feel better. Enjoy Yves B. Pelletier being born at this very popular movie, that according to me, will be recognized as the 2004 movie in Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon both act touch. I would like to compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives those who Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain has given me. So if you have a favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet film, I would like to say that you should also like the first film from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
