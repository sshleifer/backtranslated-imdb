Some critics found that this film was broken, but for me there was enough humor and hope to win this feeling. For example, the stability and stoic behavior of the daughter is still a film station, often combining non-fun things to put up with plans. The video is full of ideas and original characters, and the end result is unpredictable: I felt it could go any way. The way, new ideas that I have read use good black and white usage, but the publication I saw, has been shown on the SBS TV network in Australia, with full color. <br /> <br />
