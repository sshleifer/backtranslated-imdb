About a year ago I finally left the US television. I thought of leaving the TV until a friend who lived in the UK showed me programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder, and Lords League. It was that I decided to switch to British TV. Among all the exhibitions listed above, the Lords League is the easiest and darkest for all, giving a sense of guilt and material that is not available on any other comedy that I have seen yet. Participants include many unhappy couples, a butcher who lays an ingredient in an unhealthy meat (perhaps for better), a happy couple who look at a local shop that is only available to local people, and the worst animals ever. This plan is one of the best I have seen.
