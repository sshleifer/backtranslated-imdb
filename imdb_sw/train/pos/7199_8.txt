Sidney Bruhl viewer (Michael Caine) has had a series of flop after a great hit. He accepts a play by his pupil, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) which is wonderful. It is very well Sidney says he will kill for it. What? He? Thriller of someone who thinks. It was an original game ... and shows. It's about setting one and all talking but I was never bored. It is very well written and happens with a lot of good cast. Caine is just as good as Bruhl - one of its beautiful performances. Reeve is, amazingly, very good. I have never thought of as much as the actors, but he is very good in this role. Dyan Cannon is surprising for the role played as a wife of Bruhls. Irene Worth is also good (and it's quite funny) as Helga Ten Drop, psychic. However, his inspiration got my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet does very well and put him one. The camera keeps moving and focusing on your mind. My only complaint is that two gay partners in this film are turning out to be fighting with society and also has one of the most absurd kisses I have ever seen - but these are good complaints. <br /> <br /> good fun. Critics hate this film (for some reason) and it seems to have been completely lost since it started in 1982. That's very bad - it deserves better.
