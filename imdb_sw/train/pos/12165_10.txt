Frownland is one of the most embarrassing situations where you are going to laugh at the wrong time; and only when you realize that you should not laugh, you have ever reached the top of the sound of the voice; and when you look around with white gray faces and their open mouths and glazing eyes, you feel the crash from the beginning of your stomach and suddenly rush to your throat and ... well, you get sure But for all its unpleasantness and punch in the face , Frownland, in fact it is a wonderful work that, after looking at the unknown odds of the main character and all its pathetic problems and mishaps, makes you want to delete your own eyes and at the same time, you feel bad for it. It would be very easy for me to walk out of Ronald Bronstein's film, but for some insane reason, I felt the powerless decision of staying the course with all of the nature of the nature of which the film should provide. If someone puts you on fire, you usually want to put it out: Stop! Stop! And Roll! But with this film, you want to watch the fire for breath to insert your whole body. You end up pain - perhaps no matter what, or an unidentified weakness of the eyes that cannot even begin to try to explain. Unfortunately, the usual movie will not allow this movie to come to the theater near you. But if you have a chance to use it, prepare yourself: make a doggie bag.
