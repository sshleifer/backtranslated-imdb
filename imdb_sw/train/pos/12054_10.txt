I first saw this film here U. in December 1989 when the main TV opens. I still have a video tape, although I am exhausted (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed and have also been pulled by it!). However, I remember returning home that night, taking a Christmas hippo, leaving the lights out and checking what was announced as 'Christmas Story'. Even now I recall some events that still send hair on my neck that is standing at the end of the ... \ t stalk and string, which is laughable. This is the 'traditional' story of the soul; there is no great budget or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, no free sex events, no chaos or guns etc ... So it's fun! It's an atmosphere. If you would like a bad fear, well written, well done and a really awesome scenario, this is your film. I love the original fear; just last night I saw the original haunting and that's a very good movie. Weather again - and so is the Black Woman. The end of the film differs from the book, but it is still very good. I recommend. Try ... you * would like it if you would like traditional spiritual stories ... SO ... turn off lights, turn fire, install doors, drink drink ... and enjoy ...
