I think this is not the best film that has been made but I voted on 10 stars the same. Especially because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were just touched. This is something that you often feel. We all begin to worry and feed on more of feelings, sluggishness or preaching in modern films. The story of the movie stations near Jane's young woman in the final stages of MND and the growing friendship between Richard, the person close to the breakdown. This can be very easy and a piece of merit but it is humorous, humane and missing in sentimentality that defeats you completely and against the odds is the movie feel good. Acting from Branagh and Bonham-Carter is the best of the last who is always a believer with a strong role in his role. Chemistry between two also raises the movie. This name comes from the center of Richards, a bird-made junk and its old paintings. Jumping here is a sign for both Richards and Janes life for a perfect life so that one can continue and another can cope with the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and beautiful movie that I would recommend to anyone. do not let that matter.
