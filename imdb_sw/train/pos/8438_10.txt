HLOTS was the best series, what the NYPD Blue will never be, for HLOTS plots are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back like a movie, connecting all the loose ends, it was good to have all the group back together, even a few dead show up (still say how) the storyline was fast paced, emotionally and full of soul spirit had weekly and week out. Kill, Life on the Street, Web Player in its BEST !!!! 5 STARS! The pieces of UP and All. Thank you NBC for giving us Finally we did not find!
