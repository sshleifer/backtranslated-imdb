Mendez and Marichal have given us a thorough, painful, and bitterly disrupted crisis of social, spiritual, economic and political crisis which the 108 years of colonialism started in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with generous people I have met and because because our nation refuses to respond to its royal duties, the people of Puerto Rico are allowed to grow and die ... The spiritual crisis that the colonial state of Puerto Rico has created, if it weakens family, and primary institutions that develop any community. Corruption has spread to the extent that people do not care to pay taxes (which led to the financial crisis in this country) and the feeling of reluctance and distrust become more of the island's culture. Fortunately, the grant allowed this to hurt yet a powerful film produced. It should see it. . .
