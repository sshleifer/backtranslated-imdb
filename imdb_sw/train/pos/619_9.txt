I expected this movie to be beautiful and maybe a clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I've never heard of it until now) played a very good man to lead; he was so passionate and romantic, I and my friend who saw the movie and I was totally beaten with love. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I like before (loved her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more. His acting was strange, I could not even say that he was America. Chemistry between him and Charlie Cox was very good, cast was completely complete. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were similar to cast well; DeNiro as a gay pirate ... worthless, precious. I laughed very much in one place where Septimus comes to the ship ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I loved him as a happy mother in Hairspray. But he had a good amount of melodrama and snide views on the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was interesting (but not a stick-stick quite!), romantic, special effects was not quite regular but when they were, they were great; wasos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves wonderful movies like Bride or even Lord of the Rings. Set my mind all the time and I will be buying a DVD when it comes out!
