I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. I had heard of this film, but not any comment on it. I say, I was impressed by what I saw. I was actually being excluded from a certain place and I remember jumping on my seat a few times. <br /> <br /> Blob was scary looking. Now, I'll look at the jelly jar and wonder if you'll latch yourself on my hand. Steve McQueen was very good like Steve Andrews, the film's main character. I also loved an old man at first. <br /> <br /> With the movie's horror of 50, this had made even better with today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
