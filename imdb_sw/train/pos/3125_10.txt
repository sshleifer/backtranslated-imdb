Review of Bourne Ultimatum (2007): After two exciting sets, we get the final phase. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> Ultimatum of Bourne has all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coating of those who know everything. He has been driving for so long. This time, it is complete. <br /> <br /> The Ultimatum of Bourne has a good plot, amazing surprises, amazing patterns, insist, and some of the best summer moves. Matt Damon offers its best performance so far. He has the feelings and patience of the killer concerned. There is a sense of humor here and some doubt. Events of certain events will laugh (in a good way) or enjoy. (or both) I heard a sense of laughter in the playground and lots of applause. The audience was interested. The Bourne budget offers all in a well-funded fund. All products and then some. That's in my opinion the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: the best conclusion. Best of trilogy. This is what the summer movie shows should be done. I wish the trilogy of Bourne.
