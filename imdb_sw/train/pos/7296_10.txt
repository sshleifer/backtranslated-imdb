There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both of them are a series of police about violent crime. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler fields are very simple. The craft is more complicated ... The view is more like the Great Prosecutor, if we should see the comparison ... The main character is weak and weirdo, but we have "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just relaxing? Also interesting, people write Fortier looks of America but, on the other hand, say they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's a language, or a spirit, but I think this series is English more than America. By the way, executives are good and interesting. Acting is not the highest ...
