Flavia (Borinda Bolkan's "Do Not Miss" the name of "Duckling") is locked away from the desire for physical desires with her father. Enduring all the grief she sees around him (rape of a young woman in sexual desire, sex, horse horses) Flavia decides to escape from a meeting with a Jewish friend from outside, Abraham. The two are not far away before they are arrested and then returned to persecution and forced to repent. After the punishment he joins the band of Muslims called Tarantulas, who had invaded the first meeting and led by a meeting that was not changed to the shorter blood war after the walls of the tribes. "Flavia Hatetic" is a piece of Italian-well-known and undefined destruction. This film is very ugly and frightening. The work is good and the characters are well done. In general, the "Flavia of Appeal" is a truly moving and intricate movie with a lot of dirt and gore. You can't go wrong with 8 out of 10.
