I don't watch so many TVs, except for Soups, Gems, Entourage and E! I think I consider this show for a good company. <br /> <br /> I like a good review of pop culture which this show offers. Soup also helps me stay on what people in the office mention when talking about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). The best part is that Soup shows the most important parts of these shows, which are often funniest or more difficult times (c'mon, many people get hooked in watching American Idol because of the freak show which is inspection), that's why many claim to look. And that means, I don't necessarily suffer in other ways 98% of these numbing conversations talk or "reality" shows, for one nugget of "funny" or "shock." The only reason why the soup does not get 10 in my opinion is sometimes not exciting, and with a casual event, definitions are not always. But they can't all be at home running either, if so, the soup won't be on E! Joel's fast and typical way to Soup (which includes McHale) makes for a great show. I am enjoying fun laughter and comments from your employees off-camera. Even when they are clearly exposed to providing regular laughties, it is hilarious because it is forced. They are definitely being awesome. And that's part of what makes this show funny.
