Some people have said that as the 11th season, South Park has started a trend to stop their satire of political blows for poor spoofs; but this can't be more from the truth. <br /> <br /> When this part takes a series of Dead Dead, there is more. It is a sata of how people treat the homeless. People say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They want to be human." This period attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often less fortunate. So yes, it's still satire, and also a good spoof. What? What do you want more?
