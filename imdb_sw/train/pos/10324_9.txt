A delightful piece of the 30-year period, is a spin on a series of classic cliffhanger, as well as "Lote Boxers", just done on a small budget with multiple cameras and director Michael Anderson. Opening events reduce the amount of gothic nuveau art, preceded by Batman for two decades. He played with Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a well-fitted and well-dressed hero of Pamela Hensley as Mona's local latina identifying our hero on gold in non-American Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, with a fist for his chin as you expect to have pity on him and hug him: "Mona, you are a brick!" Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain's sea is a perfect joy. He expects a little "Raiders.", The dash of "Batman", a little "Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a lot of campiness and you just get right. Look for favorite devotion to Michael Berryman in a small part as an undertaker and enjoy the use of the campy of John Philip Sousa patriotic music. The main candidate for the release of DVD, certainly decreases. Treat the impossibility for the whole family. 9/10
