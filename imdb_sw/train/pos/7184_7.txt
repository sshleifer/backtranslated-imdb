I really like this show, but I saw the second part. After looking at the first part I could see why people were first removed. The first humor of the part is not good, and they are struggling to get started well. However, I still love the view of light and humor of the show. Participants further develop after that period and become truly enjoyable characters. As the first part, it is not recommended to accurately rest the show that is quite realistic. That period is not bad in any way, but if the show will continue to be better and better, so check out more periods before passing the judgment on the quality of the show.
