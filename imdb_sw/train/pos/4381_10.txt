This widespread game has all: a high performance of acting, a wonderful picture, a good story. It is often comparable to "Braveheart" because both movies are held in historical Scotland. Although I would like Braveheart, I think this is the best of two films. Jessica Lange gave a wonderful performance (she must have been chosen for Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the role of the head. Tim Roth is one of the worst, worried, characters in film history (selected for Oscar). John Hurt is as good as Lord Montrose, another unpopular character. I always wonder about the different types of characters that John Hurt can play. This is the story of the crisis on money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a man, who cannot solve his problems with Montrose if it violates its meaning. Montrose, who has inherited his head, has no sense of respect. And that's really all this story is about; The respect of the ordinary person against the corruption of honor. This movie is very entertaining, should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite films.
