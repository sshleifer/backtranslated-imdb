I admit that I did not know what to expect before you saw that highly recommended piece. It can be a cure for a zombie virus or a common cold for all I knew. It started with many illustrations, small snippets to grab your attention and cause your wild run. As I continued, I learned quickly in a voice about what had happened. A nice little story of neo noir that I felt not a waist for a few minutes at my time. A few symptoms given to viewers through the exhibition at the beginning give you a sense of success when they climb together a plot. With a good loss at the end it is a cooling package in general. The result, though not bad, gave the film almost feel the music video. Just feel a little dated, not add anything to continue the storyline. Some of the exhibitions felt very serious but perfectly effective and feel for a whole piece. I'm going away with this very satisfaction. I was given a lot of information in a short time but through a great editorial voice and a voice voice sound did not feel run or influenced. Good work!
