I remember seeing the tips of this show before appearing back in 1993. I was at the same time, and now at the age of 22 it feels to have a sense of start to start and finish this service and look back to it. of a sudden appearance too far, is a good decade. However I was watching MonsterVision all the time, as I am a big fan of monster flicks and awesome films. It was like the 90th edition of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get a DVD why not show Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was the most interesting and informative. Many views and opinions of Joe Bob on the film were just hilarious. Most of the movies shown on the show were B or C grade but showed many films such as Hammer films from the UK that have become more popular as well as most of the hometown of Ray Harryhausen. Many were wonderful supporters that you can't see anywhere like Sci-Fi's movie movies instead of Godzilla which is known to almost everyone with independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new duration of films and the most intelligent directors, I think MonsterVision will be a good show for IFC to take, for they already have to hit and show IFC grinding homes. I am sure that this show will be taken again for the old reason some day, I think you'll have to wait and see. Until then "that's a big TV"!
