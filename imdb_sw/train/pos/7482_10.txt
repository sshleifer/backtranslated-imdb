"Vanilla Sky" was a highly thought movie. Or say, "Abre Los Ojos" thought well. I watched the film at the end of one night, excited about what came. I had no desire. At the end of the film, I was cracking. I couldn't remove my thoughts. Any idea of ​​it just hit me. At the end, it was more surprising than Shyamalan could do. The plot line was also something that made me interesting through and through. Sent, good. It was close to a wonderful film. The kind of movie you can watch again and get everything new. I have seen four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever.
