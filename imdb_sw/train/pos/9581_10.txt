This film document Harlem ball cycle eighty years. The happiest Over Palazzo Volpi, although as patients, this film is a real gem of dirty environment. One can help but compassion and characters because of their freakness. The sole purpose of the elite of the middle class is the phenomenons of rubbish and glitz. Here many genius are very well-documented and legally honored. The characters' great influence for the idolatry of all is glamorous to encourage more worship of the characters themselves on the part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of innovation" effect that makes this film a piece of art.
