All I can say is, the first movie this season had my mind. I took it because of the participants, Gere and Claire, and the story seems to be promising. There are terrible scenarios, indeed ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our truth, these things happen at this time. And there are experts who are trying to change things and do things better and who are laughing about the dedication for that reason. Really I can feel feel "Hollywood touch" in the movie .. and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard did a great job, and they deserved 10 from me.
