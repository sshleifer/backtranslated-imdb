I am writing this after seeing the Holy Son in the Gay Film and Gaming Film Movies in Sydney, Australia. When their father dies, two brothers who emerge meet at the funeral and after discovering the death of the brothers who die from AIDS, they are on a journey to encourage the heart of reconciliation. They both lead to doing a good job of creating warmth and developing processes between them as the movie continues. I have one qualm about the movie though - when a brother who dies dies a disease, he didn't look at it. A person of 4 T4 cells would be very sick - even working to make the actress look sick. Gripe small, but one that makes it a bit less true. Although one small gripe, Holy Son is a good movie and you should have the opportunity to see it. I hope to release the DVD next time!
