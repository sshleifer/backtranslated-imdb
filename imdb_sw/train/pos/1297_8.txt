The exchange of credibility of French and interesting novels of a middle-aged player with a problem (or something), relying heavily on the details of the first person but none of the worst. Limitations (in a small way to bourgeois), filosofi and black humorous, the best way I can describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like the most intelligent Charles Bukowski (no ignore CB focus). Mordude funny, but also a sharp analysis of social and sex relations, the great success of the film is that it shows real life in an acceptable way to make you ask: why is not another film like this? One of the rare examples of a good book to make a good film.
