The old horror movies are fascinating, many blows, many voices, and great humor to go with them. "Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) has a boy who tries to be a hero in his town. Going to date with her girl is usually for all young people. But when an old man sees the same thing that falls to the sky, he becomes a victim, and Steve helps him out of all he can. At that time up to the power of the youth, this film provides the truth. I know many young people have had their problems when they work, when danger comes near, they should learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When adults in the city have finished learning the hard way about "Blob" running amok, they should learn to trust the youth and stop their behavior better. The Juggernaut of the waves was very good day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone enters the risk, the city is safe again, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this film all the time, if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! RATING STARS 5
