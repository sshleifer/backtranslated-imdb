After seeing Arthur on the TV often I laughed the role of Dudley Moore as Arthur had the pleasure of lucking a fortune to drink was a hysterical but John Gielgud as a father of a father / father Hobson was similar and pleasant. I bought a DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of almost 27 years is still as enjoyable as it was Liza Minnelli's role if the love of love was to attract chemistry between the two was magic. Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled alcoholist who has a bar bill that reads as a national debt he has no desire to grow and enjoy acting like a child. His activities are supervised by his English-based Hobson (Gielgud) player appears to have no one who cares so much for Arthur except he, Arthur's father (Barbour) gives the fate if he does not live in the horrible blonde Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weeks he will remove the legacy of However, Arthur meets with a love for Linda Marolla (Minnelli) a young worker and a thief, now facing a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies Arthur finally grows and breaks off with Susan before the wedding, choosing to put all the money with his true love. Arthur is a romantic romantic comedy for everyone
