After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should have a feeling like thinking that he would come close to Mr. Brett's "one of the most famous characters in books". Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. Good actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, the second second but, it is still the second. One can make the argument that Mr. Rathbone's screenplay was too low for the highest products given to Mr. Brett and for this I would like to agree. Yet at all times it is said to be done by Jeremy Brett forever and ever being the only actor of "being" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this issue with us, to the public, we enjoyed enjoying the exclusive exhibition of Mr.Brett. Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
