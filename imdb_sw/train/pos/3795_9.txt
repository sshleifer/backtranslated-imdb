After seeing this film in the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a speech (Q & A) about a film that later presented his remarkable state: how to get a distribution to a film showing a few (women, non-white) who work in resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teenager, identity of color, mother-mom's mother), and how to write a faithful script on all these topics have been in the middle of three years white husband. Many tribal viewers, many of the most-great people were broken up by the fantastic story of the film, deep characters, and a wonderful picture of "real life of young people." Many young people, however, had come out of the building - causing me to think this is the best film seen by adults with children, as the first step of the discussion rather than, as many adults felt there, "young films should see because it's up. "So, the distribution questions - how can we get our hands on it?" The Internet (retail) will be a great way - this is a film that will be buried, like "Pups" or other modern movie art - and McKay seemed to be responsive. For his credit as a writer / director, McKay was a very sensitive and comprehensive in his work - engaging in the Crown Heights area of ​​which the film has been installed, working with executives to show pictures in their vision of what they think they should be - with the results being really enough.
