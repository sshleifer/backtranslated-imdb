Is this the future that we expect? Extremely destructive, unforgiving inheritance and life of hell, unnecessary life? This film leads to a recurring problem, twice since the film was released back in 1973. Let us hope that the world cannot end up like this. It had a beautiful spelling, semi-apocalyptic sphere, compelling and stimulating, and eye-eyes eyes out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very, very dirty. It is near the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Anime is amazing. Charleton Heston, who has been one of my most famous actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of badass, but he likes a tough boy. I was able to put myself in Thorn shoes. He feels that something is wrong, but everyone around him listens (more if not paid to listen) or wants to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) a populist of the old Sol, who has had enough space. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as a Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with an apartment where he sits. Specific effects are amazing, even in 1973. Soylent Green factory, futuristic rooms, and especially "tiny" (fingers that can eliminate people) were better. The air is blown out and it is very disgusting. The streets of the empty city that are full of evil people and pastoralists separate so much. Remember the last one is the end, which even now is still shocked. It's bad, but if you think about it, it's a very good idea. > <br
