This is a good film. True story of bond between father and son. This is far, Tom Hanks for the most favorable conditions. Tom Hanks is actually out of the box in this film. He usually has good roles for the boy. However in this film, comes in this film as a little deception, but it still comes to smell like a rose, even to the very last location, killing its character. The release of this movie was installed together. I also love part when there is quietly while Tom Hanks trunk character and kill all the people in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something more and still known about no sound in the area, just simply feeling. I like to look at John Rooney, the face of Paul Newman's character when he knows even before seeing him, it's characteristic of Tom Hanks to take revenge, and he knows his fate has come. At first I saw this film hit me and I knew I had to go and get a video with me since then, adding to my collection of all my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my famous actress, so this film has a special place in me.
