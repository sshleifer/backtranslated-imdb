Victoria Victoria is a beautiful film and has given Queen Victoria to a different light and what everyone thinks about it. The films erase "my feelings" are not recommended by Queen Victoria and show that she was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> I love history, especially the history of Israel, you can think of my answers when I first saw this film was announced, I was so excited to be counted down to the day to come to movies. I was a little worried that it could not be accurate to the historic, but it was with me I liked it. I have seen a new truth about Queen Victoria who did not know before and loved me very much. Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our all-time administrators, and this film shows her pictures. the real personality and how his life was. He was treated very well by his mother counselor Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to rule. This was revealed to Victoria to be a wonderful Queen, which she was! The love between him and Albert was very deep and this had made well with Emily Blunt and Friend Rupert, who were all wise! Victoria Victoria is hearted to see the story of love but at the same time looking good at a large part of British History ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... of course!
