So I walked on the customer's way one night a few years ago and I think I would go half an hour to watch "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to start. For a head like I thought it was the 'B' exploitation on the groups within the youth group. My surprise was not over that. Instead it is good to act, a beautiful story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into a female boxing. He is responsible for taking his younger brother to his training sessions and getting his attention while watching his events. Because they do not want to be a striker (just following the wishes of his father) he encourages his coach to take him instead. This story is revealed in a logical and reliable way as he passes various trials on his efforts. At first, his brother's coach doesn't want to take a girl girl. After doing so deliberately there is a problem to close the match for it. Then the struggle with his father when it gets what's going on. Yes, the interest of love develops but serves to improve the plot, come up with more of the internal humanitarian responses and its outcome to fight the fight. <br /> <br /> All this is a small sleeper movie which few seem to have heard. Sometimes I saw the most widely advertised and praised "Million Dollar Baby" I thought "waiting a minute, this seems to be normal". Needless to say, I did not look at "Hart War" that night.
