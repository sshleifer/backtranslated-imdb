Although the previous audience, I had a soft spot for the fiction, so, I had a common desire to return to Nancy Drew on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film. The main secret relating to an old dead actor is provided with simple simple words and dashes of risk for young people. Nancy and her friends will never take threats seriously, so young members will not be depressed. What I was most concerned about the story was the final result was great and meaningful and Nancy appeared to understand and grow from experience. Emma Roberts is as good as Nancy Drew and hope we'll see her again in other secrets.
