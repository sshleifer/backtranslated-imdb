This movie was normal. I would like to say that this movie got the best of a working person who learns from his mistakes. if we can cooperate and learn how everyone in this film did. It had an important part to show how the family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can't get "BIG THROAT" and swallow it proud.
