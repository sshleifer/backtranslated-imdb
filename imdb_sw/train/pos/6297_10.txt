My friends and I were talking about how we were disappointed with the movies and especially the romantic comedy. We are sorry with the schlock which Hollywood serves up to these days if they do all the best. Well all is not good ... except a few ads, like this film. It does not have a big name, a big budget, I think it had a great release (I was employed from a Hollywood video) didn't have anything more visible than a romantic sexual comedy. But it had what many of them didn't. It had a great chemistry among the interests of love, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not compulsory for us as many. The director took his time to allow these characters to get really know. Their story reminded one of my loved ones, "Tootsie". Support support did not add not only short-term, but also for stories too. James LeGros's character was very valuable. Samay's gay friend was too much. Contacting Parker and colleagues in the Psychic Hotline was a lot of fun. I just laughed, I cried, I remembered how it feels the fall of love.
