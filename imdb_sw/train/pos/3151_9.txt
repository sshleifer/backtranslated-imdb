I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was a Funny Donkey! When I first saw it playing on ETV (Estonia Television) and I started to love it. It's not bad that showing it is a bad time for me. Hyde is like a guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And she comes on stupid ideas. He got these glasses that are brown. I would. And there is FeZ. Pervert Group. We all know what he does while alone ..... He wants to get wrong. He even had his master in one place. This from India. And there is Michael, a fool in the whole group, maybe the stupidest in the city with his copover! He is very foolish that I remember the following: Hyde says: Did you call cops? - No Michael comes and says. Does anyone know how to turn off siren? She is a city player. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's old partner and then a Hyde girlfriend. Then is Eric who is a child of war war with Kitty's home mother. Her one big pussy. But she loves Donna, her lover and who they plan for them are married. Donna is one girl of fire. Hmm forget what? ah Hyde lives in the underground.
