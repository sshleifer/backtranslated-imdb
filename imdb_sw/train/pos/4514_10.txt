I have recently seen this film, on Sunday afternoon, and one friend and we are so happy! This movie is the trap of garbage. Try to look at it for this purpose! It was not expected, of course, but the performance provided by administrators (and Alberto Tomba is better), the weak script and the low-cost budget has provided a wonderful mix of stupid things. Tomba was only retired from the alpine ski racing, where he was a technical expert at the end of the 1980s and 1990s. With great care about the director: nobody knows why Damiano Damiani has signed this film. All other Damiani instructions are great.
