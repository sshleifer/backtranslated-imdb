I think the movie was very good, it would add to "my collection of war" after all this time. I believe I have seen other banners that reminded some of the pickier people that are still just a movie. Perhaps some of the most esoteric points reject "logic", but many religious issues have been accepted "on the faith" is not worth testing the smell of aroma. If you are going to accept any beliefs you register in fact you can accept the movie. Is it just me or anyone else who has seen Dagger Aja-Yee is a knife with Lamonte Cranston and had many problems to get control of "The Shadow". There is no mention in the trivia section of any movies here (IMDB), but I will be able to hit the dollar for donut is the same.
