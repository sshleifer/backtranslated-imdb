I love this movie !!! The Purple Rain came the year I was born and has had my heart since I remember. Prince is very bright in this film. I went to a special show of the Purple Rain last night and it was like a festival I was glad to see some of the true fans cause this film is not worth it, it's really one of the biggest movies at all. Music can't be seen. The movie is about "Kid", played by Prince, his family is bad, his band is the most hot act in the city, and he has his eyes on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no question why purple colors can thank "Kid" for that. So if you haven't seen this then you need to wait. This is a classic - 4ever!
