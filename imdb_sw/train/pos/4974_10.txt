This was a fun advice. Hemo (blood) as the Greek god was smitten with animation and vanity, pride, quality of snobbish and strange innocence. Quotation (or location) I remember clearly when the Hemo tires of "all these pipes ... you did not find my secret at all" and threaten to escape, the scientist answers in one word "Thalassa" - salt water that damages the Fiction Author but destroys Hemo and it detects very well in the chemical field. This wonderful mix of entertainment and news makes this common as fresh and ingrossing today as the day released. Encouraging interests and ideas is important for teaching children to learn.
