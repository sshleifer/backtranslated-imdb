I didn't know what this film was about or even knew that when it was a month ago when I fell while I was looking for other films that watched Dominic Monaghan. I thought this film was an extraordinary understanding in the mind of no one who slept and what his thoughts might be in the hours that they use eyes when the whole world around them was asleep, it was an interesting film and a good place played by Dom ....... I believe that although this film cannot buy anywhere (I have never seen it anywhere) you should see if you get a chance because it will really make you think about those people around us who can't sleep and should suffer at night after a nightmare of sleep or just get an hour 1 sleep every night so generally it was an interesting film of a good substance.
