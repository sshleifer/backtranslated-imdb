Since I heard the edition of Ralph Bakshi "Lord of Rings" I asked myself: Hell is a rotoscope animation? !!! Okay ... I searched for you ... I saw this film about three years ago without having any idea that Ralph Bakshi is ... And I loved ... a lot ... Beautiful story story ... even has developed a small character which it's good for cartoon ... See if you're bored with modern animation .... Don't get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon ... It's a very good movie too ...
