And my children love now! In fact, I can look at it now and realize the animation was not good, and that the plot is wrong. Hey, if every villian introduced himself by saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKE HEEEEAAARRT" I think they can laugh, but for young children it is a moral story and interesting music. , that I still had the words remembered after seeing this film in twenty years. I would like to show them one of the little children.
