SERIES THREE- BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something to be done well, kill Baldrick before you start" Fire on the second heels of the second show returns to the current owner of the famous name under his fortune and in the service as a pastor for Prince Regent, foil free and stupid for the poisoning of Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow as another piece of comedic jigsaw. The form is similar to the original show, after all they now received a form of winning for what changes to things. We see Blackadder trying to get behind the regent's wealth of many losses, trying to make Bladrick and M.P. or try to curse a good grandmother for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the historical series, the great regent took control of the throne during his father bout of madness and some of the characters mentioned to tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all pass through events and all can steal their scenes, not easy for a stellar cast
