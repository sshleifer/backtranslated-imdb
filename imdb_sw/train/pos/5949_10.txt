Friend again, I need to comment on this amazing, exciting, and reliable story of romance and preference. Music is wonderful and does not remember. Very good film of colors. Another movie I also loved was later the High Society and Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
