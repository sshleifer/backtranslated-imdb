"That" 70s Show "is definitely a funniest show now on TV. I started to explore it about two and a half years ago, and once I saw I could say it was a good show. I love all characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. It was a horrible character when he was there, I hope he returns because he is a hilarious man. It is a classic when Fez goes to "you son of bitch!", and when Kelso tells "burn!", which makes every day laugh. always have something exciting to say. Jackie's hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out to be very good but damn, somewhere around the 5-6 season she just got really hot. 10, and there is still a hilarious one. This is one of the few that shows that I can look at it regularly and still laugh just like I did the first time I saw it. engi shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this last end next year, but it will leave the air as one of the best performances ever.
