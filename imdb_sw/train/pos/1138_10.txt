When I was an eight-year-old child, I was always watching movies and television that I didn't have, and this was one of them. It is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it must be a funniest movie that I saw in my life, acting better, not making any of these games again these days (movies that are funny and making you do not laugh without performing dirt or some kind of breasts of the breast as expected of the movie Judd Apatow including non-actors who do not know as Seth Rogen, barf. <br /> <br /> This game is classic and actors who can actually act, and deserve all the accolades.
