For me this was more than a wake-up call, and realize that most of all we see, hear, read and think about anything, depends on what the media gives us. This is a classic example of a high level of spin doctors trying to control civilians via controlled information. It is also a good example of how people who have a constitution that freely buy it, will not be subjected to this press release or any attempts of inappropriate efforts. Once again this suggests that at the end of the day most needs will be more than a few needs. It also states that in a country where there is no religious civil war, that democracy is not a real thing to do.
