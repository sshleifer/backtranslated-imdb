I saw "El Mar" yesterday and I thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood age in the life of 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur, and Francisca. After this we jump over 10 years at the hospital where 3 friends meet again. Religion, disease, love, abuse and gender-based violence in a film and a powerful and tough film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining about the film being gory and I think they have missed the story. It is a story of violence, intense and sad. People are expected to suffer. Right. To hurt. Ignoring. And I think that what the film shows, does not make the value of a fresh shock or has been presented in an indirect way. I know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence in it. But sometimes, the movie needs to make you feel uncomfortable. This is one of those movies. And the great movie is. The only mistake I found was that there was a 3 or 4 time with a description of several conspiracies that were unclear to 100%, and after thinking about them at the end of the movie, all of them were intelligent. But it was nothing of great importance to the general story, so I still give them this film 9.
