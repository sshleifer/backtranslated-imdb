Billy Wilder has been proven by the story, and his accuracy touch is seen in this natural story of a song of the spirit song that all work for the burnt music for the story of Oliver Courtney. A clear misunderstanding is found out in a very fast way, thank you in heaven, and what remains is a concoction of magic and charming and other beautiful songs (and some more overlooking), Crosby in its most appealing, great scope for the Broadway Story Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant give more of the cynical barbs (Levant is in common form and his quips are not dated at all). A wonderful surprise, and recommended for all fans of that kind.
