Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the good films. Great film. But nothing, and I mean nothing going on to the largest movie of all Christmas, Santa Claus. The video is too big and has many messages, I cried when I watched it. Hardly, this is one of those movies you need to look at 10 times. Does it mean that we as human beings do good ice as anything that makes us do evil? Imagine the film makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good translation of Santa Claus forever. Unlike other Santas, he is an ordinary man. We see him clinging children to spy on dreams, and we ask ourselves; is Santa really believing? Also, this Santa mentions Christ, all the meaning of Christmas. You are worthy to watch the center of this movie. We should just stop making the film and air nothing of Epic 24/7. If it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Anyone who says this film is bad is a fool.
