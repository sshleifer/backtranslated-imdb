"Mama" is an unfamiliar movie movie movie, touches at least two uncomfortable themes that are not usually available on the movie: rejecting the mother's love for their child and their daughters, and desire and desires at the age of three. Anime is bad: It can be an old disgusting woman and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or grief for her. He admits that he did not love his son and daughter. She deceived her husband twice and intelligently. He speaks of a loved one of his daughter, not to protect him from an immoral person, who does not like, but just because he feels horny with him. She tries to prepare her life after losing her husband in a worse way, destroying her daughter's deception. Paula, her daughter, is a desperate, who receives her life as it is. His brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists to have his shop, a really awesome business. Darren is an evil man who does not love anyone, even himself. Action and direction are best: actors and actors have excellent displays and trends are very accurate. I loved this film, but I realize it is recommended for a special audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
