Happy heroine who, in turn, wondering and scared and giblets, fights with the rooms, runs full into locked doors ... rarely that shines in my memory of 'The Naked Truth'. I liked what I found on this show: daft fun and some of the best supportive characters set the show of the show - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish, and strange-prone to accidents - It's a pleasure to see an actor who can clown - it's not surprising Hollyood doesn't seem to know how to throw him. But where-oh-where is the DVD released? The amount of bleep is, it's amazing to me that this small gem continues to stay. (Someone likes to please me if I miss.)
