I can't agree with the above comments - there are many amazing and amazing pictures of this film, it has an unfamiliar structure and it goes well with a horrible sequence that is known to use stability. What is more, it explores the incredible impulse of suicide in the most obvious way, not to pull any punctuation in what it shows, but not to sit on and reflect on it. has document notes about it with the fear of the art gallery, and it deserves a place among the canon of different films of "fear" as the Blair Publisher Project and the original Pete (all of which preceded and could be anonymous influence on) . It is definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the adventures of the awesome movie.
