This is a script that Ed Wood worked over 10 years trying to find. Aris Iliopulos finally got a chutzpah for the film script which Wood was saved from his burning home at the expense of other valuable items. <br /> <br /> This is a non-talk movie movie, which some people can say for folly as silent. In fact, it's a noisy film, without a good discussion of flicks. In the hands of the creators of these films, music and sound effects provide a rich radio experience that works better than almost any grist from the Hollywood film film, especially that the film's stupid Billy Zane film was the last ('Watch out! ',' Oh no! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I'll take a monosyllabic complaint of Zane in this film on an empty discussion any day. Billy Zane leads a team of players who definitely wanted to be in this film. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods are shining when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy name on one poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid is well set, and the performance of the Ron Perlman's animals is very amazing. In general, this is a chaotic, visceral jewel with love created by fans of Ed Wood Jr., the author and cineneged. You must see for anyone who loves the movie completely through which the first Iliopulos and cast it is clear. The movie to make you do it yourself.
