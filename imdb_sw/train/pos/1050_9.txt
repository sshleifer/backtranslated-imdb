This amazing document gives us a perspective on the lives of courageous women in the Cameroun court system - police, lawyers and judges. Despite the great problems - the lack of means, the great poverty of the people, many languages ​​and many legal events according to the location of the country and the religious / tribal history of complainants and criminals - these brave, powerful women make a difference. This is a common thing - a really exciting movie that repeats little faith in mankind. In spite of the enemies we see in the movie, justice gets thanks to these enthusiastic, zealous women. I only hope that this film is available free in the United States. Most people who see this film are better.
