She was surprised to see a low score for this movie. You just saw this film for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded of why I like. <br /> <br /> I come back with me, children, when Michael Keaton was a direct comedy player, and you can find fun in this film. It's a gentle comedy - kind of Ron Howard focuses - but if it's your thing, you should look at this. Keaton's low-base source is the same for this project. "Gung Ho" is a little dated, because it takes place in the last stage of the world of the original economy, while it still fits what the country business was out of. It says, offers a laughter with a lesson on how people can learn from each other, with great benefits. You can watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one particular area you liked so much, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but regular stream of laugh. It's like I.V. decline. And I mean that in a good way.
