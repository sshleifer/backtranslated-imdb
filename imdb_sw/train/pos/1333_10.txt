I love this very movie I watched it regularly. I don't see why one might think that this film was not good. Maybe you've seen it or whatever I like. It is one of my favorite movies and I am not quite Indian but I love it. It may be a little like "Beautiful Woman" but I haven't seen it and I don't think it's better than this. I don't know why you are involved in it but maybe you have a good reason but I think I have said it is enough but I absolutely love this movie, and for those who say it's not good all the time then I wonder why you watched it and what movies you see good. For everyone else that I looked at and enjoyed it too surprises me that these people don't like it. For Rani Mukherjee (I think it's how you call her last name) she is very good and my favorite actress!
