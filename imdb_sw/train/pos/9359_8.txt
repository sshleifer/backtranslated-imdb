Feeling for this film was amazing. The role of Adam Sandler was very motivating. While playing a very bad character, he took his ability to the very edge and worked a real role. Her character was very interesting. I can read myself reading the script of this movie and not half as interested in the part as Sandler made me. For someone who plays the most exciting roles, he pushed a great role and what looked like his quirks and inputs. I especially liked the place where Adam and Don were running a motorcycle near the city. I learned this time, because it seemed like Don was preaching one thing Adam did to avoid it all. With his video games, music, and many other things he keeps him from thinking about the past, riding his motorcycle and head his head on it seemed like escape from his mind. This movie is worth looking.
