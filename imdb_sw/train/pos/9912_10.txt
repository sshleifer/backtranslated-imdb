The most amazing celebration with Ros is the highest score ... I highly recommend this movie. His performance, in my opinion, was the material of the Academy Award! The only sad fact is that Universal does not know that this film was available on any video format, whether it was a tape or DVD. They ignore a very good movie. But Universal doesn't care much about its library on DVD, which is sad. If you have a chance to see somewhere (don't know why it's rarely even run on the cable), look! I don't want to go to the story because I think many people prefer to have a comment on the film, and many "critics" write text about stories, which are available anywhere. !
