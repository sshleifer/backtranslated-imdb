Like many Eleanor Powell films, this starts out of many plots. For some reason - oh it is explained! - chosen to transport the magnetic mine to Cuba. Good men and bad guys compete for mine and who is confusing. But, as always, play for Powell is good and there is a value to enter. And in this one Lahr plays its cowardly fear, giving the warmth of Technicolor's 1939 movie. . In addition, the great player, Buddy Rich, has a good time to show his quality. Look especially for its special duet and the trumpet of Dorsey, Ziggy Elman. I say "alone" perhaps with ignorance, but I do not know another series of drums / trumpet like this on the film or record. This film is fun. Even Skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrictive. Powell also shows that he is the greatest player of the film ever.
