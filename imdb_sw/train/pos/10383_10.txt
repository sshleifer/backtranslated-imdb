I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but I have never seen anything as beautiful and beautiful again as this small TV film. It was part of PBS series if I remember, and I have never forgotten it. It is no sexual intercourse, just stylish, migrating, frequent touch when full of tension and excitement, both put in conservative, Boston (I think), World War environment where women play The role of a dedicated wife awaits the return of the husband from the war, and did not seek independence of work and money. Frances Lee McCain is very good at the role of the pastor's job and I have spent the next 30 years unusual to look for him in the same roles as anything. <br /> <br /> Is this video of this movie? Certainly it should be on DVD but at least a video?
