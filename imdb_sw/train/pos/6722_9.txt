Everyone has commented on movies (good for big), attributes (greater than life), structure (series, and many cultural surfing for the time). What was missing is the main issue of social importance: disgusting the traditional American culture for something more fulfilling and wider. I was surfer in the 1970s. We were looking at the film 16mm at SoCal high schools. I remember the tremendous sense of walking throughout the day until my temperature was warm, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and briefly going to watch the latest surf film. Most often, the author was a filmmaker himself, reading paper sheets. Sometimes, a surf band or a proto-punk band would add a voice. I had no more fun. Except for hooting and hollering, see 'Riding Giants' returns to me on time. <br /> <br /> IT also reinforced the feeling that living a livelihood, not worrying about money and growing community and corporate levels, not keeping with Joneses, pushing physically and mentally for a short time of happiness and happiness - can be the answer for the question, "what is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and so on, they seem to have found something that few of us are brave or honest with ourselves enough to follow: live life only on our own terms. Maybe the community would have fallen apart as we all did what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who actually live out of their dreams. It was this message that helped me a lot.
