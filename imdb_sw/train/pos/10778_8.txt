Now this show looks like most of the other exhibitions from the mid 90's, but the only thing about this is that it is different, they use multiple comedy and action in this and perhaps a bit of game too. I myself thought it was a good show, I can't understand why they will delete it. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive since 1997 so far. <br /> <br /> My hope is that WB will restore a show or even make a movie, which I know is gonna be impossible to do, but hey does not harm to dreams, isn't it? <br /> <br /> However, I would suggest if you didn't see it to get a DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are the best, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and well show all is just great.
