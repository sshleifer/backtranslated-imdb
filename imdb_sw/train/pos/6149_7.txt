I've just bought a revised version of the film that I remember with great love from childhood and indeed it is for the afternoon afternoon entertainment. Bitsknob definitely makes more sense in its full form, deleted events (especially those with McDowall) connect events together correctly. Is it a little problem how the plots are destroyed. Obviously, the sound of this video was lost or destroyed, so some bright player in Disney decided to refresh the events and new discussions. Where it would be good unless the half of the cast did not move around to make it (some for better reasons than others) and one thing is very good. Some of the oral mix is ​​very poor, and the voice of David Tomlinson is called by a bloke that is not quite as good as David Tomlinson (in fact there is a German hint in it, I think). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all songs (although the 'Right Direction' point is still missing) and during the magic in this film still shines. And I urge you not to do it when little Paul is looking at Angela Lansbury and coos "but what is related to my hat?"
