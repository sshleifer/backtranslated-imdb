Playing out as a player before The Great Escape 13 years later, this small film of British british has the same as no fun and dare well overkill. The first part of the movie is to start with the escape of our characters, while the second part considers their lives during the flight when they try to reach Sweden. The film depends on the cleaner and simple, effective, and yes, that is believed to be done, and achieves its goals well. There is no small amount of emphasis that impresses an interesting film around, and if the story of adventure works perfectly for a time, it is a great thumbs on a film that can be the first of its kind? <br /> <br>> 7/10
