This is, for all categories, the best film that I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - all their movies are reserved - this is an art! The Child Story Story begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who hates what she has and lives in a rejection. His ultimate death death brings him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here, he meets Sho, orphan who lives on the street. From here, the movie is a bright experience which depends on the visual and emotional part of the movie. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never a movie has touched me in this way the film does. And executives are amazing - I have never heard anyone speaking many languages ​​without feeling strange. Great for the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The last comment on this brilliant film, is that star Gackt (former Malice Mizer singer) and Hyde (L'Arc spokesman) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I wonder how Gackt can change his way to to talk and act according to the age at which he works. Look at what he should see. If you don't see any film, check out the Moon, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the most recently unveiled jewelery. All in their native languages, of course!
