The history of the black and white night of the night, and a lot of it, shows the true life story of the 1950s in Kansas where the whole family was abducted by two men. was written by Truman Capote, so you received the message of the death penalty of Liberal at the end of the film, which is wonderful to know the truth of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson lost lost atheists who lost their focus on life and who should not kill this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Though the slant of desperate end, this is the story of riveting from the beginning and the movies makes this even more interesting. Photographer partner Conrad Hall did a wonderful job on this. It makes me love many modern films made in black and white colors. Look at the DVD. Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the supportive support are best here. My third opinion of this film came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent in the case of his wife's murder. One cannot help but see Blake and this film differently after that.
