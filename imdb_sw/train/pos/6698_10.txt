I loved Sabrina Youth Wizard and I saw every single part. I remember when I was sitting at six o'clock each night and waiting to come to Nickelodeon, however when Sabrina left high school show started to go down. The best series should be when he was friends with Valerie (I don't know which one is). From the following series (friends and Dreama) were still very good, but when he left high school it didn't seem right. All the main characters seemed to have gone away, which means that they did not have a large amount of old "few", yet the first series where Sabrina is at the university is still good and looks, however during her aunt and sabrina departure their houses are not the same. He is no longer a boy, so the name of the show is incorrect and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh show does not seem to be the same, especially when Sabrina almost gets married to someone who is not Harvey. Thank you for the kindness he has spent in the last five minutes of the transit period. All in yet I love to watch the past events of Sabrina Shepherd of Youth, but I think the authors took away too far and should let Sabrina leave high school. Because after that show seems to lose some magic
