In fact I don't understand why this film has been a "flop" big in broadcasting. Sharon Stone certainly did not lose any of its charisma and "touch" since "normal nature". I chose this 10 film and I tell you why: The game opens London at this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events of BI1. He also shows that the master's master of his own non-published class. He is "hitting your brain" as a masterly Catherine that eventually you don't know who is real. <br /> <br /> As a technical component of the film: Just return to the real-level B staff of the actors. Sharon Stone is the only true name in the cast compared to him and Michael Douglas etc. in the first part. Also I think BI2 would be better that Sharon Stone was a little younger but she is still very strange in her look and has just improved on her charisma. The "B" subscriber level is not bad either though I would want more big names for cast. I think there are good improvements in the core plot. I think this is the best thriller than many of the run-off-mill crap Hollywood so easily distribute these days. The program is huge, easy to see reviews, you can not beat half by way through the film and most importantly - it's heath located.
