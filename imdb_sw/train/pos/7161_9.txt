He loved the film. He loved the two families crossing the path in history. The only question is whether Sam is killed then how does his family line continue? She is the son of Mrs. Zeroni and Zero should have a relationship but no mention of any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Has never mentioned children or another spouse before they talk to him and fall in love with the teacher? Maybe he had a baby before he became a string of Kate Even for a mistake in the film. Just love it. Acting was good. I don't know where the story was with Sir Sir to be the last Marion women but it makes her character even funnier. Another "consultant" appeared to be concerned with children but of course not much. A bad teacher should have a very good childhood to be very important when he or she grows up.
