Children, aged 7 to 14, got a very big kick from this film we gave to all other children on our birthday list this year. They all liked it! Children from 2 to 7 are regularly watching and frequent, and we have the ability to look at them. <br /> <br /> There are few that the film stops children for a long time, and offers it laughs to adults, too. Most enjoy more than the first. <br /> <br /> Production of high quality and good cast, led by Christopher Showerman as George the chief - athletic, powerful, and totally reliable, with a delightful and especially knack to take a tree in the face - well supported by Christina Pickles inimitable as a wicked wife, Thomas Haden Church as a rough jerk rival, and everyone else. This is fun.
