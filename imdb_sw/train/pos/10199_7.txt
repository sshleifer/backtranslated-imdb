As a child, I loved this game. I played the zillion times during Spring 1993 and my friend Andrew. I was playing Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how many times we played with him, we never had to be bored. Then Rage 2 plans came out. And we quickly forgot that this even existed. <br /> <br /> You play as old Axel Stone cops, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have left power to take bad people in their own way. There are 8 levels of working in the city of run and destruction led by Mr X bad. Beat all the bad guys and the last boss is very happy. Level 4 (Bridge) was my fave because you can hit the baddies under the holes in the river. You may even have the opportunity to be Mr. X's right hand at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to a 'bad end' that becomes a master of the union. Especially how this is possible is the secret since you destroy the union on your way to Mr. X, but do not mind. <br /> <br /> Rage settings also have amazing music. The author Yuzo Koshiro performed the perfect miracles with the small beginnings of Sega. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and the Last Boss are standout tunes. <br /> <br /> As the owner of Wii I am glad to have forever in my console. But with the Rage 2 settings available also, it makes the type of giving the first person an obsolete amount. It looks like a beautiful, beautiful and beautiful picture was presented in a comic book such as a development panel that fits the sound of the game. <br /> <br /> Great tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to intervene and hard to put down. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> What is worse than Rage limits 2. Bad enemies. Baddies often go away with you instead of taking part in the fight. This is very irritating to the boss of the 5.5 / 0/0/0 <br /> <br /> Lack of good weapons. The worst examples of people are repeated away too often. Graphic B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Update Appeal B-
