If you are witnessing with awesome singing, you will find the story of the bottom story. Christopher Walken is very interesting and very interesting in this role. His acting business way works well for Puss's shoes in boots. Other executives are good for their parts. I did not find anything of great evil or infinite. The king actually looks a real dunce though, and I wonder if he should be. I can't remember the original story. Specific effects are typical of the nineties, but at least they are not more fake than some money from the computer we see today. In general, I recommend this film to children and adults who are a child of the heart.
