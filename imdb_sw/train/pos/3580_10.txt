I don't think the movie like this will be opened today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists and it returns to put you on the edge of your seat. But, what this film contains: it's interesting to learn how families can cope with depression. How the healing language and more of the great losses make us repent, and we rely on the raw feeling instead. Pain without cause and patience are angry, even hating. Unfortunately, the leading behavior (a little boy who shoots and kills his brother during the hunt) in the film is given more than his right part. Finally he leaves and goes with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear that it was an accident. I felt that this young man knew that in his heart, but he needed to hear those words from his parents, and get their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I liked about this film: lack of conversation. There was great emphasis on physical responses, face words. And the slow pace of the film lets you view the effect of the actors. Something we can't do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
