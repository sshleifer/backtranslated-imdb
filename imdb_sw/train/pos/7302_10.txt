As recorded in John's Carpenter's 'Halloween' is approaching 30 years. It has produced 7 sequels, restructuring, a whole mix of simulation and every year close to Halloween when they make a list of 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' always there. That's quite surprising for the film made on the budget of around $ 300,000 and shows then almost completely cast an unknown talent up and coming. I would like to keep going, but the big question here is: How does the film continue today? And all I can say is that, fantastically! Pros: A simple app for opening the opening, which puts emotionally. An unpredictable and circulating publisher and co-director John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Movie theaters. The direction of Stellar and Carpenter who keeps on doubts, gets great shots, and is carefully showing his villain. Good performances from unknown cast. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one of the most horrible, worst. Most of the times that will continue to stay with you. That action is slow, but stable and never can. Unlike many other slasher films, this is more about emphasizing and fear than blood and a large body count. Cons: Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then. Many pieces of truth are standing. last thought: I want to start this section by saying this is not my popular film in the series. I know that it's not a common view, but it is true how I feel. Although it is really an important film that continues to reach new generations of film buffs. And just because it has been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it will forget. There is no way, not how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
