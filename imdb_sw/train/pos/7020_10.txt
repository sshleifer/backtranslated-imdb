* I mark where there are vendors! General opinion: If you can take a big movie, go see this. Be clear and enjoyable. Do not leave the theater because you are confused as you go! The film fits together for the second half. I'll take my mother to see again when the movie is officially opening. I was lucky to see this in the past several weeks, Will you go to developing the film when. He was good - spent a lot of time with fans. Thank you for the picture! About Will's performance: When you see a very popular movie and actress on a movie / show, you always think of their current performance as you think of their past performance. This is not for Will Smith in this film. I did not remember Prince Prince (lol) when I watched this film. He was quite sure and absolutely in this great responsibility. He has grown so much as an actor. I think he will get the Oscar nod for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his behavior: Ben is a very controversial and tortured. He is sad ... guilt-ridden ... very determined, but very scared. Very much for himself. His character has deep ... and somehow, Can it bring it. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a good job to show Emily, a woman very much behind her tax. Maybe he is not the star that shines Is it in this film, but was very persuasive. I think his character did not have much work as much as Will did. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no demolition): I agree that I did not like the film until the second half. I knew anything about the movie coming into it, and nothing made sense to the second part of it or so. But when things finally work together, wow. Amazingly well written and think well. It's a very powerful movie that includes you. It really takes a lot from you to watch. In the playground I was, many people were crying to the end - even adults. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful time ... <br /> ******* Few Publishers ***** Why is it so hard to talk a plot without giving big things away. I feel like knowing a lot about this movie really damages. There were many marks in the film I enjoyed, though. I will say some of it here (without trying to give a lot away). The fish that Ben was putting in his hotel room. At first, it doesn't mean anything. There was a LOT talking on a cinema movie where people recognized the truth of the fish. <br /> -I hate Ben at the beginning of the movie. At the end of it, I loved and hated him. That's how it will prove. I thought Ben was a great jerk to Ezra, a blind man trying to just make his way to the world. Why did he treat Ezra like that also became more clear later in the movie. Try it. Everything in this film: wait. It is a good man who made a big mistake that he will not forgive himself. It is still unknown to me if she was doing what she did because she was trying to get her own guilt, or if she really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of all ... I think he wanted to help people but also to pull out his own past. I love her behavior. You love and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is a wonderful thing. You hate him for what he does himself (as a very good person), physically and emotionally. Good work What!
