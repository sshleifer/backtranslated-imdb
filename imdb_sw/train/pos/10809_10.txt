Russell, my fav, is good in this film. But more than that, the film covers a wide variety of humanity and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the patience of other people provides a way to save humanity. Story of amazing love between Lachlin and Lil. I have often watched their events. Anyone who has ever loved will have feelings with these people. All characters are beaten and displayed properly.
