Now I am doing film subjects at A. and "this is not a love song" is the film we look at and in my opinion is a very simple story but a backward story. If you start the face you will find an exciting film of two men riding across the countryside from farmers, after killing: - "it looks quite". Still you need to dig more to reveal the real sense of the true genre. As proposed, it is a story of love between two lovers of homosexuality, filled with honesty, fraud and betrayal. We are not told about this "love" directly through the film but the events that happen outdoors, for example Heaton does to Spike almost shouting this matter of love in our faces. Overall this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "trash" just because they have been done on a small budget. <br /> <br /> A good film with a bad story line, however it is a flavor that gets and goes wrong for a typical Hollywood blockbusters.
