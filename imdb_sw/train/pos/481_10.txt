This is one of the most unusual events that the film and novel has been built is very good. Maybe this is because Gorris' takes the original ideas of Nabokov and gives them a different interpretation. The end result is a view of Luzhin which respects more than Nabokov. The only thing in the movie that I do not like is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhin's destiny. I can imagine Nabokov creating someone like Valentinov and giving him a great influence on the novel move.
