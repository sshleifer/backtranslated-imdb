In my opinion this should be one of the best displays of Barbara Stanwyck. He was one of only a few of the participants, then and now, who could say more by looking at one more than the whole page of discussion. And I was fortunate to see the original and hidden movie, and 4 additional video videos. Still the film is very small. Lily is a young woman who works together for her father's work in her illegal investigation. His only link and anything is his best friend, Chico, played with amazing and Theresa Harris. Although Chico is North Africa (and have a white woman to be the best friends with a black woman behind 30 years it was as controversial as a matter of this movie), and Lily do not, they have a special bond. And it's not sex. Only two women seized, or shot, in a state of their control. After Lily's father dies, and he does not know what he will do, he is told he has the ability to get out and get what he wants. Yes, it is evil, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then "they" had to go and destroy a few minutes ago. So, until the last few minutes of the film, it is a good film and worth watching. "The subject" of the movie still valid today as it was back, and I'm sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's bad what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Citizens, recognize.
