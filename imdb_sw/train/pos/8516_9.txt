This movie is a very interesting and heartwarming story about orphans that are in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to enter the time to run things. <br /> <br /> This is the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His comments on the filming of children are creative once, and his sales techniques will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is sweet and charming that I know I will never forget. Just make sure you miss the first five minutes of the movie! The great family entertainment is very small nowadays. If you are going to a small picture of corny and the rest of the fun, go to this! I could watch constantly, and often I do! My only complaint about this film is that it's hard to find a copy.
