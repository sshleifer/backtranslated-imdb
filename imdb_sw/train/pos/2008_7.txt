The original vampires (1998) are one of my favorites. I was eager to see how one servant would work by considering that they had no previous characters. I was amazed at how this was played. As a rule, sequels are never recommended as natural, with a few exceptions. Although this was not a great movie, the author did well in setting the main theme & vampire lore from first to tact. Jon Bon Jovi was at the beginning, but it seemed to be Slayer who had half the way. I witness anyone who can make up the performance of James Wood at first, though ... unless you give Buffy! <br /> For all, this was a beautiful look and I will look at it again. <Br /> <br /> I was left with two questions, however ... what happened to Jack Crow and how Derek Bliss was a murderer? I think we will just leave for ideas.
