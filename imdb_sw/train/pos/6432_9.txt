Thanks to the smart script and a steady hand from the Author / Director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a fun and delightful fun. The movie starts methodically and builds steam as the symptoms begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are very strong when they work together to unlock the secrets, remind me of Nick and Nora Charles, from the "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is as good as the wife of Alex McArthur's penalty and character roles, played by former actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris have done well and give a lot of time in good time. There are even cameo and Rex Linn. In all, I felt like I was reading a good book on fire.
