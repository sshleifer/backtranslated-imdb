Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and the rest of the actors and artists in the "Men of Honor" have made this film beautiful. Mark Isham wrote the film, so you know the music is good, too. But: After realizing the killings of bonds, bonds, and sealing of heart strings from the beginning, I was willing to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film. If you can do that, it's _really_is_ good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real-to-life hero, is enough to live life. Look at the internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the film, as the Director admitted in his opinion. There were only three African and American Navy people in World War II. However, no one has reached the UN's head of the Navy. Carl Brashear was one of the United Nations African-Navy Teacher Diver. AND he was the first amputee diver never certified or enhanced as U.S. Navy diver. (Suspending Applause). <br /> <br /> On the wrong side of the movie field: Should I tell you just one "most"? Yes, I will mark this comment as with "vendors" and do so ... The original area, which the helicopter faces the radio line and goes into the sea: They could never have time to complete the perfect Mark V diver, even if it was Master of the story Billy Sunday, just for a moment "... a few minutes at the weekend" to save the quiz. So, for onions, onions, and over-dramatization, I have criticized "Men of Honor" from 10 to full to 7. <br /> Will Hollywood EVER realize that the wrong fact is best to be Their most advanced approach to telling stories? I urge you. Too bad!
