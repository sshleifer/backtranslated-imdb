I thought how Grinch Blocked Christmas was a very good movie. It was not horrible, nor was it good, but it was fun to look. I felt like Jim Carrey was a little fun when. I thought the environment, when not in the cave of Grinch, was good, and there were several parts where I laughed, but I often thought it was just annoying. of more scenes of laughing, because most of the smell was not funny I loved how Grinch Blocked Christmas however, but it's not an exciting thing to see.
