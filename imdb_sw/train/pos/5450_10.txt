Barbara Stanwyck has the power of Lily. He is a waitress for his father speakeasy in a small mining town. He also tells her to men. He runs to New York and actually sleeps his way up. At first I had seen a 71-minute version but it's very strict - in its time. These days are very good. The movie goes very fast and has tons of sex innuendo - some of it comes as pretty silly (but fun) today. It goes so fast you can easily ignore that most of them never can happen - even in 1933. There is nothing unusual or big about this - it's a quick, filthy and filthy film that is very fun. It falls only to the end and the end of the "values" that have already been demanded. It comes as it is impossible and stupid (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed - one said certainly "No way") I found a non-75-minute version which has a different, sad and more beautiful ending. This version was thought to have been lost until 2004 when it was discovered by the mistake! I believe this is the only release - but know. <br /> <br /> Acting is good - Stanwyck jumps into his role and plays up. He lets you believe that he enjoys being cruel and sleeping around. There is also a strong show from Donald Cook and George Brent. Also see John Wayne before a little attention as a gentle and gentle worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this 9.
