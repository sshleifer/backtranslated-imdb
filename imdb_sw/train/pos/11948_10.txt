"Match Match" and now "Scoop" have insisted that I am not just Woody Allen doing a good job making movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is a member of the right to cast), but backing up what I know for years: he should 's focus on the natives of the rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson has a journalist Sondra Pransky, a wizard Sid Waterman (Allen) puts his lost box where he meets the spirit of a murdered journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells him that the massacre that led to London were they are placed by Mr. Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, he knows, and ... well, I don't know how much I can tell you without giving away. But I can say that this is probably the movie Allen's funniest in years. There is a unique style of humor (especially a verse about his religion). Therefore, you are sure to love this film. If there is nothing else, it will make you love London. But more, it's just so much stupid. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have gotta love this.
