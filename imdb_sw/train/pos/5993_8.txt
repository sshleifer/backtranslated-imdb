Treatment uses sound on creating a strong mood. Although VO covers all the films of the film, it is not surprising. The use of a lot of films increases the lot of information on the story. The choice of combining b & w and colors worked well to increase the time. Ultimately you will be able to fly despite being able to expect results. I really enjoyed the amazing features of the film. The approach to the area of ​​love is also interesting and eye-watching. The piece is very few but very effective. Good editing helps to show what a short film can do. Value to look more than once!
