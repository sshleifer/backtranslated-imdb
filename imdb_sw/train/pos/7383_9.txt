The greatest surprise was placed in the chaos of the cities of São Paulo, the worst and worst of the third in the Brazilian state of Brazil. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is struggling with this exciting and realistic film, it has a feature of the Mexican "Amores Perros" feature with a distinctive attitude to Max Cady, from all the Cape Fears, though this is not, in any way, film about psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in the construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to their third partner (and owners of multiple shares) in the construction clothing. The murder is blamed on the city, but things start to look very bad at the wonderful time of walking with madness Anisio decides that she wants to be close to the perpetrators of crime, not just errors but, more importantly, to strengthen social principles of attention who forms the Brazilian community. Anisio returns poverty to be a focus and wants inside. Watch it almost entirely hand, grainy, the best performances in each, especially as the first actor (and a member of the classic Brazilian band band 'Titãs'), Paul Miklos, dazzles and baffles viewer with his good social fears. I saw a film in Brasília Fest's film in November 2001. It has done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
