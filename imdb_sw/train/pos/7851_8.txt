Camera Revenge is usually not unusual because of the issue (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay has introduced Nemo Little to the film at this time) but because it shows bugs to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz was originally wanted to film the real bugs to fight but could not make them do it on the camera because of the flames that suffered in such a way that they took the dead and began to use motion-stop techniques to carry out their pursuit. This brief is a good job of putting human behavior on small creatures such as riding a motorcycle, painting, photography, kissing, and playing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and Mascot (1933) but his first known work would be this.
