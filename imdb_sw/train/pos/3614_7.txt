Girlfight is like cooking your grandmother: The same old recipes tried a million times before, but somehow transformed into something new and new. Try and describe stories to people who have never seen before: young women from the wrong side of the tracks trying to improve their situation by taking boxing when dealing with a tough man, who prevents and attracts his growing partner. Watch them looking at their eyes on the string of clichés, and they are the same: it's * clichéd. However, I was recognized by how this film works well, because of the usual acting and discussion, and the sensitive direction that makes 'new'. I avoided this on the movie because it looks like a complete trophy but not making the same mistakes I did. It fully defines the look.
