Theo Robertson said WWW did not fit the situation after WWI leading to the rise of Hitler and WWII. Maybe you missed the first one with a HOURS quarter of 8? It reduces this period, and with the original amount in the series, it shows clearly the existing conditions, I feel. My friend who grew up in Germany at this time, joined Hitler's youth, and his experience was similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This document is far beyond the History of History I also own, that there is no comparison. The only key, and the smallest, which I have WAW is this: numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about leasing credit, then how much was paid / leased? How much for Russia, how much for Britian? How many merchants made the boats, and when? How many ships are German or Japanese Navy with total, in 1941? What were they? How many soldiers? How many soldiers did partners, in general, and in the country? Many numbers can make many viewers stop, but I would like to choose more! And usually, I always want to see more military analysis. Why did Patton & Clark not have a German army that was in Cassini, after going around, instead of running Monty to Rome, allowing to avoid? I don't think you can begin to understand the war until you see some of these video groups in the "general war", like Dresden fire bombs. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see parts of the death camps: you can't close your head around it - it's very impossible. It is not known then, and of course, without worrying, they had the most brutal pride and destruction of the Japanese people, including destruction, (read "Flyboys"), and some LIVE of the military "pilot" medical, w / o any anesthetic!
