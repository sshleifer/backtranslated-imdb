It is a great pleasure to see one piece of art converted to another without distracting or ignorant. I didn't think about how this wonderful literature can be restored as a suitable film to see. If you liked Bulgakov's book you would, in fact, fear of seeing an inappropriate interpretation was made more for a film film than actually bringing a deeper meaning to the story on the screen. There are a few examples of this and Master and Margarita. As hard and as far as the story, the movie is not worth anything. It is like a filmmaker who reads Bulgakov's work in the same way as the orchestral conductor reads the logo - without a mark. Why can't we find such talents here U.S. So now my book and movies have the same head.
