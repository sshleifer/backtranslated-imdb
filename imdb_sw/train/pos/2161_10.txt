How many of us would like to be able to give us social and cultural responsibilities and be free? Many of us, I suspect. We'll play? not a film about playing. It's about learning about ourselves, realizing what we want in life and having the courage to go to find it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-class member of the Japanese community where playing soccer ball looks like an inappropriate character. <br /> <br /> One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl depending on the student's window. she is attracted to him and finally shows to play lessons. He is ashamed of his play and fear of shaving. He hides the fact that he attends classes to play from his friends and family. There is a hilarious room in the office room when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a colleague who are also playing, are interrupted to practice dance moves. There are many other interesting and warming events. <br /> <br /> The end is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer to hear. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand the Japanese best people. It is a hot and highly valued film.
