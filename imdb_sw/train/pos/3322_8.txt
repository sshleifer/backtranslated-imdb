If you want to look at something that is for 'she' and 'her' to say then this is a movie to choose. I am a Roman pastor but my husband is not always so much (who does it !!!). However I was able to make him plan because I told him about sports, and you know what, he liked it! <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and the leading man (sorry but he may 't remember his name) is also the same. As I watched the film was called 'Perfect Match' but I think the head was changed to England as it was based on the Fever Book and it was ready with a film made on football and the same headline (the same film but the UK - phew!), <br /> However, all of the comments here will tell you more information if you need to give girls, take it from me, get your own / partner in front of the television on Saturday night and you will laugh and cry together. The real Gem.
