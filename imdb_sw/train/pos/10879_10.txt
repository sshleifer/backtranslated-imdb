I've been wanting to see the cut since the day I heard, which was sometimes last year. However I had to see today, and when the movie started I thought it started instead of a week but it was better after 10 hours or so. I thought that the movie was very good. but what I did not like is how the killer was created, I was just thinking before the lease that could absorb as urban stories: cutting the last, almost dead. The more everything in the final cut of UL needs to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: cutting end. The best part of CUT is the killer and death events. The killer takes MO F *** ING ASS. I will cut 8 out of 10
