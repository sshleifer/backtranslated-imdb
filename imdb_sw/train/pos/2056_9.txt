I don't think most people offer this film as a big credit if appropriate. I like the awesome low-budget movies and this takes a cake, especially by nature. Yes Scarecrow is a shock of Kung-Fu, but why? No one else is ready to go away. In fact I was not happy to watch this film since Candyman. So the city takes this child to call him a scarecrow, even his mother doesn't care about him. Then he is killed by the spirit shared by the Scarecrow, who is being killed. His fall is easy to assume once the movie goes on. The ultimate symptoms go directly to a group of panic directors, but with greater commitment to Dario Argento really beat me like a cold, these people want to make new films. Most of the film has a lot of Arnold barriers, and one subsidiary will laugh like a stick around and kills a sheriff for a stick. I would like to say, grab some pizza to your friends to laugh $ $ away from this film. I love it by its nature, and more fun.
