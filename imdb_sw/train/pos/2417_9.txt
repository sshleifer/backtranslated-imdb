"Go to Berserk" is actually one of the funniest candy films I saw, the period. Indeed, it is a low kinda budget, but not a suspension of a powerful tour. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his wife-in-law asked him how much she gets, candy says "Oh, I break anywhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." O really, it is a supply of candy that sells. Just common things. Eugene Levy also turns into hilarious performance as an advertiser. A piece of his awesome movie budget "Kung Fu U" will send you. So if you are a fan of Candy and you want to re-forget the gem, I can't recommend this film enough.
