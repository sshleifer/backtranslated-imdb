I watched this film 10 years ago. and look at the average video once a year since. it's a kind of movie that is not available, because the theme is universal, but the stories and conversations are personal. It is also one of the few movies that take you from one frame to a credit score, in spite of the fact that there is a fact, only two (very) characters. this is widely claimed in partnership with hawke and delpy, which makes us believe that it is actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie I saw the real TV, and now, it spreads! I love the way this film comes just to the audience in its place, and it makes you think, however you came to be, that you are one of those characters. also made me to plant a train near Europe! I haven't met anyone who could not share this film. maybe talking about me, my friends, or just the courage of this movie.
