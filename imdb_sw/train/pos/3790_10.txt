I went through this accident on a free and beaten film station. I am a professional actress and I had an exhibition view. They felt quite biased, totally without compromising. I could not tell them whether it was written or how it was beaten and waited until the end was to see credits and then spent half an hour on the IMD to get this film. Don't miss it. I find that the director-director also made a very good film called Everyday People I enjoyed very much. The shame of the film business is that these excellent projects do not receive the distribution and advertising that deserves and live under the radar. This film deserves to grow and boast. I encourage people to watch and watch.
