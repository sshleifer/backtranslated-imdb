I will put this one very short. I believe this is an odd movie. I see other travelers who have described the impacts that are written badly, are not shot, has a terrible voice and, worse, that it is not real in its life show. Okay, so it may not be quite sure for all its length, but this film carries out the message of hope which some seemed to miss. Hope that it is not too late to save people from bad things that develop in a lot of life. Gangland violence is true, right? Is it okay, no! This film has important social messages that concern can be loved but which is however not characterized, rather than being punished. I watched this film with great joy at least eight times, every time and enjoy the same as every time and feeling that maybe the world can be made better and not more to save (well until 2008 however). 9 out of 10 from me for this. It's almost entirely in my view. JMV
