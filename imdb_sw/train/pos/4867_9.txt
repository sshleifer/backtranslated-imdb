Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire making Foggy Day and several other dances, one duo and Joan Fontaine bad. Here we see Astaire doing what is essentially a "bridge" plays for a more pure form than its films by Ginger Rogers, and before learning how to use full advantage of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their work of radio / wife-wife's work, doing a kind of play should make vaudeville and they had no chance to do in their film's 30s. (George once was a teacher of pipe dance). Their two numbers and Fred are high-quality movies, and they deserve to wait. The first trio of shoe shoe is a warm-up for "Chin up" enjoyable number of carnival, where three of them sing and play through shades and other attractions. Almost almost looks. The Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will have the value of bearing under the "plot". I have seen this one 4 or 5 times, and get a quick button to help.
