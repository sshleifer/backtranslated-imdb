Interesting how Brosnan's real performance was the original text of James Bond compared to securities. She is a neurotic, paranoid, alcohol and womanizer of boot. This is a perfect break for it, even hating the icon of the button. "I am a mess, the community of my soul" says. Not available more than that. I have finished reading Dr.No and this is a lot of how Ian Fleming showed James Bond. Personally I did not like Brosnan as Bond because he fits the icon too closely. There was nothing to do with his personal behavior, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's nice to see Brosnan with a basic character and flamboyantly away from the wall. Anonymous behavior tries to gain an understanding of emotional and psychological issues that have no history to deal with. It's an amazing picture, and having Greg Kinear attack him, it's just a poetic. This movie reminds me of a little of the dynamics set up among the main characters in "My Heavenly Blue", but more realistic in their order.
