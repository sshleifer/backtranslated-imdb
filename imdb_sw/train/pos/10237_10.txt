This is one of the most beautiful movies out of the 'New Wave' of Hong Kong which started with "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain" of Tsui Hark. Tsui put a tone through New Wave to a military film which pretty much all directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted since the above as given; that is, the films of these films may require more than touching touch, if not quite comedy. "Cat's Cat" has stopped all, and revenge. It is not that there is no humor here; but it is human humor, such as the former Buddhist priest at first who might somehow feel the nubile of this young man when he hides in the bundle of leaves. But this is like human beings, even the Buddhist priests can be holy at all times. <br /> <br /> When secrecy is finally brought into the film, it is quite possible, derived from 'abbot' of the Red Lotus Temple, who is researching in pure nihilism if it has never been recorded on the film before. He is the entire body of Satan of Milton from "Lost Paradise": "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he cannot come to Satan's hell soon, he will go around the world to be a living hell that can rule. That's why the brutal cruelty of many pictures here: Not that Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, feel completely disappointed, accept his nihilism as a reality. There is therefore a clear impression that spells the events of the Red Temple that there is no possibility of any outside of the Temple itself - it has been all over the world, and Abbot, claiming to have powerless power, is a reward. br /> <br /> Of course, fortunately, the film does not end there. Although there is a loss, the human will is that human nature eventually prevails. (If you want to know how, look at the film!) But there is no doubt that, by watching this film, we visit hell. We hope, we don't see our own tariffs; but in fact we feel being punished for experience - and somehow we are more suited to all.
