I can't believe that they took this off. In particular, only when they had fewer cases left. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends liked to watch this show. We were very angry when they stopped stopping because of these calculations. It is not fair for people who were watching this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like to take a general vote from all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They can send newsletters to the letter and we as viewers can give a general vote on all the plans we look at or heard. This can also help promote new show. People will see and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what viewers look, you can also use this as a free advertising tool for TV and cable stations. We want to see other events. Bring back!
