When I first heard on this series on AnimeTV, I must say that from all the exhibitions I saw, this all grows. I had to see this show, and that's what I did. When I found the first amount of this show, it was better. I liked the animation, and all the fighting events were amazing. I tell you that my favorite characters in the show were Saber, and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course, all events on the amount were interesting, and very cool. Another thing I say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers, and others) playing Berserker's sound. She has good habits. And I even watched the whole series again before looking at the last. So if you see something good, then see this show, it's the best.
