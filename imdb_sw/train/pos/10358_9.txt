I remember seeing this film shown several years ago on the TV Life TV and thinking it was an interesting story. A few years later I see again and fall head on the heels with love with this film. The story behind the movie is interesting and itself. Release makes it more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely on his game in this picture. He blows the nails of Mrs. Chamberlain, stressed, and even checks. He shows pain, harm, surprise, and anger which Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is hard to remember that it is not Lindy. In my opinion, this Meryl performance was much better than turning to Oscar in "Sophie Elections", and he must have arrested his third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some reason, is not recognized by the Academy and at least a selection. For all, this film receives only ONE Oscar nod (Streep for Best Actress.) However, it received several Australian Oscars and appointments. <br /> <br /> Of course a high-level movie: tells you a great story and you get a good show from the whole cast.
