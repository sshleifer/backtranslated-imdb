If you remember that during the summer when you first searched, the boy / girl first, or the first partner likes ... this film is for you! Well, this film could win Oscar but if not Dominican I loved it ... there are other things in the film that can go over your head if not part of the culture ... children raised by a grandmother who is a mother and father, a little child being babied and bathing with Cafe Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy being harassed by neighboring men, going to church with a candle lighting application ... The beauty of the film was in the small details. In fact, it did not remove all of the movies of the cinema but it did not mean that NOR was meant to be a educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (tip: make new friends instead). More than a bitter, faux-ceryery, this film put it literally without taking itself seriously. As in the traditional "Y Only Mama Tambien" this was just coming to the old boy story. I recommend (especially not Dominicano!) = O)
