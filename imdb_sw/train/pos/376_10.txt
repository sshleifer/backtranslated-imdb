The first film of Spielberg film is not available. It is a fine-sounding film about a woman's African and American life. It also proves that not all African-American movies and America as a story center should be supported by African and American director. <br /> <br /> I liked about this film is the Spielberg's ability to make it very real despite the fact that it was the foundation of the book. Additionally, Danny Glover was as good as Mr. And usually, he is himself in his many films. But in this, he completely out the branches and is someone else at once. But, the opposition of all the film films comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is as good as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you see this film. Now, I heard that the music version of that would be a film too, and all I can say is: I hope it's about good like this, because this is a film that shouldn't be missing.
