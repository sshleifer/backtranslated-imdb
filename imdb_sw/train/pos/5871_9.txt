I love every chapter of this beautiful movie. It is up to ordinary people, all the people we know, who suffer little in their lives and have loads loaded around. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life in their performances and all are excellent, but Harris is disappointed and so real. You like to swear he is a driver who drinks so he doesn't need to feel anything. Baker as he put-sister also has a hard time - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one place, it looks like it had never been given before and maybe was not. Very good.
