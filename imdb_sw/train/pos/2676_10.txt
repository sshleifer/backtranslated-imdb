Every day we can watch a large number of films, soap ... on tv. Sometimes a miracle occurs. Good movies, and real feelings, and chief executives, and general director of realiser. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: first is Pacula? "The choice of Sophie" and Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about the love of others, about the acceptance of another civilization, another way of living. We also have to fight against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, accusing; we should only love our friend in the world. This amazing film, helps us to reach John (Lennon) his dream: Imagine all people living live in peace. These two films are hard to see: see these, but surely you will hurt, but it's better. Great film, chief actors, horrible stories, pain and guarantees, but also better understanding of others. Enjoy.
