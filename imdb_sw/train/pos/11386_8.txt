The story of the film is inserted by the drums of the dancing to play with Gene Kelly and on Gershwin's most popular songs. Songs and music include "I Have Rhythm," "S A Wonderful," and "Our Love Is Here Stay". It sets the new level of the so-called "song" and a lot of Gershwin tones are covered in detail. This period is the "American Paris" ballet, a 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron set for Gershwin An American in Paris, with an impressistic period in the style of a different authors, one of the most incomplete drums of dance. Hollywood film. Ballet alone costs more than half a million dollars, largely at that time. It's funny to think of the work of art born on the pool game of the film producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN 'IN RAIN, WIZARD OF OZ, IN TOWN, ME ME ME in ST LOUIS AND BAND WAGON) and Ira Gershwin. It was Freed's idea to buy a name so that he could use it as a film on Paris and Gershwin the idea that it could use Gershwin music. It was originally released by Cyd Charisse but discovered that she was pregnant before the shot started. The main reason Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron to be a female wife is because she felt this movie requires a "real" French girl to play Lise, not just an American actress playing one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while traveling to Paris where she saw him doing in ballet. When he called for an investigation, he said, "Gene Gene is who?" According to Leslie Caron, a series of preliminary dance drums, which included a dancing dance and chair, seemed to be recommended by some censors. Gene Kelly described the shortest form of the sex drama shown as Lise is brought.

Best of all, though, was allowed to refuse for a series of long ballet that finished all his movies. Ballet in An American in Paris can be its best job. Even though Vincente Minnelli is known as the sole director, he was sometimes locked up by his divorce from Judy Garland and other leading projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take the lead. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Guetary translation of "Stairway to Paradise"; Fantasy of Oscar Levant to make and do "Concerto in F" of Gershwin (see why it was the favorite of Oscar Levant.) <br /> <br /> A series of ballet, now we know everyone has now wants to take credit for it , Freed, Minnelli, Kelly? but before the film was completed New York's MGM office said there was no use of half a million dollars in ballet. So he was released to the title label Louis B. Mayer himself and made him a partner, New York said no.

The environment took six weeks to build, and 30 callers are endless working. Roger Ebert said after looking at the recent restoration, "An American in Paris has many features, not its famous ballet production, and Kelly and Leslie Caron show the whole story of their relationship in dance." An American In Paris often compared to SINGIN 'in RAIN why it is the greatest music made, and one critic put the best when he said, "SINGIN' in RAIN makes fun with An American In Paris makes you feel good."
