I watched this film a few times in the 90s and almost hit my side to laugh every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand is nothing else. She is very funny. Even P.C. The brigade could get this hilarious. You must look, and even better if you have boys or girls for drinking. Michael Jackson's removal is like him, if you are close to your eyes you believe he is singing. The things he tells are true for life and you would have a great weight if you thought this was not interesting. My local video stores don't use this video again but I would like to get my hands on a copy of showing my husband and boys at the age of enough to appreciate humor. However, it was highly recommended, hope to enjoy.
