Is it a good idea to use live animals for a window shop shop? No, and why .... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" sale which bugs are helping to promote it up and the shop manager (Nelson) is transferring to the new department: taxidermy. Typically, bugs and fun things start. <br /> <br /> spend almost every department in the shop (wear for children, sports, shoes, clothing, night clothes - don't ask.), Bugs comes up each side, even referring to the administrator as "GilderSNEEZE General". Even when it was hit inside the buttons, Bugs makes the situation better. Director Jones is on his game image as always, like Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (manager - who has a sound like a radio to reinforce Gildersleeves - go ask your parents-parents ). And the wise word of advice: when you meet a beautiful looking woman who wants to try on the bathroom slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument for animal labor laws.
