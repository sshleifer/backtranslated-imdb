The series of unreasonable burglary in the home of Miss Miss's sister's sister is completely broken. Rings, light bulbs, rucksack, lighter, stethoscope, shoe? there seems to be no rhyme or any of any of these. Miss Lemon asks his employer, the chief investigator of Belgium Hercule Poirot, to look at it. But what Poirot sees is the worst thing than Miss Lemon could imagine. The fear of Poirot has been confirmed when one of the pupils living in a boarding house is found to be killed. It's on Poirot to bring the killer to the right. Hickory Dickory Dock is strong, but not interesting, interfering in the long series of Poirot. I appreciate how the script trusted is the original story of Agatha Christie. I realize that some independence had to be taken, but I am grateful for the effort. The most important things are all? The burglary, the boarding house, the students, the broken rucksack, and, of course, the Poirot's ability to see something of sin going before it happens. With a few discrimination, the pupils' forest is just as I showed them. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd stand in the middle of the group. As mush as always enjoying the Poirot of David Suchet, I get a real kick from the events by Phillip Jackson's Inspector Japp and Miss Lemonine Pauline Moran. This period is a real treat if Miss Lemon gets more time to screen than usual. Finally, I enjoyed using the current mouse as an observer of activity in the hostel. It's a small game to play on the head of Hickory Dickory Dock. I realized when I looked again at Hickory Dickory Dock just how the great work of Agatha Christie was on a very stylized Italian film film, or Gialli, of 60 and 70s. Take Mrs. Nicoletis's murder as an example. If you were coming on the realities of the area, you would have something directly from the 70th century of Giallo. In fact, the whole plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could be used in Giallo. It is just to be judged and highly attractive to work.
