I should say, seventeen and missing is better than I expected. The view I took from the preview is that it will only be humdrum but I was very surprised with this amazing mystery. Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), not attending a so-called party meeting one night, but Lori does not care for her mother's wishes and takes place for the party. The truck does not return home, Emilie knows something wrong and begins to have a vision of her daughter and events that have caused her to disappear. What is missing is much better than many movies of this kind of TV, if not predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this film, and many of them come out as reliable. This original LMN was uploaded last night. 10/10
