Yesterday, I went to the cinema alone, because in Mexico, many other country movies are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after seeing this film, I realized that not all foreign movies are an alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I was very happy with this film. That last I was happy. This movie is a little spoon of hope in these days. And the main subject to me is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good choice to see a good movie in Spanish language and fill it with good music. Especially the main film film. This game room is very good! !!
