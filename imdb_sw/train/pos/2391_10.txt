My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops as our 8-year-old child does. We have bought a DVD and CD only so that we can look at them and listen to them. They are fun, powerful, and very entertaining. They encourage children to work, share and care for. They always have a good message with enjoyable entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme of the theme he turns quickly his head towards the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement. Dee Dee is a good singer, has a great voice. Moe is a good player. I would like to recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is Birds Song. You can't just help but smile and want to play when you hear it.
