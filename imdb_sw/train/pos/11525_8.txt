This movie is amazing for three main reasons. It's very good. I really liked that. There is a color theme of bold in the movie with amazing dresses and sets with pictures. The image that seems to be expensive (and perhaps not available) completes the look. I often enjoy the stories about the groups of misfits / deficiencies that come with being a family. Sometimes it falls on the clich√©s but this is not good. This group of executives is very positive, but it looks very good. Alan Larkin is the best (flow, van and roadway road, I could not help but remember my famous last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I found Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and only a little bit angry with Til Schweiger's performance sometimes. The opening area, all events where it breaks their techniques is very funny. There is a mix of humor and feeling in all the film. I would like to end very much. And indeed it's all about the theme of the Wizard. A good wizard makes the audience look where he wants them to, to create fraud. Which happens to be exactly what the film director does and that's why they call it the magic of the film.
