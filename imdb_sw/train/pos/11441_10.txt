As a person who sought to be present as a 'professional' person with a managed BS subsidiary in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my cleanliness is always stopped for importation for more modern stuff. My graduate post-post subjects were always emotional and spiritual supported by photography interests, glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding, and art painting which also included silk screening. <br /> <br /> I am also healthy for walking, walking and soon, going to distant places in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Walking, walking and walking find almost one world and when you stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In that case, I was concerned with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was also impressed with the content of the artist document Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and expertise of the CEO / Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. In fact I can't imitate the art of Goldsworthy and the way of the Riedelsheimer camera. It's amazing. Wonderful. Wonderful.
