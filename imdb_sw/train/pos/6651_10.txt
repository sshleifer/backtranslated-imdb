Gandhi, Great: <br /> <br /> The world-size is associated with people like Alexanader the great, Ashoka Great for their great lies in being honored as most of mankind. Gandhi is called the great not to be the Great but to be more human, for I always believe to bring humanity into us is where the greatness of humanity lies. his enemies. I would like to move to a movie review now. Gandhi My Father: My / her <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father is not a Gandhi film but about his son Harilal Gandhi. For the story of a son whose father was one of many human walks the world, the director succeeds to display the picture. The film succeeds in telling the story of the father of the father who led the nation to the greatness. The essence of this movie is not only available in India, Gandhi country, but through the hearts of all the people of this world. Gandhi A true man. Jaihind.
