Although this was a tragedy at the box office, It's my popular film. It provides a strong family message. It has a lot of violence and has one song and a group of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, practical events in this film are more realistic. It is a wonderful mix of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh shows that in this film. Do not read reviews with critics, they are just stupid. This movie has a good combination of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see more steps than Main Hoon And (it's still a good movie), this is a movie.
