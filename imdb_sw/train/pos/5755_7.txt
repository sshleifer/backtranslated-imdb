This is a wonderful movie. It does not come across as a film exploitation and over-high violence and unrealistic conditions, but usually for it is constructed approximately the rural spelling in conflict with each other, as opposed to invading 'others'. The film is a lot of discrimination of Vietnam's veterans, in a long line of films shown on war veterans like psycopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is 'I have not lost the war yet', as it meets its death after wreaking election for long-term murder and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother's brother in a particularly serious scene. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor, with enough intelligence, to carry this villain in an amazing depth. Vincent is clearly a golden boy, but with enough power is made up of his cutting-edge. The movie promotes identical plot Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate criminal brother until after being forced to act against it <br /> <br /> The movie has a b-movie stage stage, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent. , gorgeous Victoria Great and Bernadette Peters offer A-grade array. <br /> <br /> I give them 7 for a long-term goal lost in the US post-Vietnam psyche / pre-Reagan exam, madness, and mix, and the film industry that was ready to handle such a topic at the time . Look at this center, a great network that continues to play many of the 70 to 90 years old movies, regardless of the political bent.
