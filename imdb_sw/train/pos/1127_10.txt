I saw only one IPHIGENIA, about 30 years ago, but has loved me ever since. The one particular sequence sits in mind, and can only be done by the general director, as Michael Cacoyanis is undoubtedly. Theme: The weight of history and large army and all ships are on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The destructive act has been around the sea, and risking its great journey to Troy. He is told he must give his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo to get the wind for a thousand Ships. Previously he rejects, but comes closer, and tells his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp to get married more than all the fighters, Achilles. Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, get information about the sacrifices, and anger for gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, proud Achilles find that his name has been used in this form of deception, highly respected. He climbs the hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect him. <br /> <br /> Shooting: The camera rotates two young people, without looking directly to each other. They thrive on their destiny, and the weaknesses of men who deceive their loved ones and the desires of war. Suddenly, they are watching, and for a moment we feel their strength and beauty, and excluded - except for camera-irone that sometimes, elsewhere, maybe they can love and get married. It is an epiphany bright and sad that lasts only for an instant. <br /> <br /> What a trend! The camera does! What a story!
