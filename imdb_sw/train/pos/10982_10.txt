I have seen Gray Garden's becoming a spectacular film, approaching awesome / knight! /> <br /> The boy of cats and raccoons, and lobby their interests instead <br /> <br /> garden, while all speaking on the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are two things that Mazles Bros have chosen to write. They seem like characters from <br /> <br /> Fellini's film, just a stranger, if it makes any sense. Old Edie is <br /> <br /> almost fully bed, paper frame, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> <br /> grow around him. Little Edie is more interesting. She walks around the house, always wearing the head of the head of the head on her head, covering her hair completely. We do not see her hair in the film, nor will we ever have a feeling to do. At fifty-eight years old, it is still a beautiful and perfect life. At the Gray Gardens, we find that all these women are / are the life / life has been much lower than what they were before. Little Edie is probably a sad one. When her mother, in her early years, got married, made a family, lived hard with <br /> <br /> and even made a record (area where, at 77, plays <br /> <br /> with recording "Tea for two" that he did many years ago is one of the best movies, Edie left her career as a <br /> <br> model of caring for her sick mother. In 58 years, he still longed to <br /> <br /> seek his head. If something little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> is full of fantastic dreams and fame, and local and romantic. <Br /> <br /> The highlights of the film include the opening time, where Little Little Edie describes her dress for camera, a series of "tea for two", <br /> <br /> birthday party , a deliberate argument, vegetation provides a <br /> <br /> area, and a location in the hut. The whole thing is wonderful! And it has made all of the most wonderful! <br /> <br /> I advise you to see Gray Gardens back and back with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Temperature Short Pua. The Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but <br /> <br /> has worth every penny.
