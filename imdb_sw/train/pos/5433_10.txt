This movie is one of my favorites all the time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what was hit. Secret to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up to one. The last part of the war to this day gives me the violence and the end stops with tears. If you haven't seen, I would recommend a lot.
