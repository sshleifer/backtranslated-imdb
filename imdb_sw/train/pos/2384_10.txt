It is a known fact that when Gene Roddenberry put first Star Trek to NBC, the original part of the experiment, The Cage, was rejected for being "brain too". When the series had another opportunity, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to start the events of the rejected time as canon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has a different difference of what is good yet, at the time, when included. This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, paying a visit to the former Enterprise commander, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now for serious damage and paralysis because the accident. Pike joins his successor on the stars, where the unhappy surprise awaits: Spock, who served under Pike, has taken the tool effectively and put the Talos IV course, the planet that is bound (the death penalty) since the last visit Pike and Spock there, 13 years ago. Typically, being a wise creature, Spock returns and organizes the martial-court so that he can justify his actions. No need to say more about the plot, because others will be able to play Part 2. Very interesting is how Roddenberry creates a relationship between Cage and the whole world of Star Trek, by coming with some kind of flashback (say more would be great) that allows everyone, on the screen and extinguished, to see what could be the Trek, had NBC not slowed the original project. Specifically, it is fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not return to The Menagerie) to play Pike as a greater than Kirk size and the early Day of Nimoy as Spock, whose humanity was still not yet fully established: this is the only time in the entire series Vulcan's everyone likes gently. In short, it is not just a great "secret" event, but it also applies to those who cannot suffer to track down Cage in its original form (available as part of the season 3 layout).
