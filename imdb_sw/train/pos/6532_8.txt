I think part of this reason the film was made ... and it aims to us gamers who actually play all games Nancy Drew PC. There have been many movies recently based on video games, and I think this in one of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for any book. But it follows the sports section. I buy and play every game of Nancy Drew as soon as it gets out. And games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" And some of these games actually won the parents of Choice Gold Awards. It's not just fun but you can learn something or two when playing. I used my two children of action and went to see and liked it! The 10 yr. he had just started playing his first game Nancy Drew before taking him to the movie, and was very happy to play the game I thought he would enjoy the movie too. And I was right ... not only loved this film but couldn't wait to come home to finish his first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My other daughter's step is only 7 and also loved the movie but it is still young for teens to play games yet, but enjoys watching her sister play just to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> games are based on 10 children and over the years. All sessions get good reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on games only see its games of Nancy Drew InInterative. So I thought that the film was very good and I will buy it when it comes out of the DVD.
