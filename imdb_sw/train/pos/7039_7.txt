War Inc is an amazing but wonderful film. Actors like, the film also enjoys, but I don't know how to explain the plot. I'll get in the future. This is the selected film for printing. Apart from John Cusack as a beaten man, which we saw many years ago in Grosse Point empty which I liked. Here we have Hilary Duff who plays the Russian pop star called Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is odd. There is a place where he holds a pig under his pants. And the Hauser Beat (Cusack). There is a move at the end involving two characters. Ideal. It is the only option to throw me in. The reason is simply amazing. The whole movie is wonderful. But sometimes it's very strange and I wasn't bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff. He is not the chief. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I'm saying? <br /> <br /> This is a backbone story called Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a city in the Middle East to conquer a fat man named Omar Sheriif (not actor). While trying to cope with her personal problems, she needs to help a popstar wedding (played with Hilary Duff). And he loves the journalist (played by Marisa Tomeii). There's something about popstar star though. Hauser is broken with him. There is a place where he sings a song and later gives us. <br /> <br /> From the end of the film shows what kind of. The thing about moving is that I have made a kind of see coming. But that doesn't matter. This is wonderful, beautiful, and beautiful. I like most of the participants. In fact, I can't recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
