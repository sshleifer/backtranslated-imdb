The second service bears the movie is better than its predecessor. It has a comprehensive plan, the development of good behavior, and tunes (especially the fast track) are both interesting and warm-hearted. Certainly the film tends to have problems with caring but comes, it's NOW's Bear. This movie is a beautiful picture to show children because it emphasizes friendship, love, and again, caring. Not to mention Bears Care is just delightful!
