Woo's other head! <br /> <br /> This is the best film I ever see! Woo - RULEZ forever (save some time of Hollywood ...). John Woo - general director of the century. Maybe this is not more intelligent than many big leaders ... But he is a spiritual and spiritual image of all intelligent-free people! <br /> <br /> His movies like a great poem! Woo is Sheakspeare Movie! Woo is a Movie Bird! Woo is Mozart's blood! !!! IMHO violence in the Woo film is not the blood Directors, but the art tool. The theme of Woo movies is more humanitarian than that of the new film.
