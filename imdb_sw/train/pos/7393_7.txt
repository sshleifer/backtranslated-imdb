This movie was one of the most amazing. My first experience with a foreign film, was not too long, nor was it very difficult. I enjoyed the headlines; and the plot was amazingly fresh. The story of an older man visiting his elderly father and a brother who lost a long time after a long break occurred for the first time, but it had a very negative impact. There was also a trick of humor so that you would not be upset or talk to the audience.
