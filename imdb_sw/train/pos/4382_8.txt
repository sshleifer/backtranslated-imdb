Hidden by "Braveheart" released the same year, compare it to two gold prices. I agree to my favor against Mel Gibson, but I still prefer to "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" reflects the history of Scots in a romantic, romantic manner. "Braveheart" is a personal effort with respect to self-confidence and good fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, acronistic and maudlin. Check out its use of slow film. His violence is terrible and glorious. It is the ultimate quality that makes it more attractive to young minds. While "Braveheart" passes "Rob Roy" at many levels of murder (not to mention its enough time), the last film is finally more mature and satisfactory. His action is more than ignored, it is still more amazing and cunning. His sexual relationship is limited, but still more than enough. "Rob Roy" also has a good romantic interest. His conversation tries to compare the poems of the period. His teeth decomposed into the mouths of practitioners try a dentist's attempt at the time. And Tim Roth is a very beautiful woman. Also recommended: "End of Mohicans" and "Patriot." You can get the most end with "Braveheart" and its emphasis on the desire of the blood, and the more old than "Rob Roy" to tone. All the previously mentioned films are suitable for their R-violence characteristics.
