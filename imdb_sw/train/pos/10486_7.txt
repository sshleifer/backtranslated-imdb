"Saving Grace" should not be funny, but it offers a few good laughs and I have enjoyed a great deal. Brenda Blethyn is a good actor, and she does a good job in showing Grace Grace, who grows up to pay off her big debt. Support is also a good job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a wonderful role. The cluster alone attracts. The idea of ​​a woman on-the-hill to grow and smokes seems very funny. And the film rotates wisely every time. Of course, there is a flat time, like one where two elderly women have lost a bottle of Grace to tea leaves and begins to integrate the antics of children into a shop where they work. That was a senseless gag that did not completely remove it. The film team is declining and often decreases, but I've got enough laughter to give this English comment. My logo: 7 (between 10)
