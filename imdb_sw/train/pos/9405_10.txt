When Hollywood got a form of helpless during a few years after WWII, the UK introduced a very interesting film industry. In the "Male in White suit", the inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that does not get dirty. Unfortunately, this means that other businesses are now likely to go out of business! How can Sidney handle this matter and maintain his respect? This is an example of one of the great movies that Alec Guinness emerged before being Obi Wan Kenobi. It looks good for the total loss of the business world. If you plan to start any kind of business, you would like to consider watching this movie.
