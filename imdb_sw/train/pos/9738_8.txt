Oh dear we do not love when our super hero love mind develops us brain? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, lost their ability to enjoy, easy to feel-good, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed a loud voice at least five times and I don't see saying she had tears in my eye several times too. Release, acting and script is good, I watch many movies really on board and I haven't seen one in this type that has succeeded. Those who do not agree please tell me where I can find some! I am sure the book is good but I think you should judge for its own right.
