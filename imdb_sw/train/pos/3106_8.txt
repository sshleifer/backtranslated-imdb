After seeing the film before (and unable to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to see the Ultimatum of Bourne when we were asked to see it with AS Film Training. However, I was so happy that even the film and Damon in it could be beautiful. Scenes fight quickly, the expulsion of motorcycle things and the explosions of the BIG is what threw you out of your seat in TBU. From around CIA and Bourne you put it on your fingers and quite acceptable. However, many things were full of my cheese. First, the fact that the film was only a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence is always available and ultimately evil. Although Damon developed us to be happy and seemed to be one step ahead of the CIA, I was being examined by Bourne's regular life. He hit the car and rose as if he had hit or something! It's untrue. <br /> <br /> And second (of course) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was very strong and it was quite evident and it has made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even teachers) the sea. We were told by the teachers that if we ever used it in the film we did in class, it would be okay to be wrong and we will be told to use the trip. Certainly if Greengrass wanted to look like we were there looking at Damon and Stiles to negotiate, but certainly we can't scare our heads violently! But all in TBU are all the most enjoyable and worth an hour. But I didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being a piece of movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
