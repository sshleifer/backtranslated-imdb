Real John Carpenter's Real Music is a horrible reality. It describes the immortal story of the mentally ill patient Michael Myers, who returns to the evening town for Halloween night and killing a group of babies. <br /> <br /> This was the first and of course the best in the Halloween franchise. Alternative timber shows a great blockage in enhancing storytelling gradually and creating interesting characters; abnormal for awesome pictures. The most common is the lack of blood and gore, and it is still a risk of Halloween to this day. Get it! Halloween showed the first film of Jamie Lee Curtis's film and a step in the work of Donald Pleasance. Classic realistic.
