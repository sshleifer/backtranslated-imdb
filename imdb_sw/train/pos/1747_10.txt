This movie was one of the best movies I have seen this year. I haven't seen any jewelery in the film, but it's still very good. It's similar to Anchorman in the department of humor, but I think this is best to put the movie together. In fact it is sure. If you look at the entire T&A group you will be disappointed. Just well set the movie !!!! If you don't have anything to do for a day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this a very good movie. I certainly guess the verification of Ebert and the Roeper of this film is the same. I mean, not really like Ebert on many movies, but this is a movie that I will agree with. The movie has a good story that is really believe that this kind of people is out there. There is definitely something that can be said about how they commit adultery in this movie. Yes, indeed, you are laughing when it is available, but it still shows you are waiting. Steve did a good job to show someone who did this film and yet, it's still funny.
