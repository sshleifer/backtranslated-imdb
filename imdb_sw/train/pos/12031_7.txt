(WARNING: small attackers) I walked on this one way and talked there, not knowing what it was or what plot. Surely I consider it; I did not know until the end of that you took into account the true story! The boy who did the dirty act came out looking like a very good man who had his head around a girl with a fraud; I need to ask how real life is. Anyone who kills a husband and wife when they fall asleep can not be really good. However, I had compassion for him, if he had been established and taken advantage; that much was made clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint includes last (here's a great spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn). A few minutes before it was finished, there was no way to be recognized. The way that was discovered was in the "sting" operation, but my question is: Where are the police trusted to go with it? The movie does not show that, and it seemed to be very easy not to have an explanation of how they influenced it. I think how they used the most deliberate, as a lack of explanations made in the most important part of the area that would otherwise be there (we would already know the event, and what went on with Brad in it). <br /> <b> Otherwise, this is a very good film; I offer 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested in knowing the truth of the real case. Something else: The film took place in 1996. Some comments here seem to be treating as the most recent film. The Meadow Sisto is good. I've never seen him. He can do a little, too (always with his work line, LOL).
