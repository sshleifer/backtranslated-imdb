I saw this movie when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember well the wonderful exhibitions of how a hero / heroine escape every time you face a risk :) And the best feature of the film was the display of the villain! I think many movies called action are photographing many "escape" images from this film! And it is not only pleasing to me when I see that imitation, it often increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The artists have done well. The slow and true development of chemistry b / w heroine and the heroine was very natural and wonderful is displayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b / w was very natural :) The way they have faced and overcome all their trials and troubles is something that can make children even realize the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that everyone see this film given a chance !! - Beware.
