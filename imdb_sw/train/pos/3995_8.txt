Survival has never been blessed with the filming of the quality of its writing. Recent tracking as 'Relationship' has lost a lot of writing. But Mother is going through all her original nature, taking even my Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes the widow's hood for having a physical relationship with her boyfriend's emotional weak daughter. The fact that you believe all of this is a loan for the quality of acting if it is the last gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we are fighting, a hero, a competitor-hero who rejects the audience for any question why a young student could think of a grandmother. Well beaten, the film fails only in the weak direction of the peripheral characters, but as the probability of the impossibility, it is the winner.
