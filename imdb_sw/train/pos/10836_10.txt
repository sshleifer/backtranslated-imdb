I thought this movie was wonderful. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of the Peta. This must be seen by any rock of the 70th rocker. > Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film as glue trying to hold the band together, but it doesn't work well. If you like music, and you have been on the band, this film is obvious to you. You can't regret seeing this film. I know I'm not. Even my family found it amazing, and that says something.
