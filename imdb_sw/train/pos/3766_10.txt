A creative epic creative of inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film can be more alternative dramaturgy or acting more acting. But who is happy to say this film is not an art? I am not a participant of the idea, that a key film should be bad, non-commercial or bothering me with questions. Even there are many films, apposite for these qualities, which I like. Bogus's journey, indeed, is not one of these films. What you find is clean, more creative and very good energy, like a child. This film does not show the truth. Its friendly-naive and foreign. Imagine the future world described by Rufus - for me it would be a good mix of time-mixing live! Except the music; -) <br /> <br /> Basically, Bogus Jorney is done very well. I always loved movies and movies of this movie. Especially at this point Bogus Journey climbs its prequel to the far. Also the effects are good, and I think most of them have done much without cgi. I have often liked the good effects of the past in the big budget movies. Make sure 'just another Hollywood movie' from other people they see. But I think this is a very charismatic way. It is a short word with a sound voice: all music and orchestra music is very useful in the film. There is also no sound structure. Not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this song with Winger from the 'center' area building a bill with ted robots in van. I love the work of an unorthodox camera at the beginning. I want to finish saying this: <br /> <br /> This film is very ridiculous and thinks too much! It's the most beautiful way than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. It's better than four civilians, now apocalypse or chris markers without the sun ... ... is better than remembering Total ... No way! Yes the way! <br /> <br /> The Out and Ted Journey of Bogus is just the best movie made. Who is struggling to disagree with himself is guilty of "art-fartsy behavior" or he loves the Word of Endinator (what is a great self-identification) <br /> PS / part 1 is not the best movie. So Bogus Jorney is a great sequel. Even Terminator 2 is the best sequel! Not!
