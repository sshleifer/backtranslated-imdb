Two things you hate in L'Intrus (The Intruder): Who are the characters and the movie or dream you see? Finally it is amazing that for some time you lose the answer to one of those questions. The user emerges as different characters, different men in different situations that are not in the area, so they are evicted from them, gently or cruelly, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a hated person. He has a bad way, some work means and no heart. He needs one and follows it. He has a broken heart and later decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his liberation effort? Such a boy can cut your throat on a drop of hats. You know but Claire Denis didn't encourage you to judge her. From time to time, there is a little Russian-beautiful girl who seems to sit somewhere between heaven and earth - who condemns. He can even punish them. But not Denis. There was a character played by Beatrice Dalle who did not want a business with her: don't hesitate, she says. But Denis allows this person to be his own, he loves the film in his self-concealment. I do not know if his movie is heart or mind but not the basis of traditional conspiracy. Whatever its films, it gets to the end. You know who is the "main character", you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind and their full meaning. But it was a movie or a dream?
