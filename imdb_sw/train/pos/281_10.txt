This game was very good and challenging. It has a great line of stories, and glass is also very good. I would recommend this game to all the fans of Horror and you get so much from the beginning to the end. The only problem with this game is that I would like more weapons but that's just me. <br /> <br /> A great match for RPG fans and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />>
