This movie was awesome ... it made me laugh, makes it a buckl, and most of all it has to talk about animals in it! This movie should be seen by all people! it is one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I just needed to comment on it! it is a heartbeat with a wonderful story that makes the movie great and hearty! My favorite character is shade. this is because I think it is more interesting and interesting. I had a retriever of gold just like a shadow, I missed very much !!! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be a happy place, but I miss him with all my heart! This movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your donkeys, regardless of what they do, love them forever !!!
