This movie strikes you. This first Tom Barman (so-called Belgian ports) dEUS lets you live 8 exciting people, building film films. Everyone lives one day and one night in Antwerp's capital. Barman shows his characters in big letters and effectively shares their personal stories, a powerful tour that remembers the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. Part of anecdotes of surprise, goes, amuses; The discussion is normal, seem to have been recommended. Some of the major exhibitions with Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and very much from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is a "Windman" memorable, a wonderful boy playing in movies. Sam is also responsible for stunning choreography, and of course Tom Barman himself took the ultra cool Sound List. We were very interested: All Way Wind Wind is a movie that blows your feet.
