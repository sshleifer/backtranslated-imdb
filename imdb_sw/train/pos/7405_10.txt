This movie is very amazing! It has been all: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry, truth. All in simple but intense stories - like life! You won't be confused for the second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Someone who tells Hollywood needs a good story to make a good film, and there are many good stories out there.
