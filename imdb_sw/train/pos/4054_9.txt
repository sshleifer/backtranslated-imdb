At first I saw this movie returned to the 1980s as a wee boy. My father really wrote on TV. I must have checked more than 20 times, just before being released on DVD. I certainly bought you and watched the DVD and I was surprised at how the conversation changed. In the first edition, which I still have the VHS, the state of the film, due to the discussion, was really very dark. However, the new version, including Van Der Beek et al, is more than comic. To put it in another way, it is like looking at the American nature of the release of Akira and the dub, before watching the review version of the Japanese translation. I have never been suspended, the story and the quality of the animation are unstable, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki is looking for a lighter or black background and a theme in her film .....
