I think It's a good movie. because you see how Diana's life at home. he got a lot of excitement, and he wants to prove that girls can fight too. I think he and Adrian were chief executives. Because of this movie I'm Boxing too. I was very impressed. The only bad part I think. What? It's the end. because it is similar to Diana and Adrian. But you can't see how it is in the home. And I don't really like you also don't get to see his father is doing, and his brother. but I think it's a great movie and I think I'll look a lot more :) I recommend to anyone, even when you don't like boxing, you see more than just breathing. I had a good time to look at it.
