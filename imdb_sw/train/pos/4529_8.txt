As it is known among the lustful young people who are very interested in Herr Graf's silent sores, during the summer they like to travel in isolated and sufficient places to avoid heat such as unhappy people when they are convenient. The most amazing thing that travels around the world is also happening in the "Third Agreement", a fascinating and prestigious piece of silent work directed by the old hands, Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. It is clear that this German calculation liked the first part focused on the Stone Age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about the past. preferring to be the second part of the Roman Empire (it should include the cause of the fall of the Roman empire, ie, uninformed, or one thing, the Germans). In fact, the third part takes place in modern time but this Teutonic aristocracy thinks that even 100 years ago should be worthy of modernization. Leitmotiv which transfers Herr Keaton and his travel companions and tolerates incredible events and hilarious events during three different years, is looking for love, a very difficult lesson to understand for those who are faithful they prefer to earn money and personal interests. Every time "three years" shown in the Schloss hall, it is always a pleasure to enjoy a fantastic, envious film (even with a large German level), a horizontal work and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and fantastic technical desires , delicatessen quite silent which is perfect to allow a person to tolerate a different and coarse hot summer. And now, if you refer to me, you must necessarily leave for a short time because this German calculation should blow the flirt with the former Teutonic heiress who does not see his age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
