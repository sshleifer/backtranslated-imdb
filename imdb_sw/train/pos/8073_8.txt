A beautiful photo of the traitor (Victor McLaglen in Oscar's performance) who has had his own conscience. McLaglen plays the red rouge of the IRA who gives her leader to collect awards during the Sinn Fein Irish Revolution. Examples generated by the struggle and actions of the groups are very realistic, based on despair within individuals. The lack of hope for the future seems to be worse than death. Director John Ford creates a harsh and powerful environment, has been enhanced by foggy and grimy signs of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's music score adds to the fun of movies. Oscar winner also for Best Screenplay, selected for the Best Photo. This is one of the classic Hollywood.
