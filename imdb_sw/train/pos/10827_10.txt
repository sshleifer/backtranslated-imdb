Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Pipe since it is all surprising about R&R groups to clean up. True, here identities are approaching because Still Crazy is much better written and implemented out, while the script of Spinal Tap is corrupted from the first minute of amusing the first 10 on the drivel which makes Beavis and Butthead seen modern in comparison. Crazy is still a formulaic but the beauty of the characters and the inappropriate quality of a certain number of music for me was able to stop the first forecast of the film. People who anticipate the quiz on the skull of the satire will be able to despair of the light of the light of the film, but I would like to self-surprising to Still Crazy on pompous but failing to hit on the satire which is Spinal Tap.
