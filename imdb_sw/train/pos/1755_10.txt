This movie is a fight. I can't remember the last time I had a good time on the movie. I have seen a few good comedia my time and it's usually pretty funny. But this is a wall of a great wall wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed very hard and many. The movie was not stopping to the end when they did 5 minutes of delightful plot. Other than that is a regular barrage of one-stop and attractive conditions. I would like to see it again before leaving the theater because this is like a Zucker movie where you do not get all the joke first time around. You should see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> In addition to the real film, it could use the best silk, it might be many times but we should forgive it. All characters are best. It's not like a movie of the Sandler where he tries to be funny and everyone's sadness around him and is a linen joke. I think I will remember all the characters for years to come because they are all interesting. No victims in this film. Also, thank God for 45 years of playing his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays with her and she is good at this film. You just want women like she was there. He is not "10" as some other leading women but somehow his smile is more warmer than Julia Roberts to pass overbite overbite. Seeing the trailer of this film may not think too much. I assure you, the trailer does not do it right. They will not give away all the jokes. It's just some of the unhappy. <br /> <br /> Oh and something more. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that the beneficiaries do not get qualified and then at the end of the year they do not put them on their list. This means you Ebert !!!
