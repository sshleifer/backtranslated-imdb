I have been reading through some of the other comments of the user and I have decided to set one too. Some users are faced with a 'realist' type of thought. This film meant to be 'fantasy' .... film 'fun if'. It didn't mean to be 'real' or big. It was quite fun for everyone I knew when you came out - although you prevented the catastrophe of the Challenger ... I had 30 at that time and I really enjoyed this - my little child also loved it! Later, I joined my daughter and she, too, loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be of interest to just that - fun. All experts around the world should decline or hold a view of document or docudramas and avoid any type of film. Sorry for those young people who watched this film first and then went to a real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they should have gone to expect to find that kind of environment shown in the movie and then felt 'return' ... I think parents they did not describe the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you love fun movies and have not seen this, I recommend it! Enjoy!
