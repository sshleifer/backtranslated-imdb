The full characteristic of the main role of this movie, that of the soldier who was hit by its history and the way to clear the view of the viewer, is unique in its time, 1950. well written, the film is a great example of the film's best film. The closerness of Dana's eyes reflects the pain inside, Karl Malden exceeds his master, who is not well-off but also sympathetic to those under his command in precinct. Otto Preminger made this kind of film just about its own. If there is any mistake it will have a breath to take the beauty of Gene Tierney who looks odd to the place with a tough soldier. Their events in the cafe, however, are wonderful and true. Tom Tully, in a little part of his father is perfect as Gary Merrill as a hood. Large lights and setting settings. The building where deadly works are done so much atmosphere, I love an old woman in the apartment. About 8 out of 10.
