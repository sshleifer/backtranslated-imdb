This first short biography was very fun to see. The second on one disc of D.W. Griffith's "DVD" (highly recommended) has three good features in a great way, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (Little Music, National Birth) as a campus who gave the Countess eye (and other things) . The Countess's husband may have been betrayed by his wife and bound to his little room and room. It is strange that they will not hear the ongoing wall, but hey, probably wine had nothing to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of the player Raymond Hackett) tries a lot of motion and this adds to the melodrama, but in an indirect way. The best time comes to an end. If a woman comes out with shock and fear, once she knows she has lost, Henry takes her instrument and "fans" on it. The way he did was unpredictable and odd sort of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed my head off. Words on his face! From then I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.
