Now this is what the family movie should be! There are a few recent films that have been set aside for families or children who should see their views on the public; but this is one of them. My whole family left the film, was visited, interested, became happy, and happy. We still pick up a little anecdotes from here and there. Children liked it and so we (hubbie and I am 36 and 32, respectively) <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and awesome animations, characters (as small as they can be, and think if they are) very well developed. None of them can feel it. Creativity brings these tiny creatures with sound talents, along with the skill and skill of some of the best Disney leaders. This is a worthy film Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney will fully embrace this new film ... Flick, Dot and their band of small players can be famous as Mickey and Minnie for our time. This is the family that comes from the theater you want to see again .. and buy yourself on a video or DVD. I am willing to see it again. Take what I could lose for the first time. (I've never seen my children very quickly and clearly identified and agreeing with the characters before ... my daughter still speaks on a little "Dot".) This film is interesting, cheerful, cunning and wonderful fun for the whole family!
