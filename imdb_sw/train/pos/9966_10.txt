I saw this movie when Theater Science Theater was finished in 1993. It's the worst thing I have ever seen. Evil in fact, that with great freedom, this movie should get ten marks because it seems reliable. Anyone who wrote this script and children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the devil vs Santa? Hell's vision? Creepy laughing wind-up reindeer? Forcing children to work with racism? Not the Sesame Street, that's true. For Crow it says during MST3K to show, "This is a good 'fashioned dream dream!' <br /> <br /> There is a lot of extraordinary respect and higher theology. Merlin (perhaps Arthurian Merlin) relies on Santa in his heavenly castle in the clouds (ie Heaven). Santa speaks about the child Jesus and sends a letter to "Mr. Stork" for children who ask their brothers. There is a mark next to the castle which looks like pentagrams or stars of the RAF. My best friend and I have watched it every year since 1993 and we say anyone can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us.
