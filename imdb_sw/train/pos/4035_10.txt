By word ... amazing. I was initially unwilling to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another lament film on the group and will be displayed in India and Pakistan. I wasn't very similar. Pinjar is a heartbreaking, emotional and mental movie without any damage. I had haunted it after watching it. It continued with my mind for a long time; The theme, pain, loss, feelings - all were real. This is the hub that rarely finds in the voice today. It has no weakness or discrimination and has provided humanity stories. Here, there is not one country shown as good or bad. There are poor Indians, evil Akinas and the Indian and Pakistani Indians. Style is better and music is sad, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was awesome ... and acting only took my breath away. They were all thrown down. If you are interested in watching a mental and realistic film ... don't see it again. This movie offers all. I recommend with all my heart. AMAZING cannot describe how best it is.
