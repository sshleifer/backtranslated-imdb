Why, "Lift Victor Vargas" is about close to perfection as the film can get. If it is a good professional from a player player or just one of a lucky combination where everything has stirred (maybe some of each other), this small piece of urban-life ethnic first love flick provides out of its characters with such depths almost read their minds. The movie begins with a strong "road" taste but it works through the Latino family and focuses on a story that talks a lot about the uncertainty of young people and the natural desire to love another. In my experience, it has never been done in small quantities (provided by tyros, director of novice, etc.). They are eligible for critics but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and they tell in simple stories that are rich. (A)
