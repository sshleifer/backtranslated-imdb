This is one of the best military films. And it's great because of the moral values. It is a great humanitarian story that comes back to dedication with respect, honesty, love, and decision. <br /> <br /> Beauty and DeNiro are good in leading tasks. It is amazing to see the Great Teacher's rule turning towards honor and love through Carl Brashear's decision, the car, and yes, the honor of respect. The title shows the source of their securities. I have never seen this last time looking at Carl Lumbly's brilliant image of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, it was. In some ways, it is the foundation stone of the film because it is the memory of Carl's father that helps him take him through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I am choosing on which movies we buy. This is one of those rare ones that I want on my shelf. It will appear many times in the future, I'm sure.
