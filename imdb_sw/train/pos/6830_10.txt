Most reviews here describe the story and characters 'Unlock Night' in more detail so I can't do it. I just want to add my opinion that I believe the film is a good proof of life. At first Myrtle Gordon remembers how 'simple' was when he was 17, when he was young and energetic and felt that he knew the truth. The experience has left him feeling emotional, surprised his life has been and really, if he can even live. A tragic accident causes a personal conflict close to its destruction. <br /> <br /> Welcome - but not entirely. At eleven o'clock, he emerges the power of his art and engages himself ("I'm going to bury him a bastard," he says about his colleague Maurice when he moves on stage). It seems almost uncomfortable when the director of Myrtle stops people from helping him when he gets tired of his first performance. He knows, however, that he should have guts to do it himself as he is doing it completely. Some critics are wondering if this victory is only a short time on the way to Myrtle down. I believe this is true 'the night of opening' - opens like a flower for new life possibilities and steps, sees the way forward. It's very moving. Gena Rowlands is very good. Movies are very good. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.
