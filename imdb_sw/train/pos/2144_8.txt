The best and most beautiful movie, Is it? We Dansu? made me laugh and cry. For the first time, Sugiyama-san was not very appealing - a good salary, he seemed devoted to his family, but very easily attracted to the face in the window. The object of his loss is far from cold. But at the end of the movie, I had love with him, he, his wife and daughter, all the dance teachers and dance students. This complicated story of change and renewal is a little jewell that I would enjoy seeing again.
