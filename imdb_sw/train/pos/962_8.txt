I have finished watching this film and I must say that I was very impressed. Everything about it was very good. Acting characters, stories. A believing child who grew up to be brave, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I couldn't take my eyes away from this film for fear of missing something. It is a text / story story and values, beautiful and awesome sprites and 'monsters' but even people with heart hearts. The child is beaten and bought at the school who becomes a hero. He was chosen to be the village rider and the Mount of Goblin where he finds Yokai, which is a wonderful innovation that Brian Froud would have been proud of. And the evil kato and his laptop who definitely needed a hug. These evil people catch Yokai and throw them into the red hole with unwanted items, like motorcycle cars and other mechanical and mechanical materials that make up one of the powerful robotic monsters that work alone. Takashi little boy is one of them to be their savior, with a red man / dragon of turtle and River Princess with a little beautiful creature that, if America could turn it into a cuddly toy and sold in all the beautiful toy stores. The line is really good Do not try this for home children and other gems that bring your smile to your lips. Stand up and watch this for a child or yourself and enjoy it! Although I must admit that the end was sad. And not necessarily so. Cheers Furdion
