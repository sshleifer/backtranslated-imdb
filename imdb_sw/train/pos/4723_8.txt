Enjoyed this small film. It is a moving film on the fight, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between the different people (the act of a child who plays Miki is very good). There are many films that are not widely available around WW2, that this honest story is a real break from the usual, and the original one there. I will also add that this film is far from interesting, far away! The horse is undoubtedly beautiful and interesting for the elegant. For anyone who takes their animals as part of the family (I), you will get this free film. It is recommended for film fans who are looking for something different.
