First, I would like to review on some of the reviews of this film that said the final music to win the best image of the image is' Gigi 'in 1958. That's the news of' West Side Story 'won in 1962,' My Lady Fair 'won in 1965 and' Sound of Music 'won a year after that. He said, this film is very amazing! The story from the novel has been changed, but that is more because of the shortcomings that they had in the process that they did not just change for an effective version. However, I don't care. In fact, I rather think all production passes better than novel. I would Nancy bring Oliver to the bridge with him and be killed there rather than in the apartment. The tricks in this film make me laugh. I love him when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming to the beginning from the office of the governors. Emphasis at that time is brilliant. My three staff members who loved this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any of the film's stories, Ron Moody, Fagin playing with the player (this character has been done much better than in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is powerful more, more trouble with Nancy. The only reason for giving this film 9 instead of 10 is because of the two largest producers of 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who will sell it.' I often hate when choreography in music is meant to look like people doing daily work and work. It looks so bad and fun, especially when they are playing in London's meat. They should have just done the usual choreography for these events. However, this film is a rare treasure that will remain with us, hope, forever.
