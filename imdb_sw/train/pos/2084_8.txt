My main problem with the film is that it goes for too long. Other then that, it's very good. Paul Muni has a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through a planned marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant girl who is married to Muni. They live with Muni's father on the farm and they are doing very badly. When he finally gets money to buy more land, the drought falls and nothing increases. Every star to go north and Muni sits back for the first time. When they leave and arrive in the city they find that they are not working and they are worse than ever. They even think about selling their little daughter as a slave to some money but to decide against it. When a group of people begins to loot the city, the army shows and begins to implement people. Paul Muni works well with Luise Rainer won the second oscar for this film.
