The star of this film is a screen. Beware of the details for the period of dress, language, social (we do not hurt women) and politics are amazing. It is Kosovo's reminder to the day. The pieces of cunning in practical events are there for the observer's attention and choreography of this practical procedure. Perhaps this film is close to the bone of the truth to get help you should receive. It is like a staircase of growing violence with the stability of peace and stability between every step. Great movie ....
