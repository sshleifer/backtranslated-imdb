Words are not enough to show the emotional capabilities of this film; it is one of the most insistent that you ever see, but the end is one of the most love, tender, and emotional fulfillment can hope. Each actor in every role is strict, especially the wise and injured by Jamie Lee Curtis, a serious wound with Ray Lotta who is bitter, turning to the heart of Tom Hulce who would have to be with him in each book. (He is the main character of # 1 for the Best 1988 player in the "Alternate Oscars" of Danny Peary.) The last half of the hour limits on the melodrama, but the film gets each of its tears - and unless it is made of stones, there will be A lot of them.
