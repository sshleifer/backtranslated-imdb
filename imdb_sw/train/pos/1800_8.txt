All Dogs Go to Heaven is up and Fishing down to the awesome films of kiddies. Both of them were black and beautiful sinister, but at the same time the most beautiful child could be. This was one of my favorite films. I loved Charlie and at the age of five or six, I would admit ... I had to crush on a cartoon dog. All dogs describe the black story of Charlie cad Charlie and his girlfriend in Itchy crime. Story begins with Charlie run from the death row and turn to the nearest club to make gambling. In fact, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I liked songs and animations but if I grew up I started to wonder why I wasn't worried about this film as a teenager. It deals with the beautiful theme of adults â€” gambling, murder, hell and prison but in the world of the best Disney films, it's something every child should look at once. Yes, there is a certain type of transvestite crocodile and hell images that fear me now that when I was young, it gives a good message that should not be neglected by parents!
