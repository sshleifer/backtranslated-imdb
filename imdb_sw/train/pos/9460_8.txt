I liked the story. In some places, the poster shows that there is no family as shown in this film. Well maybe there must be. I thought everyone seemed to be human and trustworthy. It's a top piece that is being beaten. What great music is in the sound of the voice. This is very good, and it is good, but most of all, I will say two words to recommend this film. Steve Carell. It was well expressed, deep that touched me. He was a true command as a self-sacrificing widow perhaps very little to be a good first father, at the expense of rejecting his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did you do as a donkey donkey? Why, he did. It looks like it's all about this film. The actor who played this character made me feel that he was feeling something, and not just acting if he had a certain feeling, and he sent me exactly what he was feeling, and what he felt was rejected. He refused the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Completed completion. <br /> <br /> Love love. Your love is the most painful of faith, and many who do so will not feel anything like that again. <br /> <br /> Good film. I gave eight out of ten.
