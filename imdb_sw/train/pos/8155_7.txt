I am too old to know (or take care of) especially the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And, in Canada, it is unlikely that I have never seen MTV, but I don't know. But I thought this film was very interesting when I saw it, a little red satire. Hip-hop culture spreads these days that it is difficult to keep information about it regularly. (If only we can say the same on pipe music.) I've got a lot of joke (at least I think I did). Indeed, it has been taken from Tap Tap, but there are many goals that can stand on Tap. They are not speakers, they are holy.
