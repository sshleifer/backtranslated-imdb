The brilliant exchange for a novel that made famous family of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the context of the big resources that occur in ruins, being the power to be abused by the abuse of anger, the wealth of luxury for the upstart value of Esteban Trueba and his uninvited family, talented Danish Bille director, comprises, in the micro, which at that time would The process caused by the enormous corruption of his story to the hardened nation of Chile, and his main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Stephen resembling it is inevitable: remember, for example, a picture of a senator and dark glasses that make wink in general start building a palace). Bille August comes out in a unique army of Jeremy, whose character changes from pride and brutality, a hard lesson that life always brings us closer to change. In Esteban it fully applies the law of resonance, and great wisdom, Solomon explains in these words: "The things that are separating are the same punishment that will serve you." Glenn Close is not known to play the sand, a sister of Stephen, whose sin, derived from loneliness, spiritual love and platonic was the wife of his violent brother's wife. Meryl Streep is also good, a woman whose name came to her as Clara glove. With the power of telekinetic, cognitive and normal, this hard, faithful woman to her good, conservative husband, is a characteristic and self-controlling attitude we want ourselves and for all mankind. Each character is a picture of kindness (like Blanca who deserves a rebel leader Pedro Segundo happy ...) or a picture of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., a master of Senator's master, who serves as a tool for the return of boomerang. The video is moving in the intestines, adjusting some facts that you should not repeat, but it's a sad thing (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.
