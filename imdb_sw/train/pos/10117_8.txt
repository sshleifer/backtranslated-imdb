The story of the drifter, the sheep's sheep, and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but still very interesting. It takes place in a beautiful New Zealand country, amongst the areas we have learned well through other films from this area. This movie was the first time I saw Maria the best Regan, and I have been her fan since then. The bath also has Bruno Lawrence, who probably remembers more by the American audience from the film "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes over as a ranch owner who pays very little attention to his daughter (Regan). It worked very fast, and lost it without surprise from all its direction. I saw this film first in the most edited form on the night's television in America, but believe me, an unxpurgated version should not be.
