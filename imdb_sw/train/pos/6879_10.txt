"Groove Tube" was just one of two Ken Shapiro movies, and some are similar to modern zany problems. This is just a perfect example of TV. Apart from Shapiro - who had nothing after "Modern Problems" - the movie also star Chevy Chase and cousin of Henry Winkler Richard Belzer. Three delegates were beaten (along with other people in small tasks) appear in various skits. One of the funniest components is the chase in the Geritol-spoofing business, where he describes the drug as his wife blows, and ends and pouring humping. There is also a picture of photographic information, irritating images, and stories of other drug dealers. <br /> <br /> However, the whole thing is just a real hoot. In my opinion, the three best TV-spoofing movies are this, with "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I also included "Truman Show"). Really funny. I wonder what has happened to Ken Shapiro.
