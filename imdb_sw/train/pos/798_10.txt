This excellent game was doubtful at all. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the second time because every word has continued to connect the pieces to this amazing killing. This movie touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. In fact I cried for the last time (which I don't want to give!). It was also very good. Only a badly beaten member was an actor who played Anne Marie. The retailers did a great job, but the director did not work. I say this because he found someone who did not look just one like Anne Marie Fahey himself.
