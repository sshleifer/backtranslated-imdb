A listener at night held my thoughts, and Robin Williams shines as a New York City radio star who comes with a friend of the 14-year-old Rory Culkin. Williams has never met the boy personally, since they have been in touch and talking on the phone. However, a former Williams partner (a good job from Bobby Cannavale) brings doubts about a boy, which influences Williams to organize a meeting with himself. The following makes a lasting effect for Williams in a way that does not expect. I will leave at that time. Tone Collette also star. I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable picture of the mother of the Culkin mother. Sandra Oh also appeared as a friend of Williams. The Night listener is exposed to real events, and has a shock, almost silently around. Sometimes it is predictable, thanks to some of the reviews I have read before seeing the film and just because of the logic, but I loved it. I enjoy Williams in such roles, more than its comedic characters so that it was bonus added to me. Recommended. 8/10
