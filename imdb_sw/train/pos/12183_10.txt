One auditor explains that it does not seem to be what Welles says or does, motivates. I agree. He had a unique power in the film. More than three threats he could do, write and direct, he had the best knowledge of the film. One can imagine if in the early age he would be a painter. This film certainly reinforces that feeling. Music, theater actor, Shakespeare successor? it's hard to tell him but I am very grateful that his mom's cam and film and he has caught him on the film. I would like to inspire. I would like to face, size, style, intelligence and games. I love all his movies and want to be more. I especially love how other characters contacted him on the film. Many were not better or at least different from him because he was o established there. Even to the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps with his own mind, he could not ignore and did everywhere he was. Rita was a good blonde - Lana Turner looks similar but maybe even love and yet the eye goes to Welles and one wants another minute, another film, the other at her company. That is why we all would like to be able to reach the lost pieces from his films because we know, we all know, that there is no part of him deserving our time. Watch and thank for the opportunity.
