One of the best music you ever have, this is an example of where manufacturers and directors were not afraid to take actors for their talents, rather than what people might expect. Lighting and setting are unique, and offers a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I can't think of). Discussions are also unique because there are no restrictions being used. The movie is well paced, beautifully acted and attracted from beginning to end. The real pleasure is the MUSIC. Many songs of the first songs, from beginning to end, which are fully performed and designed. Also, music is very original and not very much remembered, and I think the best of music from thirty years to sixty years. Certainly has more original songs and more beautiful than more music, which can only have only two or three. It's not bad for the director without experience in this kind of film. Another type is that it is clean every time someone sees it.
