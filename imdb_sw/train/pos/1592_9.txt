'What I Like About You' is definitely showing that I couldn't wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is the best actor and I looked at her look: 'Amanda Show.' He is a very good person and seems to be the world's lowest. "Holly" is a person who has the ability and has a "outdoor" attitude. I enjoyed the way he looked all the time and around, and so he bothered himself frequently. But that's what caused that great show. <br /> <br /> I loved the show when 'Vince' behavior came. Nick Zano is HOT and funny, such as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole mission was beautiful, every character had their personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn, and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially liked 'Lauren'; he is the best! He helped make extra extraordinary show and do not know what he will do or say next! Generally the show is very good but because I don't give 10 it was because there is no longer new events and because events can be long and deeper.
