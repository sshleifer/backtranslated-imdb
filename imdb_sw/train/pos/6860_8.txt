Sexual Bobbi is murdered (Angie Dickinson) of the famous physician (Michael Caine) and then follows up with Nancy Allen who got Bobbi's description in the elevator. Liz (Allen) comes under suspicion of crime and a team with the patient (Keith Gordon) to put him to death. It can be inserted in several words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen seem better), it is very blood - and the type of dog is usually stored for splatter movies, and the boy is very good. The author / director of the script of De Palma is the same but it takes a real behind the ability to make the film. It is very successful on the visceral level and I actually share / interested with these characters. I can see the De Palma level / up to Hitchcock level - at least from one of the Teacher's pictures. <br /> <br /> And above, it has a professional and honest cast. This was the third movie of De Palma and the former wife of Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Movies Movies".) <br /> <br /> By the way, dance actor Rachel Ticotin was one of the producers of production. There are some trivia to you. <br /> <br /> I can't think that excitement can be classy and blood at the same time but this picture removes. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the music of Pino Donaggio normal. <br /> <br /> 8/10
