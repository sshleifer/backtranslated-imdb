Fully feature of the film! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. No one should lose seeing this film, it's just fine! Mr. Tom is shown by John Thaw as an old man who is a good father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) has been sent to him for rescue, almost like 'mice of the city and mouse'. A true heart film. The director knew how to turn the book into the film and did it very well. The film was so good to be beaten that the feelings of the characters and what happened made the audience feel different emotions from love and fear, and these feelings could turn into six coins. Setting up during the time of World War I, this film also shows the difference between cities and villages, it is almost like different countries. Important you must see, those who do not have a wonderful and wonderful form.
