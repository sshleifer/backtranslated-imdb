Alain Delon visits a criminal family family, a thorough interruption of the criminal family that has used him as a shot at duccio Tessari's exciting "Big Bunduki" after killing his wife and child for an accident. Tessari and viewers Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore's "Minute of Prayer, Second Kufa," and Franco Verucci's "Death Trick" take the operator about the gun to work for the group under the wire. In fact, "Bunds Most" is possible, but it still deserves to be a good entertainment and many sudden and frequent killings. Alain Delon of "Godson" is right as he offers death to the heads of family members who refused to allow him to retire so that he could enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte of "Godfather" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury a Delon squad, but some of his tough partners want a dead man. Like many crime crimes in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Bunduki" joins the cinema values ​​that the crime does not pay. Surprisingly, one person who is not related to the murder of the wife and son of the hero continues to live sometimes gives the hero to a bitter hatred. Tessari does not lose a second in this 90-minute shoot'em. In addition to mother and baby die in a car bomb in the sense of a father, the worst thing that happens happens in the salvage yard of the car when a hero of the hero is broken into a junked car. In fact, "Guns Bingi" is out of extinction without blood, but it has a large number of body for the stupid melodrama of 1973. Only in the last minute will our protagonist allow him to protect and so the eye-generated values ​​of the eye still refuse. Tessari's styling car moves and the death of the don in the train through the train train is like blood as this brutal stick gets. Photography and songs are the best.
