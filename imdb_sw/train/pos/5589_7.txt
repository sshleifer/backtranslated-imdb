Walking with signs and filled with wonderful movies, Expanding is more than an erotic festival that we have come to expect. This is almost a silent film, and it's a conversation in German, and it's very simple German for it. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted the film to reach more European audiences, if anyone with a high German school level could easily be given with lower heads. The story is of little importance however, and the film succeeds at the level of the movie, not the same story. Symptoms of skill and natural ability increase humanity - there are cases where flowers hide the face of the required star Hedy Lamarr - and there is a time here that will remind the audience of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl's work. If the film contains any presentation, I think it is a political one: a brave person is fearless and powerless; the work class is a happy, beautiful creature; and the woman is the creator, planned to be incomplete until she gives birth to a child. This Islamic Islamic credibility and the National Social Way does not provide a film in any way - it is the beauty of looking from the beginning to the end - but puts it in a different artistic era. And, oh, Hedy gets its unit.
