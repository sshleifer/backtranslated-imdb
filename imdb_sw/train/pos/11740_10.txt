I have no doubt that critics voted this film, especially fartsys of art who need laxative. This is a great movie car in the traditional of Abbot & Costello or Don Knotts more recently. It does not shake the world or change the movie forever. What will make it enjoyable. When all is said & done is the most important thing anyway. Watch this film and don't forget your problems. It even has a simple and courteous message of charity free of charge. I always loved Elvira TV show when I lived in LA. He did not actually steal his sand from Vampira over Vampira's original, Theda Bara. This kind of good behavior is for anyone who does well; & Cassandra Peterson does well. Long live Elvira; we need more of these types of movies. Not enough. The Holy, William Morgan Sheppard, was also the best. He gives a very pure deception. I couldn't find technical errors. Implementation is close to innocence as the form of art gets. My great congratulations to the director, James Signorelli, and all his staff.
