Absolutely completely the first film that feared me to die. I happened to catch my older brother (r.i.p.) He was watching. It was on a black and white television and not a very beautiful picture but it was my mind. Shortly afterwards, my people were bought with color and, as fortunately it would have, the Million Dollar Movie was showing one Sunday. I forgot a lot of conspiracy, but it didn't take long to catch up ... and I was so scared I had trouble when sleeping that night! I mean it is just a movie but it includes a creature that is not just something that came from space, but you can't hear it, or see it ... and immediately it held it was late. Even now, after all this time it still sends trouble on my back. A real classic, and even the best classic that I found awesome pants off a new generation! <br /> <br /> Live long blob!
