Such a lovely movie! Heart warm. One cannot help falling in love with the character of Gigi. He is as beautiful as a child and grows in a wise artist. The whole movie spinning him. He lives in a wonderful world? live all life ?? curiosity, ambition and expectation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory but still lives in the shadow all his life. Father is very Italian and is also a mother. I wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last area? and ask them to laugh. I also would like to have at least something liberating about an older brother. His humanity seems to have been completely disturbed. Passion and passion? that's the key to life. And look through the camera? focus on small details and enjoy the beautiful details of life.
