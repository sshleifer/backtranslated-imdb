The heat, touch the movie that has a dream-like brass. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is, as usual, superb. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has made many great exhibitions, but there's just something about this one haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> above all, I've seen this amazing 5-year. The former, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated with his presence, I had to buy a movie so I could look at it again and again. He is the miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> By looking at IMDB rating, I am the only one who was mesmerized by this actress.
