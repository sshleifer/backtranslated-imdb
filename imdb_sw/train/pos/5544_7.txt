The PRC which was very low down struck the gold with this very little fun. They did the same thing before and "Detour" which is probably one of the low-budget films. "Alien" is essentially a filmed film, filled with fog and shadows, a method used by many poverty line labels to hide a set, or lack of it. But here, it works well. Charles Middleton's spirit (commonly known as Ming the Merciless) goes around to kill those who are involved in the murder of the crime for murder and gives sympathy to the viewer. His last victim is the daughter of ferryman .... he considers his wrath not only for those directly linked to his destiny but also their relatives. Rosemary LaPlanche imitates her typical man in a coma that passes through her acting style. He surrenders himself in order to stop being killed but as a sop for the audience, the tenant sees the good sign of his sign as a sign that his message has been completed and he comes back, somewhat punished. If Ulmer ("Detour") has described "Surprise" he would be hanging on a nearby tree and the strangler work will be done. But who complains? It is not a story that is a great attraction but a full set, lighting and standard of the piece. It stands, back behind "Detour", as at the best of the PRC
