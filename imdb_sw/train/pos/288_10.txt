This movie was very good! I am a young man, and all my friends and I love the series, so it just comes to show that these movies refer to all age groups. I recommend to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: "The rosy cheeks", pointing to his daughter's daughter. He is a very good actor, with Erin Cottrell. They include very well, and they have a very big chemistry! I believe they can work again. They are interesting people, and they are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Recently it has been difficult for me to find movies that are good, and to show good values, and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies don't care.
