Bill and Ted's journey to Bogus is a good adventure of Bill and Ted. Their surveillance trips almost directly after the first movie, and does a good job if it is not best to impress the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plan is a bad person from the future tries to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that looks exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they should compete with a bad breaker (death) and return their lives to normal. <br /> <br /> Work in the movie is the top line, and even think it's a bit weird sometimes, especially Bill and Ted talks, it's a good movie. Wannen witches have certainly made another beautiful film. Choose this sometimes when you are on the blockbuster!
