I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember the penguin demonstration was not very exciting. I went exactly because Disney promised to climb a tree if I was going to see at the weekend, but after going to see, it was just amazing; The fact that photographers can capture the improbable image is just the value of your money. You also see different places, different plants, animals, and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - just because you will not expect nature to be so magical and powerful - but also touch your spirit and raise the issue of humanity against the world, how our lives are lost from nature to the extent that we take the place of natural beauty and miracles that are important to our biosphere. You don't need to be a world partner or an environmental expert based on the evil of this document. You only need to be a curious spirit who asks the value and miracle of living. Enjoy!
