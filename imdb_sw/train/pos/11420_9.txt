This movie is about the trick and the difficulty of traveling the boundaries of ever shifting, competing relationships and desires. In fact, it's not a film for everyone. No car is expelling, no buildings exploded, no killings. The ceremony is in the tension proposed by light, small signals, space boundaries, lights and abandoned items - sometimes unsupported - not accepted. It's about identity, memory, community, property. Different parts of the movie work together to strengthen the independent and other leitmotifs, identity, desires, boundaries and losses. It will reward you with a careful and sensitive viewer. It will enjoy those whose intestines require active explosion, large, and spicy. It is a human story of beauty. It's just that.
