This film is a real and historical film. It is very important for those who are exploring the LDS church, because it is actually 100%. It's the best film and I recommend. It is true, exciting, and exciting. There are some who think it's not true, but it's. It is about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and about the prophet, Joseph Smith, who returned again. It has such incidents in his life as the disease he had when he was a young boy, his wife Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, birth, and so on. But most importantly reveals the restoration of the church.
