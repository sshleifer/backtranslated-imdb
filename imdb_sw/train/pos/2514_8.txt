I voted 8 for this film because of the poor kids. Other than that, this film is one of my favorites! It is entertainment to say at least. Scenes shooting is ridiculous though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes very little "his apology" Matrix into it. It seems like their enemies stand there ... waiting to get shot. However, this film touches and makes every day to cry. It has a lot of great humor in it so it also makes you laugh. Gackt is a good actor I must say. This was the first time Hyde did and did the same. The role is appropriate. Wang Lee Hom is quite good. The whole mission is what I could say, perfect for this film. Don't do that! YOU WANT TO PLEASE!
