I loved this film when I was young. Today at 17 is one of my proposed films all the time. Good animation and interesting characters are just two things to love about this film. Although most people may not enjoy music, many of them are well-organized and go with stories. It focuses on Charlie, Shepard's favorite German who seems to be invisible for the first time ... but eventually he will win. It is not a kiddie film in any way. Often dark and afraid sometimes. Treat for fans of Don Bluth and flower animation. But continue the tissue for the benefit. ADGTH should never make me cry and do the same for those who are sensitive to the film. Of course not one of the non-Disney films of all time. With Bath down with My Neighboring River. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The heavenly masterpiece.
