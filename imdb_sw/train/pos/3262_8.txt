I don't think I would be happier, though some things were mixed up. I can't say what, if you haven't seen ... you will need to do for yourself. At any rate, what film could be missing from the eyes of the puppy-dog Robert Downey Jr? All-for-all, the plot was developed enough. Nothing was seen as running, like this movie as being available. The characters were like-and-able, and there were many photographs of hell in it. The idea of ​​all is that the story is closed well together, even if some features can fail ... for a matter of view. But as I said earlier, it's hard to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
