The premise may seem to goofy, but since Murphy's behavior does not take seriously, it helps to reduce the audience in this mix of mysticism and the modernization of modern modern children. Well sent, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is its height of 80th in comedy / action. There is also a F / X great, a series of dream surreal very, and original original plot. They are often ignored in Murphy's army, but this is worth checking.
