This is different from any other film, something close to which I can compare with Woody Allen's film ... But where Woody Allen is constantly reducing human thinking Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to connect with that unsafe security who explains us better or worse. In Lou's investigation, it is the root cause of moving to it, which can track back to the only child problem that is revealed through the backs of the fire. There are many non-neurotic people in the world and I believe that they all deserve the opportunity for redemption, although the difference in human nature is after all that makes the world an exciting place, so maybe we should not fix our neurosis longer than we have to fix our breeds or breasts. This is an indie film that has been beaten for a long time, but the production values ​​are as big as the film scope. I feel like a quirky gem for the self-help market. I hope to see what the manufacturer of this film follows, I could think of working in the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a boy like this goes, he is going to make a "X MEN" and his colleagues of the humble quirky nature are soon forgotten or are. ... X Men are aout group of Freaks as I remember correctly :)
