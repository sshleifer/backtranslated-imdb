Old words may "If you think you have trouble, visit the hospital." It has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have trouble, see the TV show show ... especially Jerry Springer's!" This movie is one of the worst, it's good! That's why I have given him seven - it's okay, but it's not good. It's a good way to lose 95 minutes, as it shows every day that the "hour of your life will never come back!" All known themes are here ... male, boys, boys on television, looking for Jerry, etc.. The player was looking at Molly Hagan, who usually has sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Head of Herman") dancing mother of trailer and Jaime Pressly ("My name is Earl") like her daughter, doing the same sex around everyone contacted them. Men (including a producer of workers) were presented as unwanted lunkheads who deserved to be given. I don't want to destroy or reveal everything but the movie makes it as a daily show. Here at Phoenix, it is shown back in two hours every morning and, after that, everything else that seems to be colored. Again, I give this seven film ... it's nice but not good. Jerry Springer is best taken for a small dose of an hour.
