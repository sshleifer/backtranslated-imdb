I expected something different: more enthusiastic, celebrated ... Again another failed attempt of nature. I am sorry to say that the film comes to the old picture of 'cheesiness'.15 years of age can be aware of it though. not very persuasive with the usual line, without any failing, the sound of the sound was good and well done. , production puts you in front of the TV for about an hour and a half, which is something that can be acceptable.
