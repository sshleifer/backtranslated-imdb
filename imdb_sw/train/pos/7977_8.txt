Basically, this movie can be one of the most well-known titles made by two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's do the same, the film deserved to be like one of the most fashionable design / design. <br /> <br /> When it comes to awesome heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts actually makes perfect duo. All this movie with Deja Vu is the most fun you can expect. Washington was really very good at shaky cameras and every scenes to implement in the movie. One would be easy to get involved with the character of his character so he enjoyed all the killings on the road. It is a success that they made the dark capital of Mexico with many shits occur. One could easily be trusted with the level of corruption shown in Man On Fire. I don't know what Mexico will think of when they look at this ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's say again. It is among the best deaths of death, but it also suffered from a large amount of violence. It is a pity that they say vigilante acts by making a movie that's very realistic and allowing Denzel Washington to play a kind of "hero missing" hero. Finally, they even shot in his swimming pool as a document. I was looking at the IMD if the movie was based on real events of that ...... So that's for consideration if you also find the movie's movie is a little blow. <br /> <br /> At the end, I hope one cannot take this film really. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art / editorial / movies / Denzel Washington.
