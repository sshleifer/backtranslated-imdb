Okay, let's say. this is a movie-bad movie. The plot (as it is) is terrible, to do more. But the movie was made for one reason and one reason alone, as all of the great movies of Mario Lanza ... just hear the sound of the stars, in this case Pavarotti in his head. Well, so maybe Lanza movies were also an excuse to defeat women, but this movie is about hearing Luciano. That alone is worth watching the movie. The giant opera star finds itself on its own fears, finds humility and love along the way, and belts out of many numbers of hit, too. <br /> <br /> I must admit I hate in several levels. I am an Italian. I am a great fan of Pavarotti (there is nothing about Pavarotti which is not great, including a fan base?). And when I saw this film first I was going alone, seeing the length and depth of the possibility of Life and for the first time. So it's bad as this movie is, good sound and memory is enough to make me breathe the depth of life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's corny and awesome. But the voice is eternal and timeless, and what the voice is about. So I give this film a high score in the hope that a man who has never heard Pavarotti before he will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he has gone. Like Italian food that has never been tried before, try! You may be very surprised, like Luciano's lover or Parrotist.
