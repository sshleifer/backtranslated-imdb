This whole movie is worth looking only for the last great time - its best end of any movie I saw. Beautiful, beautiful, amazing, just wonderful. I have found this beautiful film, even if it takes French very deep meaning. I loved it - it's a great story of love. And I liked how the Nigerians were beaten - and by the way, the music during the last credit is good. I want a CD!
