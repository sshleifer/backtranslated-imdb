Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is raw, painful, and true but very entertaining. Leaders to lead Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who will continue to act as Oscar to give an amazing show. Look like a Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from a small Texas city to New York City to be a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen work but is not easy. New York City women as a wealthy lady who played with Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar selected Sylvia Miles are different from Texas women. Sadly, Buck is trying to escape from his former life in Texas. He was resurrected by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by an amazing actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer. New York City areas are amazing to see if the relationship between FALS and the characters of Hoffman and Buck has changed into a man who has moved to a male relationship. Men are struggling to live in New York City for lack of play with the law if they get a real job. As the film progresses, Buck's past comes on the face and haunting but is not clear. Movies are not for children but compared to today's films and television programs, Midnight Cowboy can be more tame. I can't forget young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can't forget. It is also a tears of film, so get your hankies too.
