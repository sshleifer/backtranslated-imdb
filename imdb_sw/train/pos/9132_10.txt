I will start by talking to my first encounter with Prince's music. It was on the bar, my 39th birthday and the girl was playing without breastfeeding "1999" to play on the speakers. I asked the people, who is this singer? I was told it is Prince. It was so nice that it prevented me from a good, high-quality player. Later I began to hear other songs of Prince and "digging" really. When the Purple Rain came out I knew very little about this Minnesotan. The movie excluded me off. I immediately became a fan of the 1st Prince of the "War of War". Later I saw one of my brothers was his secretary, and he found me, and my nephew at V.I.P. Concert of Prince where we sat next to his mother ... how cool is that! Returning to the next topic, I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called the Purple Rain of the instant. I have seen it more than 17 times and I love it very much. I thought that the Prince's acting was good, Apollonia had worked a bit, but all in all acting was good. John Gielgud was not found to play 'Kid' so Prince received responsibility. The movie looks amazing, it has grown faster (not available slowly), and is very focused. I put it among the Best Movie Music at all. The last time I looked was after the 7-year gap and is still released. I am very happy for his fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and I would like to tell myself. He went ahead of me during the festival mentioned above and said, "Hi", to my nephew but not me. He was talking to his mother. I was a little cut but still number 1 and me.
