He came to see this film with my brother and girlfriend. That position was very good and we all laughed hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed to be very strange as ordinary people, if it was important. I am looking for movie patients showing young people like cookie cookies, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very much human and ordinary. I will encourage this film to all my friends and wait very long to be out of the DVD, Go to this movie with your friends who can laugh on the funniest parts of life! I plan to see again at the theater and I'm going to see things once more very often.
