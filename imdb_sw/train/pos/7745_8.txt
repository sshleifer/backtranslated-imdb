"Life strikes us ........ we must try to stay good" <br /> <br /> The first film from one of the best Belgian artists (singing songs), Tom Barman. The long awaited and cheerful happiness of the Flemish film - with a view to look, and a piece of promise work! It brings us into the lives of 8 main characters living on Friday and night. The head says much about the way we spend time with them: we walk as they do on Friday night when they meet. It is a rhymic style is 'highly thought'. Good use of music. Sometimes it takes over the picture and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! LOOK! Part of the party (20minutes ???) is an exciting exciting experience of the way it is beaten. It puts you in fact and when you are placed somewhere else with most people with a big party ..... it is very difficult to shoot. Thank you for the Barman film for making this interesting film, already several years, the worst of Flemish films. You have made my day!
