If you have trouble stopping unbelief then this is not for you. Consider: A middle-aged woman finds a new baby in a cabbage camp and lifts it as her own. Think about it; does not attempt to seek a mother, who may be a confused young man in need of treatment and seems to be no one from Italy as well as Social Services makes any attempt to put a child in 'care' (no social service now JIMA is fantasy). Before we know Toto is ten or so and her mother tells her she is dying away from orphans who happens to HAPPY someone who loves everyone. In any flat he did not only give his suit to a man who stole from him but he has organized the homeless in Shantytown residents and for some time he leads them in the fight against capitalism in the image of a businessman who buys a land on which Shantytown stands when oil is discovered there. This wants to swallow the beginning of the 'miracles' and Toto's mother who died (an old woman who raised her instead of her being) appeared to her and gave her a pigeon that twice as a magic wand allows her to give the most common and final wishes that hobos fly away from the best place. The more goes somewhere on the rainbow. The other side of the film is here with Charm and it's easy to surrender. Enable a little linen.
