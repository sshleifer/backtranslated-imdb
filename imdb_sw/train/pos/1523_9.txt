GBS wrote to deal with its own Nobel Prize-winning screens but did not live to see it (won Oscar in 1938 for its ability to cope with 1914 to play PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger climbed (produced and imported) in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he told British writer Graham Greene to do the job and it was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Taking a cue from Shaw's Screenshots, Greene uses material from the Epilogue step to create a device to create a two-to-one play (one early and one at the end of Joan's story) in a cohesion and more satisfying. Where in the turn of the voice is called by the entry, here it also works by returning to King Charles Balois's bedroom (where Joan has set the throne that mentions the events that caused his current situation), and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - The introduction of Warwick's shadow of John Gielgud (English "king trader"). Many languages ​​are GBS established, and performances from powerful heroes (like Felix Inquisitor of Aymler or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) for family members (films that started Jean Seberg's work) are the first level . It may be some people, only known by many voters of Richard Widmark movies, to see him playing Dauphin weak and somewhat, but the performance - the most unfamiliar paid - is a professional, even if caused. <br /> <br /> The image of the opening credit and the choice of the director using the visual vocabulary of the black and white colors serve Shaw and the story well. Go in anticipation of quality entertainment and you will not despair.
