When I first heard that Hartley was making Henry Fool's conduct, I was excited (it has been personal for years now), and then I heard when I heard that there was something to do with terrorism. Having seen just though, I was surprised to see that it worked, while it's still a different kind of movie than Henry Fool. Writing and recipes were all dead and acting was good ... especial kudos going to Hartley to re-close almost all cast, under Henry's son, who was only four in the original. As I said though, this film is very different from the first, but it works: I joined a change of tone and issue with the fact that 10 years have passed and characters would find themselves in a very different situation since the first film ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure continues ... and that's about all that I will give ... without mentioning the fact that I will need to see again what is going on and who is doubling. Although it was one of the best movies I have seen at some time, it faces many sequels and its end, because it seems that Hartley has a third plan now and the film stops hanging. I will be sure to buy my ticket in part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
