I recently saw the Sundance center. The idea for the film was to bring many film writers, in their own country, to make a short film, eleven, all in one film, considering only one issue: September 11. This movie can explain why these filmmakers were good in their country because it had all the features of a good film. The movie begins with a film from Iran which a teacher tries to teach students about what happened on September 11 which they fail to realize until later. The second film from France involves female women who write a letter to her partner in anger when she does not know what is going on like TV following a film from Egypt involves a filmmaker himself talking to a dead soldier about recent events not only about 9/11 terrorists but bombs in other areas. The next coming comes from Bolivia which the girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes they should walk. Next from Africa where a group of boys follows someone who believes that Bin Ladin. The following comes from Mexico where nothing is shown but the sounds of that day. Then from Israel it involves a journalist in the bombing area trying to get a report but is often told about the attack. <br /> <br /> There are other films that I can 't remember now but all are powerful. It will bring your feelings from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
