After being addicted to the sixth of the foot, I didn't think there could be another show that would almost almost be good as this show. Yes, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding !! I really love this show and I can't turn it off. The richness of the characters, the plot of the plot, the beautiful environment is amazing. I am quite and quite walking. I don't know how the creators do, but every character is very touching. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, under my foundation !!! I have no cable, so I've been hiring a series on Netflix. When I put it over to watch all the events immediately and feel sad when it is over. I can't wait for the next disc to come to my home. This is probably the best of TV show that I've ever seen !!!
