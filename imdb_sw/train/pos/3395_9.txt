This is a prestigious sci-fi movie which is so amazing how men and women see the same film. I have spoken to many people about the film and almost everyone liked it and said it was brilliant - while many women thought it was an abomination and stupid! This is the only movie that I know that has a suggestion as proposed according to gender. Perhaps most women have less tolerance for hateful or violent plots - but whatever the reason, I've always found this interesting difference. The film begins with the murder and subsequent investigations led by Charlton Heston. This has been installed in the future and the head of the Soylent International Organization has been killed. If the film opens, you quickly realize this is a terrible and very inevitable American society. Kings live in comfortable rooms and security and all the pleasures of money can buy (including "furniture" - uphemism for girls who are given who comes along with the apartment). At the same time, citizens are poor dirt, unemployed and often live in abandoned cars or house houses. The rapid spread and smog have taken a big blow and the future seems to be so bad! Why the rich man died and the bad truth that he could not live and I should not talk - could damage the film to you. However, the film has a good plot and it is very exciting to watch. More, it drives Edward G. Robinson in its final performance of the screen as a sidekick decreased to Heston. Although it is not for ease or squeamish, this is a popular sci-fi film which is very similar to deep.
