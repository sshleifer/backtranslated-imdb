A little bit of the film to do from this time. Obviously, it was the first pregnancy in this world by step, but even the most beautiful film from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are doing their act of action for the financial screen and both are doing well. There is very little in the way of the story and anyone who does not know and this kind of learning behavioral behavior can be a little reversed. For all, however, a good film that Peter O'Toole and Susannah York have got more.
