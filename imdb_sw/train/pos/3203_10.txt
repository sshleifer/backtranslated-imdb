I think this film was one of the best movies of Kurt Russels. Kurt russel is my most famous actor and I think he is a good actor in any role he plays. But this film had many steps in it and I know it should be more than 5.6 out of 10 meters but most people didn't like this film. Oh well I thought it was good so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this film and like that I think you should see Draft Back also with Kurt Russel.
