First of all I would say is that Edison Chen is very hot and that Sam Lee looks better than before XD! This is probably one of the original movies I have seen so far; shows the background of Cambodian poverty. Cambodia (Edison aka Pang) may go around people living; he has done throughout his life. Sam Lee's work (Wai) is to capture Cambodia for the benefit. There are tons of violent acts but it has a good story. The movie shows the struggle between those two characters; They both fought as angry dogs. Go and watch PPL ... ONLY TO GO !!! (GO HK FILMS)
