Hey now, your real, Theaterre, discovered it playing a video on the gray market, close to the new situation, and reading the back of the box saw that it was "a touch of touch" so it actually came home with me. It is a wonderful film. Aunt and cousin of the first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this 28th class on Long Island (Suffolk Co) and share a house with raccoons, cat, fleas (eyow!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co was on them when one of them lived in dirt by Jackie's old himself came to put things well. However, this is one wonderful pair, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wear something on her head and play, sing, and give a little acid for a camera that rarely makes sense. Big Edie (mother, 79 years old) seems to like to run naked, and when we get the idea of ​​what might seem like this thanks was a taste (?) It was done to the point where we have been saved by mercy from there. Women talk and talk and talk, especially on the past, and do not do much, except for them. They live in all dirt, cat makes their business anywhere ("Look, the cat goes to the bathroom behind my pictures!"), And one bedroom seems to be their operating center. If I close my eyes and listen to the Big Edie voice it reminds me of my own aunt, who was from the country and had the emphasis on Lawn Guyland. One place has Little Edie put on the flea repellent, beautiful, you can see all the cat stuck at all times so the place should be infested. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I would like to say in this case only the euphemism of "canceled out of their gourds", but this film is not when it feels something for them. This is the same, sad, and disgusting places, but I couldn't stop looking at once I started. This is not my type of "normal" flick but I find it very interesting. It will not be for everyone though, has been confirmed.
