I thought that this film was well done, Heath Leger had a great influence and his Irish voice was useless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also good and reliable. It really is what really happened I don't know, but explained why people sometimes do what they do. Perhaps those with authority have always been corrupt and I have found that it is amazing that over 30,000 signed Ned Kelly's request should not be executed, so perhaps there was more truth in this film than the first thought? In many ways he reminded me of Cold Mountain which was a good historical film. All in all I would strongly recommend this film and I am some baffled for what was not the best in movies.
