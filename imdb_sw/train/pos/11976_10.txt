Show this is about three young girls. (D.J, Stephanie, and Michelle) Their mother is murdered by a broken driver and their father Danny welcomes his son-in-law (Jesse) and his former friend (Joey). So the whole show is about life life. Girls go into life problems and have life lessons. They continue to crush, friends, and many others. The whole display is mainly going to flow. You don't need to hold the grudges you should just let it go. I think this show is very good and enjoys watching. I was looking at this show and still watching today. I am still happy to show this show on television. I watch it every day. I have 10/10.
