Although many Americans have little knowledge on his work except Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced a wonderful body of work - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - from dramas to quirky comires. I especially love her comedies, as they are well done and looks so natural and real on the screen - very different from the size from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is said, this was a film that led to my interest in these movies. It was a strange and incredible plot that it was impossible to film would be made anywhere - except for Ealing Studios - which had some experience for a "small" film like this. Guinness is a little nerdy scientist working for a textile company. He wants to try to create a non-perishable fabric, though it does not work for the company as a researcher but for traditional work! Therefore, it tends to enter into the laboratory (either during the day if no one criticizes or at night) and tries his hand during the production. From time to time, he gets caught up (such as after hitting a laboratory) and given a boot until one day he succeeds! Then, despite the importance of discovery, he sets a series of enough events - and then happiness begins. <br /> <br /> Movies is a good satire that enjoys industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
