This should be one of the most beautiful, moving movies, to stimulate ideas around. It is a good family entertainment and at the same time it makes you think more about the issues involved. Every time I see "the spirit of Zac riding a bike through the end ends I can't help but cry my eyes." John Thaw's performance is very touching and it is embarrassing he has no more to us. Forget the best film.
