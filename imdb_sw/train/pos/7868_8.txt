However, Madhuran Bhandarkar puts you on a wild trip. And the strange one is real, and for example. <br/> <br /> Mumbai-community - stars and stars, glam dolls and witches, a variety of business and type broker, yep a lot of interesting - located in a bright view here. In the usual tabloid style, their world opens, and every color-colored story is a small plot of the plot itself. A struggling star by a producer after finding a pregnant woman, a brave husband and her husband, a pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, journalists and police captain; all umbrellas on exhibitions and countless hues in the middle. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar performs the shadow work of digging dirt on the kings of dance, Queens to play with the dead dead. Atul Kulkarni binds punch, such as Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is as effective as an old criminal writer, but he could be made a little bit of focus on work shifts and party circles. It is very focused (time to run 140 min) and enjoyable film, worth money.
