As a group of boys in school we should give this finger. Even the Great Player made a smile. These two guest things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were stupid but still funnest in the whole movie. This is better than the first. And for some reason I feel that something is wrong. Something big. Something important. He made the best house and the female. No, I'd like to say the best offenders. Use the clones instead of robots. I gave this 7 out of 10 because of these two doggs. <br /> <br /> The Great Player, don't be afraid he is not a kind of death, it's funny. When he fell from heaven, I divided the gut. Splat, I don't know about these visitors. Where? Scientists? No.
