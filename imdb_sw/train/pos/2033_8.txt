True, the answer takes only a small part of this excellent Imax movie that teaches us about our hard work. C.G. and a special camera - assisted by Imax - reflects internal work (and out) of average men, whether male and female, boys and girls, or babies. Almost every part of the human body describes mainly: digestion, reproduction (associated with Marvin Gaye hit), heart, etc.. Some of the opening times are how a child can drown under water and also how brain thoughts appear. It's amazing how we work. It is going to go next to the big vote. But all the time we continue to learn hell about our bodies that we should be * need to know.
