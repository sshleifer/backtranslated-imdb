"Shore Leave" is an average average Star Trek. There is nothing wrong with that part, though. I just think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to give to fans. It's a lighter entertainment, nothing more. However, I am glad to see that the television show of this kind had good intelligence enough to break the great intergalactic fight. During this period, Kirk decides to give his staff some time, and the landing party is hit down on the planet which looks like a full holiday destination. As always, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems to be. There are some steps and moments, but many stories are played for laughing. Good, but not recommended.
