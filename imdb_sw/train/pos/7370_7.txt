Others have compared this film to Redemption. I believe the Mouse and Men are more accurate. Our leading man, Heaton, certainly loves the pastor. It is not meaningful and not available if it is sexuality. It is why Heaton does not leave the pastor. He needs. They need each other. As a brother, as a family, as their only relationship with humanity. Environment, environment, small loses all up to a good film. In fact, I didn't care what happened to the characters. But, I cared about what the filmmaker did with them. He did well with them. I was looking for how the end would be like Mouse and Men. The sound of the cinema and the movies was facing exciting.
