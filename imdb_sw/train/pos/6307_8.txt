I have never heard of this information if it is linked to George Clooney (whose company is produced and looks very little) with its Steven Soderbergh director. Unfortunately, we used on a discount bin for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars at that time!) What a great and beautiful surprise. But then I have a suggestion that if William H. Macy is in it you will not despair. This was a great reminder of the Ealing actors from England in the 1950s. This is odd and sometimes a film of gut-splittingly funny. The real shade made me laugh so hard I was crying. Maybe the funniest use of shoes in the history of the film. Perhaps it was the low expectations I had but I looked at a group of people and we had an explosion. Better than $ 5 I've spent for years.
