First, this is the best series, although we have a variety of James Bond effect. What it means is that when the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it's for the first time of the first 007 adventure, Dr No (1962) becomes the second, while in Golden Eye, the first film and Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is known to be an opportunity new to male "M" so he would have been in place at the beginning of the Bond to be twice, except the fact that he is open 14 years old? This is more or less "poetic" exciting license. We need to turn our heads aside if we want to be happy. No, the new Star Trek movie is not available for the first series of the original series from almost half a century ago. In 1960 representatives were fantasy. (now we call mobile phones) and there were levers instead of buttons. OMG, you think about 400 years since now, could have made Rogaine perfect for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let us give the following producers. <br /> <br /> But try and do things concrete, let's just think about the cylons of just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the Cylons have found natural land? We know that technology is available to fly freely through space. Well, what happened if the Cyclon ship was against the Caprica fleet was expelled or there was a sun or any vessel and a single ship, carrying with the visible cylons, it appeared not only to jump into space, but in time, back to a thousand or ten thousand years. The sailing ship near the World One. Colonists, they found that they could destroy it and eventually destroy themselves, but not before they themselves send a ship of "ragtag" to search for Caprica's common, just to find a planet that can survive but non-existent, which made colonial humanity, who ultimately bought the Cylons. Time ID? Without doubt. Where came first, chicken or road? Who cares? It's good entertainment!
