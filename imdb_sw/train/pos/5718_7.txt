I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on a big screen, so I bought the first ticket and then checked the IMDb check. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Yes, I was glad to watch the film. Other areas, which had a sense of fear, were true, as in the Buffy Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I didn't see this bad movie. It's not great movies either. Just a movie movie horror well. It does not depend on the specific effects, but on the corners of the camera, acting, music. In my opinion, acting was the same. Sarah did a very good job, very persuasive. Other workers were obviously not bad or, I loved Yoko. Seti is good (and I don't care that sets are similar to those used earlier in Japanese). <br>> <br /> Time of fear is often predictable. But not always. I found some fear, and did not expect to be afraid now, but it happened at least twice. Good. The movie had beautiful pictures that were natural, like rubbish, special effects on ghosts, boy's eyes, cat's eery sound, gurgling of a dead boy and his mother. Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another part of Buffy, because it is very different from her work on Buffy, more serious. Do not go if you just want to see movies that collect Oscar selection. It is a good movie awesome, insist enough. I paid 7.
