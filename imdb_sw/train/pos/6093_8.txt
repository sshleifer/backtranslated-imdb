I just saw this movie in the preview of sneak and all I can say is ... "What was I watching?" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The program is very simple. Still with Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is stressful, hard working when Black is a dream. Black welcomes this idea to create a prescription that fits poo. The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich. The interesting life that Black finds and the fact that he still tries to be the best friends and Stiller causes still to be mad for envy. As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is quite clear. The direction is odd, and the opening of the weird overturned for external surveillance surveillance. Dialouge and acting are very unusual; abnormal way to run. And the song is the most amazing thing in the film, from an amazing “jealous” song that continues to repeat the area where you think you'll hear the classic 80 song but suddenly it is in Japanese. <br /> So, the real question is this ... is a fantastic funny? That depends only on the individual. I was losing the power of the film. After the inquiry I heard people call the bad phone unhappy and are happy that it was free. Surprisingly, I understood their idea. There is no joke, so if you are used with all of it, you will love this movie. You hate it completely. <br /> <br /> This game is directed to lose a lot of money at the box office and to be a devotional DVD service. If you can laugh on the movie without a real joke, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I tell you to see. If you do not want, avoid away from this film. It will only make you mad.
