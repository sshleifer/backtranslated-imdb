My love for Chris Rock differs from his movies, I hated him after the Lethal 4 Armor, but I hated everyone in the movie after that. Well this is better yet, he did not expect that this is good. I climbed my ass all the time. Chris Rock offers a fascinating exciting story supported by some funniest comedy that I saw at a certain time. He loved it.
