Bogmeister and others have loved this nail. Shore Leave is actually TOS 'first attempt in a sci-fi lightweight (which later future perfect with classic problems and Tribbles). It gave all Enterprise employees and its television surveillance needed for the world that threatens the result, for example, The Corbomite Manouever. You are looking for an opportunity to temporarily switch, Business. occurs in the project M Project Project, and sends the investigating team down to check. Not long enough every kind of absurdity begins to take - some seem to be dangerous - but it all seems to be a barrier to humanitarian stance that played in a strange mysterious mix (McCoy has gone through a mirror watch), psychological thriller (Kirk facing an unreliable striker from the past, with a romantic comedy (no comments). TOS was the smallest of the series in the Trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many periods in the first season took into account the most dramatic, possible disasters. Unlike the authors of the successive series later, the TOS production team was not afraid to go to where there was no previous TV series. And Shore leave, in spite of its frequent problems, is typical. My only criticism for this period is that the cast (especially Shatner - ironic was given his sense of humor) was not found to know how to handle this new defect on ST themes. The last area is perhaps one of the worst events I can remember from the entire TOS run - both compositionally and on the part of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendations - see when you look at the first season if you had a sense of appearance - it is a process.
