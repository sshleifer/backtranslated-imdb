"Girlfight" follows a New York school high school project based on the futility of the world of amateur boxing where it finds personal, purpose, and much more. Although the film is not on boxing, boxing is all about the film. Similarly you can almost smell the odor. Technically and artistic shooting good and sense of honesty and truth about it, "Girlfight" is not a little stick with no "Rocky". Rather, it is a humanitarian game that even viewers who do not know the box will be able to connect.
