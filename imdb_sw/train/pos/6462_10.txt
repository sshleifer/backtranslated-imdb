I cannot destroy the content of anyone, who has not yet looked at this humble Catholic and Kay Pollak. The world's most popular trainer played by Michael Nyqvist in peace wants peace from trouble by moving to his village village. The villagers, who have looked for silence in silence, are trying to gradually collaborate with their greatness. Every role in this film, has a unique purpose and shows the greatest potential in each of the characters to play their own in a concise but accurate, symphony of love. Do not like in the sense of a relationship, but in the spirit of the spirit entered into each of the characters, each revealing the current story, their needs, their bones, desires and much more. I can't forget to mention, the two main sections played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose games are being played in a bad mood. They touch each other with pain that is linked to their own disability. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is being tested here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that end up as a catastrophe or fantastic. And fantastic became from start to finish, not second or more than enough, you have left with a sense of change and taste for more. <br /> <br /> To date, one of the best movies I've been happy to watch.
