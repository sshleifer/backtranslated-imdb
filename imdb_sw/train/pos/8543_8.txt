That was one of those films that I probably never will remove the shelf, but came to IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why? If I changed the station, I would have lost the treasure. This lesson is disturbing - a little paralyzed writer on the crash of an accident crash at the center of the rehabilitation center. It would be very easy and try to make this a tearful effort. But, that doesn't happen because it is written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was paralyzed. No fun of Hollywood here. All patients in the ward come from different backgrounds, but they share the feeling of helplessness, of being sympathetic to others. Stolz is very good as a kind of "wolf", and forced to rely on shame on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is as good as the old woman's family whose family is falling; but William Forsythe takes a cake as a tough guy who decided to make someone pay for taking his freedom. See this movie.
