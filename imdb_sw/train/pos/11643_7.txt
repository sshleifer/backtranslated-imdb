I enjoy this show, but the structure needs a certain task. First, good reputation. I love how this show will take us through everyday life of addict because the producers have a knack in getting addict to show us how bad they allow their lives to be. This is followed by interventions that are followed by results. The interruption is not candy items and sometimes results (often due to time constraints between imitation and telephone calls) are negative results. This makes the best results. Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work. Due to the fact that these cameramen reduces anywhere and they do not benefit the photography photographs are amazing and beautiful. In fact it is better than scripted shows as "Shield" where the picture is bad can influence nausea. <br /> <br /> Now for the worst. Sometimes it has two separate and unrelated passages that are combined together during the show. You will be taken on the story of one punishment then suddenly you are thrown into another story. Get on the same story then suddenly you return to the first addicting ... or you? At the moment you may have forgotten the case in which the individual on the screen is. This constant collapse among the really addicts gets distracted during the intervention of scenes because the show even mixing together two ways has never been quite! I had heard of BS's marketing. Because of this bad design: "The show can get very intense that switch to another disability allows time viewers to get what they look at." O please. Obviously this is done because they have two incidents that are not serious for an hour so they can mix the two together. By combining instead of giving each half-hour barrier, as required, emphasizes the viewer to view the whole thing (and ads) if they like in one case but not another. I was getting these pieces of "blender" so I blamed that I would just like to tell my TiVo recording events with one penalty, but it was easy to write them.
