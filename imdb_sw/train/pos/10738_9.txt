SPOILERS 9/11 is a very beautiful and realistic text on the attack of the French filmmakers of the WTC.2 who are in New York to make NYFD action works facing this event and do more. which happens exactly what gives the movie a more fearful situation. The day of the attack seems like just another bad day at work but soon it will change. He stands with the people of fire to WTC and enters the building. As the second plane crashes, people understand that this is not an accident. this is the time that has a profound effect on the document. Then the tower falls and our French friend should run his life, you hear the breath as a mad man while losing out of the building. Then a huge rainfall of sand dries over it and the screen turns black, he was very lucky to live and now he can film on the Downtown New York road. Because this document contains many historical images and because the film was something quite different from this document it might stay in the memory of everyone. I saw the attacks live at home because I had an afternoon, so this makes even more realistic . 10/10
