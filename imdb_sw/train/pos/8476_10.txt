*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father beat me this film when I was 3 years old. I was watching over 400 times. I just watched it and watched it. And still I do today! It has a good story, the mother of the sheep is killed by the wolf - a very emotional place - and wants to be a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb is made to be a true and evil thing. He and the wolf goes to his old barn, but he cannot kill the sheep, no matter how much he wants. He finishes killing the wolf, but he is no longer seen as a lamb and his old friends, and he cannot return to his old way of life. <br /> <br /> Art is good, the songs are .. well, the same, and the voice of working is more beautiful than other things today. <br /> <br /> For all, you just * have * see this film, it's the best masterpiece. Although, it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
