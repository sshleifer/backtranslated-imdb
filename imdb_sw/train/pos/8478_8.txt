I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! No other endless story ... I grew up in many anime movies and this was one of my many favorites, because it was unusual - stories about injustice, violence, and loneliness, and life, and decisions that cannot be deleted , and the need of others. Chirin is made alone when Wolf kills his mother, but Wolf is alone, too, while Chirin follows him on the mountain. The pastor did not kill the lamb, although every night he says "maybe I will eat it tomorrow." The area I have is broken and destroyed by age and use. I will create and watch the film again one day and cry as hard as I did as a child. Such stories, and deep in this sense, and this difficult meaning, are very rare. It is a sad story, but I've never met any catharsis well done. I am glad to have seen this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
