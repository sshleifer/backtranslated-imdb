I need this on the tape, not the DVD, and soon! I have a nephew who is in the newborn but has never used it, although she decided to go to Iraq after December 2008. I lost my beloved son in Ramadi Irak on 09-15-05 from an unexpected missile in the green zone . I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduates from high school this season because he, as his big brother, has an idea which is recommended by the romantics about what it serves the army. Myon died after only 10 days in the country and never went to any missions so that my grandchildren have no way of mentioning any experience shown in this personal document from any kind of personal experience that might have been brought by my deceased child. There is nothing I can do about those who come in, or now they have gone, but I have one left that does not raise a hand and swear in YET. I really want to do that, but none of the others did. <br /> <br /> Helps me help with this. The film The Ground Truth is the best reference to ever seen. I need to somehow make my little nephew see what he finds himself before the delay. BUT: (don't laugh) I need my mother to see this first. He must see and hear these men and women, not just their idea, but the truth of what they will be brought in, perhaps forever. Then he will have the emotional decision to make my brother look at this film and once he can then make his son, my little nephew, see also. Then, my nephew can begin to take this seriously. (/ there is sometimes where this will be shown on TV? if so please tell me when?)))) / <br /> <br /> However, my problem is, my mother is not a player DVD, still uses video (it is like tape?) So, I need to find a way to be able to watch this movie. Can I buy this from anyone in that form? If not, is there any other way to get this with the form of tape from anyone? What? There is a legitimate link I can pay to download on my computer and then transfer it to the tape. If so, I'll contact him. I will be happy to pay for the opportunity to give it a legitimate link. Or, if you have any alternative ideas I will consider whatever you can recommend. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I lost one of the most precious and loved ones already, I already know my old nephew can never be the same when he returns and I can dismiss him too. I can't open three feelings and emotional feelings for all those who make it back is a very high price to pay for every male in my family of that generation. Please help me. I will call you happy, give me an email number that is the best way to get the information needed. Thank you so much for any help you can give. <br /> <br /> By choice, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
