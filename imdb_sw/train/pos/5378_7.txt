This is a fascinating flick made in 1967, with the sound of the jazzy twangy voice and the plot that will make you laugh ... Well, it's not stupid but it's fun cheesy. I saw many differences between this and the 'Creature with the blue hand' (AKA dead blood) and they have the director! Scotland Yard is the best screening of young women in college. It seems that criminals are rescued from the inner prison to make a bad person's bidding and then return when their work is done. There is a hidden device hidden in the Bible that regulates the prussic acid, and there is another device that is not nifty or clandestine, it seems like a big squirt gun and a victim must be around close to the finish. Joachim Fuchsberger has an auditor and he actually laughs gum and looks away. There is a "monk", and how anyone identifies this as a "monk" is more than me, carries a whip with clothes in red clothing and a red hat, more than a member of Klan's color than a monk. There are all kinds of good materials like a seat of fire that goes up and down to accept a monk, and walks on the fire without putting on his beaten garment, an interesting craft there. This is a wonderful game of crime and goofy violations, and at that time is a time of pride when it is fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
