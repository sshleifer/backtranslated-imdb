When I think of the "Great Escape" I let my mind go back to this small gem of movie from my childhood. I had read and re-read a biography novel from 1949 that led it, and it was only on the movie (we did not use the word then, in fact) in a city that showed a "foreign" film, I was the first on the line to buy my ticket. As someone who brought news of the war and propaganda films during WWII, I had a strong desire to explore the realities of the crisis as shown in the records and stories of men who were there. It was extended later with a strong focus on the years of buying any book on the subject, and finally studying the same compelling stories of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which gave even greater understanding. Films, however, were different from this because they did not send the goods a few times. Among the black and white films has never been properly served as it was in those years. I've never seen a version of any technicolor of war that looks like really like making a deep chiaroscuros of the film as "Horse Wooden." If it is true that we have to be abducted by pictures of our childhood, then I confess freely. <br /> <br /> And there will be no other likes of Leo Genn as a war hero of the British hero on the film. Even Sir Alec.
