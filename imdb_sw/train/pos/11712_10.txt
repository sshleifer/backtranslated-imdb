This is a very great movie "Call me Anna" because it shows how one has been suffering for a long time without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke come out in the public eye and tell her story is an inspiration for those suffering from this disease. I respect as a person. The only thing I don't like is that I can't find on the tape, I've tried to search it but it doesn't work. Anyone knows how to get it?
