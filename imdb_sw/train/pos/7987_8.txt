The man on Fire was hot. I love the most common revenge story, and it is better because of retaliation than the kidnapping of the innocent innocent girl. The authors did a good job in this movie to create a relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer realized and actually feels the Creasy car had to save Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a kind of young singer trying to rescue Pita through the "correct" way, but instead used torture techniques and arrows on the street. Some may say, “Depression is correct regardless,” and you can be right, but when you see Creasy pain passes because of losing Pita and the great enthusiasm it comes to, you can't help side by Creasy and approach him to be more compassionate. He could not have developed as Creasy spent diplomacy to deal with different thugs and brave criminals and knew that. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Effasy attempts ended with Pita's return to her mother and Creasy to die in a bad car. But the death of Creasy did not reduce the effectiveness of the film, in fact reinforced by showing that Creasy had already died to get Pita back. His death was really good. Denzel does a good job as authors. This movie deserves a good score because it was a good movie.
