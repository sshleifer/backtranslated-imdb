This is a great series of Canadian comedy. The movie describes how the star Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the chief author of the show with his friends Rickie and bubbles play up on what real life satirical watch trailer parks and denizens said trashy hoods. The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian begin to do their most advanced jobs in the world of crime. Why and the reasons for everything will be a spoiler so I can give a real reason behind their most brilliant trips. Their friends and partner of time (bubbles) are a brilliant character. The whole version is brilliant and no movie will not affect how you see one set. It is a comedy and C capital and brilliant satire on reserve trailer parks and hard small time with little time ideas but a great dream time. If you get a chance to watch - buy - steal this app to carry it. You will be glad you did. And for my American friends - It will also break you. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. Television how TV should be.
