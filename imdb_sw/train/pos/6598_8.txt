I saw this film, when I was going to Brazil. I found it difficult to understand the culture and culture of Brazil, because it has many regional and class distinctions. Seeing this film in Sao Paul itself was a revelation. It shows something of the daily life of many Israelites. On the other hand, sometimes it's a little over-dramatized. And that's the only opinion I have on this film. It is sometimes very, many sex, many killings and reluctance to one film. The director can film some of the subtle elements, it would make the film more effective. Though this I loved the film and how the story gives birth. The characters are complicated, and much like real people of life. Not good American actors and cosmetics practitioners of many cosmetics, but people who can be bad and good at the same time. That makes the film really, even when the story is not convincing.
