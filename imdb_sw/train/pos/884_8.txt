If you are a fan of a film and you think they don't have 'em as they used, here's your answer - they don't do' em in Hollywood again. We should turn to the French to remember how an effective, craft and powerful film that is available well from that kind can be. Read My Lipu is a very good gift to the trustees from director Jacques Audiard, featuring a strong dialogue and good performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic plan can be written in 40 years: dumb but attractive old female and smart but dowdy femme fatale (who returns to be proud of pride) discovering each other while living a desperate life and desire, running each other to reach its end, developing a complex love / hate relationship, cooking a plan of crime involving waist, two crosses, a close call and a lot of money. All actions occur in humiliation, seeds and / or inappropriate places. <br /> <br /> Audience has made modern changes, of course. Fatale of women is an unpopular office worker who is close to the deaf and uses her ability to read verbal retaliation for those who isolate themselves. And where you expect love love scenes you see that all the characters are awkward and child sex. Add to the latest technology and music and it looks like a modern film, but don't make a mistake - this is an old school nightclub. It's as good as any film from a variety and easily one of the best films I have seen all year round.
