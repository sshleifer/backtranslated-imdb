Very good film made. Does not live in your memory. Excellent better as romance than flying or war, altho part of the fly is real and almost free error. Flying flyers like I would like to enjoy this film even if it attracts a bird, unless they have no understanding or has never been in love. She is beautiful and beautiful of charm. His reading of "High Flight" is good. <br /> <br /> enjoys, Boom
