The first thing I thought when I got this film is: It's not just a film, at least not what we think when we hear the word "film". is a typical example, everything in it means symbolic. So if you are used to describe something in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you do not know philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it is a myth of stories ... and even one wonderful, chaotic. For me "The Story of Zu" is quite clear. And I like it. It tells us in a story about a fight between light and darkness, a war that is as old as humanity, and everyone who seeks a sense in this life is faced with it. The film is open to Buddhists. I'm not Budha. My religion and the vision of the world and human are different. But even though we are all human beings and we have human nature we need a common experience and we can understand each other. It's a very good film! And I who got more films like this - films that are meaningful. There are many empty stories that are just good to pass the time faster.
