Movie brilliant about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. Macy is a very good actor. It was embarrassing to see him in the same picture as Campbell, who looks at the part of the sex object of neurotic but they do not have chops to work with him to the extent that the script is needed. But he is a very good actor that played down to his level performing performances. I am very happy to be trapped by Tracey Ullman as a lost wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he acts makes his character seemingly long (and even less in some cases). Almost everyone knew what they did. The Macy Exhibition of the only unique character whose behavior cannot be attentive is not a short-term control.
