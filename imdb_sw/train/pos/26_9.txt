When I was a child I looked many times over, and I remember telling a "happy song" many times. All songs are good, and really do not remember, unlike many children's music, where songs are considered for false reason. Events and clothing are great, and acting is very good, which is not surprising, considering the cast. Christopher Walken is a very catlike, and do not need to make a fool, or a cat dress for a viewer to believe he is a cat transformed to humans. And Jason Connery is very good, like a shy child and the surprise of miller, Corin, who loves to a beautiful and brave girl of Princess Vera. This is an enjoyable, interesting, feature-length movie, where different from many fairytales, characters are given a heritage. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Korin pretend to be trying; on the ball when everyone begins to play the dance of the country, as "all the fury abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, playing on the table (he is a good dancer, too!); and when Vera tells Corin all things he did when he was younger, like pretending to be a miller daughter. I would like to recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairytales. And in fact it's a movie that you can watch together, as it can't run adults on the wall.
