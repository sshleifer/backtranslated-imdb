A clear balance between the wonderful Bedknobs of Walt Disney and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Narnia's story is very clear. There are more variations here than compare Bedknobs and Broomsticks than Mary Poppins though a lot of similar creative talents entered into two Disney films. <br /> <br /> As Narnia's Things involve English children from London during blitz and come to live in the country. And these children should deal with the world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis's Rawlins children have magic invade their world and help defeat people who make up here and now. There is no return to the wonderful kingdom as the children of Pevilla. There is no philosophy of great responsibility here from Walt Disney unless perhaps it is not interesting and even the witches even like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs Lansbury did not become one of the many characters for the unemployed. She carries her magic brand that even the special effects of boys on Disney were not over. They also won Oscar for the Kingdom of Magic in the department for this film. <br /> <br /> Two artists gave birth to a film in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in the film, enjoyed many of the films in the UK as one of their favorite music artists. And the great character of Reginald Owen as head of pensioner who heads the Old Home Guard in battle and in the tender adieu song for film viewers around the world. Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote a mark for Mary Poppins wrote good and appropriate here. Unbelief age was chosen for Oscar, but it was lost to the landscapes from Shaft. Personally though I am like David Tomlinson's taxes through the color of London's roads, the road to Portabello. <br /> <br /> Bustknob and Broomsticks are a great fantastic film which still crowded well after nearly 40 years. Imagine how it would be like with graphics produced by computers.
