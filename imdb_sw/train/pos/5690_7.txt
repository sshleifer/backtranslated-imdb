Just watch this movie on the DVD and think acting it was very good, but all the news was spared very much. This movie has the same texture and look of Fear in the Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It is hard to believe that humans can live this kind of life; on low social conditions, where their general existence depends on the use of drugs, crime, abuse, sex, and lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including them. Val Kilmore is the best in its role of "burned out" the former porn star John Holmes. Assistance is just the same. However, this is a black, dark, complicated, and oppressive film. The murder was cruel, but the daily life of these people was cruel too. If you have an interest in the killing or is a "fan" of John Holmes, this is not a visual film. If you want to see the docu festival on murder, the 1960s Truman Capote In Cold and Scott Wilson's star and Robert Blake are much better.
