WINCHESTER 73 is the story of man (Jimmy Stewart) who came up and returned to his precious possession, a repeat gun made by Winchester. The gun continues to change hands, and Stewart is looking for it. This B&W effort of 1950 and Anthony Mann is more than a crime film than the traditional west, and often cowboys seem more like modern-day bandits than cowboys of the past. Shelley Winters plays with a woman with a good reputation that goes to ranch and someone (Charles Drake) can marry. He completes the collapse of Stewart, but not before the closest admission. Winters are the most difficult character in the film full of ordinary characters. See Dan Dureyea limited as a nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A terrible disorder Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
