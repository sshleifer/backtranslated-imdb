This very unit makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In fact, maybe they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this looks very much like one person has the ability to judge everyone including his own people to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon is doing a very reliable job like Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of killing the entire film. He still tries to remember who he had how he got. He gets help from a few people & looks like every minute of the film, someone tries to kill him. There is little time to relax in this film & step-by-step process is very real. There is a lot of follow-up guidance by a shaky camera which in a way adds to the reality and makes it seemingly less image than many images. This process enhances the realities of the film by feeling. Claiming in a certain series is being made clear if you wonder if someone will die or if Bourne can drive them out. This is the kind of point of emphasis you are going to see when you are translated and I am sure this will lead to the next film in a row.
