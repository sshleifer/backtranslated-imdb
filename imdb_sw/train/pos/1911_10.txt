I love new events with CJ and Grandad - I liked the story of the story and Kate fall to the prince. I want to know what is happening for Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I love its scenes with Grandad. I have loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is a loan to his acting that I didn't think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and to trust him completely as Kate's father. This family is true and wonderful. It was very sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life these things happen and how they were written in a series and dealt with were surprisingly and sad and always associated with care and love. But in general it is a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
