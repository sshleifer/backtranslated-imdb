I watched this film unexpectedly and I don't know anything about it. I liked it. Very good, bright, exciting hook in the form of a bad girl, oil, deaf and old wife, and the speed that continued with objects without hurrying. <br /> <br /> The best movie, better than the director of De battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and impossible. The only thing that had no work at all was that the old bad girl, the rage was not bad nor fat: solid, sure, and far from normal size, but with many habits in her face that she took the screen whenever he was on it. Good. I would have been in the film more, and better than he in general. I found a bit of Gilles's wife and a little of Mustache, and both seemed like a trash, and I saw all of the De battre mon coeur se arreté, and certainly it's garbage. He seems to have a few who come, so I will put my fingers on their backs.
