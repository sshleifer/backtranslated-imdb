******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> What can I say? I enjoy it when it comes to Cowboy Town. I love it and I have watched it many times - and often find something new about it and look at each other. I think one of the things I liked about him is that Town Cowboy is almost working for class people, not rich people living in LA or New York. In fact, it's actually except Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta has Bud, a small Texas town who migrates to Houston to work in oil fields. And this is when Travolta played on a good movie as Saturday Saturday night rather than playing badly on bad guys on big budget movies. This is a very good movie - the pig race of cattle and two feet feet can be silly, but you should enjoy this why. <br /> <br /> Bud meets with Sissy (played with Debra Winger and cautiously) - and after a while, they are married and live on their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real war of sex life. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to have a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not clear. Where can Parliament prove to be a real person? He can do his dangerous work on the day and run the mechanical cow at night - he can become a "urban cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up car, and he wants to plant a mechanical beef, too. So where does this come from Bud? As Sissy says his independence, he sleeps on the rush of cattle and flirts with the old prison prison and prison - a real-cowboy, Wes (very well played by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy breaks. <br /> <br /> Sissy breaks down with Wes, who does it. Read more, Bud becomes a toy boy of Pam, a rich girl who Daddy is fat and all means. Sissy comes with a trailer to purify - Pam doesn't do it. She writes a letter to Bud, but the bad Pam crushes and takes credit for Sissy homework. Grandpa's uncle Bob dies at the time of lightning and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to reconcile, but they are very stubborn. Later the competition for the competing cow is Gilley, and you know Bud is going to win. Pam knows that Bud does not like, but Sissy - did it for her. Wes tries to steal Gilleys, but you don't know that the village cowboy, Bud, saves the day and defeats the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you may wonder why Bud and Sissy will go to Gilleys about every night and "live like a pig." Perhaps that contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud did not have Pam - was not bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had friends like Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to crush them: Marshall says Bud, "He {Sissy} stood that cow than you!" But the fun part of the City Cowboy is a little fun - and say, not that Bonnie Raitt on stage!
