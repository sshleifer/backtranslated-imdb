Although I am very young, Beatles is my very weak band! I have never had a chance to hear their music if it was released but I love them since I remember. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of film that is worth trying once. I see why it was not released on the movie but it is a good film on TV. I was playing through my TV guide and I saw this film, had no details except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney met after Beatles broke, Jared Harris Stars'. I could not hear (played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. Yet they are unworthy characters! <br /> <br /> The movie had a slow start but as it was, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a big fan, I have a kind of know what Lennon real and McCartney have. The script was brilliant and Harris got the pressure of Lennon, personality and effective way! Quinn played McCartney very well but sometimes entered into his Irish statement. The decision-makers made them look better. <br /> <br /> HAPPENS TO GET IN AS * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, it started slowly but soon continued and became an emotional film. I have seen a little in the temporary loss of time and completely without a tendency for both musicians. As for the line of the rude line in the Italian restaurant, it does not require much. The end was very good and brought tears to my eye whenever I looked. It is very different from other biography movies I have seen where it is about how Beatles gathered and became popular, and those who have never done the same. E. 'Go'. In conclusion, I would like to say, if you are Beatles or John Lennon or a fan of Paul McCartney, make a chance you have a good surprise. For only 95 minutes, it is necessary to wait for the film to develop. If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting was actually done please send to the 'comment page' for this film, I'd be very interested.
