There are 21 comments if I add a mine to this list and there is little resistance. This is because this film is a mild entertainment and has a bit of everything in it. It might be a little frightening for young children but my 15-year-old child thought it was strange every way from action, humor and even a good music. I buy you a DVD only when I know that they will watch regularly and now that this is finally available in England, add to my collection.
