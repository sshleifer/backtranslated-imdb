Another brilliant view of Kurosawa, its first color film is looking for darkness on the evil living of Tokyo-based residents, basically a series of interventions that show several groups of people living badly in a harsh and unconscious city after of the city war. Departing from shock and tragedy and backward, this film shows how people are involved in each other's own lives in their own way, especially engaging in themselves and living in a fantasy world of their own heads, withdrawing from those around them or tie themselves in alcohol. Combining the authenticity of the kitchen-sinking and Kabuki-esque presentations, the fingers of the specialty and the feelings of its listeners, drawing tears and laughter in similarities. A wonderful experience, moisture.
