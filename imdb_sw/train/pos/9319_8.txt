........ Play Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was very beautiful and cried. I love to watch him / Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or anyone - he seems to have a ball and I think he made it easier for his visitors too - as long as they knew before he was disciplined, 19 taking a form of production. Rest and be free is the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> Reminds people like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis too. The best time, the ancient gags that held the audience to the south for decades, have enjoyed much of what they did. His small sad clown played was also good - but in a manner of touch. > au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au au I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was playing in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Check out this if you're a fan or want. He was a riot.
