Sentinel is a movie proposed to me years ago, and my father, and I have seen it many times since. It can always be interesting to me, when you have enough efficiency too. Flashback events are what they did for me. Cristina Raines' father walking around with everything enough, with the angry woman, can always send a spine under my back. it is your good example and evil, but at least it can be entertaining. Finally I have seen it as one of the history of Horror. It has many problems and doubts, seeing Burgess Meredith doing his thing as Chazen, had me on the edge of my seat. Sentinel has to create a full of tension. We are never quite well when Allison is on the screen. We know something terrible is always waiting for him, and that has done things all the time. This film is often overlooked among fans of fear, but I personally think it's one of the best there, and it certainly has enough for all fans of Fear, to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions. Cristina Raines has her time of wood, but came though in a great way to a great part. She is good looking, and her chemistry and Saranadon felt nature. Chris Sarandon is as good as his partner, Michael. He had the presence of an instant screen, and I couldn't help him but love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable responsibilities, or small villages. Burgess Meredith is as strong as Chazen. He looks like a normal ordinary person, but what we know, is awesome. Eli Wallach & Christopher Wlaken are doing well, as bumbling spies. Beverly D'Angelo has a horrible scene, that I can't destroy. <br /> <br /> Below down. Sentinel is an effective film of Horror which fans of fear, sadly tend to ignore. It will give you joy and horror you need to be satisfied. You have worth checking. <br /> <br /> 7/10
