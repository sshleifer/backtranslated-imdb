I have seen this film right now, and there is always someone complaining about the "apparent construction" of the future plot. But then - this is part of the game of Petzold: plays with the rules of genre. It is very good, how very incredible stories about how two girls (Timothy / Hummer) meet, are no longer visible on another, even the most impossible stories, which girls make for the throw. This film is a journey between truth and fiction, it is more likely on the possibilities, things that may have happened in the past or may be happening later, than it was on real success. It reverie, a kind of - so very suitable there are many motives, Freud can be found to attract attention to its interpretation of dreams, such as all "doppelganger". Also, I think, "Gespenster" can be amazingly viewed in comparison to the current Asian cinematic movies: The daily architecture of Petzold also feels haunted in an unusual odd way. This film is not about the obvious. Describe it as the story of the two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of orphans, who seeks Europe for her lost daughter, clearly does not mean much about the "Gespenster" situation at all.
