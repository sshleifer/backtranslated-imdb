Jim Belushi's entertainment car, a modern version of cockeyed of a wonderful life. Michael Caine has an angel of a kind that allows Belush to see how life would have been like "made it great". Jim is ideal for good news and support; it looks like a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. It is not a Oscar competitor but it is a fun heart warm.
