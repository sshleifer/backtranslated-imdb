I only saw this beautiful nature of the dead life of the Dead Dead, and it must say it was very bad and so was very good. This movie included all the antics and prestigious attractions that were originally included in the cemetery, the house caused by abandoned, floor and front lawn. What exactly love on this movie is the use of comical bread and all the common bread at home has hate against. Yes, we know that toasters, flat ovens and zip-locks have made bread several times and now they must call for their help to win the reanimated bread. In addition to the low cost of sound and sound, this beautiful short film is my personal passion for the dead of the Dead Dead, even better than the Night of the Dead Dead in 1990. What do I do this? A movie to watch is how writers and directors used all the conversations from the original movie and converted it to bread, including how the bread was made again and avoided because it is very dangerous. Another great reason to love this movie is that there is no exception if the bread is bad, the bagels are bad and even the conversation is bad, which is shown by the hilarious scene involving news and the monotone priest. I think monitors are doing a lot of humor when they are viscously with pieces of bread (ie, car location). I think the latter is very important around. Although this is short and that "The Day of the Day of the Day of the Bride's Revenge of the Terrorist Revolution of Evil, Mutant, Alien, Eating Body, Hellbound, Zombies Living Dead Part 2: In amazingly 2-D "describes another great community, it still proposes as a good surprise done by, what seems to be the university vendors. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who can surprise the Living Night of the Living and still has respect for the creators of the film. I would also recommend this film to anyone who loves D-movies and horrible threats, it's just a small short film of horror which is fun to see and learn.
