This is a fantastic film, which is always trying. It seems to go on to the cliche on several points, and then the amazing thing will happen that starts. It could give too much to say more, but stick to this film and you will be very useful. William Haines is very happy - he is a star that deserves to be found again. Homosexual congestion in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is a place where Haines strikes Pickford's (Pickford has cool). All actors are playing this small text and in the depth of feeling, so that there is a time when it is very moving. And I didn't think I could be involved in a football match as I did in this film - and I don't even know the rules! Also better is the son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph as an opponent of Haines for a girl (yes, not quite a gay film). Wonderful classic silence - a good example of years of 20 years business and edge.
