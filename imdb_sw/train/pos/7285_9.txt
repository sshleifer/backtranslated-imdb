This movie was afraid of me when I was just a child. Not "Citizen Kane" but has time. The hand stack is good. The plan is good even if the characters do not have - they may have nothing to do with acting. Put the top people on the roles and see what you get. This was one of the bullets, silk (small) and distributing in a few months of the movie. This is a sci-fi of the most common budget and just suits. I tested 9 basic types of this type and age.
