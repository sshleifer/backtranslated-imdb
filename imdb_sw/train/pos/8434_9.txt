I've been a fan of show so I will admit that I am enjoying it. When the operation was over, I heard as many questions remained unanswered. This movie to me I felt like closed. Seeing all the people I have watched over the last few years together with the latter was more profitable. I have heard that this is probably the only movie to be killed that we can expect. If so, this is the right way to go out. Sometimes this movie is highly hurt, sometimes eliminates, but always meets. If you or you have been a fan of the show, check out this film.
