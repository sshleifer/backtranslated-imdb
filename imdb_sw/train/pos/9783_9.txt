How you could say that Peaches, and its hard-to-do details about many issues, are "a little TV idea" is on me. Far I can think of many films that have a "little TV concept" in its squares. Your apparent preference for the TV industry ("Sue Smith failed to rise above its television history") combines. especially if you have a "good time" to work on television. If only we can have talents like Ms Smith (no, not a friend or a relative) - AFI to win the AFI Awards, the road from Coorain, etc.. All made for TV. Come to think about it, how about those "little TV ideas" as "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "Break", "Balance of Justice", "Blue Valley", "Water Under Bridge", etc.. I think Peaches is a good film of entertainment that was my mind, and many of my friends also, from beginning to end. It's far from free but I think it's among the best Australian films I have seen over the last few years. Who knows, with a few more views (there is a lot to think about), it may be up there with classics as "The My Year Voice Broke", "Devil's Playground". I enjoyed this film more than "Somersault" and "Three Empire". These films, I think, had their time-surreal, atmosphere, realistic and dealing with the most important modern issues, but for the very entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer with me, it was very common if not boring. When I go to the cinema, I always know the responses of the audience on the film (through the effects of movies and hear the conversation on the foyer and yo). Some came from Peaches shaking their heads, others with bad opposition, but many seemed to enjoy the experience.
