This movie takes the essence of growing in a small US city for a little girl alone. Realistic and subtle nuances, offered to the character of Ashley Judd, Ruby, for legendary stories, catch what can only be described to be true to the living conditions in the Florida Panel. From the slam of the screen of the screen, for the lack of work, the echoes of life that are actually on the "red-neck pillow" give a bad choice for the little girl. Paradise did not come easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception, and learn to be a woman herself, with the power coming from inside. Smiling smile of Ashley Judd, with an infectious temperature of outdoor temperatures and a decent and delightful command. The rapid development of behavior is similar to the "Gold of Ulee" in 1997, with a star by Peter Fonda, and also led by Victor Nunez.
