The amazing performance from Simon Pegg who gets better and better for each role. As always he plays a part of a very aggressive character which makes you want to hide behind your pillow for shame for him sometimes, but that's what Pegg refers to all. <br /> <br /> Regular laughter and watering eye and each of them wanted Penn. The movie was carefully put together where each character has a very sophisticated and large part with Penn being just a comedy to share which is a great loan to Director Robert Weide. And I cant allow this one to go without the immediate round of gladi to Gilliam Anderson who was inside. It is highly recommended for all.
