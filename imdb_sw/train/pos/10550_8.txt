I looked at this as part of my course at the University of Aberystwyth and despised me as this does not have a distributor in the UK. Certainly, it is not appropriate, because this film is everything of Hollywood film is not - natural, creative, quirky and exciting. It seems that today no one likes to see this kind of film as, in simple terms, it is not like the most common gatherings that look at many young people in the film. 'We wrote the IMD review for many years but felt the desire to give this film a special mention, even if it's a 30-minute break between classes! In fact, it is about anything, as the two main characters have been beaten in their own world of scarcity through the hatred of the world. Carefully here is how the director shares interest in a long run with just two characters and when the sole project connects half of the house with white, empty space. This is due to a large part of the stellar exhibition of actors, all who offer great laughter at the same time able to add deep emotional emotion to their roles. <br /> <br /> I would like to write more but it's quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to test this film. A very unique concept brings to the screen in a consistent and well-developed style, with a mix of beautiful performances, a powerful, beautiful script and a good-to-play video that makes a lot of entertainment. It's just a few people know about something ....
