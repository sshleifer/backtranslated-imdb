FATTY TAKES BUS is just a funniest, original and entertaining job that has ever been a pleasure to see. This movie is not available for Hollywood, or even movie-to-movie movie comedy star star "hulk" hogan, for the camera function, editing, acting, budget, or something nothing else. <br /> <br /> What this movie has, however, is very natural and enjoyable stories, and it is obviously made by people who love to do it, and the enthusiasm of all the staff and staff breaks completely through all its budget and decline speed. This movie proves that you 'We have a great budget or dignitaries to make a good film, you need both original ideas and some enthusiasm for what you are doing. <br /> <br /> Only the best movie ever. I don't care how you get, rent, sell, steal, download, just see this film. <br /> <br /> I just hope to make a DVD version.
