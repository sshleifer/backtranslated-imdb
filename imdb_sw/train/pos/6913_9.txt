As a theater actor who works hard but does not take too much work, I am always hated by those who regard it as Art Art. This contemporary says "Craft Actor" mercilessly when you lose a lot of good laugh. <br /> <br /> The actor of the ham in the area for the movie bears identical to the dictator. When the dictator dies with heart attacks due to alcohol and food, the actress has been kidnapped and forced to play "part of life" and the head of the Neo-Nazi secret service. She plays for a hilt, gets a boyfriend of a fighter falling to love him and vice versa, and returns the table to her captors to the best. A lot of good shtick and headings, many good works and unknown unknown characters, especially household workers and two members of the house guards, and little unhappy people came. Sammy Davis Jr. announces himself, Jonathan Winters is doing a half-year trading business with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfuss is unique. dumb movies, but has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors who do their work and look like they are very happy and have no natural way to be on what is just playing!
