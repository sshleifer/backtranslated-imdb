I had already held this part, since this 'teacher' has no awesome film under its belt. But this is a very good part of the season. <br /> <br /> Acting was good! I don't know how he opposed it, but we've had real talent in this period! And when you can see the result of a plot of miles away from discretion, at least it was an entertaining and managed to put me in full 56 hours, something that has not been so far in the series. I really loved the last time, not to lose for every saying, but it's a little bit where he becomes, as it is, hubby chicken. <br /> <br /> Very good efforts. As I said in another review - these are not true masters who do many of these events. But they can one day live to be future masters.
