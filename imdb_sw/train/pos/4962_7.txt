"Brak Show" is good. Maybe not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast and Coast", but certainly has a most brilliant time. It usually follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have normal life and go to school, live in the neighborhood of 50 sitcoms. ) with amazing situations and wonderful characters but it is beautiful, it has beautiful places. Some songs are good, others are not so much but I like to show this. The funniest character is the father of Brak. (that is a human, no one knows why)
