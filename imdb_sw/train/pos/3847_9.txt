At this time, this film had a controversial conflict (such as Verhoeven's many projects). <br /> <br /> It has very graphic images of death; Parachuti which does not open * body guys on the floor. The boy with the teeth of the Lion's nose at the throat. And the boy being beaten with the blood-bleeding * goes down. But over a year, this flick also has brilliant pictures (and surprisingly), done in the gray fishing town which is Vlissingen; Thousands of rosebuds exploding on the screen, in a non-meaningful movie, a beautiful woman (holy) puts flowers in a milk-can, surrounded by slabs of blood and steam love of two male characters, in the grave. The story has been completed in anger, but it is only about 10 minutes, which is not encouraging, and it will leave you breathe in the breath of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Of course the benefits come to anger, Some special effects are very high, and it is definitely done to see far away Verhoeven can push the cause of the cloud (eg many eye hanging out of their buttocks). Also, when two leading actors, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), are doing their best to breathe life in their characters, Herman's character (shown by the most unpopular Thom Hoffman) hears too much, making it difficult to maintain, even after death its great. I have done a good job to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect this amazing film, and as you can see, it is not easily understood by words. So make yourself a permit, if you're getting this movie somewhere, see! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
