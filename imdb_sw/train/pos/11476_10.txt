The zero day is the basis of the high school murder. with its diary video of two boys. for the first time you do not know what will happen if you think it's just a bad film of students. until you start talking about the horrible things they are doing at this school altogether. until you start talking about bombing bombs and guns and going to shoot on the forest. they are a lot to say about this movie. all know this film is a good film you forget you watch the film and watch the real video two boys made. <br /> <br /> The two boys make as they are in a strange service. they throw all things there. like sports center games to play dvd centers working school school stuff. The two boys can be any friends of your brothers or people you see walking on the street. it goes through everyday work (and that is to make guns.) on the video they are doing describes the violence that happens and how people say things about clothes and things you are in me I didn't tell her right but many people do things like that. It is also something that these people are thought to love because of the sensitive topics they chose on this film. <br /> <br /> so thats my opinion on zero day. It lets you say the last shot of the shot has been broken.
