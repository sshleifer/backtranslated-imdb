Although we look at this version of "Samhain", and even though I still love it, it is not as a "rejection" version that I have. If you look at the message board, you will see an exemption from this cut-off director, 79 minutes., And says he didn't have anything to do with this R-rated edited and last end. In fact, a Christian does not need that far, because the basic things of the year are still standing, even though they are greatly reduced. This is a disgrace of disgrace, because this was likely to be one of the best films and best years for years. It still has porn stars, and inbreds, and some severe gores can at least appear part. I am very happy to have a "cut for cutting", because for me, it's a jewel for any library of gorehounds. Christian Viel certainly has the knowledge and vision of providing products, and surely its future project will be well produced. Wdiots had a classic close in their hands, and wiped everyone. "Samhain" can be one of the most controversial movies and mishandled forever, and the worst gorehounds did not look at what the director wanted. **************************************************************************************************************************************** *** So just know what you have lost, this is my opinion based on the "printed work" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> Movie runs more than 90 minutes and it doesn't have a frame. There is absolutely no sound of music, and some events do not have a voice in the discussion, because I think they mean a future beat. However, most of the films have a voice and a voice that affects, and when the effect or location does not exist, the message is seen as cue inserted when the movie is completed. It's the same as it says, "Cut the bad", but the only version of "Samhain" has ever seen. The reason, because the year is very graphic, more than even the NC-17 could allow. Yes there are few stars porn, but it's just for murder, and add a little sugar and ingredients. The story is very good, American tourists on vacation in Ireland and end up staying in the house in the middle of the trees. The heaviest place at the ceremony, which includes the ancient Druids and the festival of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. (spooky) <br /> <br /> Movie starts with a great dose of gore, as a couple of camps are attacked by one of the domestic mutants. This is a huge area of ​​the year, as a boy finds his girl climbing from the rock, with her cry for help. All he sees is his head, arms and shoulders hang in front of him and when he pulls him, he is completely bound in two. That's what I will call EXTREME GORE, with legs, blood, and broken legs everywhere. We are in Herschell Gordon Lewis area here, but the effects seem to be more realistic. I'm just going to fly the story, because it's your usual statement and kill the plot. <br /> <br /> The second part of the year is something to see, as a partner from the first murder is taken to the cave as a scene (TCM-2), and bound a table. This geek eliminates all his legs off (away from the camera, to cue insert the area), and then we see his torso on the barbeque hole, turning slowly on fire, and the torso has a hard (if you can believe that). Yes, the worst, grotesque, horrible, it gets the right word, and maybe also good. Then Jenna Jameson, his good body and all, is cut from the neck to the fall, and all its organs are out of the glee, and his blood goes into the pot. Yummy, turn true on hu? But the best place for the year is taking place in the house, and it must be accepted, this is one of the best events of the year I saw. This boy (no matter who) is found from the back from the geek, and cut open to the dungeon. Geek lays his hands in and refuses all male organs, intestines, and whatever is there, from his ass. This goes forever, as the boy is shouting and more and more supplemented on the floor of the bathroom floor. This is very strong, so on top, that I found myself laughing all hell. In fact, you will never see this place on a suitable DVD, IMO, as well as many other true things that happened. <br /> <br /> Then, what to think about all of this. Well, first of all, even though I doubt that this film will be released in this useless ceremony, it makes this "Bad Cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. Yes, it is a little harder at first, without a voice sound, few scenes are still inserted, and features that have no names anywhere. But that's what makes this very unique, and I'm not going to do business for you now. Extreme, yes, a very severe year. This makes the "Top tension" looks like a Disney movie.
