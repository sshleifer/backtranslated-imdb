This is the best movie I saw. I have seen a film on Dutch television sometimes in 1988 (?). That month were showing the Yugoslavia movie every Sunday night. Next week there was another big movie (including trains, rather than bus) that I don't remember. If you know, please let me know! In any case, how can I see this picture again? DVD of this movie, where? Please say on vannoord@let.rug.nl Next week there was another good movie (including trains, rather than bus) that I don't remember. If you know, please let me know! In any case, how can I see this picture again? DVD of this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl
