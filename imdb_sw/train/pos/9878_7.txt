almost every review of this film I saw was very bad. It's not so bad, it's really good, though it's not good. Judy Garland's attitude would have been discouraged, but she did not allow it. Everywhere on the line, I've been a fan of chat, spread, overturning Van Heflin, at least in 40 years. I paid 7.
