But how can you stand up to create a baseball team that can't win? For George Knox, it's not easy. When the movie opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) climb the thier bicycles near an angel's field. When they returned home to the guardian's mother, Roger was sent to visit her father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And asking his father when he was a family again, he father jokes "I say when the angel win the championship championship" So later, Roger and J. P hide the tree watch children play baseball. When the farmer George Knox (Danny Glover) takes his drink, the pitcher gets stupid and comes into a fight with him, and soon the angel team comes into the battle that gets Knox from the game. That night Roger makes a prayer, with horns to win the championship. When her mother promotes Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to basli, Roger sees the real sky coming to the field and helps the left-hand (Matthew McConaughey) makes a catch, which leaves leaves and play-by-person O Sanders did so. Roger learns from the archangel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the horn, because he alone prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
