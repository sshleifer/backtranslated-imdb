This movie is SOOOO funny !!! Acting is amazing, Ramones are sexy, joke is cunning, and the plot is just what every secondary dream to make his school. I liked the sound of the voice as well as amazingly carefully. If you like monty python, You will like this film. This movie is a little tad "grease" esk (without all sad songs). Singing songs are recommended; you may even find yourself singing these songs once the movie goes on. This music includes two numbers in music (next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think like music for every saying; to see how good the music is, it is difficult to say the area of ​​attention was done. I think of this movie as more of the comedy and the undertones of romance. You will be reminded of what was like being a rebellious boy; without saying, you will remember your old school days after seeing this film. It is highly recommended for all families (since it is very small but also for adults because there are many jokes which are funnier and age and experience.
