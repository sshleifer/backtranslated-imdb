I think this is a great version, I have come here before, helping me get a version that I have sent and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read comments from comments users and then helped me get this version. I don't know if I find this version and it's not also. I tried to look at all the other versions and no connectivity on it, Nothing like the book, and I DON'T LIKE if you read the book you want something to deal with. When you look for the real thing and move after reading the book it is difficult because you want something that looks similar. I would say God himself led me to this edition. It shows true love for mankind. I would say the love of God is great.if there is something better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no such!
