"Scorpion Tail Check" has all the features that are necessary to make an effective movie. Stories are the standard rate. When a person dies in an aircraft accident his wife (Ida Galli) finds a life insurance policy of $ 1 million. The widow leads Greece to pay for but the series of violence is followed. There are many suspects, including strict investigations (George Hilton) from the insurance agent and the widow's partner. Director Martino keeps the story moving fast speed when the viewer tries to assume the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also remembered in "Your Vice is a locked room and I only have a" feature "and" who saw her death ") is a wonderful heroine. It is one of the best videos of Martino.
