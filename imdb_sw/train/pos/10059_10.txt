This movie is the best film. I can't remember when the last movie gave tears from me. and tears in my eye, I enjoy this movie. It has all the things that a good movie must have: Good discussion, Music, Acting, Story / Plot. The story of friendship, courage, stability and trust between the street ruler who is known to the King of Masks and the little girl sold as a boy in serf bazaar. The little girl liked to be her grandson and King of Masks loved the granddaughter. They were not really normal. Every area they were together was very valuable. The camera function is not available and you find it. Act is revealed. Xu Zhu was as good as King of Masks. Fighting Zhou "Doggie" looks good and playing his character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was good. He played his useful and tender personality very well. If you don't have this film, try it once, Do you look at it.
