Story and music (George Gershwin!) It's amazing, if it's Levant, Guetary, Foch, and, really, Kelly. One thing is missing, and that's a fine woman that leads. Sorry, Leslie Caron drives me. However, despite him, the plot goes well with the most popular (and horizontal) ballet. Oh color, interesting reds, blues, weeks, and yellow. Don't forget also the price too. ; ) I enjoy only the difference between the Beaux Art Ball (black and white dress) and the ever-brilliant ballet. So I think what I'm trying to say is: Please, by all means see, and enjoy, because it is not good, it's NOW. But make sure you do not forget that another Gene Kelly music and a 20-year-old girl who had just been confident after that.
