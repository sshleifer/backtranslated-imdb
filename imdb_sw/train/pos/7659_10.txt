Have I finished watching this film, which is very sad. It has also been in South Africa twice, close to when this film is installed. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a hard-to-beat, and opening events have 'setting location'. Increasingly faster but faster allows it to break, and indeed there is a short period of light. You will never see Nigel Hawthorne the same. He came as a very miserable person, and I found myself more annoying every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Generally agree with Steve-thomp's comments of positive and positive.
