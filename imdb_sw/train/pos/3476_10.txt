Let's get expulsion: If you are a child-boomer, you have long wondered why, in 1976, McCartney had the ability to leave the city of John and spend the day with him. Surely you also wondered how things went. I heard the report similar to that the author of this film heard, from the perspective of John and Paul, and I admit that I reviewed the meeting for pretty much the same as this film does. But none of my ideas could buy tears with my eyes this way a wonderful piece of work and action. I discovered amazing life, fully plausible and 100% saccharin-free. Now, is there anyone can explain why I didn't hear of this masterpiece before being shown by CBC last night? I mean it's already three years, for good! And yes, if you're a fan of Beatles, this is a must-see performance! Even the tricks of the Beatles songs in the past are led.
