If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent film. I have seen just a few hours ago in Paris (where the movie's action is being done) and I still feel the biggest trouble I received back my eyes ... It's a shock to see! I have never seen a beautiful black and white picture and a big change in the way to make animation movies. I believe there is before and after "Renaissance", similar to what we have seen with Pixar movies or Akira and GhostInTheShell movies. This is a real achievement in the limited world of animation movies and I hope this French program (a small non-French studio and a few small people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will be successful and realize it is worth. Vive France!
