This film was released the year I was born and it will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night without seeing it since high school. Although it was full of 30 feelings and acting it was a little beaten, however, it was very good. The story of Pearl S. Buck occurred through the magic of Luise Rainer chemistry and Paul Muni. The novel found by Mrs Buck Nobel Prize of Scripture comes alive under the battle of Sydney Franklin which with the best script narrates the story of the farmer farmer, Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of the landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's achievements are written for his willingness to listen to his wife, many times, and the love of the country. He finally comes to realize that his wife, as a country, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always consisted of powerful women beaten in a critical spot to affect the effects of events in the original female world. Born in Germany, Luise Rainer brings a young Chinese woman who tries to have life in her Olan show. The monster also takes Wang and the noble Wang, finally cut off between the two wealthy and farmers. Other ordinary characters include Charlie Grapewin, the Kansan Shepherd of Dorothy Gale from the Shepherd of Oz, Walter Connelly as a pastor, a good uncle and Keye Luke as Son's Number - but this time, not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> Classic can be defined as a movie you can watch regularly and never bored. If yes, this film is a classic, of course any.
