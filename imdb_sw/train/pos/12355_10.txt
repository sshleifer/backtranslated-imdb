I can understand those who do not like this reason for the lack of skills. First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but the brass tenants, and the different person can not understand half the movie, and certainly not the end. This is the perfect work of art about women's lives and needs in these times. Everything is important, and certainly the way to wear, all movies means more than words. For those who thought it was a lovely geisha movie, I would encourage you to read a little about this community before making a conclusion that is not out of reality. This is the work of Kurosawa is life, and I am sure the director understood the meaning of the silence of the piece of Kurosawa in the right balance of mind.
