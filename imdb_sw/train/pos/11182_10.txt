I am a very good fan of many films that have come from books of Stephen King - these same levels as one of the most intense and most remembered. and awesome. The view that Gage is at fault of a real collision with a monster truck is one that comes out. And "No right" used by Miko Hughes a little closer to the end is a sensible touch. <br /> <br />
