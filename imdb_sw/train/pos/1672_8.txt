The Scorpion tail case is a very well-documented guide by Sergio Martino, who appears to be the second second Dario Argento. <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complicated but ultimately a satisfactory mystery and leisure entertainment. It also means at the end, as well as the larger, because it is not always the time for these giallo, since they tend to defend their trust and their endless solution with the final solution. Here, below you know about the plot, it's the best. It is a beautiful movie, an interesting music, beautiful women (Anita Strindberg is a female goddess), brutal murder, black killers and sex open in the name of a few. <br /> <br /> In many places it is a functional, Goerge Hilton often isolates himself and others do well. Martino guides with a sure hand, sets the buttons with the sky and other horrible pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of a giallo, this must see. If you like the best text and doubt in general, this comes very much.
