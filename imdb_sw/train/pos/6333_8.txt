I just got this video and I watched last night. Acting started very bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but it was very good after the cut. The tornadoes were very fake, and the effects of CGI were very dodgy, but the erupted area and the house inside the beatings were implemented well, and almost only with the movie like Twister. The incidence of damage also took place too. The story was very well written, and it is comforting to see this film disappearing from the old "disaster disaster" films that has been stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> This time the movie had an amazing mix. of FX and quality of action, this fits A in my book.
