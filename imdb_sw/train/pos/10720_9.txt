Hurray! The film that has not taken too much and everyone can come for an exciting journey that is a camping space. The film begins slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together in dodgy soup. But when you go to a difficult time - toughness separates itself and is not a reliable change in characters if you believe that there is a certain role in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only right in the film is that Kate Capshaw is just as bad as "I am the same as you are all wrong" teacher. I would recommend this as a good night in the film and Vote 7.
