The Booth puts a new twist on your movie J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the main characters of the story. The director wants you to see what the main character sees and thinks. The story is about the perspective of people who work, live, and the lover of our protagonist, and how he sees people around the old DJ station radio station. The story goes back to the main character as the onion at the feet of the flash as the movie runs its course, and from them we have learned that things are not always as they appear. The particular movie took place a small studio, out of the radio studio and a very bad history, where the main character was forced to announce its show of talk from the radio station was in the renewal process. It is from this closed space that this movie grows and makes you feel claustrophobic and very paranoid. By the time our actor cannot decide the incredible events in an old studio caused by a spirit or other plot and his co-workers or all were in his mind. What I like about this film is that filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make it as a cohesion as the main character. This film is very smart, except for a short video of 76 minutes.
