I saw this on "Dance and Movies", and it was amazing. I felt for Jake. Talk about adding insults for injury! It's not just your parents come out, but there's a monster after you. It was hearty and terrible - there were a few times when the audience shouted for real fear. It is a kind of reminder of the awesome Japanese film, but the story was good. And that's what separated "Jake's Closet" from the typical indy film pabulum - the best script and the compelling characters. Also, by combining the aspects of the film of fear and family game, the movie finds better than both types, and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If it didn't come into the movie, you probably got a DVD.
