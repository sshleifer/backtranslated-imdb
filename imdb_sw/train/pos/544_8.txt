I loved this movie. It was similar to the first (cabin and lake), rather than just killing women, she also kills men. And the events are more interesting, 2 of my favorite events are first, when Stanley and Allison are at the dance club and tells the last moments of Kimberly before they are thrown to the water, and second, when Stanley visits Allison in the basement, right before go down to put, when he kisses her. Those scenes, for me, were very strict and riveting. I gave the movie 8/10 rating, not because the film was bad, but because the animation was bad, I mean, there were times when you would see anything that was wrong, as it was hit through the film often shot, you can't see the picture of "live" The camera, but then, very little, you will see the error of opening the image. what was wrong?
