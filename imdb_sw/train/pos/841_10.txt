I found that this is a very exciting comedy. Brosnan is a professional; if anybody is witnessing now, it should not be pigeonholed in the role of the button. Kinnear was as charismatic and strange as anyone could be in that role. I don't know if I cut hard during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be 'I feel like a Bangkok businessman after a navy left town'. Brosnan gave this non-binding line with an unexpected finesse of comedic. I was also impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems like everyone in this movie has connected from their original work to the extent that has caused comedy. If you loved the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will be clear like this. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
