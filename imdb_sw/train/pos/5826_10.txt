I remember when I saw this short, I was very laughing, that like many films I have seen, there is no sound! Curly is so great in "singing" opera in this one, I wonder that he did not think of work as a professional singer, because he was so good! If you have seen, this was done near the end of Curly's work as Stooge, you can say that he has changed, because he had lost weight and was slow, his voice was increasing, his face was wrinkles, though he could still smoke, he seemed like he had fifty years old. This was because he had a lot of suffering before his great that ended his work. That still can pull into it last! <br /> <br /> Being concerned about the fact that Curly was very sick at this time, this is actually one of their funniest shorts. I know that I did not feel the fact that Curly was changing, because I still thought that he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
