I previously noticed this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable television. It's wonderful and fun! Everyone has hidden weapons in this film! Dreyfuss has a "mind" don (remember the donation of New York who was supposed to be a schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are in the very best and they don't have to have! So prove that beauty and difficulty do not go together! Then there is a large "bullshit" between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they play in the world "bullshit." This film is a trick and bald. For all the shot, it can be a very quiet film. And, you have the opportunity to see several actors in their last or near roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a film for everyone. But, if you like a film that has a lot of game play and continues to move without ringing everything forward, this is a film for you. Roger Ebert jumps on this film. She is very bad. This is good, beautiful film! Maybe not one to Ebert. I see that it is 10 because it was made well and how the script might be, but not really have a kind of direct comedy. I love it so much that I have bought it on DVD because it is not so much on the cable TV. Now, it's all my mine!
