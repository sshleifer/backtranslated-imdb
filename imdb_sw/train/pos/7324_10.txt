My favorite movie of my favorite. From the first track of the first beat to the failure of the last story, this is the center of Architects. <br /> <br /> Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his older sister. All the beams in 1978, Michael saves from Smith's Grove sanitarium. On the night of Halloween, Michael has come home to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Michael hits and kills babies. No bell or screw, just foundations. It is the closest environment of disability of the fear that produces tension. Like any great movie tragic, events have telegraphed long, but it still seems to happen to random, never allowing viewers a second chance to think the film. The dark lights, long-rich, and (most importantly) that amazing music music creates claustrophobic and uncomfortable pictures yet I haven't seen the film. There is a body count, but compared with the killing of slasher after this is very small. That and most of the killings are almost without blood. Fear is not in death, but in ignorance. <br /> <br /> Acting is a good roundelay. PJ Soles offers a little humorous film (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis returns to good performance and then there are young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. His first performance seems to be embarrassing and uncertain, but you soon find that it is perfect for character, who is shy and uncertain and not ready for what he will face. And of course there is Donald Pleasence organized as well as he decided (perhaps very stable) Dr Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence. If the film has bad effects, it will be a period of time. Since the release of this film many years ago changed countless clones, copy, rip, and artists have come and steal (usually) the best movies until almost everything about it has detected. With the change of prospects of viewers and appetites, one finds a lot of martial power films. To know the truth in this day and age, it must be seen as it was once, as something special. <br /> <br /> Never less, I have no reservation and strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good, awesome time. Extreme. <br /> <br /> 10/10
