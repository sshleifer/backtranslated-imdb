Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) has been taken by Tupinambás, and despite his attempt to persuade them to be French, they believe it is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes his slave, and lives in the sea by Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalães). Later, it uses powder in which the Portuguese left to win Tupiniquins in battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decided to eat. "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another small movie budget director of Brazil's Nélson Pereira dos Santos.
