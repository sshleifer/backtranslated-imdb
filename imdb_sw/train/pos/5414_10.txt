This fun-go-fortune 1939 of the military swashbuckler, which is the opposite of Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem and his novel "Third Party," is qualified as a first-rate entertainment on the British Army in India in the years The 1880. Cary Grant provides more hit-on blows with his fist-knuckled-up fists than he did in all his movies put together. Staying in remote India, this sixth line continues on the use of three British officials and Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) of natural water who are faced with the blood of Indians' killers called Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "Outpost Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. "Dawn Patrol"), are a trio of the competition to drink hard, complicated, and enjoyable men who have frolic years are almost a history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Typically, Cutter and MacChesney hits planned plans to cancel Ballentine programs. When their leaders command them to return to action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote's "Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drugs Higginbotham so that they can't accompany them and Ballantine is replaced. Half of the joy here looks at the chiefs trying to miss out on their own. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure with great style as our heroes are fighting the Thuggees army. Lenser Joseph H. Agos received an Oscar selection for his black and white movies.
