When you see the DVD cover you are sure this is B's B cheesy cheapie, the film released for $ 1,000 in the back of a person. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is the best and very good material. It's comedy and one clever at that. It is also very touching in advertising, and a good spot of goodness. Production ethics is very good (this looks better), distinguished actors, film trends and sets are good. It's amazing. Who could imagine? Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against a kind, is bad, like "Helen Robinson," wife of June Cleaver's wife; Billy Connolly is as good as a beautiful zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a neighboring neighbor of a zombie partner "Tammy," and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as a father (watch) is the best, also K'Sun Ray as the "Timmy Robinson," should not be overlooked, . In fact, he probably has more verses in the movie than anyone. <br /> <br /> If I describe the story it will be a stupid voice that a few of you would look. You will only take the word of people here who liked and saw it very much surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; A wonderful thanks.
