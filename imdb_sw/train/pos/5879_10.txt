One of the most intelligent scholars to hit Indian films. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which therefore was a 60 remake of Hollywoon hit the same name, Garam Masala adds the rate of comedies in Hindi Cinema. Akshay Kumar once again demonstrated that it is one of the best stars of the Indian movie who can make comedy. He connected well with the new hunk John Abraham. However John still sits in the shadows of Akshays and cannot increase the event. The new gals are good and makes perfect for their roles. <br /> <br /> You must check the comedy. Leave your mind away from laughing for 2 hours! After all laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
