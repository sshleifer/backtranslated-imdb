Men can serve Lollo, if they would like (or lollos - gave her a name for slang words for milk in French), but women have a piece of tastier even with Gerard Philipe's God, who is not only good but can act. Do not be prevented if your version does not have headlines because in this simple story, to beat love and war, which is all right, they are not needed. All you need to know is that, at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palms and tells him he will marry the king. Later the story is quite clear from the Gallic signs and run, jump, and swordplay. At the bottom, the clarity of the story and the toughness of the load of the tone becomes sufficient, and it is angry that the French feels that they are better than Hollywood disturbing even trying the possibility of its exciting stunts. And of course, a French-speaking speaker loses a bit of ooh-la-la, such as: A beautiful girl: You must tell you that my heart is Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I was interested in that bagatelle?
