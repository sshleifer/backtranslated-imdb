I am glad that the film was made about the story of the wonderful life of Carl Brashear. Coming up as it did during the civil rights era, Brashear became an inspiration to small groups of people who are not interested in staying in the expected conditions. Brashear is played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. it leads to an example in the course of life he has chosen. It is similar to Jackie Robinson who joined the baseball and made it a stick to his behavior and behavior. As Brashear, Gooding knows that they do not want the life of a participant whose father Carl Lumbly has with Lumbly makes it clear to get more than life than given. But when Harry Truman connected the weapon Service after World War II, the navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or a leader of the officer, the real parts of the fighting are rejected. That's not good for Gooding who serves to be the navy of the navy of the Navy. Once at a diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding finds all that has been beaten to him, especially by the CEO for payment, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have extra discrimination, but it is still a hero and someone who can encourage if someone can be approved for racism. The best thing about Men of Honor is chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They are indeed coming from different places, but if they know, they all may be Men of Honor. The other beautiful performances are the symbol of Shakira as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the dive school, just the Navy boy just wants to retire because you will see. Responsible people are a story that stimulates people who have the courage to save and the ability to change.
