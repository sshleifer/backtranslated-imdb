We recognized the vcr and found it interesting. I don't know anything about this true story, I thought: "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as Indian Indian ('red' of Indian in the film), it's a bad choice" until I found the truth about Gray Owl. The film has a good job to show respect for these indigenous people and undermine discrimination stories about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, is what beauty, and very interesting as a Indian woman (I believe she is French-Canada, she certainly returns to all the usual lectures of such). However, the Brosnan's closure, the grunting style, at the end he came to lobby as a passionate, dedicated person. The program is limited to emphasizing its conversion from the client to the animal costerist. Good movies, it was highly recommended.
