"Before Sunrise" is a good story of love and it has to be among my Top 5 of my favorite films. Dialog and acting are good. I love characters and their ideas and ideas. Of course, a romantic Vienna, brought in the film does not exist (you can't find a poet sitting in the middle of the night) and it is impossible to come to all night just one night, or (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not sure. The relationship of the two characters is more important and this part of the story is not entirely false. Although nothing happened, the movie is not available. The latter is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you don't love love stories you should watch this film! I have a little skeptic on the good that will be removed in the summer. The first part is complete as it is, in my opinion.
