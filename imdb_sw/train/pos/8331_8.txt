This movie is very worried, romantic-comedy, which is quite enjoyable. Meg Ryan is doing a great job as a granddaughter of Albert Einstein's talent, although he believes his own knowledge. Tim Robbins does the same job as a contractor who loves him when he enters his shop with his partner after his car is stuck. I loved Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein and sole. This film feels very happy, while it still includes some kind (if possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I found this very interesting film, especially ancient scientists - I thought it was fab and hilarious! This film seems to have been overlooked. If you have a sense of humor, this is a movie to you!
