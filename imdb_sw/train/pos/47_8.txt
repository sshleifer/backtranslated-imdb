It breaks my heart that this movie is unacceptable if it should be. its very low. The people forgot what the movies of the movie, today they just think about the bum bum movies, which can enjoy very much watching with popcorn and friends, like artists, directed movies, and mega hyper on budgets like 300mln or even higher, on special effects and which is dumb movies without storyline. It's a kind of movie what I am doing even more. Of course it is fun to look at the most CGIs, but we don't have anything important from that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the performance was better. This Busy Philip, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film worth the Oscar. The emotional performance by Philippe Busy was amazing, his shame we see Oscar with his hands, which he deserves.
