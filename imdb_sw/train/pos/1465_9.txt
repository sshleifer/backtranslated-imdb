His choice of film, the basis of the 'pretending' production (which puts him in a set or simulacra of the film) and his delivery is brilliant! But if you want to Freud, you know that you are getting the version of Zikir Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. Typically, Zikhali offers difficult ideas and gusto and through persuasion. Rub it is also very good and so can be more in its gusto than in real content. Cinematically, it's gem. Psychologically, this will have people of all influence (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) who cut their heads but they reach the same popcorn. Zombi is a wonderful thing with a pop icon for himself.
