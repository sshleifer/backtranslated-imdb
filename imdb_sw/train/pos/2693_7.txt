Although the story is normal, and "amazing" end up not something but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted good actors to the project - it gives them a variety of roles that good actors can shine, and shine they do. The film is imeccably made - for its time. It was changed in 2000 as "Under Claims" and if you just want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, in fact), I recommend the last, and the direction of Hopkins up-to-date and more clear reference points of the plot which nature could only find. Finally, however, it still hits. (** 1/2)
