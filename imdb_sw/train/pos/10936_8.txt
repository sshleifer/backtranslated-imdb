More than 70s (and 80s) Kong Kong military films do not work as movies; there is usually a few well-organized battle plans, but the plot has been taken very well to fill the gaps between these nodes - like porno videos, indeed. But this does a lot of things well. Further, there are patterns and choreography, which prevents every fighter for 'style' - actually depends on the Chinese circus circus and theater, but the effect works. Secondly, there is a camera language, which uses amazing techniques (even for today's dosage), changing the measurement rate from real-time time of sharp decline, and from unfiltered to commented views to show the story of the story towards the past or for the future. The worst, but more powerful and unexpected, is building. The winner of this competition has been identified who 'reveals' the story. The Lord (author) sets a game where the leadership character does not know who is looking for, which is the same situation we viewers find. Directly, he knows who it is, to the same extent who is. That all follows the tragedy of the catastrophe. The latter tends to be bad, the "Sting". More clever things than what we come naturally in this type. The concept of 'five venom' is the template of the Tarantino Snake killers from the "Kill Bill" amount.
