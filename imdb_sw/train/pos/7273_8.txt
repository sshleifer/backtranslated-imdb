Carlos Mencia was best this is a special hour. He was working hard to show everyone was a real deal. I know people have said that he has stolen devices in this special, but not true. Carlos brings competition in the way he wants, not the way the other person wants, that's why he's good. People say she is not funny because she says Dee dee dee very much, and still don't know that part of her act, and they don't want it that way, but it brings it like that, and it works well in making people laugh. For all the opponents out there, here is the message, Carlos is here to stay, you're not sure to try to bring him.
