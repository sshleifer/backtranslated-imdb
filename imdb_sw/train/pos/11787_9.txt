It's a short movie from David Lynch and only 8 minutes, but it has all "Lynchi" links! It is wonderful, dark, unfounded, wonderful, and wonderful; and before the girl blond start talking is even scary! The voice of a voice is unique to create this unusual situation because it is also sinful and strange? With the environment itself, it does not have "traditional" curtains, but has walls of purple purple walls, which provide a similar effect of power. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl who has closed the dark room and cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to him in secret, saying he is there just because of his mistake? We don't know what happened or what will happen next? ended without unresolved and surprising, as a good Lynch movie should stop! <br /> <br /> It is too short, despite an amateur acting. Girls are professional practitioners, but I think their acting can be better in this short.
