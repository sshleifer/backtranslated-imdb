Elvira, Mrs Giza, is happy, the camping camp of the camp, which the fourth wall has broken down several times and jokes often sit under the hub. And the breast of Cassandra Peterson became a character of themselves. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) has been given the fear of a minister, who is learning, that she has found her aunt Morgana. So he goes to the small town of Fallwell, which is dominated by the worst monster to agree with the country: Ethics advice. Elviras's appearance of boobacious is, of course, very much for the sandwich, but the city's children seek a different kind of way of life. And in fact there is even worse evil, his uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after the mother of Elvira's book. See, Elvira really is a real witch, he just doesn't know. However. <br /> <br /> Why, Elvira is a fantastic film, though the script leaves many opportunities to improve. Many laughter comes from differences between Elvira and people of good values, but there are two visual talents too. On the whole direction is the same, but it does not give anything more than that. For all, good, purposeful, camping. If you would like this type of thing, that's it.
