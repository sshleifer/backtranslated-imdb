This is a very interesting and unexpected film. You can start by following a young person who hopes to enter a football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran will win, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is a young person and girl (or women for that) are not allowed in football games "stay with men". What follows is a good comedy, played with full skill and a small set. The film examines the shortage of restrictions on women's independence (and therefore the young soldiers who should do it). There are some pieces of better setup, not less when one of the girls should go to the toilet and, of course, the field has no toilets for women. The camera function is simple and somehow this story would have been told if you play for action. However, it is a small amount that gives its film. Movie theaters? No, maybe not; good entertainment - certainly.
