This make-to-TV film is brilliant. This is the best and exciting role for BAFTA to win John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Morse Auditor). Tom Oakley (Thaw) a widow who lived in the village alone for a short time since his wife and son died, and now he has come and evacuee called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). Because he knows this child begins to develop friendships. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants to come back. After Tom got worried about William not telling him he was going to London to look for him. Finally Willaim gets his home and family of love (or Father). Setting up during World War II is the best film. Selected the award for BAFTA Lew Grade, and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 on 50 big TV stars. Very nice!
