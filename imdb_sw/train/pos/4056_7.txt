See this on SBS TV here in Australia another week, where it was called "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I have enabled headlines and I think SBS provided their own therefore, which, usually, was of good quality. Just look at the "Laputa" on Wikipedia and proves what I saw ... the planted island of this story is taken from Jonathan Swift's novel "Gulliver travel", which was published early to the mid-1700s However, this is a Japanese story that includes, which has English. speaking voice. It is suitable for small children, I think, but it runs only two hours in length, so it can be too long for some, though not for an adult like me. The story involves two children who are looking for an island around a fortress on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spies looking for the island too, and they are looking to catch children (Sheeta, a girl, spoke to Anna Paquin, and Pazu, a young man, mentioned by James Van Der Beek) to help them find it. <br /> <br /> Images are good ... pictures of real-time sometimes, especially the events of the stones set by light-light, or beautiful scenes of bright day, sun, and white clouds, or mist. It is recommended.
