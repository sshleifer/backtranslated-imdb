Erroll works for the Department of Public Safety and its work is looking at sex offenders. Sometimes he strikes his work and hits sex offenders. I did not accuse him but his boss is ready to retire with Allison. Erroll now teaches him to do his job and is like a shadow work. Allison is somehow on the job at the beginning but he doesn't know what risks he is true and it's all wrong with Erroll. She begins to go away and ignore her for finding a lost girl when her job is not being a police officer. It is a decent movie on a mad man who strikes and works out "its scope of practice." Erroll did a good job but for Allison's safety. It has a secret secret too and just when I was out, there was more.
