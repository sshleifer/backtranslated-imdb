Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play 30-year-old boys who put their girls at risk to decide (Russell to some extent) by restoring their solidarity with opponents of Bakersfield years after reality. Williams is the same, but Russell is flat-out big like the story of Taft quarterback Remo Hightower. Holly Palance has a good and very interesting change as Williams's wife, who could live without this rematch. Film is worth looking only to see popular popular in action. It is highly recommended.
