You saw this on my last day at the feast, and I was glad I continued to go around those two extra days. Poetic, moving, and amazing, funny, in its amazing way. It is very rare to see directors working in this style who can find true care and humor in a world of untruth, without being considered worthwhile, or destroying equality. He looks to be made, but is completely controlled. I am trying to compare, because these filmmakers have attracted their attention (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... ordinary suspects) and found their unique style, but if you like modern directors in this traditional (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you're in a real treat. This is a good film, and I hope many people see it. If this film makes your city concert, go! go! go!
