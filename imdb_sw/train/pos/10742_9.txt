Hard to comment, what do you say is bad? Well not, but then it's hard to say it's good. What it is, is compelling to watch, it's almost as if you will get great damage without presence. It is the pictures of tsunami approaching the Thailand coast, you know you want to stop but you should look. The brothers of Naudet to address the most definitive, even in many horrible situations, there is a view of something that is happening in other countries or not or trembling. The fact is about cellulose and a little needed for the viewer to understand or understand what is going on. You cannot change history, and shouldn't want it, this film stands as a humanity command at its dark hour.
