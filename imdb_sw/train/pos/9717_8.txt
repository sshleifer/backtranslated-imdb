How to lose friends and encourage people to trust all one of the best games I saw this year with Pineapple Express and Brothers Brothers. Not one of the "outdoor" players who rely on the fart joke and the toilet humor but instead goes to the speed that is affected and you will have convenient conditions on the details that happened. Simon Pegg puts it in the coffin with his hilarious exhibition of the fish-out of the water and he quickly avoids from the same trip that once was back to the UK (the other two will be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Finding on the Hollywood food chain is a difficult thing to do as we can see with Pegg, his first jab in the front role was David Schwimmer of Comedy Run Fatboy Run but he received a circle of views from critics and the same audience. His second attempt is this movie, he received a good opinion from many but was in the box office. I, for one still have not lost faith in him and I will continue to be there when he wants to take that third shot to glory. Other characters were healed well from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprised, Kirsten Dunst in my opinion participated well in this film as a love angle for Pegg's behavior however, the spark I saw in the interview with Vampire is still lost. He needs to get it, quickly or can suffer the consequences of lost in the "rom-coms" forever.
