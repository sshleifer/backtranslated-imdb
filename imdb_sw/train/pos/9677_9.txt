This film appears on the face of a children's film that parents can strive to look at and their most interesting children. The movie looks and is more aimed at children still does not stop on this level. I watched the first film as a little child and I found it exciting, entertaining, and had never seen again for several years. I looked again at the age of 18 and found it interesting but it is like heart and entertainment. This film has stood up and has many real life messages. This film is a dynamic story that is made for children is still an epic to its right. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
