This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches the complexity of love relationships in a meaningful way, but not lectures. Script does not fall for any behavior, nor even Johnny's anger. It is also profitable from scope-in ​​direction, design, production, and exhibition. The fact that Cher is very perfect in the film and is different from "Cher" than she has ever been to me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I just look at this Christmas night with my 16-year-old daughter and they also love it. It has something for everyone with heart and stops being filled with joy at the end.
