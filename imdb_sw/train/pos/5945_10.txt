Let me do one thing clear .. for the most part, the thought of those who run the show in Hollywood by frankly p * sses me right away in general and even more so in connection with its beloved loved ones, iconic characters from comic books. Why? Let us take a look at the general meeting of Hollywood actors to show how we will. <br /> <br /> No.1 'There are many dollars available from superhero today.' <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Good, let's do one quick! ?? We will make a sink for luck in a hat and take a superhero for random to set up the film on! '(Inserting takes place with the popular name of superheroes removed) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1' Great! Now who can we get to play part? '<br /> <br /> Executive no.2' Who is the biggest star of the box office now? ' The first 1 * * executor's name * is a new feature this week. '<br /> <br /> Executive no.2' But does he really have a role? I mean he's not like any character. No /.1 / Who is caring? He is a great name; We will make the film in it yet. '<br /> <br /> Executive no.2' You have absolute right! And moreover we will fill the entire film in order to spread the special effects of glitzy to enjoy the attack of people who no one will ask any question! '<br/> <br /> The above situation shows one of the reasons I generally loath many modern movies of superhero. All style, no substances and just cast the photography recipe. In fact it is the same, there is a difference with the above rule; when mobile finds justice? take a picture of nature (and it's still quite easy!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and recently Patrick Stewart and Mr. Ian McKellen in X-Men movies. But behind the bad reputation of Hollywood today? .. It would not be good if our studio executives had to choose executives who really needed to work? Well in this unfamiliar world, one filmmaker only believes this or not, by giving them dependents based on their similarities to their comic counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Sadly (but typically) Hollywood has never been allowed Collora to lead a full-time film but by chance, we have given us the priorities of what the final results would look like two types (as yet) the most famous hero heroes of the hero. One is a good Batman: Last End and another is this trailer trailer for a fake film called Misiko Best. Well, let's not use our words here? this is amazing things! The release of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn, (who seemed similar to surprising but was completely lost in the Barbary missingluster) makes for the most perfect choice for playing the iconic man of steel. In fact, according to the physical nature, of course it has never been close to the comic character. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram is back from its royal image like Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, still a large piece of hitting! What can I say? ?? If only this was true, full of film! Hollywood studios? discover! This is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a last note, I am fascinated by the many effects of this short film from the fans. Describing, the worst and worst effects against him comes once more (such as Batman: Dead End) from a small audience, under the cinema; The facts betrayed by their grammar grammar tablets and the free use of the basic diction. The worst state of the closure of the closure is actually a sad thing one of which our studio top performers in Hollywood, of course finds great satisfaction from. After all, these people who did the same with all of them are in all likelihood of the same kind of CGI addicted, popcorn stuffing imbeciles that are shown in many crap that Hollywood eliminates and floods these days.
