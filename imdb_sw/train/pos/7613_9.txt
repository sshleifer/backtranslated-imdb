/ The first part I saw Lost made me think, I thought what other people who beat and chased by a big monster. But it's not like that, it's far more than that, because they're not a monster at all and every part that you see of Lost, well is getting better every time. The island was abandoned by the underground bunker and especially the relationship between people who crossed the straight path before knocking. That's a true secret. This series is dominating and I can't wait to know what's going on there there is hope that it is not worth the last two sessions in the movie, this series deserves 9 out of 10
