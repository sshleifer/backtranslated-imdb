Cuba's blood is one of these sleepy films that have a lot to say about life in a traditional way. I actually looked at it during a trip near Cuba on the western coast of the Caribbean. It describes the life of a 11-year-old in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time was spent on the revolution to the end, when the Socialist regime came and took over the boy's property. Most of the films are coming to a boy of age and relationships that occur in a small town where everyone knows everyone. There are some powerful events that everyone can consider. A film with a good acting and leading film. This is a film that describes stories without special effects or big plans or real twists. It's a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their victory. A good film to watch several times each year.
