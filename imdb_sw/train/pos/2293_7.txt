This is a very early cartoon of Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in the transition period - it is not available as beaten as he later and his voice is not quite accurate. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is very common. Elmer is a sap sap poor who buys bugs from a pet shop - no guns or lust for its part hitting a bunny for smithereens! However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. Early bugs were more obvious than sassy and brutal than its later practice. In later films, he accused Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started - they kissed the rabbit. But, in this film, he is more like Daffy Duck's 30s late and early 40s - jerk who just loves to light up others! "Anarchist" of the real hero of cartoons later. Although this is not among the best cartoons of Bug Bunny, it's certainly fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much has changed over the years.
