This is one of the largest films I have seen: I scored inside the entire film. Music and movies were spell when a little happened on the screen. Slow motion was placed with a travel mode (player who climbed the lawn and a great trailer) and kept it for natural and sound stations and a slow life of other characters. really happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was real, if participants were converted into characters. Sissy Spacek gave a good performance as a daughter with a disability who had suffered much but witnessed before, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was completely cast down and he won well Alvin Straight, an old but loving old man who goes to Iowa to go to his ex-brother, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his life and it seems to be the best way for people who met on the way. The film emphasizes the importance of the family to this person and, hopefully, to all of us. I look forward to seeing again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, these films show his ability to direct. Farnsworth was selected by the University of the Best Doctorate; at 79, he was designated the most old for the award.
