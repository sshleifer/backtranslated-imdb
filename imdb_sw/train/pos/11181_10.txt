This is one of the most horrible, horrible and frightening movie of the heart! Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moved to a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and a little child (Gage) Everything seems so common until Dr Creed loses one patient who had a terrible head injury, then beaten with a spirit to know as Victor takes him to the Pet Festival and shows him where the dead are dead. Talk to Ellie who is worried about her cat that can be killed by a truck and later Rachel tells Louis that it is very difficult to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick (as we see in The flashback how his sister's sister really had this is one of the most common places!) The next day Louis gets a phone from Jed saying there is a cat killed by a truck and Jed took him to a place where Victor the Ghost told him not to go! And bury Cat, his wife and children have gone to see their grandfather and grandfather and Louise is home alone amazed to see the cat is again and now it's bad for his eyes so he is going to see Jed then Jed tell him that he also buried a dog there too (as we saw another flashback ) <br /> <br /> Later in the movie Family with Picnic, Gage plays with kite and Gage says I drop ", the wind blowing around the road where lorry comes fast, Gage is close to the road, Louis is running to find him , the movie of BREAKBREAKING in any movie you fear to leave with your Jaw on the floor or Shivers will descend back when you hear Louis ringing, Recently he has lost so much, Louis then buys Gage somewhere where wrapped Cat. awesome on this film is that some events in this movie are not too far from real life. This movie is just amazing and acting from everyone was beautiful! 10 out of 10
