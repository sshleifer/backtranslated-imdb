I love and welcome the brothers of Farrelly! Did I just come to see this great movie 3 years after release? It made me laugh, making me cry and reaeaally warm my heart. Big Time. It is difficult to describe in my rotten English - but I must try again: it is worth the best - from leading- to support, acting is good, the conversation is good and the film is directed and fully edited. I think Farrelly brothers' movies are often reduced - not the sound of the sound - they are deeeeeep! They say about what life about (I won't tell you!). For my part, this movie has confirmed to me the relationship about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: Let them free, let them try to share passion and pain and be honest with each other. <br /> <br /> I don't hate sports, but certainly games don't know. But in this film - vibes get you. I was able to hear Baseball status. Finally, this film explains that a sports fan can tell you what the other fan family should be outside. Thank you, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br>> PS: If you haven't seen - please check KINGPIN!
