Certainly this film is not historic but it is a good entertainment. Many images of DeMille especially the future epics are slow and plodding but the action here goes to a piece of image. The story is essentially a series of peaks and a very short time of stability. This step takes us from the Indian war on the cabin; one of the best parts of the movie by Jean Arthur better when trying to please the inhabitants of the color. It is followed by him and Cooper being taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a long battle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but it's great fun and entertainment from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actors of this age and he shines here.
