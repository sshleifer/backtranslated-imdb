If you have ever wondered why they do not do porn and conspiracy, see the Dream Efforts. On the one hand, you should give Armstrong a loan to make an effort to reflect on this idea and to use a powerful adult who has been beaten to put his name behind him. On the other hand, it also becomes apparent why many of the porno do not have more than 15 or 20 seconds of sexual interconnecting conversations. These people are not able to act (and the story is, unfortunately, limping at a level of ignorance). Also, I'd like to see more trials like this. Maybe one day I will see a full mix of porn and plot.
