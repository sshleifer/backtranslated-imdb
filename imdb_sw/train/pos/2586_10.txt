The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was very good, pyro effects were fully completed, and takes the story based on love triangle and insses science-fiction aspect in it. I was able to identify with many characters and their motive made reasonable logic in the story system. The camera function was good, clear and accurate sound, a well-chosen background music, firefighters who feel good talented talents, well-developed, and special effects made by capable talents. I am tad puzzled how mini-carnival throughout the parking chain can be a direct power port. That seems impossible to say the least. The fighting between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a very good touch as playing the role of a big half of carny very well.
