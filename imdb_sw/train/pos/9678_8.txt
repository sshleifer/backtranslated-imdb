I liked my happy birds can talk. Tisk tisk on the auditor who drove the film. Good stories that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a small treasure. He has very few lines that have made me true. I loved the dance mechanism at its stint of showbiz. You can forgive clear clich√©s if you thank her in her effort to reunite with Marie. The favorite movie with two powerful characters who are actually partners of a little parrot separated by its small owner. What? They would like to see more than a woman who is blind and must leave their trip together. I loved his artistic inspiration and poetry, shyness could not be reunited with Paulie. Paulie in his new home, finally with Maria, probably joined a good young man who helped him to win rivals to complete his journey.
