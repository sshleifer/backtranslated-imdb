First, I loved g√∂ta kanal 1, I had many tribal jokes including the boy who can't go to the sea who seems to be the right place at the wrong time, still doing the same person in galta kanal 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance not as funny as it was in the first movie, you really don't notice it completely. Something that has made me think bad about this film is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only running pools, they are sure they are fast but those who don't have the waves like a large-scale used on the first movie, I loved it earlier with these boats The new makes one of the last events will appear to be ridiculous when the man in the ocean jumps out suddenly to avoid "big waves" from these small boats. True reduces. You should admit that we do not live in Sweden as well as in 1974 again. This movie also has more violence than the first. Although the film was good for all. I was involved with a certain conscience that I was desperate but some films had reached my expectations, then go see! It's worth the money.
