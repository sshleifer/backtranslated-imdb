Yes ... I'm going to 1-0 on this and that's why. In the last few years, I have looked at quite a few comes and just left to laugh a bit with two video rental fees because the movies were easy to forget. Then I miss the "No". It seemed to be surprising, he didn't expect too much. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I had a chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a big pair of comedic and humor had enough discomfort to remember, but it's not hard to reach the point of missing the dragon. I don't want to mention on any true screen, because I feel this is a suitable movie to see right away. For more and more meaningless insights into the movies (you know, like the army's jets kill and "fresh" remakes that destroy the old past), this movie will make you happy to say that it is ok to laugh "No".
