I agree that I am an addict vampire: I have seen many movies of vampire that I lost count and this is evident in the top ten. I was very surprised by the original Vampires of John Carpenter and when I hid there was one follower I went out and bought. This movie does not obey the same law as the first, and it is not very dark, but it is very close and I felt it was well-founded in nature. Jon Bon Jovi was very good like Derek Bliss: his performance was seen and it is still difficult for the viewer to believe that he can live in the world where he lives. One of my favorite places after meeting with Zoey and walking into the diner bathroom to see if he is more than visible. His views are interesting for beauty and it is still a common one that compares well to all other parts as it is done. Other members who were also used were well chosen and painted well to provide an entertaining and original film. Not only to restore the first movie and it has grown in the same way as Fright Night II grew up from the night of fear. There are different things that make a new film with the same theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies I would like to recommend this. If you love your movies under bloody then choose another thing.
