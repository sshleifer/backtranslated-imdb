Growing in NYC at the end of 80 years / 90 club clubs, I can say that this is one of the most important documents made by covering the area at this time. No Madonna did not come with the idea of ​​Voguing but this was what he received! Instead of taking violence to each other or in a fight of a cat, recognize people allowed to "fight" within the restrictions of anything brief touch (which would allow for automatic deletion). Seeing these kind of wonderful / good talents of "throwing" in the clubs were not surprisingly short and all the great names from behind behind are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc. ... The favorite of such periods as the song of Malcom McLaren "Deep in Vogue" ... no matter who, or where from because at the time you walk through these doors to this "magic kingdom", you have been part of something greater than you were / were very important / very important to create your own actions and ideas ... and anyone from anywhere could be the King (or Queen) as far as possible. Words and wit were bright as a step on the floor. All of the tension, excitement, and magic of the cities of NYC are widely viewed in this film. MONTH! LOOK AT THE DVD to the world to see !!! Thank you!
