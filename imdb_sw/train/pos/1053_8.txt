Brother In Law is made by the same directors of "Divorce, Iranian Style" which was very interesting as it described, as we got a vision of a divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the judicial system in Cameroon, Africa. What is good about this court is that 2 of the judges are Women, which is common to a country like this. Anyways, they are dealing with many men who have used their way around women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women have made great progress in society, and divorce laws and women's rights are recognized. So the judges often punish men in a self-organized way. It is not to say that women who appear in court find strong treatment. One of the priority focuses on the film is the case of child abuse by aunt. The judges did not lose any time by running away from the woman. And who said that justice is no longer useful? And these 2 back of the bench. It often makes a great penalty! Ya! You're going to a girl!
