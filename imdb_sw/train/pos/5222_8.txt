After Chicago, I had lost all respect to Richard Gere and then came to The Flock. There is so much good smile and a number of facial expressions can get you, but he assured me that he finally got his design and can do better. Clare Danes was also as good as his "teacher / predecessor". Some have suggested that there is so much violence, but I don't see it that way. Nothing I have seen has been corrupted by the power of this film. I was so shocked that I did not feel that it was released on the movie and got it on Blockbuster instead. The truly unique film has a proper mix of action, doubts, joy, and social awareness. Good as 7even? Well, maybe. And you will see better acting from Gere than anyone who has got from Pitt.
