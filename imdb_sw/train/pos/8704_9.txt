There are many recent trophies from Hollywood. Friend / friend, sends me movies regularly, as a surprise, it's amazing. I have put it and it can't stop looking, it's a drama, but with an unusual twist. Imagine if Romeo, like Shakwaare, had great power. It is sad and poetry at the same time. Hollywood should recognize new Russian movies, telling stories that do not apply to a big explosion and cgi. It takes a simple basic background and storytelling, without a concert. This is a lot like Asian film losses for Russian darkness. Certainly not perfect, but there is nothing. You know what power but it is never explained, nor is it fully recognized until the end. It becomes secondary to a sense of story. I don't want to see remake, it's very cool as it is, the Hollywood system would like, as usual, wipe it. Working is a top frame around. The lead and camera function is far beyond most of the tricks outside. Kudos for all involved, and I will turn many people into this free epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find i, see.
