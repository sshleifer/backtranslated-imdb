IN IN SOUTH AFRICA, there were different types of movies. These different films have included even though everyone had something different to give ... <br /> <br /> This seems to be the first time, but I thought I would tell you during this review because it seems a few people might have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for fans of Pavarotti. That's all. It does not require anything or anything more. People who defend themselves as something lacking and promise do not get the whole picture - real. After all, Hollywood makes movies every time that are shy cars for people (Bodyguard or preacher's wife w / Whitney Houston are 2 examples that remember.) <br /> <br /> <br /> First I would like to handle the movie as a car for Pavarotti. There are the worst things in the world - and the worst movies. Singing is wonderful and the selection of arias is fun. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav is singing arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut, and Turandot but also plays popular music like "I left my heart San Francisco" with a song selected for Oscar & Golden Globe, "If we were in Love" w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman- all 3 original Oscar winners <br /> <br /> stories are not bad. It was constructed by Pavarotti so it will certainly not be something known or used for the average film viewer. It is the story of a famous opera singer who had been troubled by a bad night in the previous opera years. When asked to sing again, "MET" in NYC, he loses his voice from fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italy)) played with Kathryn Harrold - gives him a shot to treat his psychological responses. She gives him the opportunity to have fling with him and he boldly admits. They start something, knowing that she is married and promised that she can't love her and she thinks she will be just another woman. Despite all of this, it falls in love (so the song, "If we loved it") and with his help, he overcomes his fears and returns to MET where he is winning. I won't tell you how it ends, but it's predictable. That is not always bad. <br /> <br /> Displays in this are not bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect the performance of Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you are deceived, not Pavarotti. He knows he is not a ruler. What she is cute, charming & charismatic. He enjoys himself, and if you can just let yourself have fun, it's not too bad. One funny line is when she tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can help you!" and of course, he says, "I don't want to irrigate with Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and is doing a good job as a very hard woman who learns from this wonderful living man. One of the verses I liked in the film is: "Life should not be the size of life." And there is Eddie Albert who does his usual job as Fini manager. There are several "coming" to real actors, singers, etc. and are held at the Metropolitan Opera area at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you would like opera, if you would like Pavarotti, or if you can just let go & enjoy “little fling” as well as suggests in movie- then you can enjoy this movie why it's it. I know I do - at any time. :) <br />
