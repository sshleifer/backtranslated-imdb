If you want a great pain of laughing, look at this film, and Bruce's items get into the news of their friends. Deleted events are worth. I don't know why they didn't get them in the original film. It cannot be because of the time, as the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been ignored for so long. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
