as a good, this is not a bad movie.I really liked it better than the first 1. I found it more entertaining.it it seemed like it was beaten style document.at first this upset me, if I just thought it looked very low budget but grew up on me , and made the most visible film of the true film. This has the most viber of nature, which is a good thing, in my opinion.i think when they went a little over with some of the events and characters.it almost becomes parody itself, which can having a point.this movie at least has some suspense, which one 1 did not, for my view.it has some great similar music from nature, which is good. Acting again was very good for the most part, though as I said, some of them seemed up. I also felt that the movie loses great speed to the end and there are a few minutes that seem to be slow and do not seem to pass, like all the movie.overall, though, I thought this was very good. y rating for "Return to Cabin and Lake" is 7/10 *
