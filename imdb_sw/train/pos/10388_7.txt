I am a big fan of Dukes's show of Hazzard TV. And I enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny people to hear the rail against this movie and excuse as "blind plan" and "it's cruder much more than show." Does anyone remember the evil of humor during the trial? Daisy makes a lot of joke with Bo says that Luke was probably born half children in orphanages. The only reason to be cleaned is because it has been changed and reduced during earlier time. And until the plot goes. It was a perfect plot of Dukes. In fact, the remake may sit on a truer on source devices than any TV show that has moved to the big screen. While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not equal to their versions of the small screen, they do a good job and work very well. I wasn't very interested in the Boss of Burt Hogg though. And I'd like to have a little more power from Sheriff Roscoe. In the Roscoe movie is a little ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who did not smile on their face as Great Lee runs the race through the streets of Atlanta and the road behind Hazzard? </> <br /> Folks, allowing you to enjoy a movie which is just apologizing for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not be compassionate. It's just a dumb movie!
