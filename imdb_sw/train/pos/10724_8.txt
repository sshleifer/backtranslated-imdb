This is one of those who feel good, a Saturday afternoon afternoon. There above with other flicks back like a Navigator Bird. Just a good movie with some cunning comedy to shine things on. And it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. I have not yet joined Joquin Phoenix. I love myself like movies like this from time to time. There is nothing too deep or too frightening. Just a good story story. And I've never known Mr. Phoenix I have not read this recently. He was just a child when he made this film. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was a very small actor. She and Lea did a good job in this film. I agree not the movie of Oscar caliber. But very valuable look. Especially if you have children inside, let's say, 8 to 11 years old. Or those who are attracted to the space plan.
