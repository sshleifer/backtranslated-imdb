Despite some reviews of Luke's warmth, I realized the story and even if some critics have described the story of love as 'Mills and Boon', why? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these amazing times. Many in the audience were shouting and ignoring their eyes. You really believe that little Victoria and Albert love it, though, for political reasons, it was a planned marriage. I felt though Sir John Conroy, who had a strong desire to control the little King, perhaps also played as the capital of the pantomime. As it is said he was true, the real father of Victoria (as a result of the matter with his mother Duchess of Kent) would be interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is quite persuasive as a young king, bound in a house that had been retired with politicians to use her. He clearly demonstrates the ability of the character and the decision which eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which succeeded never before, under his long reign. I believe the recommendations of the mouth will ensure great success for this fun and wonderful movie.
