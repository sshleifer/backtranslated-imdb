This is one of all my favorite movies and I would like to recommend to anyone. In my list of proposed movies (mind list, mind) that is in line with it is such movies as Lord of Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Homeway. I can relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the movie she is a shy girl with an unusual background with many more friends who are boys than they are girls. In fact he gets in his life. I also cannot have any responsibility of the acting actor, or any other person in the film. Football was amazing to look even for someone like me who does not know the law. Movie is never available. Love is very real and did not make me too much tooooo! One thing that did though it was Indian. Jess's parents are Indians and there are a lot of Indian color films in the film to give you a fascinating cultural experience and everything else. The people of India are also hilarious! In fact this is coming to an old movie to choose the way you want and fight it. <br /> <br /> Think of the good comedies are being thanks to my favorite music for this film. They are funny, they make fun and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
