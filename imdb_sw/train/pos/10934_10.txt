After exploring this film's military edge for the first time for almost 18 years, I must say it does not lose any of its secrets, nor any eye-popping military art action as I remembered since my youth. The story of a karate teacher who died to send his "endless" pupil to get 5 members of his former Poison Room, so they do not look for opportunities that a friend of the master hides. Fearing that his last pupil had not had enough training, he tells him to be one of five "parasites" to win the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough about choreography or work on the camera. A good film for its right and it is quite possible one of the best karate movies made. A CLASSIC!
