"The Matador stars" Pierce Brosnan as a killer burned. He is James Bond who went to the seed, very strong, wearing clothes, gold chains, and bad haircut. Our struggling defendant, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to restore his courage. Staying at the same hotel is good, its unfortunate businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), also trying to restore its balance. Danny is eager to install the plan and return to his wife Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Good and Wright without expecting to be friends. Wright persuades Noble to open certain techniques, which he shows on a cow. The quotation is finally facing his employers and shows in Denver. <br /> <br /> Author and director Richard Shepard made Q & A after this exciting film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also under his fortune. After suffering from losing his agent and rejecting recent texts, he decided to write a story no one could buy and create a character no one would like to play. Then Pierce Brosnan named. Brosnan repeats his balance in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) She has a good flair for self-deprecating comedy. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Continue installing credit to see what filmmakers say about hitting the cow. I look forward to more than Richard Shepard projects.
