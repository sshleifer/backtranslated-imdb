I liked this film very much. Animation was done well and romance was good. I loved the songs of Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer's score was the best. What? Many people do not know how it relates to the Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now the theme (happening when so-called "civilization" opposes one person at home, means "civilized" etc.). Scenery and music were very provoking. Film is crying for America which was once good.
