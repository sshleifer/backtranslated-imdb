This film is very interesting. I have seen it twice and looks Glover scored nail on the head and what he wants he wants to accomplish. I can personally be involved in the anger that the advertiser shows in the film is not clear to the shadows of a non-minded organization that is a wound in our media center, and the things that we as culture should not "think" about due to the control of the media information. The anger that Glover explains through the "horrible things" in all films is revealed in the visceral bitterness and good in its potency of poetry. I am glad to see this film and it is more obvious that Glover is on something interesting and two parts of what will be trilogy. It's good! EVERYTHING IS ONLY. See also. People who remove this film as "thoughtless" or "uncomfortable" lose the boat. This is a mental film. If you see and his live show does before and his books, it is also very angry when. The way you get into his mind is something. You will have experience!
