Today if someone who says the name of Victor McLaglen more answers will be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, which is about a poor, desperate person who is willing to sell his best friend to "carfare" for the United States. It is a fascinating movie that shows how low even shnooks means well to go for just a few bucks. The film takes place in Ireland directed by the UK and when all the characters are directly or indirectly fighting for the independence of Ireland, all the behavior of Mr. McLaglen is faced with getting money and drinking. The movie makes it strange if political crimes are worth all the trouble because when the activist is hard to make sure, many others just don't care, don't even know what the issue is about. The view of this film is: looking at a friend, can sell it to a dime.
