Have you ever wondered how one film could go away? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac continues to reflect the extreme world with Harry Russo. Harry is a powerful author, a murderer and a scumbag drug who stops anything from destroying those who stand between it and evil. Driven by the winds of the rubberneck of her ventriloquist dummy, Harry begins to kill her. From director Ron Atkins comes the first phase of the worst films. The only movie I saw was similar to this will be the 2nd round of the right Schizophreniac Necromaniac This is a low-budget film and will not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something that blends, different from awesome then this will A good choice. Don't try anything else for today (such as screaming) <br /> <br /> wise viewer is recommended
