I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story line though you need a few improvements was very good, especially in the 1st season. Season one story story was more interesting, the light side of life in the pony Jam when the bright plot plot and logic run under X-series. I was expecting a new season, in fact I am still. I hope the FOX boys and DA producers are aware that a lot of ppl still await the return return return. Even after 2 years of cancellation, DA can make it work well, and I think the name like James Cameron should take this challenge.
