"Yes, Georgio" is a movie with a cheerful and cheerful mood that has a good atmosphere and good music. It's not my favorite movie but it's a movie I enjoyed seeing more than once. Other viewers suggested that a person would like to enjoy Pavarotti, they could be better used to take the opera DVD. Although, full opera can be a better representation of Pavarotti's work talents, from time to time, opera requires clothing and has a story line that completely hides the appearance and nature of a person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice to talk and show personality and behavior through opera without. Many viewers were found to find unreliable stories; I disagree. Many talented people can engage in fun - fun enough to beat the intelligent and good people. Additionally, people who are very different from one another find out about themselves and grow up in a good way to interact with people who place them or use them in the directions they would not choose alone. Both Georgio and Pamela are more open to areas that are not recognized in relation to others. Relax and be able to get into a lively and profitable film with Pavarotti at the top of its voice capabilities. The last events from the Puccini Turandot only have to find time to get there.
