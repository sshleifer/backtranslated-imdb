As a comic reader, who still views himself as a whole child with a heart, confess that I would prefer it to this movie. I mean, it has never been a good movie for superhero long (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good movie of superhero). I loved this film very good, and unlike my recent trips to the movie (read Blair's Project Wizard) I had no desire. The men's secrets did not have serious consequences, the tension filled the flick step, was the comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. It had everyone in a small reminder laughing, and clapped and laughed through the last area. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds just a touch of sluggishness. William H. Macy has a very good man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens who use fart are just added to make children happy. Even though the set is amazing (and sometimes looks like rapoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some joke is obvious, it's still just funny. There are lines that will take even the most jaded viewer, and bring tears from the abdomen between us. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this movie. Although it is not classic at all, it is twice as funny as soon Austin Authority will return. Writing is good, and cast is great. If you are worried, make up a wife and pay a little, but any way you will be very surprised. I mean, who of us has no root for the lost once in a while?
