Well, of course, I saw the verification of this film and think of myself, what do manufacturers think? Hutton, Jolie, and DUCHOVNY? What? Voters who voted could compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had a kind of chemistry that showed an intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor was similar to Jolie's spark and fire. For Hutton, he played very well psychologically, compared to David's stability of life-threatening conditions. In general, I was very impressed with the development of writing and behavior. I gave 8 stars.
