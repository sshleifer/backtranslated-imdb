This is a moving story. No action. There is no doubt of things. No sudden surprise. If you can't stand to see movies about just two people talking and walking, about a continuous story even to the end and on romance lovey-dovey, don't waste your time and money. On the other hand, if you are in a conversation, tell a good story, the thought of stimulating ideas and getting true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this film while you are more alert, however, because the speed, music and sound of the film can keep you in a filtering mode. It's really true. I mean that. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are bothering their way sometimes but, thanks to, the chemistry between these two makes a very active, warm and tender. They act and feel out of the beginning, making them feel like a user. <br /> <br /> In their conversations there are good views on many subjects that will say ideas and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and it was also different for those small characters but I could be under their minds. Not yet destroyed the film. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple that I think the movie is a charm and is finally powerful. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The flow of the film is slow. Talk is amazing. The story builds gently, systematically. Build up to the end is satisfactory and to the finish end.
