I realized immediately that this film was not the basis of Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo's son and Perdita had now had his young children. Those of the most dalmatian were, of course, a little snowball who did not even spot the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely. In fact I have often thought about the possibility of being a friend, but now that he hurriedly became "own" again and declared that he was Cruella again, I almost began to worry too much about Chloe's Dalmatians. > <br /> Indeed, the area where young people saw Lady and Tramp when Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, it was better than I expected. I also loved the pastor who played the dog, and it was strange that dogs had learned many of the films of this film. Of course I was glad that the end of Dalmatia was saved again, but I would like to know what is happening to Cruella after losing all his possessions. And what in the world can be dog dogs do with a large amount of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was quite a touch that Snowball also had ads at the end of the film.
