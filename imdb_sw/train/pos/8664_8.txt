Steely, Frankie Diomede head of the chief gangster (often severe Lee Van Cleef for a very good form) has been arrested and sent to prison so that he can dismiss a partner without discovering. Amazing hats goofball short and smartguy wannabe Tony Breda (good to be shown by Tony Lo Bianco) also gets. Frank and Tony make an impossible friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of solidarity and help him in his attempt to take revenge on a group of warring groups led by Louis Annunziata's heroes (well played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, who works from the script dealing with Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells a good story at a regular pace, it has a good feeling, but it often has a good voice, and stimulating action sets the gun The big (rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and mondo long destructo car expel the standard as exciting things). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show good chemistry, free and engaging on screen; The relationship between their characters is different from the touch and touch. The wonder of Edwige Fenech is not worth much to do as Tony's Orchidea partner, but at least he gets his strange body and pregnant in the swimming pool. Groovy's Rirt Ortolani, hitting, syncopated funk / jazz logo certainly blows the soully swingin spot. The cinema movie Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also amazing. The most successful and entertaining champion.
