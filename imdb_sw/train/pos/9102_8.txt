I saw this film in the 18 Haifa film festival, and it was one of the best I saw this year. Seeing on the big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those TV screens the most movies have) and the sound system will always add experience movies, as the film takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you in the story, in the picture. <br /> <br /> Movie shows a set of characters, which are easily connected. Their stories cross into certain areas, and a series of story lines reminds me of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite film. But the real hero of the movie is definitely the city of Madrid, which provides background to the entire movie. It houses the characters, has pavements and roads on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere of the events, all in the other beautiful scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie returns again and again for some themes (shoes for example), and naturally Salazar makes its metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. He combines the views of the city using pictures of characters, and elegantly match the sense of location to the background. A set of talented actors helps the image of different types. One excellent example is the area where Juaquin takes Anita street for the first time. Can't work on smaller screens, but it has given me a simple blow on the big screen. The message of the film is very positive, and therefore the movie is lighter and normal sometimes. Music with the film is usually pop, with small pieces (I hope to put my hand on the sound of one day, though I doubt it will certainly be). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie with sensational feelings, and I am not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this film a solid 8/10.
