I had seen the Lady with red hair when it appeared, and she didn't remember it as a worthy thing. The fact is that, despite its foundation in the true story, its play screen is silly and unknown. The actual value of the image is cast. A group of some of the best 30- and 40-year-old performs a stunning, highly intelligent work of Miriam Hopkins which has been knocked down, with a beautiful, wonderful performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the most beautiful thing. What are the practices! He has not won Oscar, but he is in the best company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady and Red Hair has its best work in the film. See and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
