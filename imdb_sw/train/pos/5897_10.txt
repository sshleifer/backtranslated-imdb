This movie needs to be placed on DVD. It was very funny and I liked it. True, it is very beautiful and beautiful. Not true, but don't think that. The only thing I didn't like about it is a girl who relied on a young man. It represents the time of thinking. I have been trying to get this film for a long time and it has not been found in the US formats only in the UK and will not be playing on the American DVD players. Sadly, the film looks normal. Believe it or not, but this film can be easily accessible, for all ages. Unfortunately, we cannot justify certain things that can save a small country or our own. Lindy is not good, a good character that makes lamonade out of lemons. She is funny and charming. Stole the show!
