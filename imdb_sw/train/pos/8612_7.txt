I disagree entirely with other views sent to this film. For example, the cinema depends on the book and if the author had a homosexual attitude in it then how would "Hollywood" only give us the homosexual attitude to the film. And then there were two homosexuals and I thought they appeared. One was normal and the other was more feminine but was not over. And Diane Keaton gave a good performance and if another inspector had the ability to watch the entire film they would see that her behavior was developed through the film by interacting with other characters. For example when he and Adam were looking at a car that Sara came down in the junkyard she could see the side of her mother coming out and later in the film you saw that she too was unacceptable. But I think if you are very concerned about gay and characters characters who are wrong then this movie is bad. But if you're more intelligent and I don't really have a inkling of what good then you will enjoy this film.
