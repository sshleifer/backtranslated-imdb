With several hammer hammers, this piece of fear of the British is moving around the house and the past of the old tenants, whose stories are all told by the detention of Scotland, by finding a missing actor. The number one, which may be the most interesting of four, deals with the author and his wife who have just moved home and planned a temporary stay to write one of his novels. He builds a class character called Dominic, who is a very attractive looking look, and soon finds himself as crazy as he begins to see this man looking everywhere he is going. After his wife persuaded her to seek psychological help, a little appetite was established which, in fact, did not work for me. I will not destroy you. <br /> <br /> Next story (best in my opinion) The star is amazing Peter Cushing like Philip Grayson, a man who has moved home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to the nearest wax (which makes it work in the macabre where he tries to find the number of wax which looks exactly like a woman from the past. Shortly afterward, an old friend (who also has a history and this woman) is in town for business and drops to see him. The two men are in the wake of sadness as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than to meet the eye. <br /> <br /> Three stars one of my favorite favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving home with his only daughter, Jane, who employs it becomes terrible through Reid pouring a little girl. Well know ... if he knew what Lee did, he could understand. <br /> <br /> The last story is a story of a beautiful vampire which starring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After purchasing a garment from a wonderful businessman, actor Paul Henderson finds himself in a very large creature that has been shown several times in his work. <br /> <br /> Overall, pacing and patterns were very good, as they were more than exhibitions. There was a good Gothic touch here and there with a highly effective color to enhance the environment. This is a protector, and he comes very much.
