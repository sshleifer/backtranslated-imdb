Dirty Harry should monitor the rape victim who takes revenge by shooting at his attackers before killing them. Perhaps the most appropriate penalty is to enable them to live after the original shot and allow them to suffer forever as she and her sister does ... However ... the story full of stages in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The chief offender, played by Andy Drake is very good and gets his final penalty (of course!). It's not an ordinary movie but it's better than others except for Dirty's original Dirty.
