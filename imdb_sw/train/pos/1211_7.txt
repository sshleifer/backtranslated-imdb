I grew up in this movie and I can remember when I and my brother were playing in the fields and pretending we were in Care-lot. Now, after so many years, I've been watching a movie with my daughter and seeing her enjoy. If you are a parent and you did not watch this film with your children, then you should, so that you can hold them in your hands and watch them enjoy the care and care-much! Songs, especially "Forever Young" is very sweet and does not remember. Parents, I strongly recommend this film to all children so they can learn how caring others can be! When you come under all the litter on TV, you can add your children to the right mental picture of life and movies like this.
