This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to do more. There are no strong buttons, no drive expelling, no clever-clever. Only people are involved in being people. William Macy has a hitman who can't possibly work for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is a good boy, Sutherland is a powerful father. The child wants out of business, the father will not allow him. Macy loves her own son, playing with David Dorfman ("Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl who meets him in his waiting room office. It is a fascinating juxtaposition of the characters and the film follows the killer who loves as he weighs himself needs and those of his family. There are many things that touch, especially between Macy and her boyfriend. And as you expect in the film by William Macy in it, there is also humor. <br /> <br /> Work best around, administrators and director. Nice to know that they can still make a good film in Hollywood on a small budget.
