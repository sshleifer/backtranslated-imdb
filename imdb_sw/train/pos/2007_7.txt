My personal opinion is that this film did not have a real story line for the first Vampires of Johnpentremala but I don't care I liked. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was good at this film. He is very mad I believe he was a person who would not think of a popular ROCKSTAR. There were bad things about this movie. As a story line, it should be more than a movie. I loved the clothes that people wore and the environment they choose in Mexico. I loved how it was in the past of Mexico and not a new Mexico. and clay houses and old fashion churches. I was a little confused with vampires and how they could walk in churches but it was cold how they didn't follow the rules of the vampire dracula.
