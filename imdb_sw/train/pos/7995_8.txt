Here is the story of apostasy, get-bad-retaliation for Denzel Washington's starless and incredible star. He has three attributes here: a low-and-out-key-now-drunken drunkman who has already drunk, then a young man of a little girl and then a cruel maniac who seeks answers and revenge. <br /> The story is about Washington employed as a defender of a young American girl who lives in Mexico, where the slaughter of children occurs regularly (at least according to the movie.) She is attached to a child, playing a winner with our child actor, Dakota Fanning . When Fanning has been kidnapped before him, Washington goes after men are responsible and does not know anyone. Beware: this film is not squeamish. <br /> <br /> This is a stylish text, which is good and bad. I liked, but the number of people also found it because of their taste if the camera function is one that can give you a headache. I thought it was similar to a long storyline and it was interesting to see, but it is (shaky camera) not to taste all. <br /> <br /> In addition to two stars, there is Christopher Walken very attractive, with uncharacteristically low role, and many other actors. Images / movies show a basic feeling for all of us, but it works.
