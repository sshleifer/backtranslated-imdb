There is a constant hunger of the "basic training" of the cinema, so it is surprising that this had very little information when it was first released. It seems to have a second life that is eligible for DVD / VHS. Tigerland is not good for any way, there are some highly motivated characters (especially for NCO, making you long for Lee's Full Metal Jacket 'Ermey) but the leading performance of Colin Farrell is crazy the stardom of acute. Charisma burn with every actor who can kill to get.
