I agree with "Jerry." It is a low-down movie (of course, how many good non-low budgets?) If I remember correctly, a secret solution was a different kind (but not "burst") in 2001, because the spaceship computer control has been true The man, who somehow had turned into a computer. And as HAL, they tried to eliminate his "mind", but not part of its mechanics, and as with HAL, it caused disaster. There is at least one time of interest. When the character of Christopher Cary, who can not get any food, finds a bird of abandoned flight, there is a kind of bad time, but then the obvious thing did not happen after all.
