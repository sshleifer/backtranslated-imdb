Ernst Marischka, one of the most honored Austrian directors there at that time, made the film full of beautiful scenes, bright love and respect for all that is worth in life. These days, if people should hear about it, they share the name of Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he made other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and certainly this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing a couple of Victoria grandmothers. Although it deals with a slightly different topic than SISSI films, I find many differences between this film and SISSI. They are very similar. <br /> <br /> Movie is approximate. Style, music, pictures. In fact, employees are almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! It is sent ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major tasks. It was an exciting introduction to its Sissi position since this film took place a year before the first part of the trilogy about the king of Austria. It is also a film where Romy plays with his mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who gave Romy to play with her mother. First of Romy, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was her performance with her mother, too. Therefore, there were other voices in which Romy began his career in Austria on the basis of his mother's popularity. Indeed, there is truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this film is very loving. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small lodge in Dover. Their sympathy depends on the clean up in the dance and whisper gently. And now ...? What? How will it be shown? It's just sex ... But is it the only thing that love is dependent on? Thank you for Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a spirit and a message. Some people may call kitschy, but I never give up admiring these films. They are IMPRESSIVE !!! UNFORTUNATELY, IN WORKING!
