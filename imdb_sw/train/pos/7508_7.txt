Great on the Gretchen Mol section. This film is one of the best biopics to beat the screen at some point. Although it refers to many of Bettie's young lives, it also will be able to stay on a more targeted path which is a lot of biographical films. There are some good and very scary series in conversation with acting. This film is the best break from Dir. the "Psycho American," and I think this will show through his best work so far. Oh, and like buff movies, I give this film 100% in cine dept. It was amazing how they pulled up the 50s and modern films. Accolades for D.O.P. All around is very enjoyable. I recommend anyone who wants to see it: 8/10.
