If you would like adult cartoons, such as South Park, then this is approaching the same pattern on small adventures of three young girls in Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given sweets to make and do like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories developing with school teachers. There is the head of the exhibition, Mr. Bip, the Numeracy teacher and many others. Release is also amazing, Gina Yashere of Lenny Henry, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack Doon Mackichan of Pony, Mark Ringers of Dead Pony and Nina Conti's Blunder. I didn't know that this came from Canada, but it's very good. Very nice!
