To my surprise I was delighted 'Spacecamp', I remember seeing 13 years ago, and soon I used it again. I was very impressed. It is definitely a special impact on today's film of space such as Armageddon and Impact Deep is far away than those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story-story of the last eight years that you could almost mention the second line of discussion before hearing. But that's what I liked - they didn't make a film like this again, so it was an enjoyable change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the early roles, and Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to increase the quantity for light & fluffy plot. He loved a robot named Jinx, it was very good, but unfortunately it had more feeling than other main characters. The movie was close to power in its own way, and it was amazing to realize that it was done on NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
