Broadway and films-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) makes a masterpiece with this film 1977. It is a star Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and Peter Falk came . Cluster of the film: The aging style and film actor (Gena Rowlands) re-examines his life after a fan who died in a car accident trying to find an autograph. The movie has slow speed and the quality of darkness, moody, and awesome. It has a look of 60 movies and even reminds the child of Rosemary of Polanski without unusual fear. Fear here is every successful actor who gets old and will be free in his career. Additionally, he feels that he has lived a life that does not exist spiritually, humanity and praise. He has lived only for his work - he does not have children, do not have any support, etc.. The gradual division of his personality is the flesh of this film. He is falling apart. He is in crisis. Gena Rowlands actually enters into the psyche of traumatic behavior and makes that part very well. He is a bright actor and this 70 movie is a fun and often violent movie of the period or movie tragedy or adventure attractions. It is a deep-minded movie but has a sense of cool, arrogant, such as Cassavetes criticizes common movies and 70-year-old actors. Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although production standards were not good, this film is not known, it is a very haunting film and a haunting feeling. Kudos for the lowest and the late Cassavetes director who died in the late 80s.
