It is very difficult to get a literary work translated enough on the screen that I could measure this film above, but not to the extent. As a long-term student of Vonnegut, I am not concerned about suggesting a film to its readers, at least for those who like me. Release is revived: Nolte stands for victory, frustrated with failure, firm in judgment. Sheryl Lee is luscious around, but her care of the false Resi and her terrible crescendo almost forgets its beauty. Alan Arkin offers a very interesting style, but similar to the loyal, Soviet. Do not feel that you read Mama's mother to understand the film; though, if you have not read the Mother of the Night, you might want to look after the movie. Look at the changes from the black-and-white color back and forth, and don't forget the last example of Campbell's nose. See, too, for Kurt Vonnegut's close to the end of the film. The Bing Crosby Christmas "Christmas" will not sound the same sound (I write in mid-December, when the song begins to play heavy radio, and transport me nuts).
