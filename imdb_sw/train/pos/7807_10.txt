The performance of each actor and actor (in the film) is the best NATURAL which is what the movie works should; and leading management skills are carefully dealt with on every detail I have never seen. However, I am surprised to see that this film has not been included in some executives' and director, Attenborough credit which stands for me: they are not proud to make claims that they have made a very good film, long for viewers? I hope to get answers to my puzzles from one (perhaps one of the "experts" (insider) of the film.
