I saw this in last night's observation as well. I was hit so much for how this movie was beyond what I expected. Many movies can combine the dark comedy with the current event and not fall off at the conclusion. I will no longer redesign this program because I think you don't know about this film going into it makes it so much better. But I will say that the performance of Adam Sandler was comforting and true. He was funny, more fun than most of his recent comedies. Don Cheadle was trusted as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good speed about it. I would say 90% of the audience laughed for many films. Midway through the movie decreases down to deal with the end of the game and performs a very good job to connect all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really true that instead of playing until a black black friend / something of a white friend they chose to just ignore and focus on the relationships themselves.
