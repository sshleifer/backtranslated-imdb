This is a very good and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is about two dogs and cats that are taken to live with someone else for a while but animals do not know and they run to get their own family. Pati is Sassy and lives in her name. Possibility is a small dog who knows a lot about life within a pound. Shade is an old and wise dog who hears things. Put the three together in the adventure and make the fun and happy time. No special effects of mouth travel so it is not entirely cheesy. It's the best movie to talk about animals that I have seen so far. It's a very good movie for the family.
