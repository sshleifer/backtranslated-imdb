This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my films that have been suggested by Pabst and I enjoyed most of the most famous films that made the stars Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It is possible because both are similar to the Neo-Realist movies that Italy achieved in the 1940s and 50s. This fashion movie is used to use non-actors (only ordinary people) in everyday settings to create more relevant and realistic attractions. In this case, the film is about French and German coal employers, so accordingly, people in the roles seem like miners - not executives. The main dispute as the film begins is that there is a huge mine on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided into the border with German workers not invited to the French mine, although there is a huge lack of employment in Germany. This distinction, the difference in language (shown in wonder in the venue of the dance hall) and WWI's plan to create a great partnership between groups - and lead us against ideas. Later, the explosion leads to a massive collapse of French and Germans refuse to sit and do something. They risk their own lives, proving that there is a real partnership between the miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great criticism of the abuse of people and trying, free, to get the German listeners to see the vanity of war and hatred. It was an exciting film with pictures and scaryest pictures and claustrophobic I saw. Based on history, however, the impact of the film was very small. It is a real embarrassment, like this, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET IN THE DISTRICT INDUSTRY (Judgment) had a great message of peace and harmony but ultimately they failed to resist public opinion. Therefore, from a historical perspective, it is a wonderful and sad relic that is worth looking at.
