These guys are nothing but ordinary characters! They are an amazing group of oddballs that you want to see and leave it, but it is not available that there is very little space for that. Nobody is better than William H Macy showing a man with a great heart but under his fortune. This is probably his best performance from Fargo. Sam Rockwell became a meathead player in full, and another group was also good too. La Guzman brought great forgiveness as Cosimo; The latter end was highly hilarious. The direction was also seen by the brothers of Russo. In fact there are Coen brothers who feel the film and it will be interesting to see how they will continue their work. They have a long way to resemble Coen but this is a good start and I hope to leave the second cell. ... "Yo mutha is huzinzi"!
