I was sleeping with my gf last night, and when he had his teeth, I hit the way until I got this Chinese movie called King of Masks. At first I thought it would be a movie of Kung Fu, so I started to look at it, and then immediately he grabbed me, and I had to finish. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was quite delightful. He was a very good actor for being very young. Perhaps the truth was Chinese, so English had made it difficult for me to say ... but he seemed to be in a perfectly characteristic manner. I felt very bad for a girl if she kept trying to please the "master" but everything started to fall apart. lol. Even when he has brought another grandson, then he can pass his art ... it turns out to be kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever he touches for efforts to be good to his grandmother, he is just guilty. At the end, he sees how love is in him and teaches him the art of masks ... which is just heart after all the shock in the film. It is definitely a gem, and quite entirely. Scott / Scott
