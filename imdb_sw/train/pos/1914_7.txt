The eight simple rules began as a series of entertainment. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and his relationship with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have loved Kerry for Bridget, Bridget has been made before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to him in many ways, though I don't know me as his behavior trends went in a series later. <br /> <br /> Earlier episodes were happy, beautiful young plots on Paul and Cate discipline children, however I think the lost show is shining when John Ritter died. I was attracted by people sent by the staff to continue the series but when he died, I felt a plan made. For me the whole point of the show was based near the guide to the '8 simple rules of dating my little daughter' written by a real man and a young daughter with the importance and angle of the show was changed without father Hennessey Bridget appeared to be more bitter, Rory stayed the same and Cate was always giving lessons to the lives of her children which before being seen that funnier at all were left to Paul. I think Grandma is funny (Especially when she looks to avoid Great) but feel C.J is not necessary to show. He is funny in part but I felt the lines of the story when his arrival was similar to another American series of comedy. More than all new people are not just badly excited and does anyone find it irritating that Work works at school and C.J and Granddad are always present? I would often recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and also worth looking for Paul and Kerry, but later they were average average.
