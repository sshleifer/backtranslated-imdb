This holy desire is hysterical! Why aren't American comedies written like this? For anyone who thinks comedy to be dumb - there is more wit and mind in six episodes of this series than in the novel shelves! Hugh Laurie is a perfect hoot. I couldn't believe it was the same person with the House! There are many verses and publications in this series you can watch every time and still pick up new items every time. Rowan Atkinson is a hilarious master like verbose and put on Edmund pastor. This is my favorite series of Blackadder. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the bad heart of the series, "mass abuse" Baldrick. Some of my favorite verses: "When someone grows up with Wellington he puts his foot in it" and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder "top salesman" and the swordsman of homicidal from Scotland.
