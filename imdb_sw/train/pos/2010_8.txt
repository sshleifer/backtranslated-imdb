I thought this movie was very good. Some parts were corny but that is understandable since it was done more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the film was made by Michele Morgan who played Millie perfectly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although not a big fan of Sinatra, I think he was very good in this film. If you have a desire for folly, on top of the music on the top, Top and Top is your movie. <br /> <br />
