This is a very interesting movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think men around the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some extent! These ideas are very entertaining and women will also enjoy this film I am sure! All organized members do well, and this film can be the biggest hit in the world if it was released in the UK or the United States. But for those who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are for treating! It is highly recommended.
