De Grot is a very good film. The good plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also changed this story to the screen. Some of the top class do, not just with Van Huêt, but especially with Marcel Hensema, who actually worked on TV before its Axel van de Graaf performance. This film seems to be a surprise, and it puts a good mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed a little bit in a very powerful backward format, which adds a more romantic feature to a game driven by a movie character. Ultimately all of this reaches the emotional end, which will take the audience to their throat. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you see this film. Must-see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (Definition of Vanishing original screens).
