After being a fan of 'Columbo', I was very disappointed in 'Corky Romano'. At that time it is a wonderful movie, the Falk's character of the notable squad was a great cry from a lieutenant loved for many years, especially for the terrible language that he used. After 'Corky Romano', I was both honest and disturbed by Mr. Peter Falk. Of course, after just seeing 'Find John Christmas' and his predecessor, 'The city without Christmas', for the first time within a week straight, I must say that 'Max', the character of Peter Falk enjoyable in the cinema both, it is certainly as memorable and interested as 'Columbo'. While the parts of the movie are predictable, such events will not be removed and the joy of seeing the story being played. I also want to write these two Christmas movies, and I strongly recommend you if you are a fan of Falk, Christmas seeds, or just someone who enjoys a good feel of the week. This film can end up lost among many groups of fricks made for TV, so make sure you get 'Find John Christmas' before the delay.
