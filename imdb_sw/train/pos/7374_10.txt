At its first beginning this film has time to riveting and cool. In the best-scary movie your abdomen hole is always strengthening during this film. The latter is very good. Blaire Witch's creators evidently watched this film is ending not the end but the beginning of the end. A great movie with just a great Japanese piece even with the fear of perfect score makes you think and afraid of your mind.
