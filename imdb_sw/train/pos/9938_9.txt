We bought a DVD set of "Es war einmal das Leben" (Germany) / "Formerly ... Life" (English) for our two language children because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (Germany) / "Once Time ... Man" (English) series (we parents saw it as children) and it has even increased expectations! The series has been done well, not showing its age, and our children at different ages like to look at it. At the same time, they learn things we parents did not know until the way, the way later. The series covers everything to do with the human body from links, all the senses, blood, infection, breathing, and much more in animated 20-25 min events. Some topics people can find "sensible", such as digestion and reproduction are covered in tasteful, wise and child friendly manner (reproduction period starts coverage especially where the child begins to grow), while still (as usual) information and fun. <br /> <br /> The children are usually fascinated by how their bodies work and the way they get an understanding of this in their environment. Form changes between the outside world (family with 2 children) and within the body. For example, in the period covering the infection, the boy cuts himself accidentally and wound infections and the part covers how the body reacts to this. Similarly, mental events, e.g. hear, see, link what happens inside the body to the outside world and the respiratory section and the oxygen cycle in the blood covers the perfect lifecycle including (in brief) where oxygen comes from (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs ever - I would say it must see for every family and children!
