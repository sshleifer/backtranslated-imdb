The movie's road on the old-old trains in Slowenian province in late summer. At first you see a man in the pants of the underwear pants from the black cloth, and when the young man on his black pants leave the house with two boxes, you see that part of the pants is not on the banner of mourning (perhaps his father has died). In the train he meets a young woman, and almost without words, but many small signs, the wonderful story of love begins. It's somehow surreal, a very poem, and a wonderful movie, with many wonderful people and incredible events. Beautiful pictures and love for good details.
