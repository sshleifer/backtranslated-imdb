brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and memorable children filled with fear from stories like IT - as the opposite. There is no fear in this childhood that any friend - who is still 20 years old friends - remember or appear to suffer. Half of the whole line is described as a friendly partner, perhaps often described as "picking" one or more of them, but all are forgiven. No * angst * inserted as films and participants in later life describes relationships - we all see young people who have grown up to be special people. They grow more, but basically they are still the same people, and the same powerful structures. It's amazing! Not only for the fact that people can grow significantly without being destroyed by social gatherings - but also that friends can last. In this way this movie is a small Pearl - if someone thinks this has been interested in the film: A picture of unwanted impressions. Which, when opposed to future films that reflect the dark ages of childhood - the barriers to violence in Bowling for Mixing is something that happens easily, but since mid-80s with child growth and childhood (accompanied by 1000 ads, animation and series directed to children) several movies and documentation have succeeded by showing the sides of the growth of growth - abuse, solitude, push more - lead adults and dark and distorted ideas. <Br /> <br /> And here comes the film, which says: It is possible to have childhood fun, look! <br /> <br /> Thank you for that. OR the incomparable fraud ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
