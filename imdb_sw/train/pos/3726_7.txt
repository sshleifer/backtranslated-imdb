I did not have high expectations of films by Joel Schumacher leading this, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete destruction of time. <br /> <br /> In the technique, often provided for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and the function of shaky cameras, the shiny shots, the film regularly runs like an array of rows - all these Speilberg techniques used to make its film more visible but it was ultimately more distracting than anything else. But unlike saving PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional part was not weak, as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and stories are not available, not closed to the American flag (Speilberg gets 'F' carefully. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the first part of the perfect MARTAL Kubrick Day, this is the real picture of the boot camp that I have seen on the film, and because I think it's worth watching. > Not a good film, but also not a bad film.
