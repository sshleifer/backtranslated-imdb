The main reason to see this film is Warren William, who is on the form as a campaign manager of shyster. He is electrified, always looking for ways to publicize and defeat the party that opposes the middle of a major disaster. William is a good actor - I feel he had no reason. Bette Davis as her partner also shines in the role written below. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee not quite right as a candidate who had emerged that William and others are trying to strengthen the public. He looked more like an empty canvas without someone. I would like to see a realistic appearance rather than a characteristic behavior. The story itself is implausible, silly and clich√©d. But Warren William and Bette Davis should look at.
