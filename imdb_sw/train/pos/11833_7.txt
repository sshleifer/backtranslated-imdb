White man + development + industrialization = BAD. First states + animal + nature = NI. Simple formula. True, in the past such a kind of propaganda was used to defend the state of the situation; is now used to attack. However, that being said, I think the movie succeeds in winning hackneyed policies because it deals with the theme of freedom and natural nature in a manner that attracts everyone. You may not have a change of the Western-style film's overcoming, lost. But anyone can feel a sense of despair that horses can run free in the West basins. (The movie also conveniently cuts the fact that there was a horse in America before a bad white man brought it there). However, I loved it. The quality of animation - especially the opening of the opening - is amazing.
