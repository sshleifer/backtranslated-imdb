This movie is amazing! When being funny and entertaining, it is also very clear and open eyes. I'll watch it again and again. Bruce is an unhappy person. He has work and life, but he doesn't think he will take it to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, uncertain, and angry that his life is not the way he sees it should be. As a result of this mental state, Bruce ends up losing his job and accusing God of everything that he thinks is wrong for his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine power. Bruce uses this power to get everything that he wants every time. His life is finally what he thinks it will take to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of getting everything, it loses one person who really loved the truth. While the movie will continue, Bruce learns that the real change that was needed to happen in his life was not a situation, but his view of what was there. This movie was interesting and comprehensive. If you consider the truth, it motivates you to look at your life in the most respectful way of the fact that most times we bless more than we realize. If my wife says, "Since when does someone know what it takes to make them happy?" and add to me humbly, "Let's not lose ourselves and those who care when we try to know."
