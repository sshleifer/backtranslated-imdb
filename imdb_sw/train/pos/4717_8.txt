How can anyone like this movie? I think it's a hilarious spoof of all old gangster movies; if you have never seen, see this instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role everything going on. One boy uses the English language every time he speaks to Griffin Dunn with emergency D.A., but my responsibility should be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston is in this star-filled movie that fake strokes like more than "Mafia" for underground land.
