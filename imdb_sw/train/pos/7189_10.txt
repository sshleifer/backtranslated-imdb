My most famous character in the film, but almost all the character of Zorro has a little fabric like a mask and if the villain`s can` tell who under the clothes then it is daft. <br /> <br /> But in Legion The Reed Hadley's Story "Fighting Zorro" (serial 1939) mask fills his whole face to be a true secret about who Zorro is true. <br /> <br /> But Zorro is however one of the best behaviors in the film making it so far I think Anthony Hopkins in the "Mask of Zorro" (1998) is fun. <br /> <br /> My goal in the film is great, but l looks really good for the 30s / 40s ....
