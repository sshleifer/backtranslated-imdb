Lauren Bacall was living through Humprey Bogarts disease and death when he made this film. The Hudson Rock was close to its 1950's. Dorothy Malone is in good condition, and succeeds Oscar for help. Robert Stack has been chosen & falls just for a short time. It is a little soap from sometimes but it is important as many drama. It is amazing how doctors can drive in this film and also how quickly Stack faces several early films. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is very good and actually productive is this film is very good. You can tell Bacall he was corrupted during this film while doing his job is good, he looks like a emotional artwork in some order. <br /> <br /> Gender references in this film are narrow, that many viewers today cannot recognize what it is. The film is doing a good job describing the story and actually leaves the last leaves to be no end though no one has found - though it is written over the wind will be a good head.
