I am quite addicted to this show. I can't wait until the week goes to see the next. is a great story of story and has excellent actors and artists on the show. I will love every week to look at it even if I am not at home I always have my vcr set on the tape monarch tape. simon rex is the best actor on the show. it is doubtful and exciting. I think this show should stay on the air and I believe everyone should be watched to look at it. I saw the first part and really didn't look at it but I was looking at one day and I decided to look at it because it was and I really liked it and now it's my popular show. I really mean it.
