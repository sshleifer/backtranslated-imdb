This should be a unique twist of two kinds of ever seen. A great variety of movie monster and music music of mummy. This unique mix makes a unique and compelling story. Giving is the best, including the TOS BOSLEY who even though I have never been in a terrible movie before, ever. The effects are strange and the idea of ​​a great mummy filled with small mummies is one of the cold. My one complaint, I want to see more of the big mummy, but the other then I think they did a good job. Conversations, characters and stories were perfect. Acting was good. This should be the best film from the sci-fi center. You hear me, the best movie out of the sci-fi center. I give FALLEN ONES 9 out of 10.
