This was another great movie of Tom Berenger. But some people were exactly like the other character of SGT BARNES but it was still bad. Billy Zane was just beginning as Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan but then got a little mess at the end! Sniper was dirty and dirty actions should look at it. I remind you that there will be no more steps as flick of reg. Reg. I got this one on DVD too and it's better!
