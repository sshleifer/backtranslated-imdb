I went to a small observation of this film on July 19, not knowing more of the names of a few participants and that it was a fantasy / adventure effort of some sort. The plot of the plot is really not something like I have seen, and the unique story is known for everything else that is coming or coming soon to the cinema. Although the first impression can provide, not cheesy, corny, tacky, or ignorance, and in fact it is entertaining and funny. The flow has been done well, nothing seems to run or out of it. Voice sounds, for lack of good words, are magical and add a lot to the film, as opposed to just filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I knew what came to the points, I still can't stop watching the screen; for my knowledge, not one person who left the theater during the entire movie. My gripe is that it seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as I can't recognize why.
