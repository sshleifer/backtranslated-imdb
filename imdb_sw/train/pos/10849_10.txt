This is probably the best rockumentary ever- UK, the best This is a Spinal Tap. The characters are honest, the plot is good, and you can really feel some of the events â€” such as Ray's problem on the band. <br /> <br /> Sound sound is the best. Real-time items, even if they are on the same key, will be bothering some songs for the day. I liked it was almost all-UK cast, and some of the favorite family names. Ray's wife is worth ... It is never worth it, it's just going to the right speed, and has some real parts of it. Generator of the really good catchphrases! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
