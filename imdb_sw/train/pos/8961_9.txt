Bell, Book and Candle was one of the biggest events of pop-ups of the twentieth century, similar to the events we see today (back to 70 years - more than ten years later - there were still many memories of this film). It made Novak great star, put something good on the start of Jack Lemon, giving us a new light on Jimmy Stewart, and giving Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore in their work (both continued to continue playing witches and other "curious" past ", in films and television.) ./> <br /> With the 40 film I married the Witch (which helped make the icon of Veronica Lake), Bell, Book and Candle inspired fixed film and television and all the magic elements that started with Adjusted and practiced through Practical Witch, Wicked Witch and Harry Potter. It is something that I have seen a few times is that the movie is also an amazing alternative to Xmas. The story takes place on Christmas holidays, and, in spite of the fact that it is on magic, it actually includes a lot of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, dedication, etc.). I will always watch this film (I have seen it several times since my first look early 90's) especially k either shown near or after the holiday season. It has style, substances, good cast, and high production values. And as Adam's zone, it suggests a view that was meaningful for its time, it is even greater now (in both movies the female character is false and powerful), and so it always appears before the times.
