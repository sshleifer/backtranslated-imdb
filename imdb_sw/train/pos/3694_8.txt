He was sure what to expect from this movie based on his incredible earnings of stars and directors but the latter did not despair. It is one of the most important things and the last part of the US tourist speaking and awesome French accent (which I feel good about mine) which was actually quite touching and great way to delete the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the victim knife was also very moving and for the pure comedy Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take the prize. A piece of pictures of Tom Tykwer also interesting though rather ambitious in its scope. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins part was quite cringeworthy and vampire story was quite farcical. The talks in the section Wes Craven also felt very compelled by the Chinatown story was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is worth looking for good bits and has finished with power. It's not too painful to stay through a bad part - they just last 5 minutes anyway <br /> <br /> Ca vaut of PEINE !!!
