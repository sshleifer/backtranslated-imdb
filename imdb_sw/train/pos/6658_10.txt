Mahatma has been shown as a person who cared for her own child in this movie. Don't do me wrong I don't judge the movie; is a very good movie and walk out of the movies and nose in my throat. We need to understand the spiritual condition of Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. The only person who has the light can restrain himself from his loved ones. The man with this qualification leads his family and followers for example. According to the film, he spoke to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but little wise little Harilall could not understand his father. When things happened with Harilall, Mahatma could remain and admit that her son was a great tragedy. If it were other parents, they would leave their values ​​to help their son get to his feet. Mahatma did not, he is a true leader who leads by example.
