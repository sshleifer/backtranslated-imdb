I would first say that when I saw every part of StarTrek at least twice, I don't feel like Trekker or Trekkie. Those are people living in their parents down and attending agreements to wear clothing and rubber ears. I gave this seven film to stop off the historic error. Acting was better than average, but the plot was not surprising. They tried hard to restore technology technology but still special effects were only for a great trial. Now about historical errors, if you call them, the first Capitan pilot of the Commerce Committee was April, then Capt Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. .. According to a report made by Riker and Kirk we were dicovered Klingons and educated and gave them technology (That's why the basic instructions were created) but as I said this is not a reason to despise this good series. I hope the plots will get more, and then special effects can take back.
