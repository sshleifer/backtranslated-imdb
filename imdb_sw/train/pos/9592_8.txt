The film came 12 years ago, and it was a revelation even to people who knew something of the Drag Area in New York. Text books on drag performance do not reflect any of these emerging homes. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "Queens Drag Queens of New York: Example of the Parting Instructions" and his flow chart charts that link together Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol Queens, and the 90s club - and after the film - ignores the house . Even Laurence Senelick's "Change Room" - a very close thing that we have a sure book about the performance of drag runs fast and does not provide the basic information that one could expect. I understand from the film itself, and the various articles I have found on the web that this house system is returning decades. The great performance of the film by a member of the house before 1990 appears to be the Chrystal La Beija in the "Queen", 1968. The historical theme is the largest part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is important because it focuses on another neglected area. It is an important picture of life in 1989. The fact of the unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was killed during publishing provides a lot of end, but this is not the only film about sexually active lives. As we know now, Dorian Corey had a corpse made in her real bedroom, but this did not come until three years later. For historical importance, but we need someone else to make a book or film document which provides more settings.
