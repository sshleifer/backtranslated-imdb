Access to the most popular set of condoms for unexpected events and feelings in a small village. Some people are threatened by the way to handle the church church, and how people in it change in stages. This movie is interesting and makes you leave the movie with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It'a about bringing the best to people and Kay Pollak has written the best script based on ideas that have been popular with. The actors are the best, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was a new and dear friend to me. He has an unconscious face that does not leave anyone unnoticed. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband very close, she is too much to see. One would like to be beaten by playing a good person one day so we can see if he or she has the same character as well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you disliked. If you haven't seen it yet, do it today!
