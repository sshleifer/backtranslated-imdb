My left foot is a famous Epic film describing the life and times of Christy Brown, who had a brain disability, severe disability and had only the use of his left foot, but he felt, he could become an artist and writer against all of the behavior I have seen this film many times and every time I see it, I see it all the time. I think how this amazing film did not win Oscer for better images, It is shambles and professional prizes. Jim Shirdan is one of the world's largest directors.the screens, music and anything else is better in this film. As the film goes on, you would like to feel in a colorful colored colored pigment paint as everything happens. For MacAnally and Brenda Fricker it's amazing as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw are very similar like Dr Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in the battle of impunity. br /> <br /> Irish film industry was known by its name before my left foot. The left foot was the beginning of an amazing period in Irish film. A powerful and brilliant film such as a field, a cry, the name of the father and Michael Collins tracked my left foot. My left foot is the most powerful film. <br /> <br /> Daniel day-lewis has Kristoy Brown with a good disability and so consciously and the same goes to Hugh o Conner who plays Kristoy's youth. The two exhibitions are two of the best films, especially the performance of Daniel day-Lewis who would see as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the sheep. Daniel day-lewis has shown his work to be a good actor. <br /> <br /> This is the best masterpiece in the film, see!
