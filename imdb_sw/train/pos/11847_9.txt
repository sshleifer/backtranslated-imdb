Horse is really a beautiful animal. A beautiful picture of wild horses and their grace has never been greater in animation animation. <br /> <br /> Animation is just a pride. Good animation makes the back of the beauty of the horse that includes the flick. More more when the stallion surrounds a variety of different types, jumps over falls and brave waters. <br /> <br /> Sound sound is also very amazing. Good music music enjoys you. "They say the western story was written from the horse bed." Huh? Well, the story of a good horse is confirmed from the western seat. <br /> <br /> For all, this movie is open up there with the best. It's one of the best animations I've watched. It would be a very good choice at night alone. 9/10 easy.
