The Twilight Zone period combines the silent part (1890) with the text of the text and pleasant vision, to worship for the original Buster Keaton film. Lots of slapstick: Buster fall on the door of the bulkhead, fall into the sides, run around with pants-down. The discoveries of the Silent Time scientist, recall the idea of ​​Flash Gordon's future. The cheapest price, like $ 1.95 per woman's hats, or 17 cents pound for beef is seen to be largely up to Buster. Even the 1890 world is very much for Buster / Mulligan. How surprising when he is transported to lies in the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "scientist" of the time wants to return to the quiet world, 1890 which he has learned and embraced. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan now enjoys "the scientist" boasts that he has no electrical appliances, modern beds or electric blanket. So Buster brings him back with a crazy hat. The Twilight Zone does not have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last attempts. That's enough. Everything else - a long time used by Maytag Man Jesse White is a manufacturer who makes Time Temporary - for example of his washing job.
