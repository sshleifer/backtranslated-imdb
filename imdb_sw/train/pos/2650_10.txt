In addition to the fact that my list of film lovers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) others ... this movie really is better than the book (and television services though this is very simple, based on director) . An error-free film, acting and (Kubrick of all the numbers at one time) music - makes KITIKA of fear. I watched television services a few years ago and I liked the story and I was hoping about this when I got it. IT NEEDS !!! It's better than I thought. Starting slowly (label label label) and has a lot of time to decline which creates doubts. Part of the intro is a classic for every way and I look only 20 times for the explosion atmosphere induces for the entire film. Also the film does not offer much of the year (it is just enough and very unpleasant) that I hate in the most recent films. Just watch!
