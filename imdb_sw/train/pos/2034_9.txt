I have never been great in IMAX movies. They are cool, but once you arrive on the first rush of "Who, it feels like to fly!" The movies themselves are usually corny and unusual. <br /> <br /> Away has been a powerful "Everest", which attracts "Wild California" and now the BBC's "Human Body", looking at the highest in our bodies. Our towers are a controversial machine that cannot be damaged. This 50-minute film can be 10 hours long, and it is still not available in all working systems as I write this review and listen to my radio, and many of us take it all. <br /> <br /> Here you can see into the heart of pushing (it looks like a guest spaceship), inside your lungs, tiny hair in your eardrum that makes sound, baby development into the stomach, and amazingly, a few ... um, non-interesting works that I thought would descend (pimples, churning of acids in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has funky style instead, which puts away other documents IMAX. For example, we have seen every sperm looking for an egg, but have never seen it installed on the tune of "Let's Get It On"? It is a creative time like that which makes the "Human Body" not just a health subject, but also a joy.
