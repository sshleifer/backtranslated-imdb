Any way the Wind blows is Tom Barmans (who also knows as the front of the rock 'dEUS' creation movie). Fully beaten in Antwerp (Belgium), the movie begins in the morning of the morning sun and jump instead of the balance between the events that will fill the day of several of the main characters. When the movie ends, you have many things to think about, because many of the different lines of stories are left wide open. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sound track (just sound) that will draw your rock off socks. In many scenes, music enhances common sense and feel, it actually makes movies to watch at a certain time. The main area in the film, the party, is very shot. The director did not hesitate to use video video methods, having its main characters play on one of the best sound tracks I have had to hear recently. <br /> <br /> Screenplay is great things. Camera and color angles are well chosen. 'Dress' is very hot and 'too much' too. And I've loved (many) are doing. What I liked most about the film, is the touch of a wonderful, surreal, very dry or even humorous humor. <br /> <br> Without claiming that the comedy (this movie is certainly not comedy but rather a piece of art), it still manages to be its giggling audience and even burst into laughter sometimes. This is the first of the most directors that should not be the last. I hope to see more movies of Tom Barman in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
