The case of Takashi Miike in the kiddie district won me almost immediately because it shows courage and courage in dealing with fantasy things. This is a story of a story that seeks to be dark. Even as a child, I thought there was something wrong with many stories of stories; Scary things happen to people in many children's books. Miike understands that these tribal stories are less complicated (and more sad) than what they seem to be at first glance. The video presenter takes the story of the baby boy on an extraordinary effort from the early class. He emphasizes the real fear of the world filled with endless missions of danger. Western chiefs like to drop the weight of sleep stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more faithful than most American filmmakers. She goes to a story story but also shows signs of prevention. But an independent Miike is a stranger than many film makers. I thought it was a good film. It is highly recommended.
