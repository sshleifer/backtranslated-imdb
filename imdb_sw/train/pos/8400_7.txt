I chose this film in my local library. After meeting with the director at the film festival at the end of last year, I was interested in "checking" his work. I was very surprised. This film examines the most common subjects, love, honesty, friendship, jealousy. It may be a little 'talky' sometimes but never never sinks the film. I enjoyed watching the story of love with the characters who include and watch them making decisions rather than "fall" to something important as love. <br /> <br /> The difference between this film and the average low-em-budget 'em up black film is very different. See. If you are fortunate, your copy will come with a sound recorder as it was. Good things!
