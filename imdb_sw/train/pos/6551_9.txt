I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone's bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read books, it doesn't seem like anything like Nancy Drew. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not a copy of a book of books, but when you make a film out of something, you should fix it to be a great entertainment screen. The program was fun and caused by many true events and I thought that Emma Roberts was actually believing in her own way to show this classic character. There were several times of delightful and contradictory statements, at any time in this film does not Nancy come as a ditz. He was wise, conservative, respectful and true. One thing this movie also did well was something horizontally around out with a mix of comedy, romance, doubts and moments of heart. I loved this movie. What flick is, flick! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as a terrible time because I was, like, go out! Go see it or be bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think about this film for you ... the mistake I was around. I love it, I want to own this film! I love Emma Roberts now, too. He is like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
