I have never seen such a wonderful work in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact far away his position was not more. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least have a disability as he all through the film's effectiveness and surgery needed because of the destruction of his great acting act behind him. For me it is strange and through all the pain she has lived and making that move I believe it is true to say that many of Oscar's best practices in history. He was very knowledgeable in this difficult part that I believe no one could do better or more effectively than he did. Although I can't say it is the biggest movie of all time I can say how he played this impossible place and then he continued to do it until he did it again and again the big feet would never see the actor do. Probably someone also for that.
