A Catholic journalist suffering from Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) who is homosexual, alcohol and has a vision of death often has been invited to give a speech at Vlissingen. While at a railway station in Amsterdam, he feels an attraction that has not been set by a good man who gets into another train. Gerard is brought to the club's finest and beautiful female producer Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk), who is a rich widow who owns a beauty shop Sphinx, and has one night. The next morning, Gerard sees a picture of Christine Herman's partner (Thom Hoffman) and recognizes him as the person who saw the train station. He proposes to bring Herman to his home for a few days together, but with the secret intention of deceiving the person. Christine goes to Köln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard lives alone in her home. Drinks whiskey and reduces its safety, receiving three film reel and men's names; she decides to look at the tips and discover that Christine was married to three and all died with a serious accident. Later Gerard believes Christine is a witch and asks if Herman or she will have her husband's penalty. The worst of "Vierde Man" is another wonderful feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase. The story is supported by a nice screens that use Catholic symbols to create tension-related tension; the good performance of Jeroen Krabbé in the role of a confused drunk author; with amazing movies. An unconditional resolution is clear to the interpretation as in many European movies that focus on the mind and mind of the audience. There are central directors who use men's spraying to promote their films; however, Paul Verhoeven uses Gerard Reve dirt as part of the plot and never angry or seeking sensationalism. Last but not least; The spiritual beauty of sexy Renée Soutendijk is very similar to her role of a woman who attracts a gay writer. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O 4o Homem" ("Person 4")
