WOW. One of the biggest movies I saw. <br /> <br /> Absolutely liked! Before the opening credit I was held on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is the excitement of Sci-Fi - and the edge of your seat Whodunnit. Good. I would have never been. Lucy Liu is responsible for losing. Anyone can play. The leading actor, Jeremy Northram was a good geeky man. This movie is interesting to me who loved War Games, Sneakers, and Low List. <br /> <br /> Possible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D in LV
