It was spinning TV and HBO was a whammy double show of the worst of bad treatment, so I turned to my sister twin and said, "Hey this looks like a fun," - I really love the document - so we started looking at it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then he explained that because of his condition, there was no youth, so high voice and little body. He was in battle to raise money for his sake. He had a good feeling of humor and a good spiritual feeling ... I cried, I looked more, and laughed, I got to get another Kleenex, then I cried more. Once the "last time" Jonni Kennedy went up to heaven with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and was free. I strongly recommend this. If you don't like this person, you don't have a heart.
