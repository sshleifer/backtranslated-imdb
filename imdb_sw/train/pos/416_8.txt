Plainsman is west of entertainment, of course the classic, which is real even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, the best for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is as good as Calamity Jane, no one I know played better than she. Even though it may be accurate correct historical, the film can take the most important about Hikkok and about time it takes place. Sometimes you have to offer a History History to make sure your DeMille is doing here. Hikkok's friendship with Bill Buffalo, the sale of guns to Indians and the largest manufacturer to compensate for the losses due to the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, a relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious, and a Hikkok man killed a lot, also the common love of Hickok and Calamity all makes 'Plainsman' a rare and interesting film. Anthony Quinn looks very short, which already shows what a good actor will be. Many services were taken to show original guns at the time.
