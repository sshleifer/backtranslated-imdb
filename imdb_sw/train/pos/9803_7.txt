This Batman movie is not as good as Batman's Phantasm attacks and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero but it is still a good step for Batman cartoons I say is the same as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons. The story of the story is good not as good as the other but still good has many stages in it The Cartoon Effects are beautiful Sounds of actors are very good like Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal like Robin. Criminals are as good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I am sure you will not be discouraged by Batman's Secret of Batwomen. So be sure to rent or buy Batman Secret of Batwoman movie because it is very good. <br /> <br /> Total score: ******* out of ********* * *** out of *****
