this has become one of the most beautiful photos of someone I ever saw on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of lost man. he looks at the world with nature and reputation and that honor is primitive in good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness open as if you are looking at the work of the simplistic art but perfect life. I was surprised how he made his pieces with patience and how he patiently acknowledged their end. sometimes early, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his desires gently. The film drives elegantly and has respectively which Goldsworthy art has. combines nature and art in a small way as it is itself. Fred Frith's mark is an organic enough that combines everything together without interfering with natural sounds. this is a total piece of work in each element. it does not have limits until the age goes.
