one of the best low-budget movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new age? if you believe in esoteric, please don't see this film! blows all your beautiful fantasies. This movie shows that most of the fa√ßade of peace seeking the spiritual spirit is a lie of error and great terrorism. I hope there will be a copy of 35 mm soon! The Mars Marsll's first film is the beginning of a new location, making movies with a few euro! I'm waiting for a second hit!
