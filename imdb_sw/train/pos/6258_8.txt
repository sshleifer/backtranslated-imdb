Maybe they could fly some of the beginning - I don't know why this begins the Asian part of Turkey. As a result from the Mediterranean, they could get closer to the modern day of Lebanon. One of the cameras and the army arrives at the Bakhtyari tribe, is the start of a wonderful 48-day journey. 50,000 people with 250,000 goats, camels, cattle, and horses make this wonderful journey on what seems to be very quickly moving to the Karun River. They use rafts that are stored with the skin of the inflating goats - you can see where the head and feet were removed. Another "bank" of the river was very steep - I think about climbing to 60 degrees. Watching that was strange, but there was much more to come. In order to feed, they also had to cross a great mountain with 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was so amazing and itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain without clothes! Yes, without clothes. One way to this document was some of the titles and the worst test of the least. If you want to see a document from a quiet time, or a strange challenge that this tribe is not just face, but it prevails. This is an incredible small group of people facing all the challenges.
