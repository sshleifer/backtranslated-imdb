Although it is very bad, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie that should be closely watched; Some funny bits are made by passing and they do not have the usual amount of attention that is given to them. For example, continue to use Michael Keaton's gun price at the pet shop ... and also in the years of the recorded memory of the beginning of events. It is one of the most rare movies where humor hit you unexpectedly, although you know it's comedy. Amy Heckerling, director, is bright here - Enjoying his most famous films (Fast Times on Ridgemont High, Clueless, Vacation Europe, etc.),) You should give this look. Michael Keaton is very happy in the position of head and backing (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is the best. It is highly recommended.
