In the case of 'This promise', the world of the city's city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space is different. The city of the city reflects the western features that have set the environment and time; organized crime, gender-based violence, a sense of loss of identity and indifference to traditional values ​​- as explained by a small child - a village. At the end of this film, we see more of this idea when we consider funeral and wedding funerals on the dirt road. They are on a sharp collision; accordingly, the wedding, which represents the line of life and the pulse of the village, that is, traditional values, is about confused with funeral ancestors, and symbolizes the traditional deaths in this context. However Kusturica carefully examines this theme through its unique, stylistic unique. In his pride and flamboyant style as a car in his display.
