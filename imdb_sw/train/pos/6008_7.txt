When I saw the film for the first time in the 1970s, I was afraid of this film. The appearance was surprising and the museum events in Europe and the United States made you explain and what Antonioni was trying to say very well in the last 15 minutes of the movie: whispering your thoughts into the "institutions" of the attack and major business interests. Repeatedly on a beautiful house in the middle of the desert, the female character leading to enjoy a natural stream of cold water, drawing aircraft in psychedelic structures (even British Airways skills made a few years ago) is some of the photographs borrowed by advertising staff worldwide for decades. Even Pink Floyd added their fan following the film was released. You see this film 30 years later and start to wonder why the film has lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment films have more substances - facts, documentation, good displays, and very good screenshots. Antonion seems to be out of date; innocence. Even looking at Antonion's Antonion today gives you the same feeling that he passes. "Zabriski Point" should be tested for what was given when it was released. It was a good film if you could see it on a big Panavision screen against dwarfed TV screens. Visual and aural (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) Looks still film. The leading pair was not the main actors but they were good and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in the US in addition to the fact of non-conformist values ​​he made in the film. Today, Antonioni seems to be not "equalizing." But watch carefully and you will enjoy the sounds made by ordinary actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, women in the swimming pool, fighters in the shade of the air. The real sound for the difference is from non-conformists. Antononas was important 30 years ago but his central skills cannot be asked today. He knew what he had done.
