This derivative film will be entertaining for many who have not seen some of the most films of the unknown anime. I enjoyed it more, especially after the opening of the flat in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the best animation bits). James Garner as Commander and Leonard Nimoy as King delivering amazing performances.
