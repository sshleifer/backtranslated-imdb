I liked the idea of ​​this film since when I saw the first trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and its shape as gentle, playful, slightly strong mind was enough to get me to see the film. The added Spice of Matthau as Einstein did better. <br /> <br /> Stories are fantasy fresh, but one of the most beautiful. The art of the car falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's nephew. With the help of the four prophets of physics of physics, Ed struggles to win the heart of Catherine. Give an envious girl (who shows the worst psychology of experiments) and Eisenhower on the mix, and you are happy to have fun. The film has been filled with artists with good character and beautiful and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a bad emphasis; cupid and slide rule. Tim Robbins is so incredible as Ed and Meg Ryan are doing the highest level of its usual rom-com. Stephen Fry is happy as a "RRRatman" with a lover of Ryan; who do not have one romantic bone in his body. The film has dropped below a lot of radar, but it is a beautiful treasure that doesn't grow strong and watch over time. It has the first articles of writing and exhibitions and it is a gentle treat in a non-gentle world.
