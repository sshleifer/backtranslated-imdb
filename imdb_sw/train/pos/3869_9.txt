I have seen movies in Viennale a few years ago, where the audience liked it. I also liked, Phoenix's summer still attracts me, that's why I decided to write a comment. The story is held in London around 1900, where the jewish girl decides to be an actor. He tries to be one, but not before someone mistreats him that he knows about the action, that he has the power and that he connects with the audience and emerges as a powerful person. There were certain technologies, his performance was broken, accusing him of being slow, he could not bring life to his character. I think that's what it means, it's like Esta Kahn should have Phoenix making a decisive decision to make Esther a very beautiful girl. So its change at the end is more powerful than it would otherwise. <br /> <br /> The movies are beautiful, pictures of London near the end of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how bad life was back then. The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the film, the contact with the characters, after all you get just an actor in your own, so there is no great works in the film. It is a Phoenix loan that we do not open interest in the film after the first hour.
