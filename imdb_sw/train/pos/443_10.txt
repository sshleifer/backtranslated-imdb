I saw this film early in the early 90's when it was first released. The Watch Room was just new. Enchanted April had a lot more to offer! I found that real and secular, more characters are believed to be 'normal'. At the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC's Glory and Hate production, I wanted the characters to find what they wanted if they were excluded, peace, freedom or love. If you find it in Italy it is so far from everything that you have ever known, that they are very bad to take risks and leave behind all of the humdrum and constricting. But in the spring fountain in April, everyone's life opens and opens (according to Israel's corsets) and is rebuilt for everyone to be satisfied. What a little gem of the film! How can I be unknown?
