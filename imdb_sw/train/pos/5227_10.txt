The "Men in White" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not funniest, comedy movies I ever watch! (and I saw so much!) It's about two garbagemen, which become "White Men" and then stop the invasion from space. It is also a parody of many common films, such as "Black Men", "Star Wars" or "Dr Strangelove". Anyone who says that this film is crappy has something wrong with its head. There are tons of wonderful pigs and jokes here, and you might get hurt with your mouth for laughing (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on television, check it now - surely it will not get sick!
