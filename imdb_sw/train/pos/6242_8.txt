I agree with the original comments on the content of the film "daily madness" but you would like to mention that: "Dogs" is about how women are treated in the community (male). The events we see here show the difference between women's daily discrimination, especially the community and age group. There is a senior who makes his new partner look and act how his late wife was, treating him as a doll that he would "deserve to wear" old dress. There are middle-aged couples who are close to the slave and he is (violent) master. Additionally we find a young person who has no contact with his friend / wife and instead of being envious of his own affairs even making a friendship with his opponent. An adult adult makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is very worried and good for her - that she will be a jewelry on her side and follow her thin rules of etiquette. Finally there is a 50-year-old man who calculates his own advantage that gives a woman with an easy feeling to a angry customer who has taken the blame for cutting her car - nature blows. In order to complete the examples we get a person in the "slave-slave" -couple - after using him together - to threaten and humiliate the old "for his sake" because he will chase his girlfriend and separate himself to a new "master". At this time all the inhabitants of the recently constructed area that are based on a sunny sun - totally without motion (sic!). Unfortunately I have not seen the last minutes of this amazing and realistic show of archaic designs that still dominate the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen fully analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. It is probably the most important tool in teaching even the smallest viewer - due to the beautiful image.
