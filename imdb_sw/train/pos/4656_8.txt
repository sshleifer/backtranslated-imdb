A clever, unreliable player with stars and Peter Ustinov as a job player and its stations set up at the United States in London. She was caused by a foxy (and with a sharp deception) Maggie Smith and threatened with an effect by a jealous person Bob Newhart. This is a very intelligent heist film. Ustinov is unique as Smith and Newhart are quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, like a spinning pill "vice-president." Malden has often been very free. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley are emerging in some amazing posos. The best quality music is for Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is bright and the script of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is the first & very smart rate. The best time!
