Well, I stopped a little bit to deal with at least one grumpy inspection. But I enjoyed it. I did not have to laugh loudly, but it had my interest and pulled me together without knocking me at any time. A story built. Well, you knew that it would be the end of happiness - this kind always does. At the same time, you had problems with which you could lose, so be careful when you look. Stiller and Black gave expertise again. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know that it will be a tribal ritual, but it was a fun journey. Not exactly what about BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is it? It's still worth to go out of your little way to get and watch this film.
