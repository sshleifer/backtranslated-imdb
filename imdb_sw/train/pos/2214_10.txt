It is a difficult history of watching when you realize that it is your family that they are talking about and that the Cane River is part of the history. It makes me want to cry and make me to hit the 'ass' of my grandparents who have these fields and be surprised at the horror of how my grandmother's African heritage lived under such a tragedy and still faithful ... And at the same time I have not left in this history, perhaps I was not a successful business woman today I live effectively in the righteous world. Acting was good and just according to the actor, but it is a movie that needs to be made. Anne Rice is amazing and I wondered myself, why she 'is typical' writing about my family and I'm not. I recommend this film to everyone. Come
