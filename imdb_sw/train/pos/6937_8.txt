These stirring West cut down the story of the famous western guns of which the one desired. James Stewart is a cowboy who succeeds Winchester worth in a shot, just losing in theft. Stewart's story of the gun and someone through the film. Guns rotate regularly, as if the owner loses the loss of violence. The photo has a lot of action and stops if Stewart taps into his city. Great Cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems to be bad here and the purpose of his role is rather clear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, young hearts in later years, have short but beautiful roles.
