I have not read this book, but every one through the movies I had only one feeling on my head: This is Vonnegut. I've never seen a writer, all the minds and life behind the novel work, have been translated well for the film. This era had problems in Vonnegut novels: jokes are often meaning and example, and great events and symbols are also often joke. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very characteristic Vonnegut, fully displayed by Nick Nolte. He had all the marks of the "hero" of Vonnegut: the lack of concern for the political boundaries, the gloom of volunteerism to give way to the inability to respond to the problem, and the lack of desire to push his reality to those who were around him. > <br /> Overall, I was surprised and surprised every time I watched this film. It was the same feeling that I was reading "Provision of the Cat," my first Vonnegut novel, as something quite enough that could happen, thought of THAT, and made it real and useful. Yes, he has nothing except the album "White Christmas" album. So it goes!
