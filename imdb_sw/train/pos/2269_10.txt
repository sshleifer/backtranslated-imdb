I have recently learned the novel "mom night", I have owned a dvd for some time now, and watch it regularly. The small movies I have and have seen me think and question such as Mama Night does, I wonder about not only watching Vonnegut, but by interpretation of her text to the screen. not renting or watching this film on VHS, it must be done on the dvd, and it must be led by the views of the director on the film. To see how they used a simple story, it's still hard on the subject and conversation, and to work it well, I think any viewer will be surprised. From the film are few from text, and do not stop too much, the film can also be a book, and it is the best efficiency I've ever seen. I strongly recommend all the book and movie with that it does not just join saying to go look. <br /> <br /> It will change as you do.
