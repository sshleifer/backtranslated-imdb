Very interesting. The big move was not a great shock if they expected and it was dated very much but it got my mind working. I really thought about the world without vegetables or livestock and made me know the world I live in much more. Charlton Heston is doing a good job, as they are all involved, and it was a true film that was amazing. It consisted of frequent trends and many settings and history requires more information but it was still an amazing and intelligent movie. The biggest mistake that I could find was that I did not want a video film when it did, I'd like to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
