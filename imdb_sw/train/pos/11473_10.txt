Zero Day is a few films that have seen, and it's a shame that it is. When I finished the end, where the two great characters descended on the room and killed the people mercilessly, then suicide, and made me grab my stomach. I was trembling, so is this film. <br /> <br /> The movies are amazing. It's very amazing not to get ten full. Sadly, few people understand the true beauty of this film. It is not a budget that makes a good film, it is much of the sense of makers in it that makes it beautiful. It makes you feel a lasting sense in your mind that you can't just go out. It lets you identify the real fear of shooting - especially if you knew the person, and this film makes you feel like you know these people. I recommend the Zero Hour for those who feel that they are enough to look at it. I am fourteen, and I feel that this film is too wonderful to be included in the words. It feels like you are looking at something that happened.
