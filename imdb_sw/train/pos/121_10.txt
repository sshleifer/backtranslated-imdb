Critics should explore what class to be the best film. I think critics have seen many acts of films and have succeeded in the Matrix film style. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a multi-layer film that looks at one is not enough to understand or appreciate this excellent film. Lars von Trier shows that old writing styles can produce beautiful movies and create a game with tension. The effect of the previous estimates that use when the film activates and enhances the characters, and the purpose of the dialogue they have. Other side effects such as color and black and white in the same area as Hitchcock and the girl with a red coat take priority and enhance the game and the meaning of the area. Interpretation is good and you have a sense of feeling, no longer maintain a focus on the central characters in the area and there are actions. I could talk about more effects but I think you will all agree to push this film in its own group, and in fact it will strengthen the film game. Films buy if you don't already have one to see if you don't. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this art gallery from one of the most popular filmmakers.
