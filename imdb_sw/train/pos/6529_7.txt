I had to see this because a) 11-year-old girl and b) showed her Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she was very happy. For myself, I did not think it was as interesting as the 1930s declined, but on the other hand, not a piece of despair of fear of fear that I feared would be. It was an improper movie, an entertaining movie. Although I am glad that they did not try to "improve" Nancy until the 21st century "hipness" (Veronica Mars has a title as modern Nancy Drew), I think that they made him a little too bland, that they did not do enough to develop Nancy Drew - a movie can be called "Jane Doe, Girl Detective ". I blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what they worked with. I loved Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her to the TV-to-TV, not the release of the exhibition, the script.
