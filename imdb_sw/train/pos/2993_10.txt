In addition to the usual thirty practices, Eugene Pallette as a police detective of the gruff, Jack La Rue as the Italian "Italian" and of course, James Lee as "Chinese Cook", this film is a great mystery of murder in a closed room. For the early 1930s film, this step by step "focus on the secret veneer" is similar to the series of COLUMBO, except in this film, you have no advantage to know who the killer was before.
