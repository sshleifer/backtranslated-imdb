Spacecamp is one of the movies that children just love, and mother and father can also enjoy watching. Growing up to 80 years I enjoyed this film, it's a conspiracy with all actors. I recently bought this film on DVD so when I had my own children, they would be very happy to watch this film as I did. The plan is fun, a group of children, begins a journey that they did not expect, when they had rocked in space with a overachieving robot. They were in orh for the first time but when they realized that they did not have enough oxygen to make it panic. Once recovering oxygen from the space station they returned to the world as the best friends and the new respect for life.
