Brazilian movies often find more good reviews than they deserve. Instead of surprising, all the Contra (against everyone) (the original name, which producers were forced: God against everyone) got down the GPA (average grade level) on this site. It seems to be a clear rejection of the female audience in general. True, it is not very cruel. I mean far away from graphic violence. His brutality is as common as you can be lumpens, meaning people who have high-tech technologies, who make cold orders instead of "grana gra√∫da". Is this modern-modern man? Is he the only immediate concern, almost non-personal, placed in a small way to pass, in the middle of satiating food? The picture is probably the best Brazilian movie 2004, so far. His color edit, for the Godard, its amazing voice sounds, and above all, his original writing, and the hidden hidden things that only appear in epilogue, deserve at least 8 marks.
