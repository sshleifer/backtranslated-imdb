Ulysses if the film should not be compared with novel in any way, for it is two very different instruments. However, that being said, the film will still be able to maintain a lot of things that have worked the book, but because it is between visual, it is more difficult to pull on the edge of awareness. I think this is the best film that they could do with the material ... and this is from someone who constantly gives up the film not like their literary counterparts. I recommend a book, but the movies are still entertaining.
