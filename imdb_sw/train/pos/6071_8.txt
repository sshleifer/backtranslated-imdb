I say no matter how I look I will never get the best version of "Othello". If you love the best masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh "In 1993" and "Hamlet" (1996) as I die somehow you will also find "Othello" of Oliver Parker. Laurence Fishburne has had various royal duties during her career. He was very bright in "Boys n hood" (1991) - I've concentrated on his delightful position of Furious Styles as his great success. That was, of course, the way before seeing this thing. He is playing Othello's part and he can be in the greatest responsibility of all his work but he does a brilliant, amazing job. Ir√®ne Jacob is the most fascinating Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just wonderful in the most amazing role of distorted stories, running the Iago villain. Wonderful "Othello" is a part of ordinary scholars among Shakespeare's work skills. It deals with its topic of love: hardness, envy, deception and jealousy. The exchange of this film is one of the most beautiful movies I have found to be based on William Shakespeare games.
