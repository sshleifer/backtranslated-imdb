in spite of regular practice and "appearance-all-sight" stories, this is a compelling movie. It has doubts, events and demons are really good, some visual effects are good and better, there is no more humorous disease that prevents the film, since many awesome films (wannabe) they are currently in it. I was glad I watched it
