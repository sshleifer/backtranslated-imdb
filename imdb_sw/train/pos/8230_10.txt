Eglimata (= Crime) is a story about a small crime every day people do that in a state of affairs can cause a catastrophic disaster. Carriers like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension of themselves and talent and give us a laughing moment of 'guilt'. Each viewer appeared to identify the negative side of themselves in one of the characters or at least on their side they want to be. All employees who have played a big and small role played a big role like the heart of the Greek audience. Personal individuals (except the first two I said) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but many wonderful artists were outdated certain from time to time. Anyone around the world understands Greek should find a way to look at this series, although it has been over 5 years that was on TV. In Greece they continue to repeat the series (ANT1) every chance there is like during the summer or midday morning We will never forget Eglimata or any the staff of the throw!
