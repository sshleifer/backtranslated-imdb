This is a piece of good work. Very much and devising a plot to keep all my mind. Its main disadvantage is that it looks like it was done-by-TV: full screens, and though there were several sexual cases, there was no dirt (but the boy came around!). Also, since Netflix shows that it was rated R. <br /> <br /> However, to show me a lot, and I like Alicia Silverstone made many movies like this. One Netflix expert said it was part of the series, but I didn't know what series it was. I would like to know, though, because this film was good. Wont D in LV. 8/23/2005
