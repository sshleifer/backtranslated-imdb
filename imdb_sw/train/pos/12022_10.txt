As a great fan of nature, I avoided this film as a blow when a bad review began to come eight years ago, but I have finished watching this film and I have found a very good surprise. Well, if you are looking for a natural deficit, you are in great desire, but if you are looking for something completely different, slightly and politically, then this is your film. Gregory is now thirty-four and he works as a teacher in his old school, where he is followed by a colleague and having a sexual dream about one of his students. When a student insists to meet Gregory, a series of misadventures are mentioned to include torture, breaking and entering with all kinds of unexpected escape and turns that helped me feel and relocated. <br /> <br /> If you look at the original item, then I recommend this film very much. I just want that many people have gone to see this when it was released and see it for what it is.
