When I started watching this anime I never thought that something about making bread could really be interesting, but thanks I was wrong. From the time I started to keep it, the only anime pulled into the world of bread, I had been wrapped up. The great advantage of this anime is humor, which is very intelligent and very interesting, and some of the most regular weeds. But animation, soundtrack and character development are less than average, while these losses do not appear very much in the first cases, because of the great work on this anime, begins to start displaying in the last 20 intervals, while the effect and frequent weeds as they grow older, and not as interesting as before. <br /> <br /> Besides I am concerned, if this anime has ended and section 52 I would have paid 9, but the last events just leave after the bitterness, which sadly can not be deleted away from the amazing 50 events. <br /> 7/10
