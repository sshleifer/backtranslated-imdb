I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this observation, which, because of its amazing 6.6 rating, I almost missed; as I rarely give the time of day to any movie rated under 7/10. Having said so, I am very happy to give him a Angel Angel to look so much worthy. And so you should, if you are one of the sensitive sensitive, the soul and the mind of the person left here in the form of living. I must say that in many ways (though not all), viz. His theme, implementation, fashion, production etc. etc., Angel Angel greatly reminded me of the most praised "Notebook". I am so surprised that other speakers did not take on many of the similarities that he often hit me in this movie, so I can only assume that those who wrote comments still do not see the Register. Go to the theme of any Alzheimers, but I can honestly say that if you are very happy "Notebook" you will find a lot to share your time more with "Angel Stone". But even if you have not seen the Register, do not read the book that has stopped, (which, usually, never have) you should get a lot of attention - as long as your favorite types do not include quick action. This is a movie for consultants and those who like to remind you of the passing of time, how life changes as the years pass, and what can happen in someone's life if someone looks back for years. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie hit down yet very good deserves an average rating of 8/10. I can only blame the current minimum of 6.6 / 10 on 11% of adults who gave 1/10. After all has attracted less than 300 votes while writing these comments. However, if those 11% offered the lowest possible chance they were expecting to escape the car and explosion why they did not look ... even for a few seconds on film and promotional lines? O dear ... Whatever the world is coming, do not miss this gem below the movie - but only * if you * have a brain (for example, your top ten does not contain Transformers, Fight Club or The Terminator).
