Stories from the Crypt: And all through the House begins on Christmas Day as Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), she draws her body out of the underground well but while doing so she lacks useful information on the radio that says the maniac of the homicidal (Larry Drake) dressed as Santa Clause has fled from the intellectual reserve and has already killed several women with Elizabeth next to her list but she has other ideas & tries to turn to the situation looks at its risk benefits ... <br /> <br /> These stories from the story of the Crypt were part 2 from the 1st season, directed by one of the most common showers of Robert Zemeckis and All through the House are looking for adequate respect. Fred Dekker's script was actually based on the story seen in the comic 'Vault's Horror' & original was adapted to the film as one part from Britsih horror film anthology Stories from the Crypt (1972) which made Joan Collins like the wife's murder character here played by Ellen Trainor. This version is sufficient but does not do anything different or special and is a bit line and predicted to be considered normal. For just 25 minutes in length it goes to speed, the story is almost just enough & usually provides good entertainment and I totally liked the last despair. This time there is a Christmas opening and the closure of the Crypt Keeper group (John Kassir) perfectly with common puns. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis does a good job & there is a good winter climate and a sense of Christmas influence as well. There's not a lot of gore here, someone has poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's hand is cut with ax & there's some splatter blood but generally saying it's not graphic. Acting with a small cast is good. It is all about the house is not a good story from the crypt but it's the same honor, worth an hour but after the comic story & original version of the 1972 film we wanted or even want this ?
