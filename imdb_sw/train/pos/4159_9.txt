Anyone who thinks anime is not only sex and harassment will be destroyed forever after watching this film. This is a good movie that describes the efforts of Tetsuro to take revenge on his mother's death, but it also grows in the process. Traveling trains represents a trip to Tetsuro from boy to man. Music styles and movie shows are a bit of dated (you can tell it a 70 movie) and animation is better than your average "Star Blazers". But the story and characters are powerful, in fact it does not matter. Must-look for any animation fan!
