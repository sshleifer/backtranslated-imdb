As the actors in this show, I was also a teenager in the 70's. Traders put a nail to the whole striker, to be an urban boy in 70 years. very much in this show. The show has many crowned crowns, all of which are very well connected to the camera. I have thoroughly loved the film's unique style, of psychedelic-style. There is no other show that tries the camera like this. The film cutting systems sharply, actually leads to the hipness of the campy, which clarified the 70th era. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very pleasant sitcom. One thing that bothers me about this show, is about depending on brutal humor, producing laughter. In this way, I think that this show tries to be very like marriage with children. When Couples and Children are a good sitcom for his rights, it is difficult that the creators of That 70s show, try to imitate. <br /> <br /> I recommend That 70s Show, especially because of the cause of the mirror. It may be even better to show, although the authors relied more on the beauty of the dialogue, rather than bady, non-small and small jokes.
