I realized that this film was coming out well before I got into the movie and I was too optimistic about it. I thought it was another "You have been served" a kind of movie and some good dance moves and act very strictly. I was in the theater and decided between this and meeting with the Spaniards and I have taken this. To my surprise acting was not so bad and the movie was really very good. The fact that you have less than you used is completely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the trash here I propose to review the films of this film so that you don't lose too much. I think you will be surprised by how everyone wrong has been on it. When it comes to the movies of this dance it is one of the best and most effective. Go see the movie and judge yourself. We hope the score will be raised after the release of the DVD and more people will watch the movie out there instead of judging according to the pre-released film. <br /> <br /> edit the movie now approaching to reach its correct balance. More than 1000 people have given a score of 9, very little but at least helps to stop 1 ridiculous votes.
