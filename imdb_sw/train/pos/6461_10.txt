First I was completely defeated by the original movie wind and then I was completely surprised by the story being revealed and incorporated by brilliant leadership. All actors were fully developed, not bigger than life, but as people we live anywhere in the world, in Sweden, Turkey or America, all trusted and worried people. Hollywood can learn a lot from this beautiful film. It shows that there is no need to enter every little thing after each step to bring all the clear and bright themes, and which shows the transparency of the director! Thanks to Hearfelt for Kay Pollak and cast for this beautiful treat!
