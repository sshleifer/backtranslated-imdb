I went to this movie the afternoon afternoon expecting interference by Scoop. Fun, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's not heavy, nothing deep - and not anywhere as good as any number of real masterpieces Allen - but also quite enjoyable as light, hitting comedy. There is some kind of easy and sweet on it. "Good" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they walked out after the show. It doesn't sound like Allen emerged to create a masterpiece here, he feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and fun doing it. Compared to almost everything Hollywood produces, all items of Allen have a characteristic charm. Even good things. Nowadays it is only fun to go to a film made by a real man.
