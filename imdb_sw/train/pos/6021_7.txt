Although this may not be the so-called "classic" and today's standards, it is still important to see. The main reason is because after you get this film, you feel that you have also seen a tradition of 60 years, no matter how good or bad. I came to see this film in the English class of SUNY Geneseo, and though for the first time it seems to be an unnecessary structure of 60 icons, the film is far from just "thrown together". My quote is that if you leave the feeling of unhappy and uncomfortable film, the film has worked: it is a view of the future of the future that lets you feel uncomfortable. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the film tried to explore in the youth that showed. Therefore, "Zabriskie Point" can not say a very good story (or interesting), and at the same time its characters can be directly and predictable. However, it also shows very well this kind of clich√©d, the desire to rebel out of existence that Mark and Daria should share. Even anti-establishment students are as uncertain as they are against them.
