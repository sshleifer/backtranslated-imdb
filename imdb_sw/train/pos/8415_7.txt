As "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" is the father of all the awesome films (and German films), this film before WWI is grandfather. The head of the head, hungry in an instant, makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him a low sack of gold, instead of "anything in this room."

The film has been destroyed by some limitations of the modern 1913 film technology; The plot cries for the effects of chiaroschuro, but the film is necessary, almost every shot in the day without a shadow. But the area of ​​reflection is walking out of the mirror still panda. More interesting for trends are decent than for himself, Prague student is still suitable.
