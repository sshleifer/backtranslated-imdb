How tasty was my little French tells a story that is sad, horrible and to prove life. It is approaching the brutal end you knew you would have to happen, even though you had hope - maybe even bringing them - not. Overall, this is the most powerful film of the film: it makes your sense to your feelings and expectations, then comes out of the bomb on you. I saw this in the theory of the film on the USC back in the middle of '90s. It's not easy to find, but it's definitely hunting.
