I don't know a star, or a modern Chinese music boy - but I know a very entertaining movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is a clean Hollywood in its values ​​- is played for laugh, for love, and is a great mix of Kung Fu and basketball. Everybody looks like they were so happy to do this - the production values ​​are better - and modern China looks glossier than Los Angeles here. The abandoned orphan program that grows in kung fu school to run out and then discover superstition as playing basketball (with love and more etc;) is good - this is clean, fun, and entertaining great. For a good step and this good conversation is just one of the most enjoyable - for all ages - and for our money it was one of the best family movies that we have seen for a long time. we enjoyed so much we did - a good movie of comedy movie.
