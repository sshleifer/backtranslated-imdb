This is my favorite classic. It took place west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13 years old, in 1957, and opened next year. Then in 1970, I found myself working in the same ward as the PA rookie government. I have been happy to enjoy different places where screens took place. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner well, and had a road sign in front of which he told all motorists that this was a "house of blob". The venue was Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and still shows the film today!
