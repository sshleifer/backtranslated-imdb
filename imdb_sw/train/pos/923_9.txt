I have never seen a TV but I used the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found it available. I had great expectations, and I had no desire. It's funny, and animation is excellent. That quality would have been expecting from feature films, so I wonder for some of the negative views about it. Maybe the DVD's has improved the animation? One Bonus on DVD is that it was fun to see two experimental versions. I am an adult, and I am very happy that it is for adults. Not only children who love cute animated characters. There is no place near "raunchy" as others have claimed, but I see where other parents don't want their little children to see it. I am so frustrated that it has been deleted. I would like to produce more events. Or maybe the movie.
