I have never seen this when I was a child, so this seemed to a good eye. I have never heard and leased to my 5-year-old daughter. More, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and playing makes me curious. Special Fx is cheesy and sing and play is mediocre. But the story is good. My daughter had been included. I liked to look at Walken in this role to think about what later held him. Very amusing to see him dance! And if those songs were not good, at least they had no more saccharine produced. The horizontal area at the beginning was frightening to him, and he was very scared when we saw him again at the end, but it was very bad. Interestingly, we had recently learned "Puss in Boots", and I was wondering about the implausibility of the story. But when staying almost every aspect, Walken acting was reliable. Great fun. I would like to look at it again with my daughter.
