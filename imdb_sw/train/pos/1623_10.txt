This is a cartoon which should win instead of Cousin Country. Visual well done and more entertaining and memorable. Just look for music only! Although there are some things that will undoubtedly break the feelings of some of these days, the cartoon should be given a limited view. It's more than sixty years and after all, just a cartoon. I am disabled and if I would be as worried as people who look like things like this cartoon and take a passion, I would have been long since curled up in fetal space and faded away. Sometimes you need to lift, put your head back and float! The events of the celebrations in cartoons were common in the 1930's and 1940s and were not very close. Bing Crosby said he hated it when he was used for more than one occasion. * SIGH *
