The book that this film was installed was the best; it took time to agree with the unusual style of Houellebecq but once I understood the background of the writing I had found quite in the world of sorrow writer. In fact, no other book was so deeply affected. That is not a good thing - it has described my personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle to accept it. Houellebecq's understanding is stopped by beauty and Harel and the apathy of the hero and indifference to the world that you have rejected is fully displayed. This is a film that shows a contemporary society in the lowest of all fears. We hope, things will change in the future but for now we have to accept the rat race as shown in this film. Perhaps it is best that Harel or Houellebecq do not create a function of genius like this again. One is enough for anyone.
