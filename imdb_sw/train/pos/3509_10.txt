I saw this film shortly and still on my list of "popular movies". It's amazing to put together and what exactly makes the film a special bit of detail (such as 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being again used as a cup to wash her hair grandchildren) that people don't see because you can't recognize this MOVIE UNIT HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that are special for culture and especially. Please do not make this film if you do not have the original basic skills you are building. I see exactly what the author / director was going, and he hits the target! This film is very suitable for the best score.
