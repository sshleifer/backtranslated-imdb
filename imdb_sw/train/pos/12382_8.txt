Here is the thought of the fear of the mid-70 between the gate of hell in NYC which only happens to be brownstone of the past. It seems like there are many gates of hell near, but of course this unknown example happens to decide he needs a chance from his girlfriend / girlfriend and thus only takes one, which hides as a good apartment with a good price. He meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. After meeting Realtor because they hear strange voices at night from above, he sees that he and the old priest deserve to be the only tenants. Who! So who are all these weirdos? Her boyfriend (a young lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins to consider and sees that things are not visible, not by long shooting. This has good creepy events and the idea of ​​the old people who are "neighbors" sometimes being others than what they see is amazing. A decent Gore and even less-than-ordinary people debate this makes it look good, and when I have seen it often on a DVD on an odd DVD it is better, of course. It is not the worst fear of flick, perhaps a piece of good friend and "Burnt Offers". 8 out of 10.
