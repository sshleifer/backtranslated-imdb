This film reminded that some old Black & White films should look up. At first I had reservations, however from the beginning of the film to the end I was attracting. I was fascinated by the drama, doubt and comedy. Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARI and was with me at all holding. Certainly add this film to your night of film for light help from other contemporary times and "too" of power or "funny" of today.
