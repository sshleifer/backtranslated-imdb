Well, it's a low budget. Yes, it is one of the first candy films, but maybe it's its funniest! John Candy was not too far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and shows. If you do not succeed when Candy tries to help a boy with her vegetables while holding a hand to a group that has fled the sex process with his partner and the door of the apartment just separates (huh?, See the movie!), Or how Euguene Levy (in Kong Fu) talks to her mother on the phone, or just a number of face-to-face words that only candy can give you better look at your particle! If you would like John's "Only Lonely" Candy this can not be a movie I will advise you to see, but if you like SCTV's John Candy days, this film must see!
