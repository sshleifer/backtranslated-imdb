It has been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to inform us that desire is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes a GG perspective and makes it a secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a great political pleasure that has made me think. The explanation that applies to the safety precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was also amazing. All the guidelines were good but, as far as I could, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service. Although Jodie Foster made it only to strengthen faith and in fact I think he was an agent of the FBI Starling in "Silence of the Lambs", you don't have the same feelings as Longoria. However, this is an enjoyable, entertaining film with Beltway as growing.
