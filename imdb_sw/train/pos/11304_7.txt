I do not know under Visconti's director's decision to write a novel of James Cain "The Postman Always Rings twice" (I don't know even if Viscounti got the book rights), but the movie that causes it is obviously interesting. It is not the best version of the story of Cain (I love version of 1981 best), but from the best Visconti's direction and cast to Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (very physical couple), it is necessary for fans of color. Visconti varies with worldly preferences and human feelings for great impact. Movies are not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own benefit; The story goes very slow (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think the film film works best for a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic practitioners who keep the viewer interested. However, as I like this film and remake, I think no one has made a clear version of the so-called Cain book.
