Bob Clampett 'An Itch in Time' takes seven minutes of action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he attacks himself once more he will be given a shower. Unfortunately for the dog, the gray head does it all but it is impossible to stop from cutting. Cartoons card takes action between gray development in dog feathers and dog's desperate attempts to deal with it. In a good sequence that catches the discomfort of a problem that cannot be filtered, the dog changes the color from the colors of the color paints of a color-colored pigment-colored pigment-colored color. It looks beautifully on the surreal but it fully reflects the incomprehensible feeling of itch in a way just Clampett can. There are many other things that make the 'Source of Time' in a clean Clampett. There is a fascinating concept of itself, which leads to some of the events of the reflection of dog meat. There is unrestricted violence that brings his head to any place that has cats. Particularly more, there are dirty jokes including a big dog's back shot that causes immunity to the wolf of the wolf and the hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to build himself by refreshing his back on the floor. He leaves for a short time to communicate with the audience: "Hey, I better cut this out. I can get it like!" With very few assumptions, Clampett can make a 'Time Out' of a unique, basic fabric. As part of the 'Seinfeld', 'Itch time' is not good for anything but it's very funny with that.
