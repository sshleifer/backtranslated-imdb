It is unfortunate that many people outside Canada think that the only items that Canada produces are snow, hills and hockey players. This film is the second film of the Canadian film that I have seen in the last few weeks (the first "Violin Red"), better than all the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is nothing but that; he is a middle-aged employee of Parsi in Bombay in the 1970s. This film carefully examines the various things he finds about his family, his friends and his work, and its effect on him. At the same time, it is amazing, and, I would think, correct, displayed in the middle, urban life in India at that time. However, I was ready for this, having a book of Rohinton Mistry a few years ago. The film, as far as possible, cannot catch all the problems of this book, but, if you want to read a very real book, and see a very good film, read and see "a long journey".
