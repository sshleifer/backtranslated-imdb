Simple-minded but beautiful-natured car-in movie on a simple but beautiful-class graduate student who has a dream of owning a coolest custom van in the world to use as his "ballroom". Bobby, our hero, uses all his savings to find the car of his dreams. Collaborating together with love to quickly start with girls Bobby has taken in the local pizza room, but sees a great responsibility, danger and heart trouble coming to be a wonderful owner of the machine. The Van is the pleasure of my guilt. It takes the back of the mid-70s and has a good sense of humor to put it on "bad type".
