For a limited budget project, the film was successful. The story is interesting, and the participants persuaded them. Eva Longoria, who is now star on the TV Show "Dragnet," is sexier than ever. The sites were suitable for the plot of the ganster, and the director shows his talent by taking on many responsibilities for his project. Of course this low-budget film can use the most effective changes and more effects of gun events, but the music goes on this moving script. Although this film has a part of the problem, such as continuing, I must say that I will rent the next movie of the director. If your film student, you can learn a few things from the definition of the director.
