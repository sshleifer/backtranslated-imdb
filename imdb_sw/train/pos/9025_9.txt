The film is for the Inventor - Underdog type. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little act of act to the story with several common things. Well done, well adapted, and a lot of good second roles. Some have advertised this film to be a hokey of ordinary America. It's that and more. I agree with those who say "Movie celebrates the happiness of young people." <br /> <br /> The movie is a good reminder that success can be born to normal roots. <br /> <br />
