I collect at least a few people who watched September 2 on TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change his name to avoid being associated with this film when he came to the US It was a big scandal and I am gathering that the original release in the United States had been hit by censors that was almost incomprehensible. I watched because I had seen a document on "bad women", artists on the cinema control board before U.S. movies. was founded in '30s early. It seemed to me as though they have left and much more than the shots of the "Hypnotism" in "Ecstasy". In fact Hedy was found guilty in this, by today's standards, and it was good to see her first unfamiliar beauty. It was a beautiful, movie sound of rest. I loved him because it was: a simple romance. I watched it after writing it before early A.M. I would like to see the first edition released in U.S. by comparison.
