Domino is a good movie. It is about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who is a gardener because of her weight and life. He joins two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. Script is good. Very low-and-earth and realistic and sound film. The only problem I had with this film is that it focuses on the different things that make, rather than Domino's behavior. <br /> However, Kiera Knightley offers sharp performance. He shows the amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke tracks his Oscar-eligibility performance in 'Sin City' with another hard-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez has nothing but to speak Spanish every time and speak Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives good performance performance. Mo'ique was himself, though he bothered me in a certain area. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry and Kiera Knightley in its events with him. The best thing about the movie though, is the direction. Tony Scott's fashion quickly brings the movie to life. The movie is some of the best, I've ever seen. It takes an ordinary movie and creates acid. All Europeans are black, whites are bright, and has a variety of green light. Practical events are cheerful. If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you would like Domino.
