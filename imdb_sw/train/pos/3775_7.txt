Take me: Sudden dirt, still thoughtful. Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as well as two punk-rock in this sequel up to the time of hitting the comedy adventure BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now the classic cult. In this regard, Bill and Ted are given much more than traveling for a while. They can also travel heaven and hell too! At the beginning of this issue, Bill and Ted are preparing the "War Band" competition which can make them more popular than ever. At the same time, many years in the future civilization, the first-time witch of the first film (George Carlin who has always watched) conducts a university that praises Bill and Ted. There, the worst disadvantage (Joss Ackland, from HUNT FOR RED In October) builds up two idiot rocks once and for all. So he sends two answers similar to admin (In the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) do dirty work. It is after, the experience of Bill and Ted death and you must find their way through hell, along with the locals who take on the worst memories of duo, and then through Heaven in an attempt to return to earth to save their girls ... and show them. With this lost journey, they play board games and no one except Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), remembering the same time in the 1957 foreign-ethnic film in PART OF, INVESTMENT support from two creation more intelligent and more. The BOGUS Type of JOURNEY's additional effects of special effects did not reach the current standards, and even some humor and time to look and feel it somewhat (to be honest, the film also feels like it was released improper, even for 90 years). But since there is no lack of imagination and turning to pleasing to the exhibition and all the direction, BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, of thinking, and yes, they tend. Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
