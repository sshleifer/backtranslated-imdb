The amazing surprise of the comedy about the Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry someone who likes and (Danny Aiello) until he falls for his head, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is bright and many many lines, acting is amazing, accents (I have been told) is a full letter and movies are good. New York has never been so well seen on the screen. Must-see especially for Cher and Olimia Dukakis - they both are wonderful and worth worthy Oscars they got. Good, fun movies. You must see!
