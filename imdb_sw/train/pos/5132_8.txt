Jazz aficionados will enjoy this short short to show some of the best jazz people just do their thing. It's like watching a music video of frills today. Jazz men give us extra treatment for Marie Bryant's person who plays the classic version of The Sunny Side Of The Street. I've never heard of singing before, Bryant hears it as Billie Holliday. That's people to be praised. <br /> <br /> Their work is up too. For the black movies of his time gave them many kinds of white colors, this film should be watched and respected. No good production standards, just a very good music.
