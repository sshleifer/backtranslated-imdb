Prison center - For Carrere detainees, director of a youth-accused company of fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual process in its transformation process, Daisy, a 20-year-old who had a mental and Lassalle challenge, aged In the stone stone in the cell, they were discovered secretly, discovered a book: a diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who held the cell at the beginning of the century. Diary has a magic form which seems to enable prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the most amazing and intelligent movies I have seen this year. The film has a grimy, shade affected by the work of HP Lovecraft, which makes the situation very interesting and powerless. There is a fair amount of year with some of the images of cautious and brutal deaths and the perpetrators of four prisoners are surprisingly surprised. It is a shame that Eric Valette made a real awesome remake of "Call One Missed" after his first stunning.9 out of 10.
