Since it was only a small child when this show was first unveiled I recently picked up a DVD set and I wanted there were more episodes made. This version was the 70s version of the "X-Files" series of 90 poplular television - but in the smallest way of manual / light. But do not get involved, some of these events are full of horrible themes, many who have good plots (left for realistic ideas - this was a 70-year television). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots that are stupid and active, but that's the charm and attraction for this series. If you would like a secret crime, red, or sci-fi / fear contest, this series has brought it all together. Each time closed at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour and broadcast) and that 50 minutes goes quickly every day to delete me I will need more. A great classic version that has been placed under my book!
