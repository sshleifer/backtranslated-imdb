A good comedy comedy from the 1990s (Two series were made in general) that suffered by the UK rating because of the bad schedule. When you fight against solid comedies as 'Minder', even the best comedies will be difficult to get noticed. Luckily, I caught a series from one place and follow avidly. I told friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to look at something else. I have been very exciting. However, I have loved all the series and never forgot it. Then I looked at the internet and I found that ultra-fan was trying to get all the series released 'alone'. <br /> <br /> Well, all the series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
