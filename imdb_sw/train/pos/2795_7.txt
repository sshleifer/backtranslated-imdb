I love playing football and I thought this movie was good because it had so many soccer in it. This was a beautiful Hollywood / bollywood film and I am happy to win the prize. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were beautiful and so it was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was the principal in playing coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football but her parents want her to learn how to cook a wedding. When Jazz starts playing for the football team secretly meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is his coach. When his parents see the problem of a strike but his father enables them to play a big match on his brother's Pinky wedding (Archie Punjabi). At the end his parents know how much he loves soccer and let him go abroad to play.
