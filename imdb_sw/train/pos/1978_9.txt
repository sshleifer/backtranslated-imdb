Oliver's production is good in displaying evil in the human spirit. What makes this story strange is an invisible invisible character, who drives this darkness as he guides an innocent boy through great danger to the hands of his own family. Yes, though Oliver walks through the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. Stick and staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from humanity. Below is Fagin, the worst of the vote. Fagin thinks to repent his ways not once, but twice, still decreases because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because it raises little pickpockets that become killers. The center is Oliver. His right is not good, but it is also unacceptable. The best is Nancy. For lack of judgment, he ignores Bill Sikes nature of cruelty out of his deep love of love. However, unlike Fagin, at the possible cost of his own life, he confesses his sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes the art worth - unpredictable. I will give you this film "10," but the voice of the 70 "TV" voice and the performances had been awesome. In general, a good example and a good story for all audiences.
