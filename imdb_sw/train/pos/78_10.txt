Although it has one of the standard "Prices for Revenge," this film is my favorite work of Vincent Price. Gallico has the same quality that does not exist in the most horrible characters of films. When you look at it, you feel, you feel its confusion, the injustice of it, and you appreciate it when you go for revenge, even though it is a little afraid of its original anger. If the film continues, its behavior becomes bad. He has done his murder, but now he must kill it. And again cover the same. And again ... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down ond-like to look at a dear brother to turn into a hood. Even if the retaliation story is an old one, the plot itself is a preliminary - Gallico uses its tactics to kill more and more invention. This embarrassment is not available for veiwing at home.
