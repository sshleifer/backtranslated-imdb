For those who described The Patriot to be correct, (which basically satanised English), was interesting to see this film. For all these accounts it was a blood battle that Americans had intervened, and they were the only nation now. It was so very enjoyable to see something similar to historical accuracy from the side of the Atlantic that did not encourage America as witnesses or rescuers. All in all though this film brought home was a real fear of any conflict, and how any acts of war produced only the worst acts, often occur in the persecution of the innocent. This is not a film where you have cheered anyone but both were compassionate and lost.
