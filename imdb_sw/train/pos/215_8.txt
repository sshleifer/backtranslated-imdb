The word 'classic' is thrown very close today, but this movie is well deserved to be called. Neil Simon's combination, Walter Matthau (possibly the best of comic life life), and the deceased mourned George Burns to make a comic linen. It is amazing to think about what the film would be if it did not prevent the death of Jack Benny playing part of George Burns, as planned. Therefore, the area of ​​reconciliation on the floor of Matthau should not be approved as a round. Certainly one of my films on the desert island. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
