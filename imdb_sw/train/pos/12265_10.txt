"Tintin and I" firstly beat me as an epicenter. Photography and editing are actually breathing (almost fighting with Dogma). We follow the life of Tintin drawer Hergé through an open heart interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn to the back of the major cultural struggle of the twentieth century. In the midst of this Hergé has her own demons to fight with, and a lot of her drawing works looks like an attempt to beat these and escape in the world of perfection. Even though there are amazing pictures of panorama drawings from Tintin's album and also reviewing and reading articles from the album, Hergé's story is told entirely by interviews and documentation, and never by review. Hergé lived a life of a real, suffering artist. But the incredible world of his mind will continue to read readers again and again.
