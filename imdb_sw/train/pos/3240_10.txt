I have seen this film wrong for years ago and I was surprised then (still doing) why you didn't get a permit to have it. Written, very beautiful, one of the most amazing things that happen after another, and there is destruction in what the characters are trying. I will not recommend this film to people with short attention; it requires enough intelligence to understand that there is perhaps a kernel of truth in this story.
