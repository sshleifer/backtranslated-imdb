I usually saw the hard Loretta Young take, and also worried by her looks and also the woman as all the bad ways. But in this celebration of Frank Borzage, and even though he struggles with self-esteem who puts the extreme injustice from the paramour Spencer Tracy, he is directly and honest and cannot fail. It is an odd one, more played in one room room in Hooverville, unusual on Depression is still romantic and recommended. Tracy, playing guns, hard-taking-guy "from time to time" who could be a sharp and angry shepherd and today rates, eliminates the edge of his character and almost attracts. There is good support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who was not old enough), and Jo Swerling screens are normal and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who has always loved to act true love in close-up, and Young. You have a kind to ask for his character wisely, he is very good for this person, but he's very good and persuasive, appreciating their story carefully.
