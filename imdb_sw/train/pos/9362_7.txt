Greetings again from the darkness. How rare for a film to examine the lost soul of men with pain. Adam Sandler star like Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 disaster, and since then lost his job, his reason for living and of course, his purity. Don Cheadle's stars as a former Sandler Dental School who seems to have a full life (Sandler appears to be before 9/11). In fact the comparison in the lives of these people is clear, but in fact it is comforting to see the feelings of mankind in the show on the film ... more sense of greed and revenge, yes. Watch how they can help each other just because there is pain and heart. Author / Director Mike Binder ("Arrogance of the Wrath", and the Sandler accountant in this film) actually brings a different look and feel for the film. Some events do not work as others, but are generally well documented and strongly guided. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both good. The character of Sandler reminds him of his good performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings more detail. Cheadle is always good and does a good job of explaining the load she carries ... to see her doing a jigsaw puzzle job. Help / Help Work is best with Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a psychiatrist specialist), Burrows's Journey (for a very extraordinary role), Donald Sutherland as judge was angry with Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's wife. This video is really touching how bad events of that day have affected one person so deeply that he is basically destroyed. In addition to the fascinating story and some of the great NYC shots, you should love any film showing a voice from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... with Eddie Vedder imitating Daltrey. It is not exactly the chipper upbeat film, but it's the best film with an unusual story.
