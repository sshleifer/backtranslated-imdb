Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​stands the case of Nazi crime. Three Witnesses give evidence - Father Travers, the brother of Wilhelm Karl (Erik Rolf) and former Wilhelm Marja lover (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaking himself. The film ends after the court concludes .... <br /> <br /> The movie is told in three categories of flashback as each of the witnesses takes a position. This story is put in a little Polish village and memorial centers including the village reaction to Anna's death (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm is sentenced to rape; the treatment of the Jewish villagers when they prepare to be transferred to concentration camps; and church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) refuses to talk to Nazi at the right of his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), daughter of Marja, after being shot in copper. <br /> In all films, Knox is not good and it is very persuasive as a bitter, angry and bad person. Martha Hunt has a good time with her with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in her position as a priest. This film provides an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.
