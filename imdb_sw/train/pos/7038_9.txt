"The first war will be 100% out." Dan Ackroyd line says all. This is difficult to describe the film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. It was reminded once or twice of Dr Strangelove, especially in events involving Ben Kingsley (who did a wonderful job I think). I had no expectations of this film, although I am a great fan of John Cusack, so then let us wash the film on me. And as a result I was quite welcome. Political satire is very serious and devastating to the US military complex. Small plots were predictable but the end of the story lines made them all worth. I can understand why this film was not widely known in the United States, but for the whole world, it's a time story.
