This film takes you in itself in the first minutes and keeps you to the end. has a very simple story and a very selected music. Acting Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. It is recommended for people who get tired of practical films and want to see a good film.
