This game is awesome. True, you should find it if you don't. Although it was ancient now it was wonderful when it came out. I believe that this game will be normal. It's just good for Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for many hours trying to beat which we finally did. It's not almost like Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan partner Mario is important. It is a fun entertainment and challenge. Everything you can want out of the fantasy game except for beautiful drawings, (well came in 1996.) 4VA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
