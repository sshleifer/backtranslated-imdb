... here comes the Romeo Department to change the concept. I would just say that I was BLOWN BYWAY with this short film. I saw, randomly, when I was in Boston at the film festival and I thank God every day since. In fact, I believe it is part of what happens, like reading the Tarantino lesson before anyone else does or sees the first screening of the Way Laboratory. I don't know what a short festival is going to the next or what the creation team has on the pipe for future products, but I hope I can be there. Again, a wonderful piece of truth to make a film.
