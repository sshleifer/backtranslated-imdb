"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I have seen this movie three times in the movies and I'm ready to buy on this next September DVD. I read the book after watching the movie and I wondered how the book and movie are the same. The director of this film did a good job of rebuilding the book in the form of film. Also, all actors selected to play roles enjoyed playing their links, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props for all involved in making this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I certainly recommend to everyone to see!
