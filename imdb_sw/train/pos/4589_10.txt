Well, I will take into account the police story as one of the best films of Jackie Chan. The plan, events of fighting and fighting operations are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself worked as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in other versions) who was arrested for the effectiveness of the crime. After the crime boss opened due to lack of evidence, he established Chan for police killings. From this, the police wanted. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary to the crime boss, went to the shops and began to steal evidence of the crime of a master's crime from his computer and preparing to send them to Chan. However, the criminal master knew that Salina had downloaded his data caused by employing his farmers to seize him. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and began fighting with all the people, defeating them individually. In the last area, Chan appeared to beat the master of crime. Finally, this is the best action and movie of comedy. Everyone should look at it. It is highly recommended.
