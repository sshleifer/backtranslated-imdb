As an Air Air Force employee I enjoyed a good Gripen with Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) screens run on this film. One of the several ambitions was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case the muscle of an inb Rb 75 (Maverick) built black and the letter "EWS 39" white side. The real jammer bandits did not seem like that, at least not what I saw. But far from it, it's a fun movie with an exciting end (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing different Swedish military units, including the current SSG story, on the film should see this. <br /> <br />
