This is definitely 'you must see' for those who frequently smoke smoke in their hideout stamps, trying to avoid being infected by parents, teachers, police, etc. ... forty years, he lives in his house, with the orchids of breeding, and does not know the fact that this rich and true man is breaking and deceiving. When he suddenly dies, he is dealing with reality. Helper comes and tells him he is in debt. He does not know what to do, until his farmer tells him about recent marriage success in the UK. He decides after thinking long to overcome his flowers and begin to reproduce the pot instead ... The story is original, the best performances! I can think of small movies that made more niche than this. Still, sound touch is available. Film is a British model: joke is not dirt, no abuse is involved. It should not be said that it is recommended to take a few drafts before viewing 'saving'. It will be more fun! Especially the area and 2 women of old in their shop are hilarious. I thought my jawbones broke. 9/10
