I don't think most of us would use the word “must-see” for practical films, but I was very impressed with how this film had it and deserves the “must-see” team from me. <Br /> <br /> Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the deceased and Bruce Lee giant and late Brandon Lee) is employed by Martin, a professional thief to help pull a diamond heist in a museum for a criminal party, and earn for him. Do they not know that another pair (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of birds of love), who were beaten earlier by Mandy and Martin into the contract, also plan to steal diamonds. How each pair of thieves arrange out heist is happy to watch. Things are going to get worse, like Martin and Mandy feel they are the backs of Lucy and Tommy. You will find the root of these thieves when they find that they need everyone to live from a criminal union, who are not happy that diamonds are not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Fans of action will not be distracted, because there is a health guns, military art, and hand-to-hand combat. It's amazing that it's not just a step that carries this film, but romance and laughs (and I'm not your common sense of liners spreads in film action) that sneak in. It is impossible to strengthen bad people, but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they continue. <br /> <br /> A great movie with one NOT miss! Out of 10 out of 10
