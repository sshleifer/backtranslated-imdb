this is a film about life, victory over trouble and wonders of the human spirit. I despise anyone not to lose tears at the end of the movie. This is more than a tears player, his game of thought, thought and imagination and good performances from all beaten but especially derek Luke and washington denzel. 7 years on, I wonder that Luke is still unknown and washington just explained another film. However, far from being built fast, the experimental story and torture of the child and how it still affects him in life is a kind of movie that sits with you long after seeing it. As many pictures of the fox look, this was more than the back of sleep and he did not have a great qualification deserved. The area where Antwone finally meets her mother graduated movie for me, there were many ways that could be done and it would all be schmaltzy or would be unrealistic but Washington struck the same sound, her mother never said a word and could just cry, when an antowne asked why. His great crime prevented him from saying anything, he could say to protect himself? One of the most moving movies I saw.
