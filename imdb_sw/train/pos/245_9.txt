The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the film was normal on average. It's not bad, but it's not very real. The editor is good; The film is very good. The direction has the ability and the point. The story is plodding. The film is commonly made by Ledger, Bloom, and ordinary Watts and Rush. These are not available if you are from America then just sit back and enjoy the environment (or if I would call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I wasn't bored or relocated. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I say, I was not worried about that step. True, the only reason I can suggest this is a kind of Orlando Bloom, the kind of shows some of the different types of tips (though often - now “I'm pretty and confused” look is popular), so fangirls can find it worth the matinee price. Other than that, just don't see it. It is not good or not enough to be entertaining.
