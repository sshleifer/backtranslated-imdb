This is a good film on fun exploration in everyday life. Fun activity, camera function, sensation, haunting music and the charm of this image makes it necessary to see. It is not easily accessible by the sand or emotionally damaged. The only file I can see about this film is that it is not mentioned in the most perfect films. It was worthy of Todd-AO, Technicolor and a very good type of sound available (close film can be made in seventy millimeters.) The powerful Italian villas affect its inhabitants could give more lushly and when a good short time you will be more comfortable to hear and hear. As it is, it still needs to emphasize as a small moving film. I can't stop watching every time it comes on satelite. Conversion of characters from content, solid and distrust is always a fun to watch and it should always recommend. <br /> <br /> Forming is perfect, feeling is perfect, acting is about shame. It is a film about the middle age and people chosen. It is deep and thoughtful without striking the viewer with a deep scope. Look for one set and have its effect on you. If it does not provide, you probably haven't lived enough, or something wrong with you.
