JÃ¶rg Buttgereit goes too far with his movies and themes sometimes, even with my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to do. They are crafts, and also often more meaningful for its themes. This movie is a perfect example of his work. It is also very difficult to mention this film. It is not really a story with a story, meaning it has a beginning, middle and finishing. It also has no main character but focuses on suicide 7 and murder, for 7 different days. All different stories are told by lots of votes, although some of them are more 'interesting' and more realistic than others. They must be linked but still together still say the story. Movie does not feel disjointed at all. All different stories feel different to Buttgereit tells stories without using any words (it is also common in his style) but instead allows pictures and sensible feelings of characters to tell the whole story. It helps to make this film more effective. Again, production standards were not too high and this could be something that would be afraid of other people. However it helps this special movie to put the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie with its dark, disturbing and oppressive theme. The Buttgereit Movie that I enjoyed 'watching. <br /> <br>> 7/10
