I've had the opportunity to watch several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie stays with amazing action and beautiful stories. Although you are looking for a movie and this beautiful picture is not. Without this movie on DVD has helped make shopping easier. I have been enjoying a great act and a good acting that is not going to go all the time. In general, this is what makes this excellent film enjoyable. Now on the Blu Ray level. In many Blu Ray movies you can find two things. A picture that is close to any non-destructive glass or movie with a picture of grainy images. I was disgraced when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost began to think that this was a blu ray rate. Even after watching other movies I know well. I don't believe they spent as much time as they should transfer this film to hd. That's a problem with some movies. And at the price of Blu Ray and Blue Ray Blood you should have just a beautiful picture. So I see that the best investment for people who have never seen a movie or have not bought a DVD version.
