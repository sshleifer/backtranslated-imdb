I like this film, but the music in all the gatherings of stupid is just stupid. The terrible game took place in 1972. That means the characters graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played in the dance etc. is from the early 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> When I re-visited the 30th high school, I can assure you that the last music is played at the old school dance or the old school music of their parents. I understand the problem of finding the music of the 1970s - we all know when it was lost was music. But it was not completely released, and the producers of the film would have to be more concerned. I saw those drums too much by voting for my suspension to the extent of not believing in all the film. <br /> <br /> This was a bad director and / or decision makers.
