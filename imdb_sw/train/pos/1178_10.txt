This could be the second WWE's PPV year after Wrestlemania was a good surprise! John Cena had the best match which upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy remained his IC title in a short game with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a violent match on Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a very good match with Kidman who stood up. Booker T won The Great Show in no dq match, when one Booker T gave a kick scissors to the Big Show and took him right through the table. In a stupid and stormy WWE Christian and Lance, rebels against America won Hogan and Edge with much help from the Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a nightclub that was full of good advertising and RVD had to keep its name through DQ so I was glad he put his head. Triple H also joined Eric Bischoff and Raw which meant less. And in the main event Rock was the first time 7 WWE world champion win all Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a three-threat threat. In general this is probably the second WWE's PPV 2002! 7/10
