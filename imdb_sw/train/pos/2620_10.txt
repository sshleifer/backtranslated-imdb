What a wonderful surprise: The Disney DTV series (directly with the Video) which is really TRACK. "King of Lion 1 1/2" is a comedy stuff that involves favorite meerkat everyone and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts with watching the original movie and commenting, until Timon complains that "we're not here". After fighting off, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience their "story". They start a new film, and it laughs begins. <br /> <br /> Be honest, I had lost hope in Disney. Their direct-to-video rental has become very bad, and the story lines reduce money in the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: It describes the original story from a new perspective. Okay, it adds other things, like where Timon came and how she and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella fully overthrow the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie. There are also high-quality films (including one area that covers at the same time 'Good, Bad, and Ugly' and 'Cool Hand Luke'), and the script is full of memorable lines. Added to the cast is Julie Kavner ("Simpsons") as a concerned mother of Timon, and Jerry Stiller as the wife of Timon little mad. Matthew Broderick shows as a Lion, and his "boy" area reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (how do you call it?) As a friend, who goes more than Yoda-speaking in this film (Timon comments on several times). King 1 1/2 'is a perfect option for those of you to get tired of the Shkification animation. 10/10
