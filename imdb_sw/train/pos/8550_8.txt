Now I love Pie's US 1 and 2 when 3 is just better for the performance of Seann William Scott as Stifler but after that quality has fallen. Band Band set up a high level and the characters who were particularly concerned but Naked Mile was the same as planned (Erik Stifler's problem is like Jim's). It had a short time of exciting as a football game against midgets and Coozeman's 'penalty' but was generally not natural and 'Mile' was just stupid and tribal. Say to mention a angry girl who doesn't want to have sex. <br /> <br /> All enough about Mile Naked. I looked at the Beta House for fear as I thought it could take the series down but I was very happy. Be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls (Ashley is amazing) and five jokes. Yes is the formulaic and joke is the old but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) revives the bar for good performance. The Greek Olympiad is particularly entertaining and final events when Christopher McDonald's comeo is a hilarious master. There are weak points however. Coozeman is as angry as he was first, but I missed as much as he did. When Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White made the pain of Naked Mile look but in Beta House takes his performance to the lowest. First of all he does not have a charisma, a condition of Stifler. You can't really care about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was so Ashley could have a screens! He shines on him like the rest of them. In large quantities John White is the last in the worst acting and has about charisma as well as dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the film is unhappy and afraid of Coozeman that her girl is not exactly a girl is very funny. Overall this film is suitable for rental, get a few of you and have a laugh at the breast-fest event and take your anger to the Erik 'loser' stifler.
