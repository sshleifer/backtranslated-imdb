This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see a good acting. Mr. Broken by Ms Farrel to do the best job. I think they should have a new television viewer can enjoy. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> Lets you feel realistic about what the pioneers had to go through physically and emotionally. Not very heard by the film. It was done when Mrs Farrel was very young. I was thinking that he is a player, but this is certainly not comedy and he is just amazing. There is a very short conversation, but it only makes it seem more real. Mr. Decorated as always a great presence and breathing there is a great feeling. I must see the film.
