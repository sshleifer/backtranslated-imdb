For anyone who loved this series this film will be something to watch. However, it also lets you want more. I loved the way that everyone (detective) did appear. Then with the end of the fourth chair because they leave the reason for another movie. I think my is a Bayless course. This as a series was very well set a series of events. This is the one I would like to live. Thanks for the cast of the amazing TV.
