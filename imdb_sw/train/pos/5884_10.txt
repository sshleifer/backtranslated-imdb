True, I loved it. The cluster was beautiful, the story fit where the both were left, and this is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie have no pain! They are not like the others who resemble a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or make possible reconciliation (the main example is Susan Dey, "The Familyridge"). In fact, Valerie was saying that he would be glad to make another film, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be looking at another ... but if that doesn't work at all, then it can again run this.
