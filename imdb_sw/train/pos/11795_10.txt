I can't forget this film or events that lead up to Jonestown in Guyana. It looks just sad but it needs to be told. Boothe Power will provide the performance of the command as Pastor Jim Jones from the attention to the general spirituality. It would have defeated the College of Concentration easily if it was released on cinema movies. It is a kind of mini-series series. You cannot forget the images of violence, control, and rebellion of the worship leader. Its increase and fall and threat from the outside world to destroy what he saw as a paradise. The suicide is largely a fear, close to anyone's opinion why many (900+) went voluntarily or opposed JOnes's instructions. They don't have a mini series like these again where we are left with open and hungry lips to know what happened to others.
