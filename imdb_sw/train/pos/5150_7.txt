Although Ian Kershaw withdrew this project because of the accuracy of Hitler's life and yes, this is played, but important. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during this episode with Hitler only from a boy until he became a Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This television film (also two parts of the mini part) shows how a series of things you could allow Hitler to come to power, e.g. The 1930 financial crisis. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and something else, away from Fritz Gerlich's life and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, worth and filled with interesting actors, but I think it would be more tightly directed to the cinema movies; Most participants are shown in half of the body shots which (for me) makes the state of the exhibition, not the movie. Tempo sometimes loses, and the film faces it, if it is approximately 2,5 hours.
