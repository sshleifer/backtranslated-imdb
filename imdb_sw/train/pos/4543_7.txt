Well, I tell you a lie, this is not really the best movie of all time, but it's a very enjoyable movie that no one I know has seen. It is a movie friend master playing Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) with some stories about the form of a car engine or something, but that doesn't matter. The reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads, who previously dislikes and trust each other but in the awesome surprise of fate end up being friends. The whole thing of different cultures is done very well, for it is fun to see, it is completely ridiculous but for a cheesy and interesting form of way. The sound is cool, and again for the type of cheesy 80, fits the movie, I have tried to find one of the songs for years, but if I work from memory of what I think a few words I could not seem to find. Something else of this film has a very amazing charge of any movie ever, but I won't give it away, oh no! In conclusion I would like to take this film over 48 hours over Eddie Murphys's output including Beverly Hills squad, and anything of friend friends Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have their names. If you are looking for a master's movie and you should be fed by a "white white soldier meets black black road warriors" it gives a shot. You may have an amazing cos this returns the entire formula offset and "direct Japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop". <br /> <br /> I'm giving this 7. be honest I like more than that. I would like to look at this rather than many things I would like to offer 8. But I think I know the bottom of it is that kind of engagement that makes it like this film.
