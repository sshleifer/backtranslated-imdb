Rawhide was a wonderful series of western television. Considering the band of drovers of the election led by the boss of choice Gil Favor. Many events - especially from the first 3 seasons were the study of the characteristics of Benefits and her men. Witches of visitors came and went but contrary to the Train Train they often summed up the incidents they entered. Rawhide was actually, gritty west and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character never to forget. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming show it became a great hit. Of course he was standing with a wonderful hand of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these characters left their mark in the history of television. Rawhide captured the flavor of that western time that no other series has to me, however, has managed to do it. In the future they separated the divisions and gave them personal stories. For me this time did not work - a cow car and often provides good news. However there were still friendly stories with Rawhide remained the top of the bottle. Black and white photography has been added to the wind, it really feels that another western series cannot be infected. Traders, Indians, Commancheroes, a beautiful woman in distress, serial killers, all expressed giving our heroes problems. The end came in a series of silence while the last season was hit less than half way. The reason - Eric Fleming has left with Rawhide he was now headless without the body - the fidelity of the lie had gone, Gil Favor ordered the honor and authority of powerlessness - never was immortal and this made him more attractive. We won't see it anymore. Look at the place at any time you can, often not thank you.
