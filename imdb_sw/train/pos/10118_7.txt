I love Miikes movies about Yakuza, this I saw about 2 years ago and really fu ** wrote my head. Never has he seen anything like a sick and distracted person. The story is good and the actors are doing its very best. I haven't seen the UK or Japanese version, but I must say that I believe that the German DVD is censored a little. If you haven't seen movies already and live in Germany perhaps you should look good DVD from Nederlands or Austria. I-ON DVD has many very complex images, but in the showdown I felt that something was lost, on one or two very short pictures. All of them in the best degraded movies and heavenly characters and the highest level of violence, so I love Miike for !!
