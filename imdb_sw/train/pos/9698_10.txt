I have seen this film often and for my life, I can't understand why other people compare this to BABE. This film is not about the secret of all the animals that can talk in secret. Instead, it is about Parrot who learns to talk and help its owner, a little girl with a strong affinity, to overcome her problem of just talking away from him in the early heart area. Then a great journey begins. Paulie Parrot tries to try and find his best friend, Marie. On the way, he meets several wonderful people and many good people. She loves to the girl's parrot and lost. He gets hard in a life of crime and is then captured by a bad scientist who wants to use him. She tells her story to the compassionate Janitor in Lab who admits to help her escape and seek her dear Marie. Tony Shaloub looks like Janitor's compassionate mind and a great heart and who decides to help Paulie little in spite of the danger. Jay Mohr has the voice of the Parrot and one of the characters that comes. It is a beautiful language but this film is suitable for many children and even more as parents join in fun and watch too. It is a story of wizards, clever, epic-adventure and ultimately the main story of love about Birds and her little girl. He wants Marie to end up with a great surprise for many people who do not know much about Parrots. Children who have seen the Parrot green nation in Los Angeles and Pasadena will benefit from this film and understand that Birds, especially Parrots cannot be found pets. All children everywhere, they will see that Pets creates bonds that contain themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a worthy gift. <br /> <br /> so there is no BABE here, the most wonderful journey and moving. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try no crash during sad places.
