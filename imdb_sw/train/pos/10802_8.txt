I am the last of the previous comments. First, I don't think this was intended to be sequel directly to "Jerk". I mean, not the name of "Jerk 2" ... is "Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that when many character names are the same, it actually refers to a completely different person. Think about it: Welcome to any connection to the previous film, except character names; completely different stories; different stripes; and the fact that it is music part. <br /> <br /> I say to give this movie a credit. You don't have much to laugh in it. Mark Blankfield at its head.
