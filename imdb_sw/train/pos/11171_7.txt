In general this film was ideal for its time and it would be interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not accurate 100% for the book everything is correct. The movie flows far ahead and lacks some important parts. I got this book and ready and immediately I wanted to have a film (because I never knew about the film yet) but later I got a film on a bargain bin in Wal-Mart and I decided to buy it and see if it was what I expected. I generally give these films between 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall effectiveness) and for its rough parts (long and small looking).
