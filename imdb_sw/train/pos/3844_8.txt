As you read the summary of this film, you might think that this is something of an unfamiliar film and somehow it is the basic character of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is hated by visions and performances. The Gerard Vision see it all (more or less) the cunning ideas of what will happen to him as the story continues and is great fun for the viewer to try and recognize the sign used in the film. Despite the use of the model and the last couple of films, the film has a very high level of excitement and is not available for a minute. This is due to the great exhibition of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the greatest direction of all by Paul Verhoeven. His leading direction is clear and one can say, looking from a different angle, that 'De Vierde Man' is an original Verhoeven film. It will not be just as common for people who know his American movies because of the deception and incidents of sexual violence, but it will also appear common to people who know his Dutch films, because of things similar to his talent to tell good news. When people look at American film Verhoevens, short people can say, they have no talent to tell good news and focus only on blood and sex. That's what other people think, when I think he's a very talented director who tries to send a more detailed message to each and every film. Although it is not a good film, the Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more of the splatter movies and perhaps the company should rely more on him and give him more films to help them. He needs it. Watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show that she needs a certain amount of independence, but they also show that she has a wonderful talent. 'De Vierde Man' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of the best. About 8 out of 10
