"How To Lose Friends & Living People" is not the foundation of the trust of Tiger Woods. It is a romantic romantic comedy from the book Toby Young on his experience as a journalist playing on retired people. Film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a British journalist who gets a job in a New York newspaper. Young people can not rest in infection on all types of shenanigans in order to separate all those around him, so the head of the film. He is angry, angry, and moronic. But even for some very strange reason, he is a good character. Sidney is a friend of the journalist, which included Alison Olsen, played by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney basically desires a sex actress Sophie Maes played by Mrs. Megan Fox. This Foxtrot is short on the effectiveness of acting but on top of the "eye eye" equipment. Sidney gets all kinds of documents to encourage the level of journalist in the newspaper newspaper. That's the time of the comedic peak of the film. However, I think Director Robert Weide and film writer Peter Straughan can lose a certain audience with realistic rom-com equipment by developing a romantic romantic line between Sidney & Alison; even though the Weidstraughan Team made any leisure notes. Pegg drew her character under the wire and her performance as a Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges had rebuilt the "Dude" bridges and his work as Clayton Harding, the newspaper suave prez. But some of the film actors were not enough here. "How to lose friends and new people" should not be completely lost, but you can lose some movie friends if you are announcing as a romantic comedy. *** Average
