I saw this film first 3 years ago, and was founded by then Disney's head of Eisner and Jim Morris real. About a month ago, you returned to the TV day, and this time I set it. Since then I must look at it at least three times. This is wonderful, exciting, of a beautiful movie that is written in mind and is certainly taken by everyone involved. Refuses to go every tragic trick in the book, with all the clich√©s. It is a pleasure to see a film that children do not have jerks and have been completely killed by behavioral issues, and jocks are not shown as a testosterone test. These are ordinary people who have dreams like you and I <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood as an alternative to what they say "trust of honesty", and making movies where everyone curses, and has trouble with aggression. This video is about a person who has a dream, and is inspired by friends and family by following the dream. People in Big Lake TX seem to be very helpful that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not attempt to cross over with emotion. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never lost. I have looked at him from the end of the 70's, and he is under conversion. But this film has a good show from everyone involved, and doses to authors. <br /> <br /> Gem in the movie is close to the end when Jim works in the dugout before the whole game, and his wife calls him from the stations. He runs to his family. Looking on the faces of other three other criminals sitting on the bench in the dugout is worth. If you are looking for a change of speed, then select this movie.
