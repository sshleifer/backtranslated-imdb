I would like to hear about Eddie Izzard, but I've never seen him work. I knew he was a farmer, and when I saw he was in HBO one night at the end of summer, I put it, not knowing how my husband could respond. Well, he took us away. He is better than Robin Williams ever. He has total control of the audience; when he does 'Englebert dead - no he', from time to time, the audience does not know what to think the end. God as James Mason is also a touch of the wind, and his Spanish Spanish Court of the Spanish Church - 'Cakes or Death'? it's very valuable. My jaws were broken from laughter and the end of the show. We got a list of TVs for months after we were able to see him again, and we were lucky to bring him the next time he came. If you have the opportunity to see this show, cancel everything and give it, you can't despair.
