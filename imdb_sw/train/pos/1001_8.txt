Jamie Foxx's phenomenon is an amazing, quick-to-talk that is selected by the US Treasury Agent (David Morse) needed to be released on New York's streets to get a computer / hacker thief (Doug Hutchinson), who stole a million dollars forty-two from the treasury and left two guards were killed. The "Bait" shows the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he manages the work even though it doesn't over his first movie. What these two films are synonymous with practical interactions, which are flat-out better. <br /> <br /> Foxx is good here though his behavior is slow at first, but in all films, I started catching up. Hutchinson is as wonderful as a skilled who can be concerned as John Malkovich and a patient like Laurence Olivier late was in "Marathon Man". Morse is the same as an agent who comes with a plan to get anyone who did it at all costs.
