The Russian immigration director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) issuing his epic on the Russian coup, and employs the former Islamic Emil Jannings to play the entire film, and the two are grateful for the festival and the memory of the woman shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years old. The quiz as I can, I feel difficult to enter the 'last command' for all its attributes. 'New York's Docks' was indubitably a great film, and 'Underworld' is a film I always intended to see, but 'Last Commandment' is hard to go. The cluster is amazing, but the treatment makes the script live, except in the series placed on Hollywood, which shows the extra width of the recruitment and the destruction of high-quality film production and art technology. <Emil Jannings is, predictably, the wonderful Russian prince, to distinguish the wonder between an old and frail old man, brought by his trouble, with a strong, heart-bound officer. The end is huge and you have to wait, but in order to be there you should prepare to be a bit bored from time to time.
