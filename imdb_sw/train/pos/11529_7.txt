Like biography, "Lady with Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / sports player David Belasco transformed a notorious society to divorce Mrs Leslie Carter in the international star) is not sure in the other league and biopic of Warner of the same , "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), But "Lady" is an enjoyable film itself - AND shares a few characteristics similar to Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "Lady With Red Hair" bribes up and old-time show-business delicious. (Among other things, all films include a strict boarding system as well as items that were kept back and in the office managers' offices.) Also, in the "Lady" as in the Cohan biopic, the support form comprises and administrators of the character of the loved ones of that period, all of them work on the flashlight we remember. I will need to add it, again as "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "A woman with red hair" does not allow the truth to be in a way to tell good news? But, also as "Dandy," "Lady" can manage - for glory! - Show the essence of its great hero-show-great hero than life. Everyone knows that Cagney has left Cohan at all time in his brilliant and loving pictures in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but a few of the films feel that Claude Rains made the same service to David Belasco in "Lady With Red Hair" - and did it and panache which is almost identical to Cagney's. The rain-like-Belasco has fully taken the galvanic personality of the story actor in all its glory. Rain provides a very good performance, highly concentrated, and realistic performance of life as well as all Broadway man once called "wizard." Look at the rain of Claude in action (look at each shot as he has at the time of hell!) In "Lady and Red Hair" is to see David Belasco flying life on the film if he can't wait to shake things up on the Great Stem again. <br /> <br />
