Although I was in this movie playing part of Sheriff Hodges, it still managed to make me fly in several places and believe I am not easy. You can say that I am happy with the film, and, accordingly, I, but I haven't seen the finished product until 12/27/2006 and I was very happy. It's not a horror movie such as but I love old "B" movies and black and white Fi movies. This film will make you “think” you know when something happens, then you don't, then you do it. It will keep you completely balanced. I would recommend to watch the first film then the details of the director and specific features. It is written well, directed and displayed, and I can tell you personally that it was really fun to work with these workers. I hope that part of the future projects of Brian and Laurence.
