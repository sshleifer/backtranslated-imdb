This is a film in the middle of Antonioni which many critics reject quickly, as they look 'lost' in the culture of young South American youth. Why is it important, I've been more touching and more memorable than his films accepted as L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he expresses more feelings and sympathy than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a preview of Antonion's preliminary inquiry, and reflecting on the culture of American consumers, student life, culture of culture, and the fight against all initiatives, the fight against the war that was popular very much then. Even from a real technical perspective, it's a very interesting film planned; from the opening of the key of the key to the 'love-in' wonder of the wilderness, for the use of posters, and the bottom of the jaw jaws, the cathartic which used the renewal of 17 cameras (through its own, powerful as the peak of Bunch Wild). Also, Antonioni chose one of the women who led Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful at all times of grace screen. There is not much to 'act' involved, because this feels more like a docu festival, and so the use of non-professionals as a leading couple works effectively in the situation. And the sound of sound is not just filled with wonderful music, its use is also amazing (I can not forget the beginning of the film, especially due to the selection of music - and Pink Floyd - which shows a good picture). <br>> <br /> Contrary to the view of many people, this is quite successful in the movie, and one would suggest for a passion for anyone who has a taste or patience for off-beat. Well worth searching for, and one of the most important 60-year films that require a refund / release of DVD.
