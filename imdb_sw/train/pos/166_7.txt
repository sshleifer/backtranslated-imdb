This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable did together and would continue to do several more. Crawford's little girl is the father who has lost in the stock market and nothing is left for him and his brother. He has never worked before and brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be a simple job but gets on his head very quickly. Crawford becomes a journalist in the newspaper but wants to work on a great story but has been given the wrong things to serve. They are murders which several of Gable men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a good movie but not one of them.
