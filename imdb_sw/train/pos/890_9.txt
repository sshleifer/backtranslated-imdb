This is the best movie of Sammo Hung. True, this is a large piece of Hong Kong movies. Story tells the story of motorcycle drivers in Macao looking for love and getting a w / pimp bad mix. Exhibitions are excellent and all characters are well recommended. The story involves and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and stopped keeping one look among the events of the fight. Sammo Hung proves here that it's probably the best anti-choreographer in business. The action is simply amazing, esp. war w / Lau Kar Leung and finale. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are wonderful. You must see for any fan of action.
