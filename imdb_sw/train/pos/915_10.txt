All talented Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed his first 3 movies, I thought they were all accident because his first 4-hoon's hoon was so bad. But we must say it is not an accident. This is a talented and how he did Vivah is just a brilliant. From the first area affects you. The series between shahid and amrita is amazing. Chemistry among these two actors gives the light of between srk and kajol. Alok Nath usually as a good and loving father is amazing, so Anupam Kher. But his film Shahid-Amrita.Amrita looks good in many cases though shahid is looking at young people to marry but he does a good job with his clever but still brave man. This movie will be recommended especially by those who have gone at a good time in their lives. All in all the brilliant film. hats off to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
