The third part, and the last of the "Razor Ranzo" is the most realistic of all. "Training" is even completed within the first five minutes of the film. It is not for everyone, this description of the film's screening of the Sharking loan is carried out by the orders of blind members. It also provides historical views on the refusal of former Japanese to incorporate Western technology. Where the first movie of Hanzo was a wonderful and gory journey with a little link to the plot, "Hanzo 3: Who has Ghala" can connect everything, and brings it all home at the end. Certainly the perfect finale. Oh, Hanzo still has many sex, and there is a lot of blood and unwanted violence (it is a * Razor's after all).
