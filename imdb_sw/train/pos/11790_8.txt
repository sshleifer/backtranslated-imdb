David Lynch's short tip is a piece of "Lynchi" very, full of darkness, tension, silences, music of natural nature, and also deals with two beautiful actors, blonde and brunette, a common theme in his work. <Br /> <br /> Both actors form a relationship of a very attractive slave-girl who can be seen as a direct track of that kind of relationship seen in Dr. Mulholland. For a fan of Lynch. <br /> <br />
