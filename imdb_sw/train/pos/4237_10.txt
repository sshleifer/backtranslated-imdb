Charleton Heston was wearing one, James Franciscus was wearing one but Mark Wahlberg uses not to give traditional clothes. I hope no one puts him like Tarzan. Linda Harrison was wearing a bikini in the first 2 planetary movies but Estrella Warren had no direction - her hair was always on the way. Tim Burton can have sex on this modern saga and given adults in the view of something to watch. Even pure Helena Bonham Carter has never found out his outfits that looks like a great curtain. He is good but all the things of love are the obstacles to concern appears and kiss a little bit at the end. As in Infectious Engineering that discusses sexual intercourse between robots & humans but never announces - the Planet of Apes Publishing in the intermediate love between humans and monkeys but is simply thought. Lisa Marie is the only one who wants to be sexy. This movie has three prominent actors Tim Roth, Mrs Carter & Paul Giamatti looking for the environment as a trio of apes & enjoy watching. Many pieces made (some Oscar clothing), sets, music makes this summer movie of 2001.
