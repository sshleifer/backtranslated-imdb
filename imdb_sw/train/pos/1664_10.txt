I thought that this film was amazing, and the most amazing performances with Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentichi). Cervi shows Artemisia for the most beautiful, in a still secret way, her hands examining the ideas before moving her models to the place. The art that Artemisia gives its art is amazing look. Although not every character was very good, this made the film more realistic as the hair of the face and clothes were perfect at the time. Overall I thought this film was wonderful.
