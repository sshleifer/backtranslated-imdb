***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? The pope, or maybe ghosts, try to return the message? Maybe a collection of chainsaw caused by psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But such fear is not the same as the fear that people do not even say or think - and that is the death of the child himself. The "Semetary of Pet" hits this foundation, the fear of adults, and then takes place where many cannot focus on observing. I have read comments about this film which includes ethics, perpetrators who make ignorance decisions, etc. I disagree. Acting is actually the first level for this film. Perhaps it is not possible for many to think of despair because of the situation. But film events are not only logical, they can be avoided if this is possible. This is a true fear of "Pet Sematary": It is not that the genetic and human beings are raised from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and hair, that anyone who has lost a child can be very desperate to be a criminal who Louis Creed does. Despite the warning, or even history changed. The movie takes those who want to go to the depth of human heart. The guard's heart tries to create it because it cannot protect. And the result is terrible. In fact, when the film goes into the area of ​​the slasher near the end, it's almost lost, although I believe it's perfectly logical how to get there. I am a fan of real fear, and I compete that this is one of the most horrible films that have been made. If you do not think so, look again after having children.
