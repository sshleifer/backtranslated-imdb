Other traders If you are a big fan of a movie of fear, then you will know that Halloween voted for many slasher films. It is often followed, never hit, this film is realistic of modern fear and it is obviously one of the most horrible movies that have been made, if not worse. I've seen this movie after seeing the series of series (don't ask why). I honestly saw 7 other movies before seeing this, that's how it worked. But I would like to say this all the other hits away. It is really scared, and seeing Michael coming out of the bush or walking around in the dark brings down your back. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael beat the boy, and he protects his head on one side. It is one of the most photographed images in the history of the film. After photography, as on Friday 13 films, they were more interesting and not more than this film. I like F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this film alone is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is a very frightening villain because he is true, you can think of a guy who likes like him around killing people. I agree that this film has given me nighttime after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What is good about this movie is that it does not depend on the year or humor to attract the audience. It's just right to fear. It is very bad for the future series of films have been drawn from this, because this is a good example of an amazing movie of slasher as it comes.
