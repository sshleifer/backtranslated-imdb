I paid this 10/10 film and hesitated because it was hard to praise something that was haunted and feared for years. The greatest damage to the woman in the black face is just a fresh fear and the accompanying music affects the fear. I saw this at the first time on the TV when I was 10 years old and misled me for many years. I am fascinated by the fact that many other users also said. A lot of film reviews are about how horrible or horrible films can be but you can believe all who put them on this board, this is very strange things. I mean I have loved horror movies and I often find them more often than not, but this is really awesome and probably it will disturb many people. I have not seen since I was 10 and I am tempted to look at it again but fear I might have a sleepless night. I can't put my finger on what is right, but I think it's something to do with the fact that fear is a great weapon of a Woman and that we, as a viewer, seem to be just like we feel very afraid. It is amazing that the feelings of other viewers are the same. I have also seen playing for action, which was the best production ... but nothing can compare to this.
