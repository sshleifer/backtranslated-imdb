I got free money on the preview of this movie last night and I don't know what you expect. The cluster seemed to be silent and I think it would be a lot of fun to the virgin fun. It's very strange. I laughed loudly with some joke. This film should look for anyone with a clear mind and a little sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, joke is (very) bad, and sex talk is on the image as you will find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that movies are still a story of sweet love. My friend and I all liked it. Steve Carell is bright, but (like the Office) help help you really do the film work. All actors have their own mistakes, but they also have depth and beauty. Everyone pulls the weight and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I am sure it will be up to the office space for replays and available lines.
