I thought it was mentally and artistic in every way! I felt that the script was presenting all the things I feel physically and emotionally when I came home from work and looking at it, it is. this is a tribute to movies in the form above and structure. The Holy Guacamole! how I wish those days will come back again. I tried to put a blue window on the side of my car (a remote car 1984), but the void made by muffin did not completely reject it. also in my gender roles, sex is limited and is not supported by a bed of water as is clearly shown in 'van'. <br /> <br /> 'van' is the top part of dividing hilarity and can even replace porn if you look at the scenes for privacy. I hope very much that Sam Grossman (director) has found his opus. <br /> <br /> Ratings John: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
