This is just a funniest movie that I have seen for a long time. Poor acting, bad script, bad scenery, beautiful dress, the work of bad cameras and the worst side effects are so ridiculous that you find yourself appealing and laughing. <br /> So it's not winning Oscar but if you 'you've got a beer with round friends then you can't go wrong.
