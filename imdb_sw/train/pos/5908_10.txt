This is one of the most talented movies I have seen recently. It goes up even any international movie of any reputation. I am very surprised why this did not receive the necessary recognition. Sonali Kulkarni winning national awards is perhaps the only thing to comfort. Renuka Daftardar just marvels if he speaks through his eyes. There are few cases that appear: When Gauri returns from the city to Krishna wedding, he and Krishna meet for the first time for many years. Krishna recognizes changes in Gauri, but not one line of discussion is said. The whole feeling of emotions is given through the craft and eyes. There is another toward the end when Krishna wants Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you do not support the area, you are not encouraged. Look at this film with the transparency of film making and the ability to act.
