The information on this film is common for many people who have been experiencing information recently. Walter Reed's mistakes show a small part of the fact that we do not do our best to keep our wounded heroes back. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the most common truth for all wars. Psychological pain that the soldiers face when they are involved in the war and the difficulty they have when returning civil life. Only those who have been converted or affected are different people and many do not know how to deal with it if they do not know themselves. Finally, this film shows what the military is doing for our young women in getting them ready for war and policies and practices that they should follow in a war that leads to all psychological problems. We have over 3000 dead soldiers in four years of this invasion; but we have tens of thousands that will suffer for a long time physically and psychologically because of this war. No matter what side you are, it lets you know the cost of the war to determine if we should be in the business. This film shows the cost of men and women perfectly.
