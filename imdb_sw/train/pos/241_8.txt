I am tired of people who judge the film on their "historical accuracy". AND OF THE MOVIE PEOPLE! The authors and directors are required to put their own views in the story! There are a number of movies out there that are not quite accurate with history. If you want to see very few actors do what they are doing well, then I recommend seeing this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the truth. Just enjoy the quality of the film, storyline and one of the biggest actors of our time.
