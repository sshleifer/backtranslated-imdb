I was about 7 when I got this film first. It was not so special, but a few years later I saw it again and it was a lot of stress, much :) I think the best part of the film is: Yeti language and 'special effects' too. If you want to watch this film, don't wait Hollywood made blockbuster, even this film was made from the average. $ 1000 :) <br /> <br /> I've had a copy of it. Video videos and videos too (but I don't think it was shown in the movie) <br /> <br /> See it, enjoy it! Yeti forever!
