loses the fun of fun, I was a child in the movie, the one in the shade. :) I am 19 years old now. my parents sent me to try this place, we lived in Texas at that time. I think I did just like money 80, but I wasn't in it for too long. My parents said I would shout when I had to be happy and be happy when I had to cry. I was all mixed. The wonderful and wonderful fact I think .. and no I am not a child actress. I am livin 'in San Antonio, workin' in walgreens. I graduated from Texas but lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a good movie, though, a good concept. I have seen it several times in my short 19 years.
