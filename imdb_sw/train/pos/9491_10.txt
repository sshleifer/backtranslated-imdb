Henri Verneuil's film may not be popular as Parallax's view, 3 days of Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes better than these typical representatives. The action is carried out in the false state of the state where the false president has been killed. After several years of investigation, the special commission of the government decides that the president was killed by one gunman. But one Volney prosecutor, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is something else to be investigated and so the film will start. This movie does not deal with some real theory, but it incorporates the entire structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. The film can only be made in the 1970s but will never be lost. Additionally, it's even less fearful how accurate words are correct. 10 out of 10.
