I think this film is a very interesting film and one of the best 'National Lampoon's' films, also has a very interesting feature of attraction, which basically emphasizes what the whole film refers to .... White men !!!! The story is a spoof of many films including Will Smith's film, as you may have tried, 'Men In Black'. I will not give you an end but it has a very nice and very interesting end (Leslie Nielsen style of humor) from the beginning to the end, especially around the beginning when you are on the road collecting dust (litter trash). Also, they have a good lorry of cool dustbin (garbage collecting truck) in the area too. Acting is not good, in fact, it is not very good, but that's what makes the film beautiful, it's comedy, to restore it !! I love the story line, because because it is so far away and partly because it is interesting to see how the trick (Or shouldn't be hidden) remove all other films. I am a big fan of non-fiction, but I am also a fan of the real thing, and for these films, it is difficult to decide which is better, the film refuses (said earlier i) the real film is, but also when you make a comedy film it really makes it more difficult, but this film removes it successfully. Two rubbish men are very funny, reminding me of a sketch show of TV in England called 'Little Britain'. This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, of the best stories, the National Film Lampoon so far!
