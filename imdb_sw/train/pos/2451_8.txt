George Lopez is a good man even without sitcom. The first events I saw most often made jokes at the cost of his mother. I have looked more, there are many more and more. No one on the cast is safe from its witches now. It seems to me that this season has continued to be George's more comfortable with the role of the father of the father. At first it was not, but it gets More and more on vegetables. This makes everyone & shows it continues to be fun. They added several characters to George to play this year too. His wife's wife is getting more and more involved in the plot. His / her mother is still there, but not in the middle of the past seasons. I think it's reasonable to speak to George's time of comic, and the lack of ABC's good sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance to be here ABC long after George W. Bush.
