I don't try to take the IMD account for the heart, but I was being organized when I saw the rate of 5.4 for one of my childhood interests. It doesn't wow me very much in 17, but if this family film is a sweet and meaningful movie. Children will certainly love it and will not overlook mistakes, and adults can think the actor behind each character and love the subliminal message of the film. No films were preaching in any way, it actually has a great message that added to its sweetness. I will admit though the story is on a narrow side, and some cases like the death of Screweyes (which still remove me out) can be tad on the horrible side. But animation is higher than average with beautiful colors and animation of good behavior. Music by James Horner is very good, and the song displayed is memorable, interesting and exciting. I loved so much characters, Louie is probably the most comprehensive for all, but dinosaurs were at least involved. Clown Martin Short was beautiful and powerful, part when he tells Screweyes "I quit!" he had me in stitches. I really liked Screweyes though, an effective woman who is careful and I think she has intelligence. If there is anything, I would like the film to be saved when he tells how he lost his eye and why he fears the nerves because that way he could have developed further in detail. Script, when not Oscar-eligible, has its parts to stimulate and warm, and should keep children and adults welcome. The sound made for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave a strong show, but special mention goes to Kenneth Mars for he was very good as Screweyes and almost unaware. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get a rating, honestly I don't. Certainly this film is not perfect, and it is not the same as dinosaur films such as the Country before Time, but it's a good pleasure. Bethany Cox 7.5 / 10
