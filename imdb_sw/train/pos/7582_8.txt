Shintarô Katsu, known for Zatôichi's films, stars again in this third and final movie in Kenji Misumi (known as "Lone Wolf and Cub"), a saga led by Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami shows a great ninjas hit, to build ' ', and unfold the shadow walks in the treasure of the Shogunate. The plot of Hanzo' was kinda to get stale and repeat. Why once the novel in the first film, he was no longer. Well, this was better then second thanks to having more humor. I am glad that they opt out of one trilogy (I look at Lucas) <br /> <br /> My grade: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Waya Trailers for all 3 Hanzo Razor Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima provides both tits, Mako Midori just her left one
