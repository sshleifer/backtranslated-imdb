I'm waiting for every new place, each run again and expect! See the new sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is amazing that I never hope. Reconnecting the past and the future is a new perception that is interesting to me. Season # 9 should be fun. I would like that Richard Dean Anderson will come more often in the new season, if I like his dry witch as his appropriate temper in his character as Jack O'Neill. Other characters only add their own to a show that makes it a winner, season after season. You can delete this app in the next three years, and you make a big mistake. Also, you need a great responsibility for Asgard - they're just cool.
