This is one powerful film. The first time I saw it, Scotland's inspiration was hard for me to understand a lot and that destroyed the experience of watching. I left it but then I got a DVD, I used English headlines when I needed it, and I got into this film, realizing how good it was. It is better. The color of the red color makes it interesting in the place, with a beautiful colorful landscapes and the story that reminds me of Braveheart, involving the story of good and evil. Here, Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (evil). They all do their work well. The few vendors come as they deserve as Roth. The man, want to persuade this man in his pussy, irritating puss. (He is the worst and evil critics who love his behavior more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man with a strong figure figure like Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as female leadership. The movie enters you into and makes you completely involved, so you already have an emotional experience to watch this.
