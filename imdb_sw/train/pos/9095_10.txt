A lively, funny film that gets a solid bridge round. I saw the screener of this film recently in work. It was very good to see this film against all the movie crappy fears I see every day. To a large extent, I thought I would like to write. I don't know if this movie goes to the movies, but I hope. Her beautiful movie to see with friends, her boyfriend, and has a wonderful joke. Acting was severe (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf) Leading was good (not the most needed film). It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the flag between the characters is smart and has a good rhythm. (I am a dork) However, a very good film that I recommend.
