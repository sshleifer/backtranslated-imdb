First quickly 'fast!' for those who say this stinks of the film. You can't go to every movie expecting 'Citizen Kane'. This was a really enjoyable movie. Jason Lee is good in everything he does. The only file in this film is, I don't think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have more lodging on that. Other than that, movies are fun. Selma Blair needs to eat something. Ananias. But he still looks good. So, I recommend this movie for a Saturday or Saturday's fun day. Go see. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 out of ****
