Since the death of Siskel and the lack of Ebert, the show has remained in the hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a critic of the film he just criticized whatever he does not like private movies and country music to get panned because "I don't like music country!" with children's movies to get the standard "Don't see it now, try until it comes out of the DVD and rent it to your kids!" Roeper can be a idiot sard, but in another field. Meet the weekly visitors' for Ebert better, but who wants to take a daisy in the middle of a cow cow? All that said, is to show only in the city and that alone makes eligible look. With Roger Ebert, like Stephen Hawking can talk, so you can! It's your mind and mind we desire. Do whatever is needed to reach usurper off his own seat.
