It is easy to forget, once a series was made arc plot plot more arc, that once in a while, The X-Files' wrote episodes as "GenderBender" and "Symmetry Surprise", where visitors were not all a little gray or goop control of mind, but really can surprise you. The "fearful symmetry" begins with "invisible elephant" - in fact a certain elephant has been removed from space and time, not far from "Walk" - and ended with a pregnant gorilla if taken. And it's a great part of the wonderful time. Subplot is very suitable - yes, we find it, the zoo is bad unless it is not - but the ideas in it are amazing, powerful, and highly memorable, and it refers to the angle of cutting that is largely ignored - why * human beings can be the only things that visitors like? At the end, it was not normal, but it was fun when you were, again, not very much remembered, and especially, it's something you can't think of many others to do.
