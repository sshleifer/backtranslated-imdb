This is closed and carefully examined the document describing the worst case of Chagos Islanders, who shows, between 1969 and 1971, were strongly expelled from their country through the merger of British and American governments. The Anglo-American policy makers decided to do so because of their idea that the islands will be based on the basis of the Indian Ocean control through a solar and aquatic estimates. During the Cold War when most of the states after colonialism left the Western Orbit, it seems that the British and US leaders felt that allowing island dwellers to determine the fate of the islands was not an optional option. Instead they chose to overcome the general withdrawal of natural persons. The film shows that there is no provision made for the people of the island during their refusal, and that from the city center in Mauritius where they were abandoned, the evacuated Asgossian community fell in three decades of cuts, and in this new state, is subject to madness of the house, they received a lot of death rates. After more than three decades, in recent months (and years), following the opening of many demolition papers from the UK Consumer Office (one suspect that there were some errors, and These documents were not required to be made to the public), a legal appeal from the Chagossian community in exile saw the British court regularly obtaining permission from the villagers and against the British State. Therefore, the shocking and disturbing conclusion from the film can only be seen as proved. However, the British and UN governments are currently not volunteering to return to the islands for what the courts have concluded is the right inhabitants. This is a very valuable film for anyone to see, but it is important for Brethren and Americans to watch. To be silent in the face of this fact is to be justified in a serious crime.
