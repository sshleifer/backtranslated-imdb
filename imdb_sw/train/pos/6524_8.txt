If you are interested in pirates, pirate films, New Orleans / 19th century American history, or Yul Brynner, watch this film and have your mind on it. Do not be taken up with a new solution. My response is that it is entertainment, it does well (for the most part), it has a very magic talk, and that it does a good job to show charm, appeal and delightful personal story of Jean Lafitte. While not all of the events in an appropriate historical film (can you show me any historical film that is successful in this?), I feel the film is appropriate in the treatment of Lafitte's role in New Orleans history, and the history of love- hate relationship The "noble" citizens of New Orleans have this law of crime who was one of the loved ones of the city. Don't worry about what the film does not do, but look for what it does, that is, for the study of one of the historical figures of New Orleans, and America.
