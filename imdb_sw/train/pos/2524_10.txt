I did not expect Gackt and Hyde exhibitions to be as good as they were, and I did not expect to be healed in this artistic and well-developed film and enough to enable you to have enough interest and diversity to do it first. This film was an unexpected jewel, and I will follow the next film like that. I especially like the fact that it is a movie of the vampire, but it was not a flick of a cheesy vampire, nor could it beautify it. All characters had human qualities. The way that shows the growth of the characters was very interesting, and makes you feel compassion for them throughout their lives. I give this film two thumbs so far. Of course a good movie I saw in the last five years.
