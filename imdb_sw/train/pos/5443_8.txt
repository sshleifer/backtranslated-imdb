Why, this is a very good movie. I wish all Johns -Stamos ("Full House") & Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both offer powerful performances. Interested in love is the same, but this is more than a movie of a guy than a good movie of the date. I love Harleys, and I hated them to see the colors on the "14 lacquer textiles of the hand" and the old Elder Army Army. There is a history of small history here on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle that played an important role in WWII. I don't know if the exercises were similar to these groups! The movie put all my mind in a way without getting slow anywhere, and a good order riding the step. I would like to check the number of history of the vote - one 18-year-old gave a 10 film (really a bicycle partner, I think). I will not give you 10, but I have given you 8. I did not measure each movie at the same rate. There are movies that have a big budget, with key actors, who expect to be so good when they fail to fail. (Star Wars - I am an excellent example) I liked the first three SW movies, but I thought about the part I was weak in comparison. So it gets less from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
