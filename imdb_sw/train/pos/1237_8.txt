This was the original movie, and the hero's move to all involved. I don't care if it's not a movie to keep well together all the time, the fact that you have Eddie Murphy doing something that's not formulaic, and that I don't know what's going to happen next, making it my favorite. I would like more movies were thinking like this, instead of an old entertainment form.
