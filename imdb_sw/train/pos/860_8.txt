Audiard made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of a young woman who felt, in her world of work as a secretary; he is ignored, confused, refusing ... Employment intern as an assistant seems to be his way of getting someone in his life: but the guy is just out of jail. They are all rejected by the community that unites them gradually. People's details are income, they go into details ... all begin to help each other; for he can read on the lips, which seems to be useful for him ... He will continue to change, away from what he had before. <br /> <br /> Made well; it's all very persuasive, even if it turns into a black film at the end. Signs are particularly proved by the beauty of pictures of Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for the Cesar's Best Labor Workers for her play. Step towards the end of the film prevents it easy to "learn the moeurs". It's really amazing entertainment: 8/10.
