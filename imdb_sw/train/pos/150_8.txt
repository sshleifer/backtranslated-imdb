Recent films by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga are a study on how children are affected by violence and exclusion from their remote community, they continue to be concerned young people who need some psychic tools to deal with their hidden secrets. If these tools are a religion followed by a fan level, caring for others or just putting an eye on the eyes while engaging as a prostitute, Villaronga creates an investigation of how badly affected these three young people living in Spain under Franco. Neither do they preach two deaths or their friends before the youth and then bury their feelings with their small animals until they meet again at the hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. The text of the text is usually seen as you would like to expect from the Spanish artist and it is a very recall of his colleague Spanish colleague Pedro Almodovar and the themes related to sexual desires, both gender and homosexuality. The feature that is the difference between the two directors is that Villaronga is delighted under an unusual voice published by the efficiency of claustrophobic, gritty opposite the use of Almodovar surgery, although all styles are the same. <br /> <br /> The piece provides insight into the psyche of young people and has violence and sexual violence. I highly recommend watching this film as it has things that will remain with the audience for a long time after watching.
