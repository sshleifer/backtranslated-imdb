High School Vince Lombardi has a new head - Bibi Togar (Mary Woronov). He expects to ban rock music and roll all together. He blows his head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) cannot be seen to connect with any girl - without recognizing the cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) likes her. <br /> <br /> Night midnight movie. This was given in general and almost immediately hit the bomb - but as the midnight movie was a great hit and continued to play until the 1980s. I remember to attend a few of those when I was a university - it was like a party! People were singing along with songs, laughing in shock for every joke and usually enjoying it. See it now as an adult I can't think of why I loved it so much. Script is young and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Character changes to random and the movie goes flying everywhere. What saves this is really amazing lines and amazing displays with Soles and Woronov (who really enjoys himself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles up (if they should). For Ramones ... I wasn't a fan. I do as a tune of the head but some songs have never been to me. If you are a fan of Ramones you can give this maximum. <br /> <br /> SPOILER PLAYER !!!! This is for children (has a rating of PG) who maybe gets silly but fun. I especially think they will be like the last when the high school is hit! SPOILER END! Therefore, if you are in the movie's midnight movie of the mid-1980s you can love this. Otherwise do not go away. I offer 7.
