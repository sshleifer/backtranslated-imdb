This movie is wonderful. The plan was just ... wow. I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde, after growing in the US world of participants who cannot sing and do not act. <br /> <br /> In this film, Sho Sho (Gackt) comes on the vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they create an impossible friendship. Kei is injured because of being forced to live with others, half the life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but it's not sappy. The program was very unique, and contrary to your usual flick. The story of the story was thin and spinning and very interfering. It is the only mistake I could say the movie was, despite the unhappiness - yet peace? To end, it will be many languages. I had a version of failure (I am fortunate that I understood all of it except some Cantonese), so I would like to find something with headlines. All of them, the movie was just amazing.
