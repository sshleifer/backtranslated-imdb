I love this film. My only desire is that some of the original songs were changed. It is true that Frank Sinatra has no opportunity to sing too much in this film but it is also good that not just another movie of Frank Sinatra where it actually makes music. I thought it was better to use the voice of Marlon Brando himself if he had a good voice and I could not see someone with this great voice removing the gangster feel of his voice. <br /> <br /> "Sit down, You are a rockin" in the sea "is a tappin 'of feet, singing-long that I just love. She is a hard act to follow with her version and I still like her best. Vivian Blaine is the only best in this section and "The Adelaide mourning" is a favorite of its songs. I thought most of Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I didn't have the first to pick him but after seeing him in that place, it was meaningful. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is not available. If it was made in 2008, I can't change something. I see that something often goes away from the action version of the movie but this continued to feel for action, although it was on the film. I thought the movie was well healed. I made the regional offerings of this and is one of my favorites at that time.
