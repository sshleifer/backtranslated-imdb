"It's not me! It was, er, my brother Rupert!" Bobby says Dugan is fighting against the Sally place. I have used this line several times over the years (no one believes yet, though). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of all the fun and unbelievable moments. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan's part, the amount that he was in the "Malibu Beach" of 1978 as a similar character (not very close during the screen, however). "No one calls Dugan turd!" is another line for years. This typical film was worth the price of entry.
