I am giving this film out of 10 out of 10 people because criminals were attracted to their roles and an unknown batwoman makes it interesting to "guess who" game. Movies, however, requires more Robin in it. He appeared in the film at the beginning and consistently in another period. I always thought a new series of animation made just a little good for Robin's new behavior, then alone Knightwing. This movie just keeps that bad traditions. The movie spends a lot of time on Bruce Wayne and his love that is not so bad in one movie as romance was not so incredible. It is still a good movie if you are a fan of Batman and I would recommend watching it.
