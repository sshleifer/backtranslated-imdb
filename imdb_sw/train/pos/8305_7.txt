I enjoyed the movie, however, I did not know that Little Richard had so many things in his life. First of all I did not know Lucille. There is very little (any doubt) mention of women being very close to Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of women in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. In general the film was good. I also did not like Leon to play part of Little Richard, he is a good actor but I feel that the part should go to a different actor. Apparently did not remember Little Richard. I was also not quite aware of the evil that Little Richard was part of. From the film was made as an addict of sex. On this day he would be advised to increase his sexuality. He was voyeur. I don't want to destroy the movie for someone who has not seen movies yet there are a few things about the movie that I feel should not be part of the final cut.
