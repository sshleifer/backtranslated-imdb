This movie shows a kind of set one job in every film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are very interesting, talking about "family business" as a grocery store or a pastoralist. Macy, Campbell, Ullman, and Ritter are also strong. They are collaborating as members of the top top group, who recognize that good quality requires every actor to help others without self-interest. And finally, there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What is the amazing performance from the child ... and it's the same as what he has with Ullman, whose son plays! We are dealing with a special story in "Fear," and that's a deficit in these days of crap fatigue formulaic. The discussion is sharp and intellectual, and this small film still has the ability to attract full emotions from the viewer. There are places of laughter, shock, shock, sadness, wake up, anger, and love. It's not a film that stops you from jumping with joy, but when it is much higher than knowing that you have spent the last nine minutes getting a good job. Most of us would go to the movies if we were treated at the best price like this. When will the power in Hollywood come? It is a real shame when this thing cannot get more emphasis on ceremonies and lucky houses enough to have a cable.
