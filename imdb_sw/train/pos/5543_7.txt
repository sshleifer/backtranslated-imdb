A very frightening and interesting film of the PRC film tracking company who usually produces cheesy genuine films like DEVIL BAT or SERPENT OF OIL. Germany's director, Wisbar, marvels for a small budget and put his swamp of studio-bound. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton is the best as a guest.
