I don't want to comment on how good a movie was or what wrong it was if I wasn't a professional film professional and I didn't know enough to make movies. What I know is that making this kind of film in your first shot is a great success and I would like to congratulate the Director for it. However, in some reviews, I have read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers were not mentioned, and his brothers were completely removed from the story. Now I would like to add here as the movie name suggests, not the film about the brothers of Hiralal, is a movie on the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more. If we begin to complain about the other characters stored without working in the film, it will be fair because these characters are not identical to the image, no matter how they were in real life. So I think it would be better if we hold the main idea and stop meeting the critic for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
