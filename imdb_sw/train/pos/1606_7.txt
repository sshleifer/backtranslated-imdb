"Movie planned for adults" is a common phenomenon these days, but Moonstruck makes it well, and is still better than the average movie, which is very aging. Although it is a comic time that has a lower priority, the movie has a special feature (Italy in Brooklyn) that is not used to reduce characters or viewers. (That is, the members have never been seen in a solution. They never become as bad as my Greek Greek Wedding) secondary story lines are described economically and short events that allow you to break from a big thread. These are events that are now not missing in modern movies where their quick value cannot be surprised by manufacturers and bigwigs. I accept these events. Also with beauty it involves ancient characters. The movie takes its own, a quiet way to the conclusion. There is no badly written area that includes anywhere to do some sphincter actors relax. Cage and Cher does a very good job. Moonstruck welcomes old school, tribal, and last days New York is like 'Marty' but Moonstruck is a small way to purify.
