This movie is a story of a touching about the adventure taken by Darius Weems 15 years old. United States. He and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of finding his improved wheelchair on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite performances. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and has never left. The head of the western head for the journey that its participants will never forget. Darius climbs the boat for the first time, ride in a hot balloon, swimming in the sea and visiting sights he always wanted to see as Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The film staff here clearly have emotional relationships and equipment. They do not have money from the sale of $ 20 $. $ 17 goes towards the disease and $ 3 goes towards making more copies. The film has won over 25 awards at the ceremony and I agree with the quotations released by the film for a variety of forms, "Some to stir the hearts".
