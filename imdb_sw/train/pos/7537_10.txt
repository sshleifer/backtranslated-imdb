Contrary to what they hate Christianity, the 700 Club offers real answers with inspiration. It also provides reliable information, logic definition and different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is better. Unlike other programs, which provide the definition of society and faith, those behind the Club of 700 provide support to those who need it, like giving to the hungry and Operating Support, providing medical help to people living in the injured and poor communities. hope for those who need hope. It's not quite hateful. If the 700 Club raises you, I recommend accessing remote control and turning the center on your TV set. I do the same thing when I get to the head of CNN or about it, plans that I like or offensive. What I reject is the way the ABC family makes a decision that the 700 Club views do not reflect the ABC Family.
