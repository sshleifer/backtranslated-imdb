This was one of the funniest and great sitcom to hit national television. Unfortunately the show is not set between beautiful sitcoms where it's true. Workers did good work and one to six seasons were show at its peak. Although the seventh season was not ideal when compared to the last six, it was still amazing. The 8th season was a real problem. Without the favor of Topher or Ashton Kutcher, the show just fell. Not also say, other actors were not as big as two second-party actors as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also left) show will have the same effect. And the entry of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either because he did not receive well with the exhibition fans. I believe if the show ended last year it would undoubtedly drop in history as one of the sitcom greats. The 8th season was small but finale was better. I miss a miss show, I just hope to wake up one day to find out the show is back like That 80 show and cast the same because I miss miss a hell out of it.
