Where the End of Sidewalk is a very good film of film crimes and it is smoothly in black and white and also place. A copper crash kills a bloke who is charged with murder and protecting himself, he covers this and blames the other person who does not like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past. But toward the end, he owns but not before the fall of love with the woman he meets who is the partner of the man who killed her ... <br /> <br /> Release included Dana Andrews (When Sleep City, Demon Curse ), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (San Francisco Street, More Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). A good place from all. <br /> <br /> Where End of Sidewalk you have a look to check if you get a chance. Better. <br /> <br /> Testing: 3 out of 5 stars.
