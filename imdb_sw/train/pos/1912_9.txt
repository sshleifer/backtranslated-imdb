I will put it in short and short, the people who wrote the story lines for this show are the elite, the artists are just perfect for the roles they play (the CJ character is a story) and they have many chemistry on the screen which makes it, the most successful comedy. When I first saw the new intervals that would probably return more than 6/7 months, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was created to know that he died when I searched for Google. He was very good and played his character perfectly, a protective father, who loves to put his daughters out of the widespread and away from boys. <br /> <br /> Comedy, I think, has come out of power, even without Paul in it. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people will enjoy watching this.
