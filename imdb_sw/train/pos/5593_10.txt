This film can be a silent film; certainly has one feeling. I was very, very fortunate to see this very common version of this film. To expand, it's a 'symphony of love', and it goes through all language versions. French, which is a romantic romantic language, seems best suited to this earthly and audible version. but certainly far from having romantic pictures. but that does not prevent the magical magic of this old film. Most of the early movie movies, they would like to love this film.
