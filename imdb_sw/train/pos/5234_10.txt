After going on a bicycle trip that day, lying beside the lake in a natural reserve, using half an hour to eat and talk to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it, this film has made it quite meaningful to me. The image of the film was good and that's all you need. Remove the skills of thought control and work done. Reminded Baraka (1992) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph. These terms require less than ten lines, ten lines are less than 9 but ten. After completing counting all the lines you realize that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines are all needed to express my opinion.
