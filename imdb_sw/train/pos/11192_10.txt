I have examined this film several times at the university, and every time I show, the number of people looking at me grows correctly ... in addition to widows, anyone has been shown to NEEDS to see again! It takes a little time to get into it, but at the end one room screams, shouting, screaming, restoring scenes regularly, repeating discussions, and just completely and completely interfering in the movie experience which is also Zadora in "Lady Lonely"! After the event after the event of the most widely used text, which was written incorrectly, the TRASH has been thrown to you in an external attack that becomes like a great object that I own (no small information, friends). For me there is nothing to compare 2 U, Also ... and I think I am the only one who has ever felt this way!
