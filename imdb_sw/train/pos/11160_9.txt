That's the largest movie of Swedish at all. Not only is it a revolution in its notes, but also among the first movies to mention the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish readers. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of the most prudent and cautious filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film makes it clear that to show. "Vuxna människor" (Adults) is a warm heart and hilarious story about adults, and a question if we can't be better without it.
