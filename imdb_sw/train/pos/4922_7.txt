I am wondering what the audience of the day thought when they first put their eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Surely he looks like no one else of the time, that the face like a skull, a blowed nose, and the body emerged - even now keeps the existence of failure. And what is more suitable than the emergence of the New Orleans corridors that appear to be spreading as the Blackie blows over the city. I'm sorry just didn't have more scenes. The movie itself is connected with skill? morgue humor, the discrimination of Widmark- Douglas, non-tourist areas, war between officials? all of them are placed in a truly dangerous thriller of the same as that of others. Even local Widmark events that have placed a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee to manage are not too much. Director Kazan certainly demonstrates his ability to support the label (Fox) product, no matter how he can feel about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark has a basic function as a public health officer. But my money is on Zero Mostel single and special. Was there a knife singer who could shout or get more pushed by a fallen person (for example, Enforcer, 1950). The part with Mostel, where Palance is facing the majority of Soli's wife (Liswood), is a gem of vigilance as Mostel tries to strengthen each as a berserk pin. The worst he lost many years for the list of colorless. (I wonder if it was Kazan's voluble that he mentioned.) It is not just professionals who add color. Residents increase the behavior and origin of all, particularly two Asian boys interviewed by fighters. The whole area has the proposed air, like Kazan to realize their potential and create a small area of ​​the spot. Then also, the hall of hired colors and all the hands of the deck are inspiring clean. And what about these smoked coffee shops that are running on Denny's nearby. However, the film is still very good, very interesting and air-conditioning that is not so much of the modern-day mega.
