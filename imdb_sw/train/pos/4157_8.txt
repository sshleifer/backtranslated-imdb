This original Anime movie was a very good film that I had immediately found at the Fiction Science Center when the characters were really popular in America and not the catastrophic disaster that adults swimming say is on the cartoon network. I really think it has less to do and be less popular and more and the fact people would now buy dvds are looking uncut episodes on the web. This film though it was not reduced to many types and sound work was the same as the movie called, although I would like to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use offensive sounds for children in anything called. This film has a little boy who runs a train called Galaxy Express with the hope that he can make it on a planet that has technology to make him a robot. He wants to be a robot to take revenge on his mother, who was brutally murdered in the hands of a robot who is hunting for humanity. During his adventures he has friends with different employees into the train and also the woman who resembles his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who as a beautiful woman in the movie Anime has a secret that can be very good for our little hero, or very bad . He goes from planet to planet as well as the train makes different stations and runs into a pirate of space called Captain Harlock who seems to have a star in his series of cartoon series, so basically Galaxy Express takes place in the same world. All in a very beautiful journey with an amazing and unexpected end. There will be a sequel for this, but it was not as good as this, however the end was more end than it was here.
