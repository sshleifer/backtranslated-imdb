I saw this very important film tonight. His most important and better work of Richard Gere and Claire's Dane. Gere is eligible for Oscar for the similarity of the person who was forced to retire early as the registrar of sexual offenses. Claire Danes is shouting like a Gere woman with a chance to take her place - a woman tries to teach all she can during a single case study that Gere's attitude believes one of the loaded tracks can be captured by a little girl. The lesson is surprising, sex offenders and those who follow, but this film will not be reported quickly. I know I will be shown by Gere's photo for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins showing a killer has a picture of fear and worked for me. The movie opens with amazing statistics so you don't miss opening credit. Detailed and memorable. The best role of Richard Gere to prove someone can act. Dancers can also and all do very well in this highly challenging film. This is a gutsy and Gere film that gives you a lot of performance. Just give him Oscar now ... worthy!
