Bette Davis returns to a very cool performance like Mildred Rogers in this 193 film. of today. It was amazing to me to see how little Mrs Davis looked at this point. The actors turn to the presentations that are realistic and sound is both meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well healed as Philip Carey, a club medical student. This is a powerful message about who we like to love and why. However, the "Human Bondage" did not seem to have a great impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt a little different from the movie after watching it. I am aware that this could be the answers that the director was going. You have to be a judge! <br /> <br />
