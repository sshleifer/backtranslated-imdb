This is one of these historic films that have to be in a state of the time. which were part of the Soviet rule. It was in such a climate that a small country called Estonia was born. For the established governments, it is known to encounter serious problems, Estonia is also experiencing many problems as some corrupt officials have used state machinery to fill their dead bags using their own selfish means. This is one of the basic themes of this film. The presence of Tallinn is seen as a movie in Estonia but was done by the Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He has tried his ability to insert many of the possible possibilities of the Estonian humor. That's why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones. As ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film denotes good and evil. is not a new concept as easily available in many religious books of different faiths .To look at Talinn shows how common governments can be destroyed by people who are destroyed. A good film to watch the sunny day.
