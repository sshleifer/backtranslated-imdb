The first film of Australian profession hits the screen with bang. And hitting. And a piece. And shouting or two. With a lot of blood, fear, red celebration and lots of votes. In fact, there is a lot of first cutting Cut - it's the first script of Dave Warner to be generated, although many others are selected or in chat; is the first film from the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and is also the first film for the manufacturer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of boys they beat their fingers for the first time, they know their stuff. It says the story of a group of Australian film students who hear about slasher films, Moto Damu, which has never been completed because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by actress playing psychologist in the film. With their lecturer (former night administrator Hilary died) to warn them that everyone is trying to start a hot fire again and a dead person, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and a Hester producer (Sarah Kants) decide to continue and complete the film. They put together workers and manage to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), return to Australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete the Fire Blood? 14 years after the shot was closed. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a slasher film, lots of blood? for a long time to laugh a lot, a few few good sounds and sounds of Aussie's rocking. Cut shows that Australia can make a good film of the awesome market, such as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It is a well-organized feature, with special special effects, the taut plot and killer - Scarman - that's the most welcome to Michael's column, Jason and Freddy.
