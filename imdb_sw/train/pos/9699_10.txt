Something about "Paulie" touched my heart as a small movie. It's magic, funny but still emotional movie. I am an executive at the end of being a fan of this film. I did not see "Paulie" until May, 2004 and since then has ordered the Widescreen DVD from a dealer on eBay. The specific effects of showing Paulie's conversation are very good. My son asked me how the birds knew so many words. Maybe my favorite movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays the best part as a good person of the heart. It exceeds its way through the film. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!
