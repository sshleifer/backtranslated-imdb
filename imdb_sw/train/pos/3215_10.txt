This was better. Contact, insertion, and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this film, it deserves more than 5.3 or more stars. This movie is a story of an old soldier who learns more than life than soldiers, and people who learn that there is a time to fight, the need to defend. I cried, laughing and more I was afraid of this story. Good job writing for flick action, and the plot was correct and fairly stable. The end was not sharp, but it was still better. If you would like to escape from New York, or to be buried in the forest for the lower forest, this film is for you. It is not an unnecessary amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to look at it. Something for everyone.
