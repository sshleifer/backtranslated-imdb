Hollywood time to sit and realize! If actors are doing snooty, all you need to do is find the animators who worked on this little wonder. Renaissance is probably the flick of the first animation that makes you forget that you don't see people. Although the voice is faced with a cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce etc.) it is some of the best I have ever heard but even the emotions displayed by 'cartoons' don't know. This type of animation is not very new but the use of light and shades makes the film a lifetime color. Amazingly, the technician of that technology forgot that this is really a very good movie. The input of the input and the plot is wonderful and crisp conversation. Plot: The lack of a high business employee defines the story of fraud and corruption and a hero of cool heart in helm. It can't say a lot without giving it all away ... except that when the movie puts you on the edge of your seat, the peak leaves you without a speech. <br /> <br /> Must watch ... even for 'adults who beat' cartoons'
