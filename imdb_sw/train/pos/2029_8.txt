If a horse horse partner can only appreciate this movie. There are a few movies that show life like this. I would like to know if Brian runs himself in the film. He would also like to know if he enjoys a horse. Brian has had many movies where he has gone. Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding events are always perfect, as the horse can run forever in full steam. The camera function is the first level and connects the horse in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on the horse. It will be very interesting to know how they did about throwing this film to get all the riders of a very beautiful horse.
