What's a good movie of the movie television movie. The story says about a five-year-old girl who lost her father and sees it impossible to cope. His mother is also very sad. In fact the miracle can reduce their anxiety. All viewers expect to make. Samantha Mathis is as brilliant as the mother of a little girl, if she was like a nanny in "Jack and Sarah", worth watching if you like Samantha Mathis and happy; The tears of tears of the year! Ellen Burstyn is, like, always a beautiful bride in this tender and very powerful film. Jodelle Ferland (five-year-old) is good and the most interesting actor. The film depends on a true story that makes it so touching. The "Mermaid" is a tax for the humanitarian milk that is displayed clearly and clearly yet around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, realizing that there are many delightful people in the world with lots of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scout U.
