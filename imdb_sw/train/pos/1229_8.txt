I waited years before seeing this as all the comments I had read about this were awesome! I lost it expecting the worst, and when it's not the most beautiful film of the sandler out there, there is so much worse! Sandler is talking to the camera on a regular basis and the film does not work hard, but that's a fun part! The best way to lose daylight, and you can even turn around twice! Good movies, worth rental!
