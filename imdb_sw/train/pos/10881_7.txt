"Cut" is a complete destruction of the type of slasher and generally achieves what it does. Most of the level of slasher levels are there; The old creepy house, trees, mysterious mysterious, the buckets of the year, and of course the couple is interrupted by the killer when they are having sex (that's not a spoiler). -up is easily itself: the nerds of the school of the film are provided to complete the slasher made "masterpiece", which is not made because of the murder of several couples. This too well - similar, messily - provides Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They join one of the victims of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald who completely steals the film because it gets all the best lines. All others have to clarify their roles well, especially Jessica Napier, who plays well when violence and year round. <br /> <br /> There are many red breaths and time of cheating, and there is very little time to try to work with whom the killer is because the film goes faster. It also has a proper look at the low budget, including some appropriate edits that may have a purpose. Good sound, too. If there is difficulty with this film is to decide whether it is to be sent or worshiped for a variety of slasher. Probably a bit of both.
