This, along with "Hare Tonic," is like one of the best cartoons cartoons, in fact one of the best bugs, ever. There are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons are "basic," meaning, I think, that is still not fully filled. I really prefer this version of the "core" from the mid-40s (Chuck Jones' was the best version) who is actually more than rabbits and more sizes than the last long-term version that got on Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The last days of bugs had been a matter of modernization. Also see “Hair Add Hare” (1946) and “Rabbit Punch” (1948) for good examples of classic bugs and Chuck Jones classic.
