This is one of the best movies since 2002. Maybe it's not the best film, but it looks good, it works well and is dominated by Sam Mendes, who started with the 'American Beauty'. The story of a young man named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) for one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be the same but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) puts his father and Michael up, causing Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the second son. Michael thinks Rooney is involved with Rooney deciding himself and sending Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is an honorable person in the organization he tries to win other friends who can help him including the renowned boss Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> Through "lost road" is a common movie of the gangster but it is well made around you can't see it. This movie is good in its design, production, art, sound, music and more of all in its movies. All these things can be amazing and create doubts as the result is sure. That Hoechlin is not an angry child and Hanks, the Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course. <br /> <br /> According to this comic movie is much better than you would expect and although it has its own mistakes of the best movies in that kind. Sometimes there are cases where you realize you have seen many times before, but for some reason they also feel clean at the same time. The exhibition between the Hanks of adults and Hoechlin baby helps in the area. Watch this film that will appear normal sometimes but it is quite new in many places.
