Artemis was late last night. At first I didn't think I would like, but I saw I didn't feel like sleeping and nothing else was going on, I kept looking and I felt happy with young Artimisia, virgin, pure and enthusiastic. His love and Tassi's supernatural convince them. Although the film is based on the most interesting and not the truth, I loved it more than the usual biographys or game of practice. Play great, great camerashots, good music and literature. I loved him and wanted more! : -) \ t
