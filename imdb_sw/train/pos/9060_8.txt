You saw this today and my age of 8. I thought it was good. I agree with another poster that was not like a book I can remember, but we still enjoyed it. All children are good and all in all good entertainment. Billy is a young child who assures himself and school to attack 10 worms a day. If she has lost she needs to walk in the school hall and germs in her pants. The beginning of the film has been created to show that Billy has a weak stomach and almost every pukes. Hilarity comes with a group of different ways to cook worms. Good news about the stand for attackers and of course, sappy happy ending.
