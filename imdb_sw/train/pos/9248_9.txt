Holding Your Person Finds Jean Harlow, who works a class girl from Brooklyn falling to Clark Gable's husband and finding all kinds of problems. The film begins as a film, but at the same time it is about a definite emphasis to change its behavior. The movie opens with a Gable game with a lover, Garry Owen and a call for fighters. As he chased the Gable duck into Harlow's apartment and because he was a very good friend, he was hunting for him. Before long she has been involved with him and unfortunately with her heresies. Gable, Harlow, and Owen are trying to draw a game on the beer Paul Hurst, but Gable won't go through. Of course when Hurst knows that it is con, he's still tough and gets sharp and gable has its punch out. But then he is raised to death outside the house of Harlow and that the red platinum hair makes it easy to recognize. He goes on the assistant to kill people. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are her and its restructuring for prison life. His interaction with other female prisoners give him a very beautiful scenes. I think some of these materials were later used by MGM classic Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets to make a song of the header and made like a ballad style style, very popular back in those days. He speaks / sing through Sophie Tucker and very well. Gable is healed well as a con man who keeps conscience, a place that he could play often, especially in my Gable film, Honky Tonk. It is still Harlow who shines in this film. I think it's one of the best he did in MGM, his fans should not lose.
