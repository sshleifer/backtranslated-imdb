Good films, full of good performance and intense, intelligent conversation. What exactly is different from the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness around. The story is emphasized by issues, solitude, suicide, despair, fear of losing work in the world where it had serious consequences. Most of it was installed in a world that was no longer existed, after being cut off from the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is not quite available if you compare the percentage of major events on comic scenes. Yet it is amazing - listening to Margaret Sullivan of the rushing of Jimmy Stewart and looking at his bitter words as he answers that his opinion was a wonderful mix of "poetry and stability". It's funny, spells, and sad all at once. Wonderful achievements and one of the ten most popular comedies made.
