I began to watch this film unexpectedly, just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the sketch and the main character, who is enigmatic, is not talking much, he found me true on this film. <br /> <br>> I loved this film, it was dark, well done and very touching. It's slow but the immersion is completed. The direction was surprising to inform us the bits of the story that leads to Joey's faith and his life behind bars. Music was so beautiful and so entertained. The end wasn't expecting and the deviation did not come. It's not the type of movie we see many times.
