I just want to add my two cents, and forgive me if I repeat something that is already written, but I feel it is important to remind people of the everlovin mind of Damon Runyon. Without a wonderful road, the hilarious text of Damon Runyon this film has never been made - neither many other scholars involved with gambling and so forth since the 1960s. the location of the East Coast road. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood games, I would recommend other flicks from the text of Damon Runyon; "Lemondrop Kid," and "Little Miss Marker," both show Bob Hope, who, apart from his politics, has always been a funny person. (Like Western Freedom, I see its politics well, too!) Damon Runyon lives!
