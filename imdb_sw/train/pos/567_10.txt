Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann took part in some of the best western designed and this is one of the best. The real stars of the film are, however, an interesting Canadian Rockies that serves as a growing story. Some of the best performing movies in the film history. All five of the west that Stewart and Mann did with their roles were fully beaten. There is no discrimination here, under the pieces that may have a few lines, characters are beaten with that line. Stewart is a complicated cycle of hardness in this film whose real friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It is the death of Brennan in the hands of criminals who make the intention to release gold from the bad people and separate themselves from the process. John McIntire is the great woman of the piece and she was an unpopular actress and a variety of different types. He was able to play the old fun, monitors and in this case is very serious and subtle. <br /> <br /> One of the best western ever.
