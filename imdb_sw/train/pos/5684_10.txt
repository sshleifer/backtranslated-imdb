Wonderland is an amazing film describing the star of the x-C film. John C. Holmes in the brutal killing of Wonderland. The film promotion loses one by thinking this beautiful picture of the porn industry in the line of Boogie Light and not here. In fact, except for a few references made by reporters that John Holmes is a star The porn and short montage of the real picture of the life of John Holmes this film is very harmful about the involvement of the celebrity as well as the murder and how it happened. It is a waste of films. Acting from each cast is the best and I'd say that Val Kilmer is amazing in its ability to drop all the way to John Holmes. I really believed that I was looking at what John C. Holmes would probably see and do as in real life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of John C. Holmes or as a story about Hollywood then I think you will enjoy watching Wonderland.
