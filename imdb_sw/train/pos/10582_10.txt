It has to sing. It has a game. It has comedy. Has a story. It is one of the largest films made ... period. If you can't enjoy this film, then you must be asleep or some form of mental deficiency. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and plays for his College Academy Award; but in this film he is a BETTER! This is James Cagney in his BEST mandatory! She is fast with one liner! He is fasting on his feet! It's an unusual step. With skits of dance-and-dance are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil." And cast is good; and the whole movie is upbeat, quickly moving, and exudes confidence. And although this film was made over 70 years ago, it still looks, even today. And of course, this film shows Miss Ruby Keeler (married to Al Jolson). She is a perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you want to upbeat, quick movies, and play and play many, this is a movie to watch.
