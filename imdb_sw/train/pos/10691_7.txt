I got this in a bowl last night. I liked the movie. I loved Russia 3 times different (adopt our two children). I can't put my finger exactly why I liked this movie except to see "turn" bad "good" and "good" to turn "half bad". I liked watching Ben Chaplin through the entire film. If "I can't make this happen to me" if it's good or bad is the same look (and it works). Too much. 7/10. Pay or catch on the plate as I did.
