I got this on a screen show at Sundance film and I had a very powerful film this film has. It is a study of the psychological effects of our brave soldiers who join the military in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with respect and also be maintained by our government for it. A film on the psychological change of the boot camp as soldiers turn into a "killer for their country" and impose war with results after returning home. It also shows the effect that the murder you have on the human psyche. He respects the soldiers and never checks troops against other films, rather than criticizing a system that is not prepared and does not address all physical and psychological needs of Vets return. This film is powerful, motivating, emotionally stimulating and imaginative. It stands as a weapon to help our assistants not only to buy stickers and go to chains but actually listen to them, and help help change their way of their health and well-being are taken after the last murder. The best film of the festival to date, **** / ****
