Peter Sollett has created a beautiful picture of the real people living in poverty in the east-east of New York, or Loisaida, as is known by the locals. Sollett's heart is a good place to explore this unemployed family, which is common to 'local' cities of different countries. Mr. Sollett encourages positive in the story he presents. These are very good children, children of parents who have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing. Instead of presenting his characters as lost, Mr. Sollett shows the best side of all. These children do not have drugs, or they stole because they are poor. If this story was made by Hollywood we would be seeing the violence of discrimination, instead of struggling children, but inside, they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, as Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is normal. So that's July Marte. His behavior shows us a girl who has no feelings that cannot be deceived or implemented to do anything she doesn't want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as the bride is the best. He expresses his frustration because he cannot give his grandchildren on what he believes and which is very important to him. All of them, this was thanks to the best image for Peter Sollett.
