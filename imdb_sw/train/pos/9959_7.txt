Well, if you have a clear interest in the Barber Shop, then you will love this Canadian film. If your mind is like to be closed as Fort Knox, then you will now give a logo that contains: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a film for anyone who is scheduled to watch movies from outside their foundations. It is involved, it is true for life, two or three times you lose relationships between the events, but often, especially to the end, you find yourself with tears or two in your eyes and this just because they often show life that can be like. I love and recommend it to anyone who is considered more than a traditional American film.
