First of all I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and that some people say so and then run over the experiment is more of me. Everything that was in the trial was in the case of Silver Silverman, maybe not directly funny, but the situation and delivery is what is deep. If you loved Jesus is magic then I don't see how you could 'like this. It has the same flow with the same rhythm. The truth is only for true fans, but if you will be happy. <br /> <br /> Just for real fans, there is no way around it. If you are used in its style then you can't find out why this is interesting. However, it is, and I hope you think too.
