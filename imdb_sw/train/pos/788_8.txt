Ok - I accept. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this film - but more than his beautiful performances, the movie is being done at times possible, but suitable. Starting out, we are presented to three women's leading film. One of the head - is very involved in its shape and never married. Police officer - a child with a bad old man went up. The third - a powerful physician with a state of hunger and desire to be recognized by the third. <br /> <br /> They are near the "First Women's Club", and in fact there are a lot of old words to share with others "came out of credit card" character. Character setting - the movie continues. McDowell's character, head of the head, comes at the end of the funeral - where the little member, filling the ordinary player (Doughty) takes his eye. What? What do his two friends say about the next evil? Will they live happily at all times? <br /> <br /> A tissue or two was recommended if you are a type of teary - to complete the end, but maybe not what you would like to expect. All in the main movie that stands between the current choice of actions, special effects and fears of schlock.
