Small pieces show main characters (Abu, Jaffar, and Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; Three are songs, linking to the same characters. Three times Ahmad expresses the full word 'Time', in his love statement to Princess, answers his three questions at their first three meeting. In a very strong sense it is the impression that the Princess will oppose the three attempts of Jaffar to overcome her - by three ways of success: fraud, hypnosis, and abolition memory. However, Jaffar owns what he describes as incomplete instruments on a woman: whip, power, and sword. Third is the number of flying instruments: machine-horses, Genie, and The Genie and carpet of magic. Genie offers three requirements for Abu in their first three encounter; Three times Genie says very much in the mountain gorges, and three are his thoughts on human weaknesses, before they leave. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, spider-giant, and giant-octopus). Three are the right organs: a magical eye that shows Abu the future, a magical carpet that only takes him to save Ahmad and Princess, with a bow and arrow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three, and there is magic in this film.
