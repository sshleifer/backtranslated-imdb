How to lose friends and isolate people is a good comedy and a bit of romantic techniques. <br /> <br /> It is true story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) breaking into the journalist's business and magazine which is translation in funny way. Simon Pegg appeared well, a little more than usual. Modern is not hilarious or funny all the way or something like that but it has time, and then it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching American and English cream comedy for all people who just want to sit, relax and enjoy the film for what it is. If you are about to watch this film and a useful technique then you should pass it unless you want to despair and start making it.
