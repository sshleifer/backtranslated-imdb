This film is like a marmite. You can love it or hate it. If you are going to this film you are looking for a good film and good production, good plot and great characters you will love. If you are going to this film you expect a low budget budget you might like. When you enter this film you expect to see one of the many lost characters who have filmed the form of Harry Russo you would like. John Giancaspro is quite brilliant in it on a picture of insane, insane coke fiend. Special effects are really worse but really, he cares? If you are a type of person who is ready to watch the Schizophreniac film: The Whore Mangler has found many of the most scary images filled with the image. With this film the film was made even though they tried it perhaps would be the same all the time. I would like to be able to laugh at something that is not worse than having negative feelings. To count them, you will probably hate this film but if you are one of the few who decide to see it yet it will be the best thing since the divided bread # 2 I like marmite.
