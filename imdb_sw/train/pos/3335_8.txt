The movie shocked me. For my soul I had the worst pastor. Certainly after having a DVD for months now I inserted it into sleepless nights. although the movie dragged an additional picture was used for the purpose of the weight of its desire and its recovery from increasing the game would be less true if they had left any scenes. The best thing about the film is the position and relationship. There was no ex of pop or on characters threatening connection. I mean usually we see a girl meeting a young man and waiting for a moment, they have a date, something we've seen coming to them and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not follow the mold. We actually saw the relationship and it was wrong and although the characters had a time to fight love they had not stopped fast they went and made every 15 montage and then reunited again in love again. I did not feel that the movie was predictable as other romance movies. The story was unique and realistic in the real way that I felt that these people in the film were the most loyal that I saw in the movie romance from modern times. a little bit too. Not "My Righteous Woman" but it's a powerful and honest film. I will only say I love it.
