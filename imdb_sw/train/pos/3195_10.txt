BEAVER TRILOGY is, of course, one of the most talented films available. I was lucky to do it, with the Q&A session and the Trent Harris director, at NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy of the Trent website. This movie seems reliable! I recommend to look for Trent's name on the web and then buy a film from its website. She is a very good boy of boot. Don't worry: A viewer in the TRAITO's BEAVER section is not Trent! When you see TRILOGY a few times, I must admit that I could do without Sean Penn Edition. It's like a test version of Crispin Glover "Kidogo Kidogo" and is more interesting as a curiosity product if you're a fan of Penn than a good video. Penn is very good, though, and you can see a great star display in this video of B & W of anger. <br /> <br /> It may also be one of the best works of Crispin Glover and I would just see an updated document about Groovin 'Gary's original. Once you see this film, you will never get Gary's nervousness on your head again.
