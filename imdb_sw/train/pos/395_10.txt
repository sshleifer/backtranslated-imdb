The amazing and full-sighted Oriental Philosophy, this amazing military military is brought to you by General Tsui Hark's director, a man behind the film's best film in Hong Kong. Special effects are good and thoughtful. The program is slightly on the side of the brain, but it is an exciting change from films that listen to their listeners as morons. If you think it's not your tote, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go to see the latest from Hollywood's no-club studios, but if you are looking for something more, he is where you will find it.
