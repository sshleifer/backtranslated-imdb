I enjoyed this film. Britney is a very good example of young people and should be more valuable. This movie is about following your dreams and never stopping no matter what people can do or say despair and criticize you. Holly fulfills his dream as Britney. There are times when everyone lives when people judge them because they are not. Watching this film will allow you to understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He cannot know how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You're great !!!
