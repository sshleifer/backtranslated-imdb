First of all, this film is very interesting. A person who works on 3D CG movies as lighter / composer, the pictures are drawing me. Every second I was surprised by what was on the screen As for stories, well, it's okay. It will not put the world on fire, but if you would like your future bright stories (and who is not?) Then you will be fine. I need to say that I felt the sound it made was particularly bland and approved by the film in general. I saw it in an English movie, but I hope that there is a French version around it. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth seeing.
