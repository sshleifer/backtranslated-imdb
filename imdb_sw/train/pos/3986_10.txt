I am a college student reading standards and I need help and feedback from anyone who has any comments about the mother's theme in the film, for the mother. If you've gone something else or just want to comment and help me explore more about this film, any comments will be widely known. Comments will only be used for test purposes and will be included in my text test. So if you have any ideas, I can really use it and you can help me get A! I also learn 'About Boy' and 'Tadpole' so if you have seen these movies too, I would like to know if you can leave a comment here. Thank you.
