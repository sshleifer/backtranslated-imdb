I saw this film in a video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I were very excited to buy VHS and were happy since then. The program has been discussed well, so there is no need to do it again. The action is this movie deserves to watch regularly. Americans, in particular, can not find all the jokes the first time around. I know I haven't. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray suggests toast on his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" trying to kiss him, it is broken. When Beano is finally closed by a black woman, it is very funny with words. And the music: it is similar to any sound sounds I have heard for years. I was playing in the bedroom to "All around the world." <br /> <br /> Each activity is completely complete. Bill Nighy has been accepted correctly for a show by Ray, a man who had one bad trip. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a favorite player of the keyboard who carries a torch for Karen all these years. She looks at the attractive hangdog that makes women want to hug her. But all actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore any pans you read about this film and see it. It's gem.
