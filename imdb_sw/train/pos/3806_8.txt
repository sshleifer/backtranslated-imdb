This movie took my breath away for some points, I just loved it! I agree that a conversation of character and story story can be done better, but hey, this is a simple story (short) of several people trying to kill the dragon, nothing more for! <br /> <br /> General composition, atmosphere, beautiful theme ... it's just all magical! <br /> <br /> They have put much love in this film. Characteristics are good and interesting. Little Tim Burton-ish if you like. I can recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to the beautiful design, shown in a small, but interesting story.
