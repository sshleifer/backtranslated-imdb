It's a pleasure to see that creation on TV again. This period is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well to writing not bad (I think it will improve when they get their feet). Certainly worth checking. <br /> <br /> Girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is delightful as it is Olive. Two aunt are happy. I hope they really write in a large part as they are magic. It is all relevant information to be published. Go make a big popcorn bowl and enjoy something fun in the past. This is like Dr Seuss for adults.
