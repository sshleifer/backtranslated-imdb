Meryl Streep was amazing in this film. He has a wonderful knack for accents, and shows amazing skills in this film in general. I felt for him when Lindy was being tortured. He was really played, too. He was in trouble, angry, and uncomfortable like the media and the government continued their bad witch. I didn't expect too much from the original film, but I was fascinated by it, and the movie depends on the real person and real events. It was better than I expected. Sam Neill was also excellent; this is the best work I have seen from him, and I have loved it in other movies (Piano, for example). I paid the 7th film, but if I could just measure the acting, I would give it 9.5, and 10 full for Streep.
