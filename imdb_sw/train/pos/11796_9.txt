As a result of the fact that it is the basis of the casualties of modern genocide, it would have been sufficient to provide a film film for the 1980 film film. But the truth is that it is a good entertainment for Pastor Jim Jones, who built a church in the real authority, and then encouraged it to destroy it in the cult of which Congressman and his participant were killed, and 917's supporters of worship committed themselves to drinking Kool-Aid. and cyanide. It was done very beautifully but frightening enough, contrary to the DAMNED AIDS, GUYANA SOMETHING very sadly includes all stars, including Ned Beatty (like Rep Leo Today), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid , Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, Lear Burton, and Madge Sinclair. But it's Boothe Power (in his first great role) that looks like Jim Jones. It is really the man, and his performance is screaming and breathing. Therefore, it is not surprising that this film still manages to attract more than twenty years.
