I loved Timothy Dalton very much though he was young and also good for Mr R. but I thought Zelah Clarke is also bright and short. This version was however true for the novel and it was done well. I found 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite R R, although George C Scott did very well and is high among Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, though they were two too little for the role. I recently saw Rebecca's TV and Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would like to see those two doing Jane Eyre.When I looked to translate the Ciarin Hinds, I think I was Jane Eyred out, but I never never tire of the first minutes of hearing the voice of Joan Fontaine write the opening of the first edition I saw. I always want to return and read the book again.
