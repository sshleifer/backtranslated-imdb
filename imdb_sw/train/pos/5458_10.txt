I enjoyed this film. I thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and appropriate at any time in American history. There is every woman doing what she needs to do to plant a class system. I feel that Lilly's behavior was shown correctly and cannot be done properly. I enjoyed it more when he realized the love that was true. In all the movies all the people who came to her and they gave her everything, even lost their jobs for her. Until he met Cortland, he did not understand why these people had left everything with joy. His way of life had been completed was far from what he expected. I would like to recommend this film to any of the adult audience so that you can understand the contents and meanings of the placement of film and plot.
