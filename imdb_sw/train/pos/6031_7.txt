About two hundred members of the Cleveland film, Ohio USA, called Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 to see a typical Cinemascope film of the 1970s of Michelangelo Antonioni, "Zabriskie Point." Cinematheque director John Ewing, who works best to get the finest fingers in his series, cooperated with the pre-published audience from Italy for this only show. <br /> <br /> Listeners were held spellbound as the film revealed its artist on a great panoramic screens. Looking at this beautiful copy, shows how Antonioni wanted, made one know that this is a modern art work. It was more appropriate that the series was placed in the Cleveland Arts Council in the University of the University. Antonies songs are designed for Cinemascope settings. To assemble her with the image, paint the color, moving to the choreographic, all is the work of a true artist, using the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> Last audience can understand "Point of Zabriskie." As his description was revealed, it became clear that this work is not about the story to se, but instead of the short-art artist's presentation. The sequence of some chaotic activity over the sixties provides only a big motor for the collage of the moving artist. Antonon is not available for standard story levels, and can stop at any time by writing a creative event for a great artwork. The audience went voluntarily and the flow of his extraordinary ideas, as his great pictures in the large canvas were held simultaneously. When the audience can be only involved in behavioral relationships, they realized the theme here is to bring humanity, the head of the regular director. It also realized that no small or minimum publishing of this Cinemascope native could make the right for this special delivery. So the audience was more pleased to see "Zabriskie Point" in its original form, which can breathe, and break into the sounds at the end of the end.
