I like children's movies still done this; dark and deep. There was (getting this) character development (and Charlie is a characteristic of a dynamic character), the development of conspiracy, good animation, emotional engagement, and a sensible head, describing, and consistent. If not for a few of the dance-and-dance acts, you will never think this was a children's movie, and this is why I give that high score. This film is the best film, let's just for the children's movie. That brings me to my second step: this should be a movie of "kids" of the darkness that I have seen for some time, this comes from 22 years old. The last half with some of the first half of the movie, and all ended with one of the sad breaks that could come (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those who are 'Futurama' fans), and this is what makes this film so beautiful . Just because the movie brings the emotions that we don't like to feel and think it's bad doesn't make the movie itself bad; in fact, it means to succeed. Beautiful funny movies should make us laugh; awesome horror movies should make us fear; The sad sad movies should make us sad. My quote is, good movies should help you, not just attract them; This film has encouraged me. Also, this film is very violent for today's standards for children's movie and has a matter that, for today's standards, may be inappropriate for other children. Parents, I would like to look first. I don't usually say anything about this kind of thing, but I just saw yesterday and it became like a surprise to me.
