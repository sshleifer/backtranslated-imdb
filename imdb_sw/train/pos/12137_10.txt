It's amazing how this film is amazing! I have seen it regularly in all ages and I am always spellbound with it. The reason why the film is easy to look again is, of course, the performance of the capture given by young Bette Davis. He is not just stealing every area where he exists, but in fact it is a very beautiful and better picture here (not mentioning sexier) than it was in any film that made so far in his home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by RKO Radio Photo). She dresses very attractive and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those very beautiful eyes (especially, in the scenes of a restaurant in Soho of London). His body was severe when he was young. Get a burden on the cheap negligee that covers its great fight against Leslie Howard. And oh boy, he is quite strong in the area. Howard is very little too scared, but he attracts a sense of hero. Frances Dee marks as Sally sweet, very nice who really loves him. Max Steiner's color is interesting and painless. The most beautiful and delicious performances of the thirties make this a must see a version of the classic novel.
