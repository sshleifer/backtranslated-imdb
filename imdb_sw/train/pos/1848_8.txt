A few years ago, the Navy continued far from the decision of "Men of Honor," a film derived from the experience of the first struggle of the heads of chief of service to overcome racism. Then the intention to support films that show the best side of the U.S. Nimitz and two carriers of helicopters, as well as coastal parking machines, were given to strengthen this fictional story of the marine war and uncontrolled anger. Some films were shot in U.S. Belleau Wood. Antons Fisher wrote the first script of Denzel Washington's director where he becomes a star as the Psychiatrist Navy treat Fisher, played effectively and deeply with Derek Luke. Fisher is an open man for USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), the frontline of the attack helicopter. Fishers cannot be seen to avoid launching his own attack with a little exciting from his registered male. To be sent to MD as part of the possibility of separation before, Fisher opens slowly to a black psychologist, revealing a bad childhood of very indifference and terrible violence. <br /> <br /> The story grows as Fisher carefully but increasingly depends on his doctor and gets the courage to follow the interests of love, a registered vessel named Cheryl, played with a beautiful pair of wonderful Bryant. Fisher deals with the doctor by asking long-term questions but soon realizes he must find the answers, however pain, to grow and stop the destructive behavior that seeks conflict. <br /> <br /> When all the main characters are black, this story flows by running when unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and hypocrisy in the family environment. Viola Davis, a very good actress found in several recent films, is a picture of evil but not compared to the mother who raised it, Mrs Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short but those screens were available - if available - Oscar for gut-churning. Films about the patient-following interactions follow some predictions (all transfers transferred to the opposite) but Fisher's trust with his doctor / counselor joins. It is a good story, it is well told. Period. Putting in the Navy, "Antimoni Fisher" is not a real sense of services such as "Men of Honor," the best movie that was associated with racism caused by a real person. This is a true film about the blacks. It is about living a good childhood and, as Fisher says, being able to announce to adults that the victim is still "standing long." Sufferers are decreasing in size and importance as a brave and powerful young man claims his right to a good life with the help of a caring physician. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> My only humble is that Washington is an army of lieutenant but it is addressed as a commander. With all of the Navy support listed in the last credit, one should tell the Washington Director that his behavior, like all naval officers under the title of the commander, is considered as "Mr.." It's not the biggest resistance, it? :) I don't know why this film plays in very small movies. It deserves greater distribution. Derek Luke can get an Oscar appointment. <br /> <br />
