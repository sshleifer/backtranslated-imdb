Best entertainment pirate! It has all the best to keep one's mind - a fascinating story of the brain, a hot pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who has loved Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is out of a private message. They make a beautiful pair of beautiful screens on the screen - relax! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is meaningless, a bad pirate putting its network of dividing and winning. I saw a very beautiful face of Mildred Natwick with the responsibility of helping as Mrs MacGregor, the patron of the Little Patma (Alice Kelley). There is a beautiful picture of marine, ship, and bay. Locate a lot of fighting fighting swords, ship wars, high levels of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on the ship!). From the red hot red I heard once in Maureen O'Hara's interview that he boasted a great sexual command and he would also fight Flynn with swords on those days but there would be no need to put a test here. The most enjoyable movie.
