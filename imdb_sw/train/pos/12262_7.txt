Some thirty years ago, Author Numa Sadoul published an interview book length with Belgium Comic book artist Georges Remi (known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film is accessible to Sadoul today as he remembers the interview, when we hear the cassette (Herge died in 1983) and saw some old pictures and footage of the man himself. Some of the interviews were published in the book on the request of Herge, and we now know this to deal with his division with his wife, after he had a sexual relationship with one of his partners (who later would be his second wife ). The amazing thing that movies should not address is to move to the Tintin books from the first and fairly literary books (Tintin Congo, Tintin in Soviets countries) for anti-Indonesian books a few years later. Blue Lotus). In general, I come out of this film to know a few more things about Herge and see him as a little more unlikable when I enter the theater.
