John Thaw, the title of Inspector Morse, plays the old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and begins the Second World War. Little run, Tom has not yet received from his wife's death and child when he served during World War I. If you can think of General Morse Auditor and retirement, twice as crochety as he was a policeman, then you have got the character of Tom Oakley. But this stone's heart is over to melt. The children of London are being moved out of the blitz. Young William (Willie) Beech gives evidence to Tom. Willie plays for a good effect with Nick Robinson. This boy needs to take care of the capital C. After school, he still lays a bed, and he can't read it a little more trouble than his problems. He comes from a horrible history in London, and a mother who cannot cope, by gently putting it. Slowly, still faster, man and boy love each other. Tom gets his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. Look at Tom and Willie to build a bomb building at the end of their garden. See Willie's happiness is probably his first birthday party to Tom. It's not stopping, but Willie is taken by Tom after a lot of battles, and the pair starts a new life with their mutual love. In this film, Thaw and Robinson are following on a long line of movies where someone meets a boy and develop mutual love. Check out the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in the "Spanish garden". Or Gale Clark and Carlo Angeletti in "Started Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captain Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in the "Man without face". <br /> <br /> Two things of interest. This is the only chapter of Thaw that I know of where he sings. The only light of the song, New Jerusalem, but he sings. Secondly, young Robinson also watched on the second film with "Tom" in the head, "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on the novels of ordinary children.
