An American in Paris is a show of Gene Kelly. See if Gene sings, does and plays through Paris in any case. Some of the most beautiful, some fresh grain. One can only think what Kelly did as he did this film just one year before "Singin" in the Rain. "He is definitely one of the greats at all. It's amazing to look at the comparison between the two films, especially in Kelly characters, The only great difference that one is in Paris, the other in LA / / <br /> Some said that Leslie Caron's acting was under clean. Perhaps Cyd Charisse, who was originally interested in that role, could do well, even so Caron believes in the role and has a chemistry and Kelly. The short-term role of Oscar Levant in this film paid only what was needed, a man who does not look like Gene Kelly. as any other guide. \ tStatistics and dance dances are perfect. Even the highest ballet at the end of the film makes the film better than that. The screen to make the connection of that love is trustworthy, Minnelli used this sequence to make it look like you would like to spend four hours with it. Inenious! I will watch this film with Singin 'because it is very similar to the story and song. Singin 'would hardly find a nod because of Debbie Reynolds' efficiency. <br /> <br /> Full recommendations. <br /> <br /> star 8/10.
