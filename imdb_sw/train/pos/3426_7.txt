That is not a criticism on the film, but rather the opinion on how blind we are doing in our past. <br /> <br /> I recently looked at the Cold War, and the Ground Truth was like a remake look or an array - unless it was about Iraq instead of Vietnam. Like the Cold War because of one message, both films show how we interrupt the accuser into conflicts based on false misconceptions, and allow our young and brave (and often uninformed) to carry the violation of this war. All these films show that the idea of ​​being forced into the minds of young people with a desire to make them effective machines, but training cannot teach the diplomatic and police skills necessary to overcome the hearts and minds of people who are supposed to fight. This is finally what lost the war in Vietnam, and it may lose war in Iraq as well. My only negative opinion is that the film is one side can be easily approved as a left wing propaganda. Not for me, interested in you, but for those who want to despise the film and message. A more balanced view would talk to a large audience.
