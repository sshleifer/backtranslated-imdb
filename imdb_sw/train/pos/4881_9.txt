"Kaabee" shows a woman's difficulty before and during WWII, raising her children only after her husband was imprisoned for "crimes of thought". This movie was led by Yamada Youji, and as expected the situation of this film is very realistic. Although the historical accuracy of certain events, especially the coastal area, is a suspect. <br /> <br /> Acting in this film is very amazing. I am amazed at how they could collect all the stars that were hit by the 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most popular in Japan, of course without winning personal awards for its performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in the role of helping was very good too. He was in Asano Tadanobu though, who gave a very good performance, showing perfectly the skill of his character and the difficult situation he had. The video and the pre-war is not my thing, but thanks to leading and doing a good job, I had been bound by the story. Also, it was not as much left as "Yuunagi no March, Sakura no Kuni", and explores the controversial and non-repression of the government and the destruction of the brain that took place in Japan. A good film, it was recommended for all viewers.
