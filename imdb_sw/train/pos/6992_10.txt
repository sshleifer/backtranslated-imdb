I can't say this is a bad movie; in fact it is a very good kind of film that the label "poverty line" was giving at that time. Selected for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very good in his role as a skilled scientist, pretending to be a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his supporters have a bad habit of stealing young girls, and, after losing, they isolate Bela's wife and serum from their bodies in order to put the young. Lugosi is more than a job to make this film enjoyable, however, the movie faces a wooden acting star of coco Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Bofi (good name for the guy in the flick of fear) is the worst in this case. I have seen him in many movies and tv shows and he is always the same; hard, timber and powerless. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she also don't have the talent to do her reliable work. However, the viewer can enjoy a great Lugosi works still another program of dastardly just destroyed at the end! In spite of the poor and others exercises, "The Death Comes" is an enjoyable movie for all to see.
