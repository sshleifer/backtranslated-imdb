Add Victor Vargas is the movie you need to see. It was very hearty to see and have a lot of humor that gets you into. It's like real life and what young people are experiencing. Victor, a cocky boy, but with a good heart finally deals with love in all the right places to deal with girls and families. Finally Victor learns the real meaning of love after dealing with an old lady and a girl who wants to use it is actually to use it too. That's how much it feels this movie has. One heart felt that while it was when Victor's grandmother gave us a winner out of something simple. Victor was really encouraged and did not believe he would do something like that. It made me feel really sorry as it really was. I generally give this film B +
