The main reason I wanted to see this movie is because of an amazing cast. Tons of my dear actors in one film resemble amazing and outdoor actually see. But this movie has taken me away. It was not what I was expecting. It's been a while since I saw it but I remember I couldn't stop laughing !!! And it's not just the beat for me. Script was written awesome. Every time you expect something to happen did not happen. There was a lot of change and it turned out but it resembled the entire sound of the film instead of returning as well as engaging. Style, with the set, was also good. I can't say anything wrong about this film! To send, I would have Andrew Davoli during more screens!
