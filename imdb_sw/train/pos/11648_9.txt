There are people who claim this is "bad language" of Mexican film violence. They are the same, but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we've been. A bad fact hurts, or bores when you have already accepted the third-world view as the only possible goal. One of the most important aspects of the "Cero y van cuatro" is an open invitation to reflect on our current identity. Is that all of us? Is that all we want to be? I am out of the country and I realized how destructive is the Mexican community when the Tlahuac event came. I still can't understand the audience preaching the massacre. I was almost puked when I saw some pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small village near Mexico City when the damage was done by the controversial media and government. The same kind of trial in this film condemned me very much. Other stories were good to show other cases of corruption, dishonesty, cruelty and abuse, but I think "Tamales de Chivo" is much better. <br /> <br /> The movie is more than a "cabr√≥n" and "love" scream. That's meaning without comparing the actions of people. With a few discrimination they are all perfect examples of human waste. Such as in real life honesty is to be different than the rule in our country. In addition, loyalty is only given to a miracle.
