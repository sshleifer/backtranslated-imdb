Other speakers have explained the category and social models and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my enthusiasm for this small film jewel. It holds more well that 50 years later in each category - screenplay, act, photography, design set, sound design ... is really classic of kind. This was the first open to the "youth" Alec Guinness, and it is obvious from the first frames that made him special if he finally received knighthood. I am testing the "8" rate because it is basically a quick example that examines the human condition but is not quite good; and because the plot takes an easy way at the end, rather than solving disputes between inventor and mill workers and producers who drive him everywhere. Also, a few minutes of imagination reveals basic damage in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever a factor to decide in buying new clothes (especially wear clothes); The children grow, people change the size, get and lose weight, and go with the latest fashions at all, and have as long as the looms are dressed in clothes. And if there is nothing, the manufacturer would make a fortune to provide uniforms for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> Still, this is a good film. If you have the opportunity to see it at a regular movie station, you should.
