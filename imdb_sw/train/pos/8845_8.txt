The beginning of this film is a little clunky and also combine, but crust firmly, because you're on your life journey. The concept is compelling, and the most attractive material used to describe the general story. There are good performances all around, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have a good cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves a loan for very good performance as well. Trends with Mr. Lumet are excellent. The film has seven years of self-respect that the risk is taken in describing this story, but unlike many of the false films that surround the environment today, this is exciting which is based on relationships rather than special effects or sticks. You will get a great reward for the time you invested in this film.
