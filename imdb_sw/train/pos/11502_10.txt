As a follower / picture of forty cities and a former fan of Kolchak: A series of Night Stalker since my youth, one thing that is not mentioned is the amount of urban search of Carl's behavior during the series. He always managed to isolate in one large left, sewage or tunnel after another. He wrestled with his loyalty penlight (similar, so he had some flares in the first piece of the piece) with his camera, he never loaded any other gear to protect himself or make the search easier. many here, I recently bought a DVD box for two experimental boxes and the following TV shows, and I have been reading everything again. And although I remember looking back to the 70 years when they first gave, it was over 30 years ... many of them seem to be again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. They don't do things like these these days. Now everything has been created by regurgitated spin-offs and characters and predictable plots. Thank you, my 16-year-old daughter has been sitting down looking at the intervals with me and has created her thanks (enjoys genre). It gives me hope and confidence in the future to continue for new generations of fans for years to come.
