when I saw the movie the first time I thought it was boring because nothing happened but when all the horrible things began to happen as when the church died and brought to life and also the gage and her mother died and the father idiot has brought them up even though he now warns and hates Judith not Steven kings work best. I thought that his best work was shining. I don't think people who see this film and comment on how bad it was because they all think what they were thinking about. as if that person can do a better job in making a flick of fear. I mean doing evil and how he murders Jud is a professional. and make the most innocent character in one of the killers is cool. The people who did not like the movie are dumb because it is all scary movie and none. don't expect something from a film that doesn't. still in the general area was not good. I still recommend people to watch movies
