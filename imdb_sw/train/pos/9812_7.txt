"The great benefit" leads us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard striking a private inquiry in Dixon Hill. These texts form some sort of common form, occasionally on TNG with DS 9 and Voyager. After the entry of the holodeck object goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under a different situation of playing the game (shown by the failure of the holodeck security program). This concept is used to expand Star Trek capabilities and enable a variety of type combinations. Dixon Hill's Picard's stories are false examples of 1940-year-old crimes and their representation on the screen is known as Noir's film often have a leading antihero leadership in the lead (see Chandler's story of Marlowe or "Chinatown" for Polish all the time) ).

Those Holodeck "games" are commonly used for entertainment and reflect the personal interests of staff members. So the technical aspect is frequently ignored and from the same story the story has never been talking (but the Star Trek ever had technical, scientific point, I meant rather than some of the concept of utopic?) The biggest benefit ‚Äùshows Patrick Stewart, a McFadden assistant who has never been seen in the Star Trek period (at least earlier) and Data has a great image, too (although it is difficult to believe that connecting lights to plug out the wall without really surprised, actually that he was has done research on that period and its customs). Wesley continues to turn the peace tractors into potential killers (why they did not take him to the holodeck and allow the finishing groups to finish?) But all in this fun ...
