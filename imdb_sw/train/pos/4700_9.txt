I could not believe the rating of 5.6 on IMD about Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote that memorable piece as I can. To a large extent, to get the lowest score, the voters should have a very little sense of humor, not to mention a very clear open mind. If you do not like exciting thrills, don't look at them! Combining extraordinary humor, a very good story, and the release speed released by the most complex, this film has made its way to my DVD collection. And without mentioning the checkpoints placed here and there, of course, the use of "oleils" and "clich√©s" according to our organized crime movies. I showed this film to many people and, by bringing it without a special expectation (except perhaps looking at the comedy) - the real sense of the mind should look at any movie in my opinion - all liked it very much. It goes well, not long to look and no sharp decline in the evolution of the story, which I think is really straightforward. Certainly not perfect, some sex falls slightly, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering some of your comments. That's why I rated this 9 movie out of 10. This film is in my opinion as a precursor as "The Secret of the Top" and "Spaceballs" in the field of concern but concern thinking. Which is more modern and more time to reject the side of thought and ingeniosity. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think to understand correctly, if they don't. As the last word, I would like to say: see yourself, do not follow Joe's words and if you do not like that, then you will really know it was not good for your taste, but understandable in my opinion.
