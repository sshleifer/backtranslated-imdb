The shakespeare games has a way to pass time. Language somehow breaks the time barrier. but perhaps it is executives who do it really. After the disappointment at Romeo and Juliet (Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), he was concerned about taking another Shakespeare model. To my surprise Othello was good! Iago's character was well played by Kenneth's colleague! even discovering Iago is very bad and despicable, the behavior was played very well and makes what shakespeare focuses on the participant, being pleased with the audience to hate. I see that the fishburne performance here was also good too. I recommend this to the shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) alike.
