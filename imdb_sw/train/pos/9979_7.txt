To begin with, since this movie is a classic remake, the rating should be reduced already. Since this star version of Viggo Mortensen in the first role of Kowalski, helps. <br /> <br /> Isn't this like the US government though, terrifying one citizen. It seems like the character of Jason Priestley from the film! But it is true, the government will do everything possible to destroy a person's life by trying to get home to his wife. Wife, who doesn't work a little, and can't do it. "There was a time in this country that the police could take her pregnant wife." Words of Jockey Disc. <br /> <br /> There were great shots of the theme in this film, and a big car runs with a lot of spiritual. After much consideration, I released this film 7.
