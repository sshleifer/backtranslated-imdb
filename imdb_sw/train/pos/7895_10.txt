In the opening scenes of this movie the man shot arrows through the hotel room inside someone else's bathroom and blowing out all the lights. This should have been very much in 1936, but instead of the way out and had no connection with the film, Robin Hood did not seem like I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "August's whale", '87 was very young and interesting and made one of her best responsibilities in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey did not stop standing or be very sexy with her night clothes and also called her bicycle suit with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "Spiral Staircase", '46. Daisey even suggested marriage to Johnny on the Ferris Wheel down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a good couple, someone thinks to be very rich and another is a very poor journalist. From the stage, Davis and Brent had a real love affair, which is a good reason why there was a spark when these two appeared in this film. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is your film!
