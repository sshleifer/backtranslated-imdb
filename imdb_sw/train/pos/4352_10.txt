I was looking through the films in my area on yahoo and seeing a movie that was not advertised. I looked around and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. After looking at "Mad about you", once, I wasn't a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a big fan of Peter Falk. So the husband and I got the opportunity. We lost this story. Positive conditions, the heart attitude and the moral values ​​of the family and the values ​​that are often seen in movies and the world today. It's not that sappy imducted junk, but the real life situation from real people like life. I tell you, Paul Reiser was the best, though, still I can't watch "Mad about you". I don't know where this movie has gone. I heard it had been given for a small release. It should be with the world. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. M.
