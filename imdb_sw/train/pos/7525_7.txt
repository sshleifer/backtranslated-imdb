Bettie Page was a symbol of the restoration of the 1950s, when he represented the freedom of gender that was still ten years, but on the hopes and dreams of young people and many young people. Gretchen Mol does a very good job of displaying Bettie scandal, who was a little girl of the city with the prospect of acting with a good body. His work did not go elsewhere, but his body brought him to the peak of popularity in the field of acceptance. Photogrsphed in black and white colors and colors overlap as they come out of the world of exploitation in New York, this film made for TV (HBO) has good production practices and is very reliable to support. The problem is, emotionally rather flat. It is difficult to create an attachment to the character, because Bettie is shown as a person who was not very detailed and slick to be given the business she had. The government's surveillance surveillance is given a lot of screenshots, which eliminates the film to the end. But it is important to look at the history of the time, and to see the oppression of the heavy government which was the reputation of fifty years. 7/10
