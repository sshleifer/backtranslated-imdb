I love this movie and I have seen it a few times for years. It works best for every look. I agree with all the positive comments here. Yes, it is sincerely and cruelly if life in the garden was in those days. I found myself making comments as I looked at. One person here said Rip Torn has been sent. I couldn't agree more. He is as brilliant as he struggles, with bitter Clyde Stewart who says a little and works as a slave / stubborn. Conchatta Farrell is as wonderful as the widow Elinor, who Clyde employs as a landlord / cook (with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is better if a distant neighbor is called grandmother. The star is also a beautiful slope of Montana. It is a beautiful and cruel country that depends on it. There are some interesting and important events. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a perfect music track with a great script. Once you see Heartland, you never forget. It is eligible for every 10s receiving here.
