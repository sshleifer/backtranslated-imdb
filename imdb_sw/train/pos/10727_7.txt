This is a family film, which for some people is automatically extinguished. It seems that most people do not want to see films that are not available and weapons that cannot be defeated, free violence and enough to fill a New York phone book. This film is not one of these. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not need to accept the film as a fact. It makes only a good film that should do, which is voluntary to suspend unbelief for two hours and enjoy adventure. Casting is good, while not the best. As another advertiser said the voice of John Williams was, as usual, better. And the fact that many films were shot in Huntsville on a real space campus made it more reliable. It was surprising that the initial release of the film was delayed for several months due to the Challenger Shuttle tragedy, which could have a major role in the opening of the exhibition, but eventually the film helped focus on youth dreams most return to space and the possibilities within it. SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.
