Unusual historical celebrations, with beautiful scenes of war. Tobey Maguire provides good performance, and gets back well. The script is a learning and original original, and the film is taken with compassion without the heroes. That said, it doesn't drag a bit, and the last reel is very like a mini TV series. Still, Frederick Elmes camera's camera makes one interested in small pieces (and every time you see a shot that reminds you of David Lynch). Value to see.
