Personally, I think Sayonara was a very great movie he did. It touched every emotion from anger to love to complete the disaster. And Brando has to win the best actor. However, the movie is amazing, someone attracts for CHILDREN AND WORKERS and now you have no reason to see it! Do it, and fall in love.
