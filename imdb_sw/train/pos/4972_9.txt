LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt that I will see better this year. This positive view by the Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage has been set up in Wallonia industries. Benoît Poelvoorde has a father who wants his son to win a car (Lada!). By doing this the child should break the doors to open the record. What a father wants his son to be a man, because he has never made it more like a local journalist for the magazine known as L'Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing is happening as planned. This film can be well compared with CLOUDS to stimulate Aki Kaurismäki, although it is much greater and humor is black. Just like in this film however the tone is more than despair than humiliating and ending upbeat, without having a real fun. Humor is amazing, with no extraordinary conspiracy, and Mariage finds incredible pictures in settings that are not supposed to be seen. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the statement with Poelvoorde. The statues had fame and popularity with the brilliant worship of the master Ben. Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not sure of his ability to act and all the roles he was given with Ben's behavior. In his return to the lead role in the LCA he should have no doubt about his acting. He is just wise as a ignorant and evil man to keep his family in trouble, but smart enough to realize what he has done and burst and sad about it. Must see.
