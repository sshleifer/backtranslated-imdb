I have seen this film back, after I told it to my friend, who is a great fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself was very interesting, though it had its good points, which for me is Donnie Darko kind of "wtf?" The feature after the film ended. <br /> <br /> Of course, for positive also come negative points. For me, a little girl in the film was very good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job too. Unfortunately I have no comments about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This may be to me, and I do not claim to be a great critic, in a way that I do not consider myself sufficient, but he did not seem to be as attractive as an actor. But maybe it's more amazing then, although I'm not a critic, this takes my attention. <br /> <br /> Concluding, above all I think is definitely a film worth watching. It's interesting, mix, and you should just see it.
