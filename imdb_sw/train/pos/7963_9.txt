I have seen this about 2 or 3 times and I haven't regretted you. The closure of the house is not just a movie of ordinary animals. It is unique, pleasant and bursting and adventure. Things that make it an enjoyable movie are animals (clear) which are good training. Very good effort. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10!
