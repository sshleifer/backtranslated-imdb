This is a very complicated movie, and it is impossible to find a deal on what's going on. For the first time it seems to be a pedestrian movie about a person (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and instead emerges in one when the current tenant (woman) commits suicide. Then spinning and begins to start. Are neighbors trying to kill him? And why the tenant's clothes have turned into an apartment? Someone is wondering, finally, like Trelkovksy _is_ tenant before. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER We think when we see things from the attitude of behavior that we see things like that and that there may be a distortion of truth. We think when the camera shows us things from its amazing perspective that we see the reality - but Polanski has a false camera.
