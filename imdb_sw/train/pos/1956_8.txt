Actually, I think this movie is a more example of a simple goal than the worst film. In fact, movies have been done very well for many things and are very entertaining. Yes, the script is a bit of interruption, but that's the kind. The film has a noirish environment near the fatale of women. As well as the ancient folk of the tribe, this, too, has a screenplay which swings you around so you don't know how to get its meaning for the first time, and it can be stretch if you think too much and try to put all the pieces together. That's kind. In general, the script has enough surprise and returns to view the viewer and, in turn, wondered, without leaving the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also a simple goal. The fact is that he looks good and speaks to his two-entender talks through zhuzh on something wonderful, beautiful and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Trends are more than approved, because suppose - you should put the audience interested in "did it or did he not?" The question for two hours. In addition to the distorted script and good performance of the Stone, this has been done effectively through the guidance for the creation of noirish conditions which are dark and very modern and modern at the same time, and direct industrial lines go along with Stone sexy curves. The structure is always good - pause journalists anywhere and there is something interesting for the eye. <br /> <br /> The film also builds up efficiently on the gimmick elements in the first film and makes them the most realistic, especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how awesome!" is considered more of the fact here, and usually, the sex film is used with the best effect. You are still prohibiting, but you have not done so easily for the shock and buzz value as it was first. I won't say that it's still not a gimmick because, let's say it, this film should be fun. <br /> <br /> And a fun film is. It may be a simple goal, but if you look at what it is: noirish, women-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, made-he-or-he wasn't he-dunnit, you must enjoy (no planned pun).
