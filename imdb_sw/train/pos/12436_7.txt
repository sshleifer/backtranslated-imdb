I have read gently Blaise for several years now, collecting a line number. After the movie's fiasco made many years ago by focusing on the first book "Power of Blaise" I was surprised by the results of her. I got it a movie that didn't depend on action or violence. The director had taken into account history and psychology. How calm was made according to the story itself and what part of his life was affected and not his childhood. I think this thougths will give you more insight into the next film (I hope). I just loved the old fashion film. But everything was not good, gambling was not good. almost boring and unreal. Acting could also be improved. I don't think the bad person in this movie saw the truth, the only reason he was there was so softly could have someone tell him his story. They could also expand the film, show more about the time he builds the "Web" but I will think that for the next movie. <br /> And please forgive me for my bad English
