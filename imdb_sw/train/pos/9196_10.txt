The petto is a good story about a girl who one day gets a boy into a box that is outside his house one day. He decides to take her to make her cuts. Then he takes a mark for eating some food he has made and then going home because he was going to work. When he gets home he still feels he is still there. He tells him that he wants to live with him as a brother or a cousin. In desperation make him go and tell him that if he was pet then he could stay. And if the pet says that he had no right to do anything he told him. (not in that way!) With his surprise he agrees and since then he is known as Momo, his animal.
