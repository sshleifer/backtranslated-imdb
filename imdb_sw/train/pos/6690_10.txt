Men Siri is one of those movies that find funnier over time. There is a lack of guilt and "beauty" for the characters. It has become part of our “culture”, and we push the characters often. It's my popular film two years ago. My children are 13 and 11 and we all like this film. Acting great and comedy. We love the Galaxy and Monty Python's efforts also. Okay, we're not talking here, just connecting the Family!
