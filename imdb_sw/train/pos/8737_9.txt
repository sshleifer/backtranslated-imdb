For, people say Antz is the best. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed the Bug Life more. I can't remember Pixar animation, except two film's Toy Story, that I was laughing so hard. Animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't work. Voice sounds is what makes this film. Dave Foley is an ant of self-indulgence. The hopper is a very good reputation and Kevin Spacey is always amazing, just like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also good support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I can continue to continue. Script is wonderful, so funny and sometimes even touching. It does not have Antz's social messages, but what we have is a rock recreation. 9/10. Bethany Cox
