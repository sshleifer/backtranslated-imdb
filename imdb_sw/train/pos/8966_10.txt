this is a wonderful film, it makes the 1950s very nice. Kim Novak is fascinating and persuasive as a modern witch and one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All support is great, from Jack Lemmon urging Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as a Magic writer in Mexico who works in Magic in Manghattan, for Elsa Lanchester as a little pastor and also a Queenie witch. And then there's a cat- I don't know how many witches (instead of me) have called Pyewacket cat but suggest zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but just like his character is out of the ace; in this wonderful world of magic and magic. Ideal. And it has an end to romantic pleasure, which we believe because this vintage movies have an end to happiness. Gillian and Shep certainly have a great opportunity to have fun after Rose and Charlie Allnut in the African Queen (another great film)
