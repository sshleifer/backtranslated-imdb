My son had 7 years when he saw this film, he is now the Russian Fishing tool and says that the movie was much more and with whom the heart lingered even this 39 years is the Legend of Boy and Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get this for him. I am sure that a lot of things through his head as he has only 3 hours of the day and he has been on the ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract ends. Since we have Indian blood linking to this film. January 27 returns to the age of 47 and I would be able to find this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a fisherman for a period of 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. What? Can you help me find this film? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
