In fact I can say I heard a movie in its right corner where the mind games from the reality of dreams come into the surreal future of the future facing Tom Cruise. I didn't care too much about the effectiveness of Tom Cruise but I must say that it looks amazing everywhere on the film ... not only because of the story of engaging but also because of his self-respect. and beautiful. However I must say this movie does not come under the "flick average weekend" which you take easily and look at; It takes a strong feeling and characters so do not hug this down with your beer and pop-soul. Surely it requires more than that.
