I know this technology is not a great TV show at any time, I mean it was shot on the video and its shortcomings in all the radio and visual parts. Acting can sometimes be a little too little, I love this show too much.it the fear of hell me when first opened in 1988. Of course it would have been 5 years old but I recently bought a DVD of the first 3 events, which unfortunately I hear now it was deleted.and i also heard the listener can not be released again because of the bad sales of the first DVD. Also the TV show did not have the same emotions as the movie, I really thought it had a sound more than sin.even though the color of the palette is the same as the dream on the elm 4 road (the film and TV show were held the same year), this has The loudest sounds when the fims continued to get more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing, I like Freddy as a cracker. This one has more than a sense of fantasy, it has been enhanced by a consistent perspective of lense.im is not sure if it is his purpose for the part of the creators to show or for the shortcomings of the video. I like this show, and it's not considered as one piece on movies can be fun.
