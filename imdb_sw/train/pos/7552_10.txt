CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the Nekojiru manga story. It won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6 Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at the Japanese Art Gallery. When the soul of the kitten Nyaako stolen by Death, he and Brother Nyatta begins a wonderful journey to get it. In the surreal dreamroad of the other side, they meet with many fantastic and wonderful characters, often sad adventures <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is anime like anything you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, very beautiful and has great potential for attention and sound. CAT SOUP is a modern surgeon (no conversation) and sometimes cruel and gory. It is therefore more anime than adults (they can't fully understand!). A great trip for those who have the opportunity to see this absolute. Must-look!
