Two years ago I watched "Matador" in the movies and I liked everything about this movie. Obviously, I was under the impression of the great responsibility of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday, I bought this film on TV so I watched a little more. Now, I can truly say that this film is not special but you just gotta 'love because of one person. Brosnan raises his bridge in my opinion and the amazing performance of Julian Noble, a tired old man who has no friends. Recently Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, the unfortunate man: his son died in an accident, his work is not well and he does not know that he can put his wife Bean (Hope Davis) > I always loved movies like this; movie crime with a great touch of humor. Additionally it comes from Brosnan as he says jokes about young people and big d .... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on Sunday morning, after the left city of navy." Brosnan says to his charm when he drinks his usual margarita. I also like Greg's 'ordinary face' Kinnear in the place of the loser which is very interesting because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend you to look at the best possible role of Brosnan forever. He will make you smile and praise him at the same time. Great Brosnan in the movie is not the same.
