This movie has many comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one. He shows his attractive side and it was very strange to see him blowing. His training is "unorthodox" and who could think of connecting the finger could be very bad? Lots of great queues and choreography. So much creation! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang in a mix and you have a wonderful surprise! Do not mess with Manchu strokes; they are worried!
