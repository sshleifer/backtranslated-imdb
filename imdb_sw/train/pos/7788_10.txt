I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are beautiful. Ruby <br /> in Paradise is one of the best. It is a very beaten movie which you really should look around and appreciate. The story of a woman tries to make herself and refusing to give in to temptation that will make her life easier. Some of his movies like Kisses and Time to Kill were probably good at the box office and video taxes. They were very good movies <br /> <br /> also, but do while looking at Ruby and I think you agree it's one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
