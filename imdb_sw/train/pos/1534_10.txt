I like to show this as a full-tempered action, love and preference. Well sometimes love! It is good to see a show where all the characters work together and treat each other with respect. It is also good to see Dick Van Dyke in the role of television as I have seen him in Mary Poppins. A mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve are joining the audience. This is to show what you are going to!
