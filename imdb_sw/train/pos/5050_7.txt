We were very happy Gray Owl: well a well-told tale in the classic Attenborough fashion: a little more-romanticized, and archetypes, humor, and trouble with respect and values. <br /> <br /> Beauty shot and told to nice This step is a true story of Archie, an Englishman who came from India's origin, and went to live with a trap in Canada. <br /> <br /> A strong show from all makes this film a simple message to see. The two stars of this film are undoubtedly the most obvious we have seen - and the message is good with its educational schools. It must be great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique characteristic and this is a suitable film of the film.
