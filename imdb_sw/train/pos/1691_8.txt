This movie is fun and appropriate for any age. It is definitely the entertainment type of family. Sent there is a good job of playing people in the mid-western city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we should not think anything happens since the excitement (before the invasion) of the decade is new (and only) from the Interstate station. The area is appealing as it can be boring and it is not possible for land invasion and Martians. But these Martians do not know at all, despite having the weapons of the right and deadly weapons ... including one set on ending the Martians, too! The Martians are dead - they line up and give us a good voice just to make us viewers and locals want to help ... from the world. J. J. Anderson playing a traditional Halloween bathroom has just a good line. Watch this film for laughing and entertainment; to convince them not. But the trick and enjoyable is.
