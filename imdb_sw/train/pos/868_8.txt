It is very French about this film is when it is used to introduce two leading characters. This may require a little tolerance, especially since there is no “interesting” in the typical Hollywood definition of such. However, once the "heist" comes in, the film goes quickly, perhaps very quickly. But it's a real trip to the rollercoaster and if you don't look very closely it is all quite real. The kind of film you know Hollywood would have been closed.
