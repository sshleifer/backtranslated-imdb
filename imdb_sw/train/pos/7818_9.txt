I think the context of the story is covered by other banners so I would just write about this film's impact on me. I saw this film the year of release in 1987. My school organized a movie trip to see it, for RE project I think. We all went together for doubt because we were on a school trip to movies! We don't know what we were getting. To this day I have remembered the feelings that came into me and I remembered as many of my friends. I think when we had discovered it to be surprising and quiet with anger in our youthful way. served my purpose in my case.
