National Lampoon Reunion risk is the first comedy film from 80 years that combines unique characters, lots of votes, and good music from Chuck Berry. While Walter Bailor is completely abused by classmates in high school, he takes the opportunity to take revenge on his class. Directly beat their classmates who include a blameless girl, a fat boy, a high school of high school, a king of all preps and even an old lunch woman who attended all children at high school. This film has a kind of horror and has a few short sex so I don't recommend young children but it's a good movie for young people. If you are looking for a movie and a good score, the complex characters or the effects of the killings may not like the Reunion Class. If you want to stay for 90 minutes and have some fun and fun (and who don't) then this film should be on your movie to see the list. ++
