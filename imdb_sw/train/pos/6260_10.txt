This was to stimulate the soul! I am in Iran, and I live in the 21st century, I did not know that these great tribes have been in such a situation at the time of my grandfather! You see today, or even 1925, one side of the world woman or child can have everything used for her or clean, but here 80 years ago, people tried their lives to go somewhere with grass . It is interesting that these Persians bring these problems to feed their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. Thank you for the Americans who followed this tribe, they were as hard as the people of Bakhtiari.
