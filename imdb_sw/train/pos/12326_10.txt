I saw this film first in Berlin film, and I have never seen a movie in Hong Kong before. I felt like I was sitting in a spinning basket: the act was very fast, and there was no one interesting time in the film. It has martial arts, love, special effects and good plot. My favorite part is when the Taoist drinks, singing and battles for myself - one of the many scenes that emphasize the wonderful part of the movie. This film must necessarily!
