If you have any kind of appreciation for the behavior and conversation, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of material to play in this film. It may have been the first time to play, and that's why the discussions are heavy, but I can't stress how these images that we just understand are made to be wonderful and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This film is better than any college course by telling you how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
