Nick and Kelly are ready to marry but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a wonderful blue wall which will exchange half to Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick likes to drink, smoke, and play pool and fellas for fun but Nick suddenly avoids this kind of fun. Sex is one thing he likes because he wants a child. We see that the visitor's tournament is dying and needs to be associated with women from the world to save their number. It becomes a battle between humanity and foreigners and the number of dogs also involved. Good movies.
