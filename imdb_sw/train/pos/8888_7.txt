This movie started slowly, then it got faster towards the middle. However, the fact that the movie fled the second night broke the speed at its peak. The second part of the truth was interesting, but provided a way to finish just pathetic. Play soccer in the yard? True, can it get again sappy and maudlin? Now I hear the same movie plans according to '70s. I can't make any great effort to create within it if something like "The '60s."
