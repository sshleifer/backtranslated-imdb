Excellent political stimulation, played more and more slowly than other high-ranking films in this type. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how can they jump on these amazing performances? Stories of friendship, father-son relationship, corruption and deception. Two players of the amazing gel well together, and help from Aiello and Fonda are also amazing, although Aiello is a brilliant, especially when the paper run to the media. Instead of focusing on the greatest scam of corruption, it creates extraordinary characters who reflect the human side of political corruption, the last events and each of the main characters is wonderful and practical.
