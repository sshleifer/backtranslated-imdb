I first saw this as a child living in East London. The eyes of Hitlers Luftwaffe were very obvious and the movie atmosphere reminded them of our road. I remember having a dream after seeing it. The strange thing is that it has never been seen as part of social history in the Cinema concept. In addition to world wars, the scope of the machine was very bad, more than Nano-Technology now, but in general, good and well done. It was interesting to see how the air travel was known back then. I would like to think that running a flight from a huge gun would certainly kill the scientists. However, much was correct. Men want war, human beings. Ways of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
