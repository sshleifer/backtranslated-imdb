I enjoyed Longstreet, which followed Raymond Burr's successes of Ironside TV series and was aimed at providing competition. But this show was deleted after one season because it decided - I believe wrong - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr Irrish Ironside. I can add that the show of this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope that a set of Longstreet box will happen. Writers should note that this story of the story has been briefly considered here and that much more can and should be done to show play and disability in TV.
