The story line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and sometimes also extreme in their thinking / attitude. More than necessary. Also, I think something wrong in making. John Turtorro does not really believe I play a player of the autistic chess, not talking to an Italian player. Restrictions are not explained very much. <br /> <br />
