"The Big Thing Last" is a beautiful satirical film which sardonically drives the pop culture to a humorous self-desctruction stage. The characters are very interesting and interesting to laugh. That brings me to the introduction of my favorite characters ... Simon Geist is a man who came in the early 30s / 40 years who creates a culture-run editorial magazine called "The Big Big Thing". The thing is, this newspaper is not true, and it is Simon's excuse to be close to the actors by interviewing them, just to beat them-blowing badly, insulting their way of buying in pop culture. His girlfriend, Darla, also writes a newspaper (which is true), which relates to him and Simon, with him and his father. Darla is a truly desirable character (or recommended), based on how you see its neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, I loved the best. Brent is a flat-characteristic character, such as Tedra, a video-video queen for a band group counted B. Still, these characters wear a very interesting network together. And this film asks all the questions people have and what they do and why they do it. Her good film and I show you you will see if you're in a crowd of house / art. Write my logo! <br /> <br />
