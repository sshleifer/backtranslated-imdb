You must see the film for anyone who has ever gone to the camp, or wanted it. This film takes the essence of what the summer camp is about. It is surprising, it is a pity that makes you want to look more about the characters once the credit begins. If you haven't seen this film, what are you doing? Leave with you and continue the video store. Have a good time :)
