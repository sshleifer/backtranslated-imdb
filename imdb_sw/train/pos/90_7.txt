Yes, the poster is an awesome job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was the same ... there was nothing very real ... I was hoping that he would be a hard drug of hard and totally reject Life. Ah, but that can't happen to rich children now can? It is not the son of a rich businessman who has a small rubber party and has a well-chosen lawn in front of the mini house. No ... the child is very good to have his life completely canceled. After all, who will drive a new SUV car and who will go to law school? Ah, poor rich children ... in their beautiful home, and their league schools, clean homes and social parties ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope all are used by drugs, lose their lives and end up in jail ... so maybe we can see movies that are not all around the poor and poor little girls of the surreal world.
