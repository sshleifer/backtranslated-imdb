Especially is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but usually directors start from historical facts to talk about something else, or also shows the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during a few days when the revolution is doing. It can also be seen as a kind of documentary. The movie focuses on these two people, showing as usual they were, not as ordinary heroes, because the revolution from people. Although released from the military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights during the entire movie, the best work for the director to be his first movie, he will not fall the banal way. Well-expressed emotions and people's enthusiasm. Maia's character (the main one) has been well done and there is a good interpretation for Stephen Accorsi, capable of showing the boundaries of Maia, this is not to be a hero.
