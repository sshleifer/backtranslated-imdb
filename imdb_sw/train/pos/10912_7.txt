"The old Bradford mother" (1936), Thin star star William Powell (this film was released the same year as the second Thin Man film, "After The Thin Man," is very close to voting and fun film Thin Man, but still lacking. However, it is a very exciting, entertaining fun in the comic vein. Is myrna Loy missing?, I would like to be tough in the name of a better alternative than Jean Arthur. Arthur and star-star William Powell is a real and fun, romantic and inclusive. Anthonyu Vieller and partner of John Wyne production company, James Edward Grant ("Angel & The Bad Man") is close to being and the efforts of the Municipality, but they have no beauty and sizzle. <br /> Although it is not on the stratosphere of the movie "The Thin Man" (what else is it?), "former Minister of Bradford" is one of the most entertaining and several more the secret-comedy "made-its" 30s & 40s.
