Page 3 is a great movie. Stories are fun and interesting. Not once in the movie I found myself looking into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the cinema, although I think the most happy person or enthusiasm would be better, but he did a good job. All helpers were also very good and helped the movie together. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands in this film THE STORY is good, and really, it does not blow around the bush is straight forward in sending its message. I think the movie more like this should be made, I am ill-watching the same film of sweets of floss regularly, they are hard to dig now. Everyone should watch Page 3, is a good film. -For my 2 cents
