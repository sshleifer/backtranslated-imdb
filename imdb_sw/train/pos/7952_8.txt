This is one of my favorite family movies. He loved it when I was young and still continues with me now that I am an old man. I still laugh at all old jokes and may even cry for tears. I have never taken care of many animals talking, or at least UN-animated but this will stand up. It is a good old movie but always will place in my heart. It is not any live animal movies that I can think of when they can't compare it, forget it alone like this. I might give many features to this movie but I don't think the show. I believe the great message that "Home is where the heart is." Or at least that's the message I received from them. Indeed it was recommended for a good night of family film.
