It's not a good shot, well written or well done but it has to be an addictive show that I've got since Twin Peaks. Each revelation is well placed so that you can see the next section to find any type of closure. They have steadily decreased the show where they just reveal a small amount of information each section but feels like they have just told you everything you want to know. Yet some acting is on the worst and some of the duologue is very difficult. Other characters are very double. The most skilled artists like Locke and Ecko are very active on actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be exciting as the next section cannot show what the previous period happened. Bad stadiums have been part of a story that sometimes hasn't told you anything. However, the second season has changed until the stories back to more about the island than before. All in its show all but not complete.
