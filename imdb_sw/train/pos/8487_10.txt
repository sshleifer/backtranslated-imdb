I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother, and wondered why she would cry constantly in the last few minutes. I, of course, have got a whole hilarious movie, especially the ways of the characters. It was not there until I was old and I watched it again that I realized how much the depth of this show really was. Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe highlight their work as reluctant solutions. Keaton holds surprises with its real-line style, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I thought also that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was just wonderful in his role as a comic aid. I think this movie is one of the films hit down more than 80 years. And now I understand why my mother felt how she did during the closing time. I'd like to have one of these cars, too.
