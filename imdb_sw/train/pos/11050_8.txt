Yes, magic works in mysterious ways. This film about 4 detainees, trying to escape with the help of narration, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a great joy of magic and an amazing end and insisting lots. Even if it had something to the theater games (almost everything that happens in the cell) was not boring and it was done very well. In the "Cologne" culture you felt that you were dealt with by the Partners and even if they were criminals, you have been sympathetic to some of them, just to change your mind by misleading the story. Some events were looking for care and there was a brain touch in the air. With the edge and entertainment and if I didn't expect anything (a friend leased), it was a good surprise!
