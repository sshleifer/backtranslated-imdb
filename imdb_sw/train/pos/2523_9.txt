When I first heard about the Child of the Moon, I thought it was joke. After a few months, I thought I think it's true. A few reviews I read that had no text of fangirls that had been unsuccessful. When I was given the opportunity to look at it, I prepared to mourn, delete, and otherwise I must close my eyes to avoid damage. <br /> <br /> I was most surprised, and in a good way. Yes, Sandy Day has its time of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness - I think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, an unknown person for its purity - but all in all, it was completely enjoyable. No, it's not the work of the movie theory but it is very real, exciting, delightful to the touch, a touch of touch, and a happy thrill. I know little Japanese movies so that I can't judge the act really but based on the fact that when they spoke a language or a very big language at the same time and that some of them don't have the experience of acting, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good movie, good game, good comedy, watch this film. At least pay taxes since it comes to the Region 1. <br /> For a side note, there is a sexually suggestive sex / homoerotic in this film. I couldn't even see a lot of subtext. Do not let the people who read so much in this area destroy this for you.
