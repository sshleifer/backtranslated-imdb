I agree that it is not the love of Oliver! as a small child - it's a long time, and the story is small to move because of all the music numbers. As a young man I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Instead of thinking like the change of Oliver Twist, think of a festive story of a classic. Settings are free at best, but in fact, if you're looking at music, it's not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is the basis of this film, and a large number of it is stellar and very interesting. Most or all of the strings were included in the version of music action, and shows in their exhibitions - and I think this is included. All exhibitions are in the most stylish style of the most common films, and are very entertaining. Away is a child playing Oliver, whose work seems to be a good look and stay out of real musicians. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a wonderful job to maintain the presence of fear screen as Bill's Sykes. Even the dog Sykes Bullseye puts good performance. This video is not for everyone. People who hate music despise them, like those who are pregnant too seriously. Searching for information about the historical details of the error or the evil of the action of the spread of the act to do the wrong act will ruin anyone's happiness. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's better if you remember that, like music, it's fantasy planned freely around the book, not tackling tough.
