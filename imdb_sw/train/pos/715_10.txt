All people who sit here and say that the film's film is Ramones perhaps he will say Amadeus was the same as not for the angry harpsichordist. The Rock and Roll High School was near Ramones. How anyone can look at this and not get a Joey Ramone kick to eat bean seeds after an attempt to stop him from making it clear square squares square. Mrs. Trogar, blowing white mouse, hallway patches ... classic acute. Don't recommend Riff Randell's behavior. If you do not like Ramones then you do not know the rock and roll and are eligible to watch a film called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
