I liked this film very much. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide reliable performances, and Harris are enjoyable on. Lighting and shooting in some of the events of Harris makes his face look real diabolical. The amazing end of the plot at the end makes it interesting. It's not a great movie, but it's a fun one. I gave 7 out of 10.
