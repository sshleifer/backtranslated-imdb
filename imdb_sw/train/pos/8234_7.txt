"Fido" should be praised for taking the form of fatigue, Zombi, and making it an original film experience. The early atmosphere of the 50s is a wonderful, dynamic acting, and all the production shows many careful plans. Suddenly the viewer is introduced into the world of good old cars, clothing "Eisenhower era", furniture furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss "Fido" as a cartoon cartoon, similar to "Tank Girl", but these two movies are very different. Fido has a structure, a script describing the story, and acting that is the best.
