This film takes you sometimes when there was a different pace of everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how the family had to deal with war and how quickly we sent young people to fight. Look for a very touching and reminding that war casualties have not just happened. With our luck we have never gone through what our grandparents, grandparents and parents went to during The war. This film, I think, is small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as Peter O'Toole a little and Russell Crowe is quite attractive and as Australia can. It is obvious to listen to him reading "High Flight" and he makes me wonder what he can accomplish with Shakespeare.
