This film has come down through the movie history cracks. It is much better than other New York films such as: "French relationship" or "Take Pelham 1-2-3". There is a sense of feeling for this film that will also be able to use humor using a plot line. It is from the beginning to the end and it has not been destroyed by age as with the above two examples. Ron Liebman returns in the performance of the brarel as "Batman" and is embarrassed his work didn t stop as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> The Gordon park spells, and comes as it does after "Shaft", it seems first to be a wonderful choice. However it flip the side of the original effort and approached just in the face of your horizontalismism / <br /> Unfortunately this film has never been found on DVD or VHS in the United States. True Union artists have a gem on their hands and are embarrassed to do nothing with it.
