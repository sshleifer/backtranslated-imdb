I had a chance to see snippets from the original Aardman run of this show in the UK. It was always fun and normal. There is no deviation from the translation - it's as clean as the people interviewed - whether it's some scripted or not, as it was corrupt, it's beside the point. It is constantly entertaining. Aardman Examples Illustrations show good ideas in the characters used for each voice, one aspect that I probably like most about the show and its concept (enmity between pandas, snakes talking about needles, ape painting ). Frequently it grows up to you, like young horses and asses from Maryland, many couples (carrots, insects, and cats for a few) and children's behavior, and I have come to dig ferret! Monday will finally be the day that awaits.
