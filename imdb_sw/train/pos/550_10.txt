This is a very strange movie, West about an individual who cares about (Jimmy Stewart) going to Klondike for gold. Along the way, he gets trouble with local advice in Alaska (John McIntire, giving good practice of evil), who lost it. McIntire threatens to be a dead person if he comes back through his city, unfortunately, the only way to return to the Nations. The main chunk of the story is about the city of Klondike's Dawson's city turning down with new residents from McIntire town. Ruthu Roman, for example, who has come along with Stewart and two colleagues (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds the saloon (front of Hollywood to house house) and tries to run the town's restaurant make a place out of business. He gives way to McIntire and his goons coming, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the highest peaks of the West, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is only a little too small, and it has 99.9% of what made the film unique, of course, hearing as a cheap copy. As a Spur Naked, Country Apart has beautiful pictures, on the cinema area. Theme is very good. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost the same as his 1954 great achievement, the Back Window). I think it can be taken as a cliche, if he begins a selfish fool and learns how that kind of life is out at the end. However, Stewart plays very well, making this character very human. And the help displays are quite amazing. In addition to those I said, the French actor Corinne Calvet is very good. And I must blow out Walter Brennen, too. It seems to be special in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, for he is, for the first time, the only character that can bring humanity to man. Screenplay is very well written, and the direction of Mann is impossible. The masterpiece. 10/10.
