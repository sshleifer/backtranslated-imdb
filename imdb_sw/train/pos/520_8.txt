My only little and the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY going to Heaven, is the fact that RAYMOND MASSEY is amazing for the last twelve minutes in the experimental area. And the attempt itself, IMO, is the most interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are astounded as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY who offers the best and most reliable performance. . French MARIUS GORING is happy (he even gets information on Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger sent to join Niven when his death war will be done because of the observation. Goring has the most beautiful lines and gives them with pleasure. See this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or more years, I think it's a great example of the 1946 best year was for the film. Technicolor's photography, much less and less, is the best and how you exchange it in the B&W for the heavenly order is done with good ideas and efficiency. The opening area is a type that draws a viewer into a fantasy story of the story - and a discussion of Niven's time with radio hunters during his flight to the world, unexpectedly leads to the encounter of memorable love . Truly amazing film from beginning to end, another victory for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
