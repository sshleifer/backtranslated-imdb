I have decided to believe what the famous critics say. Although this film did not get the best views, this film made my day. It made me think. This is a false world. What do you do when most of your loved ones deceive them? It is said that no matter how often you feed the milk for snakes, it will never be faithful and dry when you are given a chance. The same way with other people is that they never thank. This movie is about how self-centered people can be and how everyone thinks about themselves and working on their own. The brother dies carefully in the hands of the gangster. The brother continues to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the vanity of this world. There is nothing real and no honest person to anyone. Amitabh gave the performance of his life. New actress Aryan gave good performance. Migizaji who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. His role was small but he demonstrated his commitment to the fact that one was guided by his performance. Chawla had a beautiful face but her role was very small and was not given an opportunity to express herself. <br /> <br /> Great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His movies always provide a message to the audience. His movies are like Nanak Singh's novels (a Punjabi author whose novels have had a purpose and have had social goals) because they have a true message for the audience. They are entertaining as well as providing a lesson.
