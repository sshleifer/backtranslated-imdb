One of the best films made! Why just get a 7.6 rating is hidden. This film is a window in the world of black experiences in the United States. It should be a must look for all white people and children all over 10 years old. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Plots," think again. Do not miss this movie, which should win Oscar. (And read the book, too!)
