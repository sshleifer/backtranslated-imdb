In 1967 In the Blood of the substance was perhaps more like "the real thing" (Think about it: do we really want to see something real?), But it was black and white in the color world, and many people didn't even want to know what, there was a chance to do it on television. Further, if you create it, you can show other things not previously shown. The Cold and Truman Capote Bloodbook was "the first novel". Truman's book was not 100% true for real stories. I thought the Canadian area was enough for Kansas very much for the TV movie. Check out the sex stuff, drug and rock 'n' roll: Dick's womanizing, Perry to be a junkie aspirin, Perry playing guitar blues.
