A young woman who is a successful fashion, and also engaged in marriage, and who has tried to commit suicide in the past, has been chosen by a secret and remote Catholic priest to be the "sentinel" next to the gate of hell, which appears through the old palace, \ t but is well preserved in Brooklyn. Its tenants take a step up and they can make themselves, but it seems unlikely to escape for a long time as a sentinel is there to block the way. The former (John Carradine) is about the dead, so he, in the end or whatever, will be next, and the punishment must give him to kill himself. Many interesting details are under the face, his relationship with his father, the stories of the defendant, his wife, so one can stop this as fear of cheap exploitation, but due to sets, cast, and the overall level of skill, this it's obvious to see.
