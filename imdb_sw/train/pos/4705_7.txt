All who voted less than 5 are definitely not fans of fresh humor, language-and-cheek. Keaton is a brilliant in this - as in most of his work. This is not a blockbuster, something bigger than life. This is a bottle, a slapstick hit with some of the best Hollywood actors (and very brave). Piscopo was the same as the dog's wannabee, once. If you want to see more fun than what has been done, you have seen Dimitri make a piece like Morone. <Br /> <br /> I paid 7.
