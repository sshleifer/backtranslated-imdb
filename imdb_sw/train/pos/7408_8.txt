I had the opportunity to see this film at the Intenational Film Film Festival of Rotterdam. 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200.000 movie under the film about the father and his two sons. The father has a traditional hut somewhere in the traditional Chinese village where many people, many years old, come to rest and bathe. The father has children: a 'lost' child who lives with him and a child living in a modern capital and who comes to visit him. For this traditional village, the bathhouse and his brother 'lost' seems to be strange and offensive, but this changes in the film. <br /> <br /> Though the story may seem cheesy or cliche, it is not. For the most beautiful performances, especially the father and son 'lost' (sorry, I do not know their names) and a good movie story was touching and funny at the same time. If you have a chance to see this film do it. It is a good alternative to creating Hollywood movies. <br /> <br />
