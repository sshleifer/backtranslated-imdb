I rented a domino for shock, even I did not know it was inspired by a true story, and though it is biopic as possible and of course you probably see. I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Kelly is writing many of the squares and notes in 2 hours of clean entertainment. And once you have seen it more than once you get and appreciate it. Domino is an example that turned out to a virtuous hunter who leaves a beautiful Hollywood career to pursue a non-cunning or perfect job. It has a journey of travel journey offered by director Tony Scott. And for quick and editing music, it provides an opportunity to watch your attention, and dirty exhibitions and unexpected comedy, the film is made well and enjoyable and should be reached with a broad audience. I recommend to anyone who wants to think and be happy at the same time for 2 hours.
