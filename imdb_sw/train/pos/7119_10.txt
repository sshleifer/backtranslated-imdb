My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (ret. Great, US Marine Corps), was Guadalcanal and lost his foot to the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was shocked to know that my father was a technical adviser to this film and I hope that he had an impact on the film by making it similar to the way it was back then, as I read it in various comments written by the viewers of this film that seemed like real life. My father is faithful to facts and figures, and always wanted things to look like they were so I would believe he had nothing to do with it. He / she now lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (surprisingly, she is Japanese), and a few years ago was given one of the top qualities from the Japanese King for a donation and his activities to restore Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur blocked them after WWII. My father was once at sea but I know that once you are in the sea, you are in the sea. And that's exactly what I love and respect him. I would like to be able to watch this film if someone has a copy of it. And I would like to give my father to his birth 94 this year!
