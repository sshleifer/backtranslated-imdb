I loved this film, and I am one of the older people who shouldn't enjoy, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - caring? These types of movies have never been. But surprisingly, there is a message in it. It is that everyone should be able to be whatever we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is the best in this film. I've been thinking that she is like one of Katharine Hepburn. Therefore, it is good to see that both Hepburn and Posey performed movies about the library (Hepburn is Desk Set). All libraries, especially those with a sense of humor, should see the Party Girl. I donated this 8th film. It is not any way to make a good film and movie standards, although there are some of the best shoes in it. But it's very strange and highly entertaining.
