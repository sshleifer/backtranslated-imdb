What can I say about this film that didn't say already? well tell you a lot really fake looks like some slaps and kicks. how charlie she knew though this was really I dont know. I'm sure they'd be playing and catching him as it was. however the events and stretch and hot fat are very real. and the last needle in the eye area has been done surprisingly and it is probibly the only thing on the film that has ever been awesome.
