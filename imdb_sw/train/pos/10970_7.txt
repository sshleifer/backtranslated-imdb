Interesting but still combining look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin for Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a damaged donkey's house, which was considered to be a health hazard and a city. It becomes very clear that these two have passed well. Little Edie seems to be far too far as he does with the thought of ten years though he is actually 53. The content is pretty much created by two things. The first is the conversation of Little Edie Lambastes Big Edie by transferring all his heroes and destroying his job as a writer, actress, and player. These discussions often have positive, useless, and often interesting views. The second part has a long conversation of trying to sing on both sides. Everyone thinks their singing is complete and it is only one who looks bad. In one wonderful scene Big Edie realistic attack Little Edie and its cane only provoke him to stop his battle. It is very interesting but one feels that they are the greatest exploitation here and the lessons are too far to know. The film workers seem to treat this as a freak show in the circus, coming every day to record (and chuckle) in any strange character can come up. Finally this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has just passed these two. Their hopes and dreams have perished as the house they live in. Despite their confusion, these need each other more than ever. For without the other there will be no refuge from solitude. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats isolate themselves in his bedroom. His answer to the complaint about the smell is just amazing.
