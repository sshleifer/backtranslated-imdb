In the history of movies according to comic books, "Hidden Men" is one of the most underrated ones. This is not an ordinary movie of a superhero comic! It follows the actions of the motel-minded staff, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azaria) and Wengu (Paul Reubens) . "Men's Secrets" causes several elements of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," as pithy words, and questions about the identity of the secret. Most of the superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but the colors of blue and low work and home life. So it looks like Kinka Usher director makes the heroes something that the ordinary viewer can involve. I have seen "Men's Secrets" have to stimulate to the eyes and very funny. Even if it is not available in the franchise, it is still fun to watch!
