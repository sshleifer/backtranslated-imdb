Daniel Day Lewis at My Left Leg gives us one of the best performances and performances. He is a brilliant like Christy Brown, a person with a brain breath, who learned to write and paint with his left foot. Oscar is very worthy for her and Brenda Fricker who plays her loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is as strong as Christy Brown and Ray McAnally is as good as a father. It is worth looking at the best performances.
