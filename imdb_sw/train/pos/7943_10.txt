I like this series of television series. has an interesting and beautiful animation. I don't believe that they cut off the TV, and also that I never know if cybersix and data7 die or maybe, it seems to live, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was far from the BEST TV show constantly. I know that it is a delay in hope they will start a series again and so I am very happy to look at it. THE FAMILY IN HIS OWN <3 <br>> </> is about women in the name of cybersix, he is not a man. He goes with adrian sieldman, a teacher at a high school. Now cybersix is ​​really women, she is just hiding as a man in the day. During the night cybersix runs the city patrol. A boy named Von reichter is the creator of cybersix, and once he sees him alive he uses everything he can catch. <Br /> <br /> If you have never checked it before you download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it? some people have trouble. but I'm glad I looked at the 13 sessions.
