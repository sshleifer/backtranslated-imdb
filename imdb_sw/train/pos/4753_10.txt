In the completed series and brilliant events, this looks like one of my favorites. Not a bigger part, no greater meaning or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are good displays. <br /> <br /> But what makes it true for me is that, with my knowledge, * just * Twilight Zone area and * Double * snapper ends. The area is very popular with a great surprise at the end of the story. But this time, you get a surprise, and think that yes, but it turns out there * another * awesome wait. I just like so much, that this is probably one of my two pieces of love (the other is deep, more of the message).
