Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who takes a criminal case in a "unknown person," a 1951 film also watching Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A good believer in justice, Pidgeon admits the pro bono trial to protect the young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) who was accused of murder and freeing him. Shortly afterwards, she knows that the person is guilty and was reducing the protection from her victims and other suppliers in the neighborhood. He is advised by the DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a little change, which removes organized crime, someone deserves to get someone up. Mason sees a man on, and is faced with a dilemma. "Unknown Man" is a small, black and white film that manages to hold the viewer interest and its various conspiracy twists, although the plot is somewhat planned. It is a true story of a good man who seeks his god, justice, and what he is willing to do to reach it. And that's part of everything. I think there was a time before OJJ, Brothers Menendez, etc., etc., when people believed in the rights and integrity of the lawyer. For this viewer anyway, those days are much longer than <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon works best -. Her handsome, elegant trends and declamatory sounds show us success, confident person but also deeply caring one. Pidgeon had a good job over 60 years but it has never been completely revived. He was a good actor who could only play on anything and did. It may be because when he was getting the lead, he was well in three years and he did not become a statue of the tenets; or it could be he had nothing; or that he was typed as early as the second biggest star female as Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie and beautiful performances.
