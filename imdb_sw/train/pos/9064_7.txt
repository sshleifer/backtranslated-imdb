I sat with my children when we watched this film. We have all seen that it is a very entertaining movie. When Billy goes to a new school, the fifth level of abuse starts with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms. <br /> <br /> The bet is done by Billy has just too much time to eat 10 worms or other. From this point, the oppressor and his friends are trying to come up with bad ways of cooking, fry or baking soup to try and get Billy's disease so that he will lose the bet. Billy stays strong and eats his favorite way more and more with everyone, even worried friends. I don't tell you if he is successful bet or not ... you will just need to look to know but I will think that if you like a good family movies you would like this. Let's add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all the girls and they loved it very much.
