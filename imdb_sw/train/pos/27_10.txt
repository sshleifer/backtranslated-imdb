Emilio Miraglio's "Red Queen Kills Seven Seasons" (1972) is about the perfect example of the giallo I ever seen, combining all the elements needed in one true seat. First of all, with great importance to me, it has a sharp, emerging program that finally makes a perfect mind, and the murderer here will not come out completely on the left field at the end. Stories, about a series of pain-killing (you already know how many from the title of the film, right?) What happens in appearance to fulfill ancient prophecies about two sisters, is to involve one, and a murderer, who has a red figure and a laughing insane woman, is terrible and memorable. Each giallo requires some interesting actors, and here we have been in balance, led by a bouquet of Bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of its original roles, Sybil Danning, as a greedy fabric in Barbara fashion house. Another important thing of the best giallo is a spectacular, impressive, and Bruno Nicolai logo provides one for this film that should stay with you for the day. Elegant beauty? Look again. Held largely in Wurzburg, Germany, the image is treated to the eye in fact. Okay, okay, but what about these killings? After all, isn't that what the gialli is over all? I am pleased to report that many viewers should be satisfied with various types of beatings, shot, damage and other killings that this film provides easily ... without mentioning a cry, a series of dreams, mice and rats (and 'em' em, also!), Drug records, rape area, red cattle and, for the person of Ugo Pagliai, the leading man to the female audience. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD comes from good people in No Shame, and you know what it means: good printing and extra luggage, so boot! Thank you, boys!
