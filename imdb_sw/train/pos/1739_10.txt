from the perspective of NASCAR Maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many cars running from 1983. Even hard, racing events are not very real. But I must admit, that I have not seen any race before 1995, because before that time, they did not show any NASCAR community in Germany. it is basically what we use to see from Reynolds in the 80s: Burt behind the wheel of the fast car, like in its Bandit movies. <br /> <br /> If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you just like one of these 2 things, I also recommend watching it. If you like neither NASCAR nor Burt Reynolds, you still have to give a chance, but remember, this film was off to win the Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> It is a common sense of 80 years. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies, and Police Academy, you will also like that.
