This movie is very realistic and I feel that a great crime crime which most people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what goes through the mind of the victim is pride. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a wonderful job in his Maya position. I agree that this is a very bold film. This appears on rape from a different, more realistic view than any movie I ever seen on the subject. Finally you found it for a long time, but I know that many victims think this kind of justice, since the chance of an attacker to be sent to prison for their crimes is almost 1%. It is best to see a film that is connected to the truth than most want.
