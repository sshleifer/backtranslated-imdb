I recently looked again at Caprica and I think I might come and write a review! I saw this first thing after seeing the finale of the Battlestar Galactica series (Being a great fan of the show of the left show I connected with anything I could from the world shows) so I didn't know what to expect ... but I came out with a smile though I must accept ... <br /> <br /> The story begins with the fastest of the caprica planet and we are brought by different characters ... I can't give too much away but there is a big event that tells story story but I tell you to look at this. We need to say ... Esai Morales is one of the actors who gave the boy Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father at Battlestar Galactica) I got his spot and I can believe that he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... Also Eric Stoltz does his work correctly. ..! Special note was good to see Polly Walker out of Rome! Don't put it down and look at Caprica and hope to be like Battlestar Galactica because the story line is exactly the same as anyone can look at it ... without seeing BSG! is a well written game for those who like to match it with a bit of sci-fi run!
