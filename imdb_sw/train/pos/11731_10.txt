I think this movie is very fun and scared. I love Elvira and I like this film. It is very sympathetic that the second part of this amazing film was unsuccessful, because it is so wonderful as the first part. I am also proud that instead of this film I have never seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actors. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What can I add more? This is a cool and unusual movie!
