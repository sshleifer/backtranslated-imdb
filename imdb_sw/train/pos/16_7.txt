I saw this being so-so romance / drama that has an end end and generally good feel. It is not the Hall Hall of Fame of the family film and sleep-pre-married marriage "common" behavior but focus on the star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would like to expect the greatest film, at least the language. The most memorable part of the film is shown in how difficult it is to learn how to read and write as an adult. That is the main theme of the movie and involves some of the touch events but, being honest, the film is not a memory. It is still a gentle thing, a beauty that I would like to recommend.
