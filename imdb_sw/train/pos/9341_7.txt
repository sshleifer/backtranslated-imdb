Sandler is amazing again ... I've been a fan of Sandler. This movie is the story of a sad Sandler. His words are wonderful. I cried more to watch Look but there are some similar dimensions. Considering the value of the family before losing and being able to say 'I love you' is the most beautiful fact of life… It's hard, it's true… and in fact there is a real Owner of this success, Binder. I don't think another director can give these feelings in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect to laugh or be very good ... If you're ready to cope with the realities of life, don't forget this movie.
