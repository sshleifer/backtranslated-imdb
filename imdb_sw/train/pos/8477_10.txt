for the unusual sense of the word. This movie was one of my favorites as a little child, and I remembered this soon, and I think I look at it. Although many details are not clear in my mind, the general feeling that the movie has given me has been lying with me over the years. If parents feel that their children can handle the themes of maturity and sometimes violent, then I recommend this movie very much. It taught a lot about life and death, and produced in me a lot of emotions. To date, it is still one of my favorite films.
