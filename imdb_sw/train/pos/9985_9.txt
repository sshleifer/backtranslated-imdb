I saw this film in Winnipeg recently, including the area used. I first read the book of Lawrence after 70 years and to me, has always been a very powerful picture of aging in our society. It started again when I was young, and it shows more now. When the film went out, I was determined to see if the story could live. and was very surprised, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. He can give us a perfect human, although the behavior is generally cranky and judgment - a person who does not want to live with. It is good to be able to see loved ones live in reality.
