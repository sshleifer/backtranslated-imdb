This movie is just funny. regardless, but funny. to enjoy this film completely you will not have a view of how this movie goes and just enjoy the side of the side with the relevant features of the film. I still find a little time to start funny when he says "they want beer ........ cock". interesting things. but what makes the film decent is the fact that you are not trying to make it hard to make a big film, many comedies try to have great things that you just believe. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin stops it horrible in the film and adds nothing but three people, coop, remer and squeak is very funny to watch and make a great film look
