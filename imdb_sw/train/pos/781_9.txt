"Crush" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the quality of saccharin which destroys many movies and similar themes (e.g., "Magnolias of Steel"). At the same time, it shows the sudden power of surprises surpassing surprises. The events that were shown were very impractical, but the emotional emotional reality seemed very real to me. Not the film for the fast-and-blast people, but adult women should answer with laughter and tears.
