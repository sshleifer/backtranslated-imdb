An example of an unread movie. If someone can watch this film regularly and laugh every time and still sees something new in it, it still looks like another amazing picture. And though the movie has encouraged many and has added quotes and images to the pyche of all viewers, the Moon On Parador has not yet received the necessary acceptance. Even cast a talented winner of the Academy of the Academy of the Academy Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, they cannot change this view. But after looking at Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann made Richard Dreyfus give him a t reject in a meatlocker by reading a good review of the part he once played one could only one conclusion: these things are timeless ! In fifty years we will have evidence.
