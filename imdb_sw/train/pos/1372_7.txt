"Party Girl" builds a great charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes, movies seem to be a car that Mrs. Posey allows to play herself, as usual she lives. The video, led by the mayor of Daisy Von Scherler, is a treat for Mrs Posey's fans. Mr. Von Scherler Mayer takes us to a wild trip to Manhattan on the ground to show us this useless soul that his life is devoted to having fun in different clubs that always exist. This was the time that was still more ignorant than what the area and the district around the Meat markets were. At least, there is no desire in the film and we see the bottom of the world people are going to live their lives in a natural way, if we can call it that way. Parker Posey makes Mary wonderful. It is because of Parker Posey we like to enjoy a movie more than if another actor could play with Mary. She is the whole picture. Some of the cast are good.
