I saw this movie with my family and it was beautiful! This film is more than a document (which provides a cold fact) and a mono / -duologue long-term with multiple patterns ... "The power" full of this film comes from interesting pictures done underwater, in air or Arctic. By watching this film you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, it shows that WE are embedded in the flow of life. This film is not only for "fanatic landscape" although people who want to watch a good movie and message should look at it. This movie teaches me that we live not only in the worldâ€¦ we live and through the world and all the plants and animals grow and die with us.
