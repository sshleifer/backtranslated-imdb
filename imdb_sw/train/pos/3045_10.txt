This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies available. Amitabh as a gun of the country, Arjun Singh, is a hilarious master. The best thing is laughter never stops. The plan is a similar old story where a child is given by a mother who gives everything for her work - and cheers the last happiness. There are criminals (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and grandfather to give us a good measure. But this film is about Amitabh and all that you remember at that time. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to make a good life and the delivery of dialogue and its ways are hilarious. Later in the movie turns out to be the Boy Scissors. Unspecified parts include walking to him, talking and speaking English, song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. All in all I was going around with a laugh on the cinema. If you want 3 hours and Amitab entertainment for the best - this is it. It will give you 10/10 easy.
