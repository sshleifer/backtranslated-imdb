Better. The right and true manifestation of pioneer life in the western branches and emphasis on the role of the woman and its place. Moving film, with love, and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget, free film; did not make any money. Certainly not romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of the pioneer life.
