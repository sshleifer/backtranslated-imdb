The Jafar Panahi Festival "Kikwazo" shows some women trying to enter the Tehran sports field where women have been blocked. Official reason: a lot of bad language, and soccer players have their feet to show. But of course, it's actually a sex case. Therefore, many films have a romantic support if women are trying to ask men the best questions about why women are prohibited from the stadium, and one woman even comes with her plan to defend men. <br /> <br> As I understand, all Jafar Panahi movies (this included) are banned in Iran. The fact is that the CIA of 1953 destroyed the prime minister and supported after the brutal shah to give Ayatollah Khomeini forgiveness for using his thin Koran version to establish a chauvinistic society, and that the current policy of George W. Bush towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad excuse. to do a cowboy and strengthen control. Overall, this is a good look for people who come up with ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but it's important to see. Considering that all Jafar Panahi films are allowed, I wonder how he can make them.
