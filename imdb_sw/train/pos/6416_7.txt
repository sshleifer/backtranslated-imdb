Men of Honor Star Cuba Gooding Jr., as the real life of Navy Diver Carl Brashear who mocked the Navy of the first African Navy African Navy. Sometimes on his side and sometimes his enemy was one that Carl Brashear loved so much. His name was Great Teacher Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, increased and helped Carl to be someone who wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this film. His commentary here is freedom and power as Denzel Washington was in Hurricane. Through each area we can see his passion, inspiration and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle in it as he begins to make his father proud. I also liked how the director built and brought a lot of tension in some of the most important diving events. Meet the Brashear and submarine during the salvage message is to stop heart and brilliant. The only mistake I could see would be in the cast. Cuba and the DeNiro characters are very hard and exciting look. What makes you a little sad when they have to head their heads and two common supporters. Lt. bad Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Shakira Theron), a secondary school diving school (Hal Holbrook) and Cuban love interests are the ones I found to be deep. What could make these characters more effective and more effective was the little time to develop. Why was that church always in its tower? How to come to Sunday's wife was very painful and always drinking? <br /> <br/> Perhaps the strange question should be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean if this film writes the life of this person in his wedding will not be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, are a perfect example of victory and belief that the human soul grows. This film will encourage you and make you feel the struggle of this person. Which I believe is because this powerful story was told. My hat goes to you Carl Brashear. I really enjoy your strength. <br /> <br />
