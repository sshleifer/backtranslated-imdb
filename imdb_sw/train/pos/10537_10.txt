This film was so amazing, I couldn't stop it when I looked at this and I have already watched it twice for 2 days! The film is unique in the humor and exhibition, both of them are very bad and are similar to other Natali films (more big) Cube and Cypher. I've been a great fan of Vincenzo Natali since watching Cypher and everything he did is very interesting. Very good on this film are characters and characters "lost" Dave and Andrew, displayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (author of the story), actors I all like very much. Also cool is the X-Box battle or the Party of Love (you can see Dave playing Halo for sure) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> All in a great film feel good about friendship. You see this!
