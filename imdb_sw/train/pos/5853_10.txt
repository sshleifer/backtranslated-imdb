I loved so much this Summerslam from looking for a field, curtains and just looking for the general was interesting for me for some reason. Anyways, this could be one of the best Summerslam ever if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, at the same time it is just the same as being too fat for a strong man but I'm happy the times have changed. It was a terrible event as every Luger match was in horror. Other games on the cards were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Associations, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this is the event that Shawn called its chief diesel control body, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes Doink then takes Jerry Lawler and items with Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroys Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took Giant Gonzalez in another bad match, Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow with Head Title, and Yokozuna they advocated the world position against Lex Luger this match was boring and has a terrible end. However it is worth 8/10
