Two famous players in the great movie of Neil Simon according to his hit game. The biggest combination, especially when the fighters in question are Matthau and Burns. I wonder why Burns won Oscar for this; he is bright and as funny as ever. And Matthau is all his match, as the most crotchety tad. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar location Simon: two former vaudeville partners again with a special TV but still can't stand after all these years. <br /> <br /> It is fun to enjoy these two taking for each other, their collective events make this film a perfect joy. Personally, I really enjoyed "knock, hit, knock / log!" area. And if you are a fan of Burns or Matthau, you will also enjoy, <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
