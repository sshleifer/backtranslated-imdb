I like this film like no other. Sometimes I will try to describe his attributes to those who do not believe, but now allow me to quote wonderful conversation, which please, remember, it is all language in the cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else well? (song song lyric) "can sink beer, can take a queer, in its recent gear execution of Bondi." <Br /> <br /> (another lyric song) "All pommies are bastards, bastard, or worse, and England is ** e-hole of the world." <br /> <br /> (during a television interview on "arty program"): Mr. Mackenzie what artists have attracted the most since you went to England? (Barry's response) Flamin cow artists / champion (while talking to a young girl): Mr. Mackenzie, I think you have a group of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Answer Barry) Top? I've never seen Life in me. Mother makes more acute solid (ie hard work) on both sides. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious horse of the busser this Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it, see and enjoy.
