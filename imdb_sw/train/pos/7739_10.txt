Ever read Jim Thompson? He is black-boiled at night with very strong fat and misanthropy I've ever met. There are occasional private detectives in his work - only lost, psychotics and longtime artists. This film has Thompson poured columns - "If God made any mistakes in this world, it was to give us the desire to live when we have no excuse for it." Each character in the film scales on the edge of the ravu between realistic surreal and creepy. There is concern, doing Uncle Bud, played with Bruce Dern and with a good intent on Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric offers a wonderful performance, consistently of heart like Kid Collins, any bright, former refugee who is more afraid than anyone else. Rachel Ward is a Fay, sexy fatale sexy who can not quite think ... It's not your ordinary movie, it's not a goal to be. After Dark Dark My, with The Grifters, is the two best revision of the novel and one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
