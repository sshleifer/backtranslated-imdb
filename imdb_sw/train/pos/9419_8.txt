Starc Guinness Starrer is a very good satire of the satire of corporate industry, and the study of common behaviors as well. <br /> <br /> Walking is slow for comedy, and no one is yet happening - a wonderful kind of apartment, except maybe sound effects for experiments. But it has its exciting time, and it is very much in its implementation. Most of the explosions may be the most farcical feature. The co-ordination process is totally evil, remembering very much for ALL JACK; especially female sexuality and a romantic decline in the behavior of Guinness. Political charges bear the story. Ernest Thesigner is very popular as heavy. I don't think this works well like WADYKILLERS, or GOD'S WAYS AND CORNERS; but even comedy Ealing light is better than nothing.
