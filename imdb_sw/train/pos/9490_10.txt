At first I saw this film was in eight years, but it was reviewed now this is very interesting yet. Some recent films are based on such topics, but do not match this French point. <br /> <br /> President - clearly JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during public appearances. A major investigation sees "Lee Harvey Oswald's" figures of this film, but one member of the jury insists in further investigation. He reveals some amazing evidence ... A new picture of murder. Even a real psychological attempt is used for this crime scene. Compared to JFK this movie is more intelligent, intelligent and exciting. The parts of the plot can be found in many new films, I had a kind of dealer sometimes on the movie. <br /> <br /> "I ... if Icare" is "must ion". It is unique and brilliant, and music with Ennio Morricone is amazing. This movie deserves a very good title, as Hollywood production will be known for sure. <br /> <br />
