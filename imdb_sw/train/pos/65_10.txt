This film is not just about school bullets, in fact it has never been seen even. But that only adds this powerful film to it. Its about people and how they are affected by tragedy. I know it was shown to students who survived Columbine's shot and gave them a sense of closure to many of them. Acting is very good. All three employees (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are best in their roles ... I strongly recommend this film to anyone. It is one of the movies that makes you talk about it after you see it. It encourages not only a conversation of a school but a human feeling and impact on all types of disaster. It's a tearful player but it's worth it and one will look at him regularly
