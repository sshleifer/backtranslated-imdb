This movie is very good. Installed back to about 40 and the behavior of Meg Ryan strives to be known as 'smart.' Plus Tim Robbins is very good in this film. And everything about it has a magical feeling towards it. Every time I look I am happy. It's definitely a girl's movie, and I am a girl, so I would. I also love music. Violin is amazing. but rather that I think it's a good story and everyone should look at it.
