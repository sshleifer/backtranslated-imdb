When it came out, this film now looks beautiful and looks beautiful. The feast of mind-making, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and the central performance between Jean Seberg good and very good. Preminger does not fly around to show - its time slowly takes heart to listen to and reflect, and the Graham Greene script eliminates Shaw without offering a controversial.The piece has a look of made by TV TV, and of course the studio is tied but no worse for it. Most modern movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist sleeping. What would Gib Gibson do to the maid? Many throwing shots on the rack probably, then crisping on the BBQ as the fire take. Preminger does not have any of this. The burning is shown mainly due to the reaction of guilt. There are a few weak displays, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I got this movie on television and I didn't expect to look at it, but I was bought. In our religious and religious age, the story of Joan has an unexpected resonance.
