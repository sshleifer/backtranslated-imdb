I loved this film and I was shocked by other people who have given them an account. It's a movie derived from the comic book and is animated, now if you dislike comic books or animation then of course you can't love this movie so why you look and awesome to the level it is over me. Although, if you are a Fascinating fan, powerful characters and heroes (women) who have wrapped up and save the world (hell) will love this movie. I thought the story had drawn me and it was a very good movie. Anime-esque or more like American movies following a new animation of adult animation. As Titan A.E. meet the live version of the Punisher. At the end I recommend this movie buff to comic with a super hero fan or anyone with an intelligent mind to watch a fun movie.
