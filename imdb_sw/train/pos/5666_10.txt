I loved this show when it was disclosed on television and it was broken when I realized that someone somewhere had decided not to go on! For years I put on my copies of this show, which I had hit or I had anyone hit me. That's up to now. The power that finally decided to open this beautiful series on the DVD and I was finally able to get my little hands on the full set. Which, brings me to this section; part about that show this refers to all. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about good evil lines, basically the struggle between Lucas Buck (which is Buck, and B). She is a bad Sheriff of South South City who runs things in a way that wants things to run and stops anything to get her way. I felt that the show was amazingly written and was directed by many lots of life still alive. I hated it when it was deleted, but it seemed to go to me when I finally found something worth watching on TV. Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, has just the right of the evil lines to remove it. Other workers did the good work too, so I think you could say, even cast there was a hit me.
