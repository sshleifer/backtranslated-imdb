I will not try to put this "Death Trap" in the top 5 list of the best mix of action and the ever-ever film.aine and Reeves (actor who was less trustworthy who did not have the opportunity to do more than soggy lessons with "Superman") plays very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - who I usually do not care - is fully thrown into the role that uses his sense of despair as an actor. sure that the comparison "Death of Death" and "Sleuth" - another brilliant efficiency of the screens with Michael Caine - legitimate, or even fair. Of course, these two stories are very much but "Sleuth" is a lot about class class The war of wits, and the house in "Sleuth" installed is at least such a similarity in the film as two actors - the house does not really have the same "Deathtrap" and "Deathtrap" "is not a very war wits as it is vignette that explained about how people don't know well ( and they don't know as they think they are and they deserve everything they get. I'll just tell you that both movies are good examples of that kind, and it's worth your time and money. This is America, after all. <br /> I can't stop losing and turning to the plot, but I don't think it's anything. I've watched the DVD eight or nine years in twelve years, and I still enjoyed chemistry and time and meaning, scary when things go "pear shaped". he is not very well that the journey becomes more important than the actual destination. Anyone who loves black-hearted comedy and insist on Hitchcock style of film making perhaps enjoy "Deathtrap" very much.
