Interesting drop on the male hustler would have been in New York City forced to live in a building condemned by a con-man fool. A modern study of the decline of moral and social values ​​in modern times, strongly influenced by John Schlesinger (who had not done his work here) and has been done by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Packs are quite punch in general, but "fantasy" scenes - some of which are playing for chuckle - are gently intrusive, as is "mod" medicine party. The ongoing relationship between the two men is a feeling, but the film vendors are careful not to get mushy, and this gives an intense picture that may be a lesser director than Schlesinger. Original X-rated in 1969, and the winner of Best Picture Oscar; The journalist Waldo Salt (who changed the book of James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won an image. *** 1/2 from ****
