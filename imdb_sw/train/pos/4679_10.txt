A terrible movie and start slowly slowly - make a chance to get cooking. Story creates for interest and controversy. The characters and the story line block the expectations and cliche at all right. New York City's beautiful homes - false, real - is a wonderful drug for the purpose of the "Sex In City" business - in fact, the whole film is a HBO / Hollywood idea of ​​New York City, sex and relationships. It is a small film that takes its characters honestly and compassionately. Love IT! Very great and spectacular performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his love interest (forget his name!).
