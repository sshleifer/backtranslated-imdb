I do not know whether to recommend this film to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily write some things about this film as completely clear "Tetsuo". The concept is the same, editing is fast and fast - which is good because, apart from making the movie more powerful, it hides certain errors caused by a small budget and other things. <br /> <br /> There is much more than a year, under a quarrel and, in the case of "dairy machine", human change into a creature that is part of the machine (referred to?) called "Necroborg" original origin is caused by young visitors. This small red from the real space uses human beings as their gladiator games that play for each other. They affect the body, somehow managing to keep the amount of deception of mechanical parts in it connecting them seem to have no place and turn into a murder machine which focuses on other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another visitor who is in another Necroborg, taking out the corpse and eating. All, the plot looks very little and I didn't have much expectations, but finally I enjoyed this film. As I said earlier, this is a budget budget below, but it's still very good. Don't wait too much from administrators, they're not very good, but can be tolerated. I liked the sky and gore, some strange and how the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not original, it has some charm - to me at least. About 7 out of 10.
