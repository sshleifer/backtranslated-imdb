This show is good. I would act, funny bits and his cuteness. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, all did well at the show. The show started well with its wonderful idea, the non-core of bringing dead people into the first series and honestly, as the people said, the first few events of the second series were a bit to allow but later came back to look good yet . And now I hate the truth that it will be deleted. Why does ABC not only allow you to finish until the end when all events have already been done? I want to know how the story will be. I think it should be given a chance if there are still many viewers who like it.
