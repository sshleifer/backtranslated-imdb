I remembered this as one of my books that I loved the child and I wanted to read it to my 5-year-old daughter now. I knew the movie was coming out soon we went to the library to find the book and gave us the text for the next day! We ran home and we got a day to read a book so we can compare it. It was not necessary. The only thing between the book and the movie is the first name of the characters, the fact that there is a bet, and a lot of vegetables to eat. Laam, I almost forgot, a child who cooks more than worms likes to present his masterpieces to French emphasis. As children know, the number of children involved, how the bet has come, the number of worms that should be eaten, the time that he needs to eat worms, how to cook, the development of friendship, peak scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow, it didn't destroy my movie. All characters are happy, and the film has not left my heart. A word of caution to parents, there was one time you could hear adults in the room drawing their breath and it was when Billy's younger brother used his penis as "dilly dick". Part of the shame came when my daughter continued to ask those who were around us, "Does anyone know what dick dilly is?" lol. That and often "fast" is like a bad shepherd as this film gets. My daughter thought she might be sick next to the 3 and 4 bug (and she had just taken an empty empty tool) but she was thin and 6 bugs. She and I were both very happy with the film and we had a good time sharing experiences.
