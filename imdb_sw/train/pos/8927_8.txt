Clair Denis again reiterates his father's emerging story, the following men enjoy themselves in a decisive manner, regardless of their feelings in their family but when Nénette and Boni from the original film live in the narrow world of Marseilles, our investigation of Louis Trebor In Intruder takes us from a remote area to the French and Swiss border to half the way around the world, Korea and Tahiti. Again the film begins in the middle of the stream, and Louis, in his seventy years, dealing with the patient's heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is not a stranger to violence as his cabin is a place to run and hit regularly. Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with a gun nearby. Denis is not quick to mobilize the action, and we must use it with our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and a few people involved with the frontier including child, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost ignorant of long hair and desire the mustache) who rejects him as the "observer":, is shown as a dedicated father of two. There are many short things that, when it seems interrelated, builds the sense of Louis and its surroundings. The work of Godard's camera is amazing here. An example of control is the heartbeat of Louis who goes to Korea and then Tahiti looking for another child, is not available, and where Louis's new heart rejects him as Sidney has rejected earlier. We are familiar with a short image in Denis film which is unknown: Nenette eliminates Boni feeding and spoon; The car to shoot the father of Boni and then the briefest of Boni pictures and gun wounds in the head; The area of ​​Louis in the morgue and the string and the severity of the plant but the body of Sidney. For, the last two, is the rejection, real or imagination, and father, kills something that cannot be made to the child.
