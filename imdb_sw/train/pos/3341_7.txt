I saw this movie on Thursday night after having a really interesting day. I had no expectations, those I had were rather negative. That the only movie I ever saw Jimmy in is the American version of taxi and Queen Latifah (?) ... why not ask why! But with weight .. this movie is very good! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but almost I liked to the attitude of Fallon. Why can't I meet such a beautiful nerd. :) Movies like that are best. Simple, sweet and useful. Sunday on Thursday. I'm not even a fan of games, but it's something about American movies and baseball that are very interesting. Probably the fact that we do not have this game here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (my first comment ever.) Haha
