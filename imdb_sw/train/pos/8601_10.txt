My Case: The vamp outfit the last is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and wonderful. Jeanette was well dressed, and even had Nelson's ignorance. The entry into his balcony served him the same. His feminine dresses were arranged in a wonderful way, especially with today's standards. The 1942 textile painter did a great job. The main theme of just a beautiful song. Attention to bad posters: 1942 was during WW II; Pearl's park happened a year before. U.S. just come out of the Great Depression; they needed out and spend that hard money for dive, singing and dance, fantasy fantasy. Damaged dictators were trying to dominate out there in RL, opening up independence. Thank you for the good public had a wonderful movie of conspiracy to attend. An exaggerated contemporary was the most beautiful, in those times of oppression. When you, bad posters, become actors or even film stars, then you have a chance to talk and refuse. Jeanette's film and Nelson stand the test of time. Angel wings wings, on real angels. RL wings in the clothing party is not hot, but it is ideal for Jeanette considering SL. It is beautiful to sing to Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette play was fun fresh. <br /> <br /> 15/10
