Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films that I have seen in the last decade. Good performances (especially yiannis zouganelis are good), a well-written script and excellent guidance from a very special, in Greek very average standards, author. The film, apparently influenced by the leaves of Sam Peckinpah's leaves, which could be a jewel if it were exposed to certain obvious and widespread conditions and ultimately end. However, this is a movie that deserves attention and is of such an unusual form of Greek movies that should be considered out of Greece. It is a shame that in Greece did not do business, as well as other big counterfeit goods and gifts like Politiki Kouzina.
