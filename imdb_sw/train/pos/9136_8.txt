This is not a bad film like other reviewers, and as a summary on the IMDB page of this film, say. Why? The first is that in 1984 the filmmakers had the courage to respond, as one of the conspiracy factors, the issue of domestic abuse - so pensioners who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points! Secondly, without the feature of the film of Prince and his bright father, the peak of the music will not act as well - so those retirees who say that only music is good, again, missed one mark - in particular, why is good ... for because all the music in this film has a back feature of the feature that makes the music more similar. Third, make this film break! For the first film producers and director, this is not so bad! There are the worst movies out there and people who have reached the movie! And finally, the audience who say that music is "good" also missed the point - look at the different types of stylistic music, various forms, music, and performance of the Prince's actions - actually one, go to music where no one else has been going through the 1980s, and in the style of other artists' work (clothes and movement: how much expensive things came first, Michael Jackson or Prince? Also see if you can see the fingers on the front of the eyes that Prince does in the film this, long before the "Pulp Fiction" of Quentin Tarentino). As a whole of its parts, not the worst movies.
