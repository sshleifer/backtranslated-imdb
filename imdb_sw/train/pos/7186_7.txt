There have been many Zorro films made over the decades, but it is a shame that one of the best is one of the least seen. The Fight for Zorro Fighting is quite different from other Zorro films. First, it is the chapter of the Republic in chapter 12. And at this time, Zorro was not found by the top star of the studio as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead of an actor like Reed Hadley. When Hadley does not give strong power over such cases, he does enough work, is helped by the fact that he is not the only hero here; if the head means, he has an army of fighting fighting. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the environment is not California. The story here takes place in the middle of Mexico in 1824 where a man who says as a living god persuades Indian peoples and anarchy band to help him in his plan to destroy the founding Republic of Mexico. Something, Zorro, and a few of the supporters plan to do anything they can stop. Do not get wrong, there is at least one very good time for each section, from the corny bow "twang" sound effects to acting courage. But in general, this represents one of the best periods of the Republic at all times, and perhaps the best Zorro. The program is more powerful than many series and has never been understood or intervened, and there are a lot of action - fans of Indiana Jones will see many borrowed borrowed from this serial.
