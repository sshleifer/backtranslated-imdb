The best time to kill the melodrama, and Fontaine effectively to fight against its original gray wall, in a role that was said to be Olivia DeHavilland declined. That's good, because Fontaine is amazing. Written by Charles Bennett, who wrote to Hitchcock in the thirty years and later wrote the best script for the first film of the British Movie of the Demon Night. The opening part, where Ivy visits the unfortunate host who plays with Una O'Connor's wonderful (screecher of James Whale's popularity), is a powerful tour, and the film shares the interest in many ways of evil. I hope to see this film on one day of DVD, but the despair of what is happening, because it seems to be an inappropriate film to hide. Fortunately I had to see it on AMC seven or eight years ago, but I haven't seen since. Catch it as you can!
