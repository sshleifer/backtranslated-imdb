With the release of a small key in the country, and their apparent visibility in other countries ('R' in the country cannot help - honestly, just because HBC uses C-word!), This is actually fine piece of work. Love causes a constant threat, but fails to play in two ways. It is easy to win the plaudits just because you are physically or mentally minded (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not have used the total destruction of the MND, but his powerful and sad car pays full compensation. In fact, all his work is done through his eyes (and what eyes!). This is a mental guide from an actor who drives the English speed of his reputation, and emerges as a model of a particular situation. Prize should follow, though not, alas, for this good performance. Branagh, one feels, has never given the best of the film (except the possibility of 'Hamlet', and his play is reduced by a large cast). Here, however, he on his other appearance, playing for hilt self-esteem, permanently, finally a boyfriend and trick he will not always show, and show all the mind and depth. In short, we believe in him, if we can't believe him as Frankenstein, as a priest in 'Proposition', as a lawyer at 'The Gingerbread Man', like Andrew in 'Friends of Peter'. That is surely its very best performance - why can't it produce products in advance? As a film, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars perhaps not so much available. But it has been a pleasure to see these pair make their socks off like this, and I expect more from them (though not 'Love of Lost Works'). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC find 10 out of 10.
