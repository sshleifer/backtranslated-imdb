Warning! Spoilers ahead! I have seen a movie in German, so it could be, that I have lost some symptoms. <br /> <br /> With some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that happened to me. I liked Lexa Doig's acting in particular. Sometimes I got the feeling, that she * is Camille. But I can't stop asking myself, what happened at the end and Bob, Cassie and the baby. I love, he, after the introduction of Bob, finally finished love and regret what happened to his brother and forced to lie. Otherwise it is very strange, that she would carry her baby and love it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I don't like the end. Dean Cain was better than ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I've seen him better but it's also bad. I believe that the film is more analysis of human relations and dealing with unexpected situations than the crime story. Underneath it below, I liked it very much.
