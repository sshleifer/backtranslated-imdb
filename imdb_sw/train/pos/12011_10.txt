I am shocked by the negative views I have read and I can only assume that people who make these comments were less than honest. This is a picture of Joseph Smith's progress that I have ever seen. It was good to take action because at one time I forgot that I watched the film. It brought Joseph's life of trouble, a good hope, a lasting faith in men and God, and a final sacrifice for life as it actually left me without speaking and silently for fear. If anyone, of any Christian religion can watch this film without touching it somehow - I'd like to say it is an individual view and not a movie. I am giving a "10" film and encouraging the honest spirit to see it. At the same time it is a very good heart that has come to the person who gave everything he had for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs laugh, this film reminds them of the kind of people we need to have no religious beliefs. Pruitt-
