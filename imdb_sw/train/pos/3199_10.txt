Okay, we think that the Trailer Park Boys has bad lines of the story, because they hit the ass. They just ... they fight. <br /> <br /> For example: Near the end of the film, it shows Ricky and Julian telling "Patrick Lewis" to stop the dog and walk away. Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying they have been in jail for 2 years. But in the television series, they have been thought to have been in jail for 18 months. But other actors show quite different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the boys who pay Ricky to destroy, and then plays Sam Losco in a row. Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, boys pull the coke instead of the cigarette anger. The thing is, they never have to prove that two story lines are connected in any way, instead of waiting area. <br /> <br /> Sorry to continue with blabbing.
