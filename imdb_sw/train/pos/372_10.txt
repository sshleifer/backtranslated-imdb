Steven Spielberg wanted to win the worst Oscar that he thought that he could not win by leading the epics special effects (he was chosen for three: "Welcome to the Three-Type", "Raiders of the Lost Land", and "ET: Additional Country". He decided to get a big risk by leading "color paint", a film film without special effects. received 11 Oscar nominations including the best photos, but Spielberg was right when he was not elected to the Best Director. It was worse during Oscar's night when this film did not win Oscar one. It was completely closed. should conquer a couple of Oscars including one for the first film Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, a woman suffering from an insulting husband (D terrorist by D anny Glover), then finds s make every thanks thanks to some special friends. Oprah Winfrey also made his first film here and gives good performance like Sofia, one of the Celie friends. Since I am from Chicago, I had known Winfrey from his talk show (which during the release of this film did not go all over the country). As Goldberg, the beginning of the film! Margaret Avery is as bright as Shug Avery, another friend who also happens to be the husband of a decaying husband of Cowlie. All three staff members received the best Oscar for their work here (Goldberg for Best Actress, Winfrey and Avery for the Best Assistant Executive). Setting south during the first half of the 20th century, "The Color Purple" is a very powerful film that has made me cry at the end. It also makes me laugh sometimes. Why the University voters were very difficult to choose Spielberg for the Best Director is a mystery that still bothers today. But Spielberg could win two years of Oscars later on "Schindler's list" and "Save Private Ryan", making him one of the best directors of all time. But he should have been chosen for this film. Work that made from special effects of blockbusters as "E.T." for a great festival like "color paint" was amazing. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
