I am not a good writer, so I will put this short. The World in War is the best documentation of WWII that I have seen. I have seen a separate WWII document (not English / North America only) and this document appears to be the most complete WWII document I have seen. I think it could talk more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler had authority, but it works very well to fight the war. It seems to be complete and objective / right for everyone. It does not extend or reduce the roles of different nations. It has many natural pictures, including color pictures and many eye witnesses (made in 70 years when much more were alive). It has multiple music and author. All-to-all have given this 10/10, because that's good. (I haven't seen the parameters in the DVD version so I can't comment on those)
