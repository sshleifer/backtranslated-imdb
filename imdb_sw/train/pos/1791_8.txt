This is not a great movie; Most of the plot issues are very predictable and "tried and true" but they did well and made some interesting points about what we can regret ("our error" as the film calls them) as we look back on our lives. I had not read the book, so I had no more information than the story of a dead woman who has a strong memory from the past that she has not shared with anyone. Thanks they are beaten on the artwork .... Meryl daughter Streep, Mamie Gummer, plays Lila's youth, and then Meryl shows at the end of the film as Lila's old ... In addition to an amazing similarity (duh!) The little actor worked great maybe not on the caliber of his mother, but who?) All the others in this film were good, although I would have been more than Glen Close and thinking Buddy's behavior was very small. <br /> <br /> This is more than a movie of girls than boys, but it's nice to see your mother, or your daughter, and maybe start some conversation going. It's hard to know the parent as "man"!
