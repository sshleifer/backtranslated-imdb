"If I wanted to walk, I would call the nurse." <br /> <br /> "Don't you have enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got a toilet." <br /> <br /> "If I die, please remove (cowboy hat) from my head. So I don't want to be remembered." from this charming and insightful film often. Dudley Moore is a beautiful, loving and rich. Mr. John Gielgud is a good, attractive and loving ... and poor. They both have no father / father and the relationship of a child who defines a person who Arthur will be. Will he follow his heart and soul, or his property? Over twenty-five years, I have returned to this film, fun and amusement and fun. It's a movie to come back, again and again, and remember what is important in life, as brief as it is. <br /> <br /> Justice Miller
