SOLDIER is not as bad as many did. I saw the film having romantic humor, like that in the Starship Troopers of Paul Verhoven. Lack of discussion and on the top stage is deliberate and adds to the atmosphere of the comic-book. One of the trivia-bit emerges to me - Todd has the names of several war-campaign campaigns' d in his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those not feeling out there, the Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy's Batty's final blade Runner. Thinking that Todd could fight with the android soldiers as Roy remembers speaking at least. Maybe journalist David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this 3 out of 5.
