I love this film. It has an amazing chemistry among the actors and tells a story that is quite common, the story of the lost son. The best thing I like is however the way the bathroom is more than the history of the story. As the father told the story of his wife's family in the northwest of China, the water and bathing feature becomes a very sacred worship. Water was very easy because a simple bath was deep and meaningful. <br /> <br /> Total film was very effective. There was a time, however, when you were on "too" sweet ... bordering and freezing during the garden record area. But in general, I strongly recommend this film.
