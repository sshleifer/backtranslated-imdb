"Grace Grace" has a sense of feeling like it describes a modern story of various life in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the game can be done in any modern city. It examines family values, sexual relationships, and age group characteristics and similar aplomb. Judge the characters, just submit in a direct manner, for they are struggling to make their personal problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and the observations conducted on the characters are wise and bright. I appreciate this very advanced film.
