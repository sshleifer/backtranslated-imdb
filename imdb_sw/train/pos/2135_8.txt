What? We will make the film very good because it shows how something, like playing, can strengthen the soul's life within the human spirit. Dance looks like an expression of existence, and the birth of an individual. Certainly it is Aoki's. In the job she is a gentle denizen office, but put him on the dance floor with all his up power bottle supplied. Surprisingly, this release is very much in Japan, because of the strong culture to follow. At the beginning of the film, all actors are shy or afraid of their desire to play. They will be disappointed, or seem to be misled, by expressing their passion for dance. This film is worth looking at the birth of human feelings and desires. It will catch a smile on your face for a day.
