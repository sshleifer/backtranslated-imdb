Saturday night **** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Morning Monday <br /> Bad rhythm, which gets on it (now continues) seems rather than any very powerful talent , Richard Gere has always taken a more radical position in the US area of ​​Hollywood, always bet bet in the leadership of men who still has a known reputation today. But today he seems to have placed more in this type of direct DVD / release work and as much as it seems to be more residential now for now. He needs to draw on a tough thing here who was hard, a sex worker Earl Babbage, a worker who was tasked with several hundred sex offenders in one US area, with his new advocate Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) should take its latest step, trying to abolish a young woman when trying to forgive herself for a failed trial for years. <br /> <br /> This is a certain dive into the black side of humanity, raising the material definitely not to squeamish or those looking for light looking. And so it is a powerful, dynamic, unlocked and unlocked DVD. The only thing to reconnect is a very well-organized jittery, the cutting-out of the camera as soon as it is more visible that is less visible over time. But it is still some of the most powerful material I have seen Gere in, without stopping to get darker and more on the edge as it continues. ***
