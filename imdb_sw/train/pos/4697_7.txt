Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in the removal of the gangsters movies in 1984. Maureen Stapleton has his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his master, and Marilu Henner is his partner. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton has a pet shop owner in the 1930s who takes a child to save a child and then tells him, for a flashback, how he got himself a pet store. It turned out to be a robbery at an early age to get her mother to the pancreas work ($ 49.95, special this week) and began to work for the group's boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name "Risk" in the world of stars. <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious events in this film, and Stapleton is a clash as the mother of the evil Johnny who needs any tool in her body to be transformed. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very good performance, such as Griffin Dunne, the DA's scorer who can't “play the ball” with the missing Burr (Danny De Vito). Like the Nemesis of Johnny, Joe Piscopo is good. Richard Dimitri is a position like Moronie, who tries to speak English - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that it does all of it with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a little tired to the end, but it's good to see, and Keaton is as strong as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was reduced when it was released, and as another gem of "Night Cake," heard a lot about today. For exhibitions and events that are real gems, you will find the "Johnny Dangerously" very enjoyable.
