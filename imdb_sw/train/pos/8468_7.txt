Ponder meditation on the state of regrets through a way related to paranoia. There is much going on in this for having just a run of 74 minutes, but it works. The events are very subtle, not the risk of cutting-out which appears to be the most recent films of Asian fears. The "frightening" method is similar to the terrible time in "Interfaced" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, headed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not close to the same. The film has a good job of balancing spiritual spiritual stories with something unusual and psychologically. It is not perfect, but it does what it should do. I would like to consider watching it if you have a chance.
