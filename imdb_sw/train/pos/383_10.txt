This film was captured on my heart from the beginning, when I heard the first Quincy Jones notes or saw the beautiful purple flowers in the mountains. This is a real right film and die of ...! The whole commission provides excellent performance in the film I saw in years and Spielberg has come out for himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh master!), Danny Glover, and others, all give us the best and you can hear it - almost touch! Goldberg is Celie, giving him the security and sense of lowness that is needed for that character, and we grow with him, we grow stronger with him, in all movies, and we win him. Margaret Avery is as wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she boasts more, and shows us that "sinners", in fact, "they have souls too". Danny Glover is always compassionate, who works well in making people hate and good music (I would like to say sir) Quincy Jones adds more beauty to this royal film! Photography, music, director and music makes this beautiful film, a spirit of life. You don't want to lose! "Sister" ... remember my name ... "
