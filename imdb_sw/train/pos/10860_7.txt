This is not as severe as I expect that makes the incidents of violence seem more brutal and more effective. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of misleading and turning and jumping back and double crossing all the way through the film makes it hard to find out who whose behavior is high. The program is interesting and good dialogue with the development of the character and provides a spectacular view of the work of the Triad group. When violence comes in brutality, there is no gun or scenes of a military special effects, this is reliable in the face of your face and all the discussion that you will never forget that the Triad is a criminal organization. . <br /> <br /> The end is awesome but quite consistent and reliable.
