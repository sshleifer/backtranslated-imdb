I saw this film as the second element on the disk with the original Nasty 'Blood Rites' video. As Rites Rites was quite bad, I didn't have much expectation from this film; but in fact, it seems that garbage director Andy Milligan has withdrawn himself at this time as the Seed of Sin has climbed the Blood Rites in a fashionable manner and stands as a sufficient piece of disease for sixty years. The plan is very similar to the Rites of Blood, when we focus on the unemployed family, and of course; there is a dangerous inheritance. The film is black and white shot, and the look and feel it reminds me of a lot of classic 'Durious Dr Humpp'. There is any amount of year shown, and the director seems to be reasonable to focus on sex, and the theme of the disruption and hatred. Acting is normal, but most of the women seem to appear nude at some point and in spite of the notorious reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for this kind of thing, as many series in this film are really quite good. The program is thin paper, and many films are filling; but the music is interesting, and the director also does a wonderful job with sexual incidents themselves, since most of them are few. In general, this is not a good film; but it is possible to appeal to a fan of worship, and it gets more recommendations than the best quality known and under 'Rites Rites'.
