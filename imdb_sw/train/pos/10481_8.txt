A small sweet movie that can't even accuse your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to have been excluded from the same clothes as half the other half of the UK comics over the past two years ... underdog is experiencing difficulty, finding the strength of the challenge and learning something about he himself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widows and so break, Grace is a gardener, and joins to help a friend / worker Matthew grow his plant pot. She has been doing anything, so Grace helps her. They realize that he is a perfect man to harvest the pot, which they can all benefit from. She likes to smoke, she needs to raise money to pay her credit. Show it to Grace going to London to handle some of her products, wearing what looks like a white suit John Travolta wearing in "Saturday Saturday night" and thus emerged as a big finger. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, who I loved in "La Femme Nikita", is remembered. It is not moving too much or understanding, but great entertainment, and after 90 minutes, feels like walking with friends. 8/10.
