Any movie in the early days of Orson Welles is a victory through the third person and cotton Joseph. He is also wonderful in the touch of evil. Please see all! He seems to get the glory and engaging in the film as F is fake, the stupidity of the film. Don't waste your time looking. in fact it is stupid. Orson Welles is a film icon and anyone who learns the film should see everything he chooses. All leading women are big but eventually Welles became an alcoholic, as her character in A Touch of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered to be good during his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could continue to continue but I ... and because I it's a woman, I can see her attraction. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last film makers and unless you count the filmmakers today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the film creators do not only get to Jewish film makers! I know there are many popular filmmakers today but for a very short time I can't call them all. There is no error for this popular millennium film characters! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of current and coming filmmakers, I don't want to cling in the past! I like some films out now, but there is hardly anything that I will put on the "best than 100" list. "The river and the river" was good, so it was "Fargo", and "Oh, Brother, where did you," from the line of Sullivan's journey; Another fine film from forty years! Is there anyone who can give me a good list of the 90s and up to 2006? I would like to know who looks! Thank you! Also Props on this site! Where else can you plug the film or boo it! I love ranting and raving from ordinary folks like me who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any film for someone who has not yet seen yet!
