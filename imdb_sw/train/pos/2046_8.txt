When the voice sounds are dated slightly, this story fits better with U.S. now more than ever. With blue jobs not only but everyone's jobs are left by U.S. while the government receives benefits and suffering for the United States. Peter Strauss is Emory, a metal worker who works similar to his father for 35 years. His wife is shown well by Pamela Reed, who is really, trying to help the family with two children when Emory lost his job. The key is closed under the pretext of misuse, but there is also a bad and cheap salary where they can pay one of the steel earnings one month (transfer) what they should pay Strauss / Emory one day. Nor do you worry that all men are good workers who are honest and try their best for their families. John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Brother Strauss) and a few other workers are also affected. It is very troubling and true. Some events between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes his local unity will be able to reopen the mill, as they promise to do so. Emory's brother, Lee already sees the writing on the wall. No work is left in the corridor (Ohio) and must continue. However where in U.S. can move? What? Will it be better for a black metal worker? It is a victory area at the end where Emory and its staff fill up the loading field and metal products. The guards enable them to do this as a last sign, one of the men who commit suicide and sympathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good video message about hard times here in America. The few things you care about are addressed to self. 8/10.
