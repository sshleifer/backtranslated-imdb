Cecil B. deMille knew how to create a classic, and after 7 years west of it comes as Real McCoy, engrossing, entertaining, interesting; in any non-temporary way. <br /> <br /> As a real fan of the DEADWOOD TV, I will tell you the Gary Cooper show as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane is more on target. <br /> <br /> We don't have any names in Hollywood again. PLAINSMAN is just one of several scholars from the 1936-1945 years that has seen two years of lasting life after ten years: it was released, released, given again. Businessmen like Spielberg today, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in the box box. No film today will be sought in 7 months but only 70 years.
