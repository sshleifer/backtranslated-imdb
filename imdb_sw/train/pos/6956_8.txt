I must say that Uma Thurman is a sexiest woman in the world. This movie was beautiful and I mean uber cute. It had all the "sex" content which many of Ivan Reitman comedies and but for something extra lil, CHEMISTRY. Both Luke and Luke have this psychological but credible chemistry that appears to be surpassing every area. They all seem to create this unusual, emerging and interesting relationship with strong "sex" tensions that laugh until you can't feel your face again. Anna Farris and all other supporters seem to have an opportunity for each other and even Wanda Sykes' small role to laugh. Although these types of comedi are not for everyone, but I must say to someone who is not happy to enjoy these films and was laughing as mad. This course is certainly not for everyone. especially young children since a certain time is also too ... well lets say ADULT to a small audience. All in all I was surprised by this movie, the last hard I saw was a little weaker compared to all the film. (3 1/2 * out of 5 *)
