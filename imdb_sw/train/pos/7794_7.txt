Victor Nunez has witnessed this unfamiliar story of a young woman's journey and the feelings of poetry are often seen in movies. For poetry I mean what the text and movies are filled. There is a great deal of literature about the film, almost like a novel has been taken to the page and page for the screen. In this sense, the film reaches a lot of it cannot; but it is also slower at times, a deep decline that was once acquired by the grace of ennui. The movie star Ashley Judd has not yet made the film better than its beginning here. He fits the role of Ruby to lead as a glove, almost as he did not act. He has the presence of a true film star in the film, and he is not able to convey the same pictures in his future films, although he was good in normal life.
