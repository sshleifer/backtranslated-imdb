All the reviews here on how much ZP does not know the plot, acting is a wooden, orgy area of ​​no meaning, etc., they all lose the point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a movie released in the head of the 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. It's a movie that needs to be monitored with your H-I-G-H out of your mind on a certain psychedelic substance. Get a certain type of bud and smoke, or get a strong hit of acid. To a large extent, this direct and prudent review of the ZP is not sure. You can't get anything out of this film for a direct issue of mind. Until you watch this film on a large screen (which I am fortunate to do three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare), you don't know what this film is about. If you insist on looking at not drinking alcohol, you can know at least the end of the destruction when you beat up to an amazing voice of Floyd's "Careful With Ax That, Eugene," "Come on Number 51, Your Time You're Up. "
