This book is excellent and the best part of the film is the direct translation from what Greene wrote; for example a sharp but very bad humor that surrounds the events with Boyer and Lorre, or the fate of a murdered child who takes some conspiracy. Where the film comes from the novel, it is caused by the attraction. I don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way. Every time it looks part and the story stays in mind as good 'un. Some of the little characters were the characters of the stock who can turn their hand to anything. <br /> <br /> It is a shameful disgrace that the film is not available on DVD.
