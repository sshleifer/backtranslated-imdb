"Journey of Hope" describes the poor Turkish family and their odyssey hope that increases down by despair when they travel to Switzerland looking for a search. Although this Oscar winning film has been done well, it is very rare and has many implausibilities. Much of the film at 1.7 of the run is to get a bus, stop the bus, go to the boat, leave the boat, get into the van, out of the van, etc; when you could use it well or completely. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are familiar with the normal business crime for illegal immigrants. Careful and prudent care but more advanced.
