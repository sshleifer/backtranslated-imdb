This is "awesome at the time" through computer animation, allegedly the work of over 300 artists. I thought it was beautiful and very interesting on advertising. Most of the short screens did not make sense, just the form that turns into other types, but it was fun to watch. This is all about the exhibition, not really about any kind of story. There was an incredible series of invisible-creation men could go around the birds when they heard. All that is an animated computer back back. Even the word "animated computer" was not known. <br /> <br /> It is the only opportunity to show this new technology in short periods of events like cartoon-and-nice colors and thinking events. No words, just images and electronic music. Callers must have loved this. It is good, interesting for 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy." For today's effects of this CG can be lost effect, but I think you would like to have fun for this.
