All in all good films and best for the fact that the film has not been made that the story can remain a mystery to citizens. Brosnan is doing a good job like America's natural and mysterious past and pictures are amazing. For others, this may be very modern, and some will bother - for me it is a gentle, well-spoken and perfect look for family. Now it's not something you get recently.
