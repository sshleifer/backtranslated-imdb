If you just read the plot of the plot, this film would look like the most common of the 1930s. The strength and beauty of this film is in direct, manufactured land. I have often seen Jean Harlow showing many kinds of emotions, rich and cunning around his face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the church, there is a great feeling of feeling among the main characters. Crude feelings are shown sincerely, so it's true. The last sequence is almost without considering: when Clark Gable looks down with joy and surprise for his son, lifts him with pride, "My child!", I couldn't remember that Mr. Gable's son was born to him later. This is one of the best examples of the Depression period.
