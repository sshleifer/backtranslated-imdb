I thought they had a good job *, had nothing wrong with it, I don't know how the first advertiser could say that it was terrible, it encouraged me tears (I think it was moving everyone with tears) but I didn't try to cry in the movie because embarrassed but this has happened to me. It was a good SOOO! I hope they will open it on DVD because it will give you a copy! I feel like it has renewed my faith and gives me hope that I cannot explain, it made me try to be a better person, went through it and we are kind of taking it for granted, I think. Compared to that, I feel like our own experiment is nothing. Yes, it is nothing, but it is not found what they have experienced. I liked it. Who played Emma?
