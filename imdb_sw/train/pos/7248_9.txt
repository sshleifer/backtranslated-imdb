When I saw Exterminators of 3000 for the first time, I did not have the prospect of the movie. Although, it's not bad if I was thought of. It is a kind of Italian version of Warrior Road, and cast, which is almost popular in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of the animals of the animals Zombie. You can also see other links on the Italian fear movies: Luca Venantini has the role of Tommy, and you can see the child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the dead living AKA Gates of hell) like John Robbins and Apocalypse Cannibal as a role of Mary's brother. Modern movie entertainment, with dull parts.
