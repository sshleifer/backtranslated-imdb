This is a poem on the film, presented in amazement and photography and sensitive skills. It catches the time and place perfectly. (Italy's twenty years.) It is a story of love and perversion. The characters are unique and trusted. Settings are very amazing. Some events --- a funeral boat in the fog --- a long shot of chess table in the middle of a very tile proposed apartment - it's a beautiful picture. And instead of a mandatory end of happiness, this story has one sweet sweet. If the film is art, this is close to the jewel. <br /> <br />
