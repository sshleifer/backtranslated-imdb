This film is more than Lupine then more, especially from Funimation. Other then bad dub, not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is as much as a comic (which is all Lupine stuff 3 is based). Lupine tries to find a great treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness for women trying to find something out of it. Still the last is not bad, she is with other women, but of course Fujiko is still the number one. Most of the other Lupine films are more than Families with the words of the cuss then Lupine. Any good Lupine fan thinks she will be surprised (I know I was hearing many bad things about this movie). It can be better without small sketches developing during the credit (making it a little mushy) but in general, it's not a bad film. Good enough to be one of the few I would like to look back on Lupine III movies.
