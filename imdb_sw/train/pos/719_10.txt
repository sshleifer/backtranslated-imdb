Although this film is a cheesiness for its best, it is pulled off perfectly. This movie, of course, should be considered as modern modern. There are basically two types of movies I like - movies and depth (chick flicks, if necessary - I blame my wife for this) and comedies without mind where I can sit back and relax. This movie is the perfect perfect example. My friend sent them to this film shortly after release. Considering me for a little, he told me, "You must see this film. It's just your kind of film." To say insulting, I began to look. I know they cite Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, it's Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had my glorious time. This game, though now somewhat, must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else for it.
