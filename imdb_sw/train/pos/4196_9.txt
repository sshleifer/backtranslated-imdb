These amazing crimes are such as the color of the film, although the change of context from post-war to the Cold War and has something good to say about humanity. In "Pickup South Street", the police are good people, criminals are real boys, and only enemies are "The Commies", who are finally described from the good people because they are personal emotion, driven by real service for their own value , as shown in close-track-closely which explores the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie refers to characters. Innovation in this film is unique and comprehensive: Put in a pocket that can destroy any risk, and sometimes during their wealth; Moe the author who tries to save only for a fun burial, but who can capture the hearts and respect of the other characters (and listeners); Candy, a innocent girl who is said to do the government work and does not fully know the plan she is dealing with; and Joey, a boyfriend of a bad old Commie boy who tries to hide everything from everyone and, surprisingly, is the worst person in doing that. Cast into a group of colorful characters (such as a boy with chopsticks and police) and "South Street Pickup" meets with the glory of the creatures while photographing confidential and stolen pictures. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
