Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and gets a flight to Miami. He is about to sit next to a killer named Jackson who tells him that he needs to change his family's house or his father. The reason he needs to change the room is because Jackson wants to beat it. It is a great movie to emphasize because Lisa is trying several ways to avoid this approach that Jackson has set up. The whole story is good and I thought they could spend more time on the plane. There may be more on the plane but moreover, the whole movie was very good. <br /> <br /> I loved more to finish because it was leaving the heart. I didn't know what would happen and I was surprised by it. For me, this film just took it.
