It has come out and can't believe the brilliant document that this is. Often you walk out of the movie theater in fear and amazingly. Recently the movies have been growing so much that the joy of discovering something special and unique happens rarely. Amores Perros did this for me when it first came out with this movie now. I didn't know this before I got into it and what a surprise. If you feel the concept you can get the impression that this is one of the most touching movies about the amazing victory over and over the top music and trying to make us more sure about the good news that describes but not leaving us. Of course this is not a movie. People say the story! This works very well to get every time they share their time when we get into the world and feel every second with them. There is much more plant that makes everything going on for more time. Contact Void was also a great doc about climbing the mountain and demonstrating the power in the way of engaging but this film is a more human story. I only saw today but I will go and say that this is one of the best documents I have seen.
