Some people say this is the best film that the PRC has ever given, I don't know much about it since I have had a good place in my heart for their secrets. I will say that this is one of the most exclusive films, or another studio, large or small, released. <br /> <br /> The program is simple. The shade of a murdered trader has returned to the pond to kill all those who gave him lynche along with all of the distant spring. In this mix comes the grandson of the victims of the same spirit, the current follower. He takes the ferry business as the soul has closed in the person he loves. <br /> <br /> Locked with a thick mist and put it exactly on one swamp to put this more poem music than a typical feature film. rhythms of conversation, especially in earlier scenes, they are poetical cadence to them. There is also the effectiveness of the camera function as it walks back and forth on the beach like crossing and returning the gateway between life and death, guilt and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or anorosus or a subject of music more than a typical movie. His amazing piece of film that is probably the only one in the history of the film. This is not for Lilly Agency. This is the lowest fear of the budget / secret that tells you a good story that will continue to attract you. His story of love and revenge is what is involved here, not the film that makes it and puts you first priority (technical issues are just wearing a window.). Fog does not create a mood but also hides the fact that this rain is completely on dry ground. Regularly return and return in the same way for a while but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. Do not get me wrong like this film. His very best film that I am how you would like a little poverty was hit. In fact it has value to look like you can cross.
