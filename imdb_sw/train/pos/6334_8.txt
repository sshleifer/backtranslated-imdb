This movie has other things that are very strange. First, it should be based on a true story. That, itself, is remarkable that many hurricanes can hit the city at night during the fall-in Nebraska. I wonder if the real city name was next to "Blainsworth" (the city name in the movie). At Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that begins with something of Blains. <br /> <br /> It shows the slow moving corals in the record of where your boys are at home. On the other hand, the area where the TV goes fuzzy depends on the truth. Before the radar radio and Doppler radio, we were taught that if you turned your TV to a certain center (not on the cable) and just considering it, you could say if there was a tornado. The problem was that at that time you would be able to hear. Since I know something about the midwest tornado, it has made this film enjoy me. I enjoy most of Twister. I mean, give me a break - no way you can do it with F5 by submitting to the tap in a nice house.
