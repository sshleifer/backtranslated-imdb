WOW, finally Jim Carrey has returned from the dead. This movie was with me laughing and crying. It also sends messages that we should all know and learn from. Jeniffer Aniston was good, eventually he would have a film hit under his belt. If you liked the falsehood you will love this movie. I offer 9/10.
