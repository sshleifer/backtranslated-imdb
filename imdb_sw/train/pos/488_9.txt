The part I enjoyed from this film was caused by the fact that I did not know anything more about that than it was the star John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to look), was a piece of time and involved chess. Everything happened before me did not expect quite. So, I can't give away more. It is worth mentioning that Turturro is as good as shade, emotionally and large-scale chess genius and Em interacting as gradually as a powerful woman attracted to her. It is about love and excessive, rather than a board game of honor and after opening me gradually over half the first, it became quite compelling. And I defend anyone for the second-guess end.
