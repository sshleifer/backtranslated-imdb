This was a top-notch movie topped up. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed have been beaten well in this beautiful movie about the true angel supporting the Angels' team. You don't know, it can happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. He was hilarious. The story is about converting your life around, as little faith in the Angel has helped to turn around with an angry, tough, and shocking Glover manager to see better in people. The movie was well and also on the best seeing in people and achieving your dream. It was beautiful, charming, touching, and sad, all done well. You will like it (or like it). I make sure. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
