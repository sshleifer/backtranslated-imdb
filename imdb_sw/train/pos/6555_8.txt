I have read more than 100 books of Nancy Drew, and if you are not strong enough to find it yet, Nancy Drew's film was MNYANA Nancy Drew, not 18-year-old who does not go to school that all of the books are near. This was when she had sixteen. So usually, he would not be as wise as the one in the book considering he is only in grade 10. Other than that, I thought the movie was very good. It was clean and accurate for everyone. It was a good time. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. He was saying, in character, and good. I loved the evil that Nancy and Ned were almost everyone because they were not old enough to be in a big relationship like them in books. It was a good film, PG that I enjoyed because I, unlike many people of my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or dirt.
