I enjoyed this film, and after watching it, it helped me wonder how many 'Caitlin Rose' are in the world. How many other girls have been treated with this type of sexual abuse, and suffered by class pupils and are too afraid to open their mouths about it? How young people can threaten and violence, because as this film shows, who is not very important, who is popular, and is afraid of what makes young minds, and persuades them to let this kind of sexual immorality from Tiffani Amber Thiessen give strong performance as a victim of rape, and Brian Austin Green is induced as a guy broke between the girl he thought he loved, and his best friend. This is a kind of film that is not available worthy.
