this is the best comedy I ever seen! but not all can understand this you must be from Georgia to understand this amazing film! :) The most excellent film I ever seen .......... Benjamin and all actors playing well but well Kote Daoshvili (Baba Germogel) is in my opinion to work best in supporting history The movie :)) In this movie play a lot of georgia like ipolite xvichia, Government Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... all are Stars in the Georgian movie :) with this movie is play a good Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course The film director Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... i recommend this movie to everyone but remember you must know the beautiful Russian language to watch this film
