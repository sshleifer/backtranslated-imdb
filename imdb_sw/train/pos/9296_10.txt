I love this film. It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of madness, and certainly not your usual comedy. If you don't get an exciting movie then I think it's not just for your taste, so this is hard to write comments for. For example, Other sessions that I love are Big Lebowski, Bride, and Zoolander (that one has found me a second time). There are others, but my taste is obviously common, and I have admitted that most people don't just like that kind of thing. I don't know forgiveness for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. The events and characters of this film are included, the humorous humor is hilarious, the situation is surprising, acting is very good (if you could expect to be cast), although acting decisions made by the script are not very high. The general fund makes fun, fun, still enjoyable entertainment.
