James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are working together in the Budapest gift shop that is not really loved, without knowing they are good money lovers who have never met. <br /> <br /> Very romantic comedy, very actively played with two beautiful stars and a very desire-to-please help help. The story is well written and the film is sexually immoral (it doesn't know how to explain) that the film today treasure. This can be compared to recently you have Got Mail, and the previous success every way. <br /> <br /> This must look every Christmas, I can imagine the best way to fly Christmas feel than this small gem.
