The beautiful Treasury Island was made. You don't like film <br /> <br /> like this again, or ever. No one makes this film like this. More <br /> <br /> than a novel, this film is exciting, realistic and interesting, but still awesome, <br /> <br /> Wonderful and interesting. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director / manager <br /> <br /> should have some idea about all of it, but it'll leave the room for your opinion and your interpretation, with a little stop left for ideas. Why he / she <br /> has not made more movies like this, I don't know. When you are reminded of some of the best, it's one of the kind. But this is not lazy or simple.
