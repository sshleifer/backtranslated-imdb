This was a great movie that had a lot under false issues. It dealt with the issue of rascism and class. But, he also had a message to know himself and take responsibility for himself. This movie was very strong issued a message that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being easy with you is the only one who can enter the community. Others think about you is not important. I believe this movie did a good job to show it. Pastors I think they were able to present every wonderful character. I thought it was amazing how this movie was true. In fact you will not see how deep the film is, but to look more you see the meaning of the film.
