I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think he's a kind of actress who was better not to act before the camera, but just to be yourself. He did so, and he appeared to be common in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, he tried to add in a more fake performance, especially in the first half of the film, so that he could see as more intelligent editor. While he was in another half, he put himself back in his track every day, and I can just tell him to be any way editor. Therefore, its performance cannot remain in this film. The video, in general, is interesting and interesting. The behavior of young people is complete and wise. However, the film describes a great and modern story. The only great weakness is that it did not show the turning point of the story of the hero and the love of the heroine. I am quite confused during a kiss at the end of the story, for this reason it is unknown to two people.
