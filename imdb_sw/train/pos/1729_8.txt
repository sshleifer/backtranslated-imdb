In 1943, a group of RAF officials, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to avoid the POW camp by using Gymnastic Vaulting horses in the courtyard. In 1950, it decided to be a film of his account, and it began a very dedicated British Film Genre-story of the Prison Camp Army that reached its ranks at risk (1959). one of the silent movies I have watched. There is no good time, but enough story eventually builds on a more tough stage because the story is not suitable for the impossible drama, cuts or stripes of some music (somethings about to happen!). It's quite his time and works well. Today Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson cause the lowest of the lowest and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, they are always mono-tonal and quiet. They put their feelings away from their roles. As many were, until recently, old service, I think they returned to their duties during the war as 'Officers and Lords'. This dishonest way does not stop any great tension. On the contrary, in contrast to many of the Anti-War Films, the story does not end on the barbed wire: and that fact keeps me hard to end.
