Charles McDougall's commentary includes leading events on 'Sex and City', 'Failure Workers', Queer as Folk', 'Big Love', 'The Office', etc. so comes with all the features of making a film version The TV novel Meg Wolitzer SURRENDER, DOROTHY WINNING. And he can largely put this story of the possibility on the death of a loved one and in a way that people in his life do away. Sara (Alexa Davalos) unmarried young women accompany her best friends - Adam's gay (Tom Everett Scott), now Shafani's Adam Shawn (Chris Pine), and two married Maddy (Lauren German) and Peter (Josh) Hopkins and their newborn baby - home to Hamptons for summer holidays. The group is seen jolly until the journey of the ice cream into Adam and Sarah) causes a car accident that kills Sara. At that time Sara's mother Natalie Swedlow (Diane Keaton) who has a good social life but has often called her daughter here always with a 'Emergency', greeting, a place in another place: she accepts a call that Sara is dead coming soon to Hamptons where his self-defense and sadness makes friction between Sara's friends. A little bit but actually Natalie reveals the secret about each of them, continuing to talk about Sara as though doing so brings her. Natalie's quest for any cost causes a big change between the group and it is through the legal love of Sarah who has left that all finally meets. Diane Keaton does the best job in these roles that walks between the drama and the comedy and its existence there is a story together. Screenplay has its time for good lines, but also has a lot of filling that becomes a bit heavy and morose to make the characters clear that they are concerned with the given lines. Yes, this story has been told many times - the effect of sudden deaths in the lives of those who have been changed and opened - but the film goes faster and has real entertainment enough to make it worthy to watch.
