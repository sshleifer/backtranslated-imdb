This movie is wonderful. What separates from the other sci-fi is 50 is the fact that the stranger has no reputation, no face, eyes, anything, still can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film does not work for a few days, it happens one night, which is thought to be past midnight. It also scares that once the blob gets you, you can't remove it. you are stuck in it, if it breaks your body and slows down your body. I have loved 50 sci-fi movies all the time, and sometimes it is considered one of the most necessary. I can see why Steve McQueen this rock love. All this with a theme of interesting landscapes! How can you go wrong?
