I had reservations about this film, I thought it would be a common bill of fare - movie of the form about Christmas. When you are in the middle of the heat wave in late June, we decided to pay a shot, maybe we'll see the snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned into one laughter after another. Ben Affleck was trusted in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He gave his lines with a real wit on it and made a "great father". <br /> <br /> If you want to have a few hours of enjoyment, surely look at this one out.
