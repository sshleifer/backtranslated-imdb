Wow I loved this film, William H. Macy is as good as Alex has quieted it. <br /> <br /> All the exhibitions here are true, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br> Alex, a married man (like his father) with a small child, keeps a middle-aged crisis and wants to leave a family business so he goes to a psychologist for help and this place meets a free youth will Sarah who falls in love. One day Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill someone he knows. I recommend you check it if you like interesting interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
