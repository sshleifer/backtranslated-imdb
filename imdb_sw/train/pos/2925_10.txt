when eddie murphy standing women from the audience shouted at eddie and someone from the audience responds. what it says is, women - DO MR ROB (this is a character from Saturday night live), someone responds to SHUT UP BITCH. in contrast to the previous publication that the women said they did gumby, this is not correct, although after they said they were there they must have trouble hearing! in spite of what the post-er says about not being able here on DVD to be almost listening if you really can hear on DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps anyone feels out of stimulating gas cheers !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
