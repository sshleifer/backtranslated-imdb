It's just funny, check out !!! <br /> <br /> Certainly want 10 lines for it: This is a spoof of 50s / 70s waswolf movies. Lots of satire, some political. Feeling like the original movie of Clouseau (perhaps from Alan Arkin), but with the stick of the stick. If you like Naked Buns movies you would like this too (once again under the slapstick in this one). In fact, humor has sexual feelings (it is impossible in the boy's comedy), for a good social and political satire. The School High School Change from 50 to 70s is true. The sequence to change the presidential image is brilliant! Well maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. There are tons of histarical cracks from the 50th frost of the cold paranoia and at the end of 70 years.
