I saw this film first as a boy before age, about age where children begin to think about their identity. I was very affected by the person's place and the children he raises as himself. The old boy is made to be his mother is a prostitute and no brother has one biological father (which Kurosawa makes it clear to have children who do not see anything like them). The man persuades the boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is said to be the father of all but one, who still loves his brother. Every one of the vignettes is also forcing their own stories and conclusions. It's a good film, even if it's not a great film of Kurosawa.
