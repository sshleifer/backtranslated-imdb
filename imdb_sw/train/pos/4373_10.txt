I ask anyone saying they do not have this video service. Some experts said there was no adequate action, others said it was too long, etc.. Don't listen to it !!! If you like Shawshank's deliverance and / or Braveheart, you will surely love this film! <br /> <br /> Work shows are amazing! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang crave and Liam Neeson does a pleasant job and is an attractive character because of its size. Cinemapgraphy's photo was brilliant and interesting. It is a series of movies that I have seen in my life (with Shawshank) that had no sense of throwing, leading, writing, acting, etc.! !!! I was surprised this is not 'T in top 50 or 100 movies that have been reviewed. I heard so much that I was registered with IMDB and then I could everyone know the true score. I've seen this movie 10 times (every time with someone different) and everyone liked it! You must be vigilant and pay attention for the first 30 minutes because it creates a few characters at first. If you have more time to consider more than many of these juvenille children write a movie review on this site, than you would like this movie! Come ... all 3 of the movie's Rings movies in 9 up with Matrix in # 32?!?! That should show you the age of most consultants here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie!
