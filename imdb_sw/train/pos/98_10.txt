For me, this special Christmas is one that I remember very much. In 1989, I used two CDs that I found for recording, giving one to my sister and putting another one for myself. It is part of my family's Christmas customs now, and I would like to see a show again than just remember if I'm listening. It was found elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show, and did more than one special together. The good relationship between Denver and his ignorant associates comes in a clear way here, in a charming and beautiful display that is good for all ages.
