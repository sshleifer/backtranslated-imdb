This was the eighth and final film of Columbia Whistler and just one without Richard Dix who had retired from the film and was dead the following year. It is still a powerful thriller, the machine continues without him fully, but? The thing was missing: Dix! The story in Whistler's series was fascinating, sometimes brilliant, screenshots often have been in the color of the sky every time, but not just Whistler himself who wrapped him all on the screen, also Dix did. The young couple leave for two weeks to get married in the rainy season but suffer when the first bride is lost and she is ready to be married before they appear to be mad. What? Groom can pull out, even when a personal dick hired to find slugs and suddenly, or likes the blind? Who misleads who is the question. Michael Duane in his last film is exactly the same as a bit of a wimp, the most beautiful long-term Lenore Aubert came to the next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was amazing as ever from Boston Blackie. Also out of the journey where Whistler himself must have rain from rainwater, unless he is covered by the sea foam by sound. <br /> <br /> Many attempts have been made in this last hour, well considering and again as usual for fans of the kind like me. Whistler's radio series started in 1942 until 1955 when it revealed about half an hour showing, almost all that is available on the mp3 and according to what I have heard so far close to all that is also relevant to listen.
