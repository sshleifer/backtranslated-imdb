"Minute hate" is one of the best films from Michigan in recent years. Not to say it is a brilliant film in any way, but it is definitely worth watching. "Negative" describes the adventures of the sordid of Eric Seaver (played by Kallio director), a child who has now been growing up, and began to hear his bad side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very good visually. Shots are creative, and the lights are largely and interesting to look at. This film has a feature of production value, as opposed to other recent Michigan releases as "Tomorrow's Dark" and "Appealed Applications". The trick of shots of the illusion and the pattern of the bullet displayed shows the best use of the $ 350,000 budget of this film. However, "Hate" remains in the same places that many local films are doing, and that's in the news and behavior department. In fact, only things are proposed. Eric Seaver does not change at all. Basically, he has always been mad, it's just that people start to remember. The film is moving in a fun way with very little progress. Also, the end is very sudden. Still - since this is a terrible movie, since when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die, and "hate" certainly announced. As the body count came out, people in the theater began to enjoy "Kill him!" "When people scream back on the screen, you are always happy. This is where" hate "is successful.
