I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and I've watched many movies so far and none of them have gone to make me laugh. Nor did he have to lose friends and encourage people. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically about a good person like walking people. However, he has the right to a moral nature that prevents him from doing things that might make him famous. But finally he ends up making them, a culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is shown well with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of lap dance. It is one of those movies where you can only be happy when it is finished.
