I am sure a lot of this film depends on the true story. At first it says according to a true story, kind of. I say the only truth to them there was an old-fashioned patron of the virtue that can be called Domino. However, it starts with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what he knows about theft of $ 10 million. Basically he tells other bounty hunters 2, Ed and Choco. They allow him to join the group. He is tough, he can use any kind of weapon, and he will use his good as needed. They are involved in a scandal that Clarmont, bailman, is going. On the way, the group starts a real TV show, and then Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green are involved. They are kind of like hosts and must have been eager to appear here. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and had some laugh. Editing did not work for me. There is also a lot of violence, especially using guns, and blood. It can be very short. <br /> <br /> VERDICT OF FILIA: Good enough to look.
