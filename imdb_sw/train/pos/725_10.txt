The Fascist Woman Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who has been avoided by a professional photographer Dean Cundy if she had ten feet long) has a plan to turn over the square. Problems make a challenge that the rock'n'roller's delightful goals Riff Randell (PJ Soles who looks at the screen - has a hot bod, too) who is a great fan of the punk punctua port. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, who is a very large glass and the role of nerdy cannot hide his wonderful beauty) joins the power with Riff to stop the claim of rock'n'roll for good that Togar's favorite message. Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role like Tom Roberts, success in everything, but getting set. Kate is crazy about Tom. If only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the film around (honestly, who can steal this film from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, "seller" who can find everything almost everything. His office is in the boy's room! Paul Bartel is also cautious as a music teacher who becomes a Riff member when he likes the GOMES festival. It is a high school that rejects all of the common rules. It is like someone says, "Let's make a fun life for 1Â½ hours." The film is really chaotic. The non-conspiracy of the love of love for the heart for the heart (even though they are awesome actors, have the opportunity to get new audiences with this film). Overall the entire film has been completed. Riff and his classmates are taking high school with one starting group. Be honest, I didn't want a party to end! It is not uncommon for us to leave this film free. In line with the rocky sound of some of the most beautiful rockes, this film allows the viewer to accept time in life when the battles do not dominate the headlines and people had a good time. Those, I think they were day.
