I will not give anything by describing the plot of this film except to say that it begins with the return of Israel to a young blind woman whose close friend and friend has committed suicide. It seems like an inquiry like a blind woman is trying to find out why her friend finished her life. While tracking its observations and information gathers, it leads to the disappearance of a major conclusion. The film focuses on working, especially with Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, a blind woman, better. The Israeli film is full of age and now has full competition with other external films, although few have found many viewers in U.S.
