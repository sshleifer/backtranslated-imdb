Well here comes another, well, romantic romantic ... but contrary to all the movies of this kind, this is the best I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I will, at first I wanted to watch this film because of Megan Fox, and a little because of Simon Pegg ... First and foremost, if you have looked at the amount of respect of movies, you will know that Sidney and Alison will be with the film, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of The film will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this film is only for Simon Pegg. I can't see another actor in Sidney's position, and I'm sure this will be a very weak movie if not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> There are a number of wonders and jokes in this movie that made me laugh so hard, in honor of Simon Pegg's Sidney character ... but I think everyone in this movie is good.For example, Kirsten Dunst is established in this movie (usually do not think of him as more than an act of moderate ress, but he was very good at this), then there was Jeff Bridges, there is Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox who plays surprise surprise Sophie Maes. A great responsibility for her ... <br /> <br /> For all, when I often disagree with its standards on IMDb, this time I would like to agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go see This film, it's really hearty and positive, and I recommend in detail ... my rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 true ...
