Maybe it's just because I am so afraid of hospitals and medical supplies, but this has under my skin (pardon pun). This piece is a hero, not afraid to go up and as satisfactory as they come to the terms of a movie revenge. Not only did I feel a lot of feelings of hatred and compassion towards the "screwee", I felt a cringe and felt the pain of hatred at a particular meeting that is so common and interesting for a jaded observer like a panic like myself. Part is a very reminiscant of "Hellraiser", but come as a tax instead of imitation. It is a very fragmented piece that does not give the viewer much to think, but I am glad to have a slide attack once and a bit. This piece brings and doesn't download. I loved this very much. Do not look when you eat pudding.
