Definition of the post of female cruelty and sadness. <br /> <br /> Viewer! This gem hit under the film describes the story of Flavia, a fifteenth-year-old girl of Noble's birth was confined to a meeting after defining her father and in fact the whole Christian community of Medieval by looking at a hero a Muslim who fell as a man instead of demon figures. It cannot accept the rule of the members of the tribal meeting (obviously in the area where Archbishop arrived with weapons and soldiers) Flavia begins to ask a community question that he finds himself, by losing the entire system of torture, oppression and violence , of course it brings the end of fear not only him but all those around him. <br /> <br /> Earn as a piece of this violation is far from reality. This is a film that shows the effects of violence, the effects of patriar rule, the nature of rebellion and corruption of the human spirit. I described it in the title of this piece as 'after the female' and finally Flavia's victory must be destroyed, affected by the men. Even at the end of Flavia's refusal is done by men for men (women turn around and members only watch without fear. <br /> <br /> About many of the discussions discussed: this is an example of the effects of abuse and threats of the world used by madness The removal of the violence would have reduced the impact of the film, would have affordable film and allowed to be made within the speech of Patriarchal shows the middle class. especially with Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares, with a beautiful and piovani brand and still has a challenge after all years Flavia is a classic Cinema of Europe.
