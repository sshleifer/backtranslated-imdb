Good effort for Australian display. which should not be surprising if it seems to be renewed in the quality of Aussie. Can I compare this show to the beauty of my love way? No. but it remembers the first secret life. The cast is good, the gibney uses its magic in the first two events I saw, the British strikes also particularly the characters of the callum and lizzie. but being forsythe can be a light saving (not that it needs to save) if this show is getting another season. I was not a fan of his performance in a series of amazing series of mini series of years but was as good as hal in always. is also good to see brooke satchwell again. lets hope show continues to improve with each section.
