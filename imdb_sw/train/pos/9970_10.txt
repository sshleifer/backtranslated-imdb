The best use of high technicolor technologies shows many of the hopes of modern Christmas holidays. This feature during the events (Santa & Pedro summarized the behavior of the community looking through the telescope) is unique (and plainly Jean-Luc Godard, although he was a trick, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou") . It is highly recommended!
