Possible SPOILERS: Not sure When looking at the King of the Lion 1 1/2, I couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the entire film. It is obviously a good way to spend an hour and 15 minutes. But nothing about it that will give you the same kind of emotions that the King of Lion made. The story, for those who have not read other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumbaa met, and how they affect the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There is a really good joke in the movie. My favorite part is when they show pairs add Lion. However, for me the worst part should be when they show Timon and Pumbaa direct intervention with previous events. I can never look at "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel The Night of Love" is the same way again (I am similar to "I Just Can Not Wait to be King" sequence). <br /> <br /> Sound talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella does a good job, such as Matthew Broderick, a boy who has a Friend, and a hyenas. Even the actress who makes the little Lion beat enough like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me. But why did they include a sound actor in Zazu? He had only 2 lines, and he wasn't very important. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller's announcements only add to the talent, although you can't hear the voice of Timon's mother and not think about Marge Simpson. There are some instances that seem to be incompatible with the original, one who comes to mind when they are a proud rock at the end. What? How did they get in the fight against previous fighting with witches? <br /> <br /> Like the DVD itself, you can't help but feel that by setting 2 discs, specific features don't fail. They can have a simple definition, or other aspect ratio on the first disk. I enjoyed "Who desires to be the King of the Jungle" game, even if it is a more embarrassing example of promoting the cross I've ever seen. Some questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Generally, a good movie, though not close to TLK or even TLK2.
