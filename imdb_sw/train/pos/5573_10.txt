YOU WANT TO GET! I saw WHIPPED on journalists' investigation and it was hilarious. We say unwanted laughs. It does something about MARY looks like a drama. Amanda Peet gives the sound of the stars and its combination of win, beauty, and great ability to act. Peter Cohen, director, has made an intense film which shows within the raw of the egos of people in the remote world dating. For all that is interesting, they were beaten and succeeded with that mind. Which is very common for the first director, especially for romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Jude Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zorie Barber are going around with deep and powerful displays as they would be female. You need to see these people going to work and get caught on the Peet network. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it has the value to download 3 minutes.
