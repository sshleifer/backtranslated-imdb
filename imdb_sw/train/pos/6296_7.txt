Sam is good, intelligent and very important. Will he be able to put his true character under control? Besides, Sam does not have a successful artist - however? This is a sweet, interesting, and interesting movie with two very interesting stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Typically, the plot is a string of "how I can continue with this ruse", and Sam ask Parker for shampoo when he is persuading or urging him to sleep in bed when he gets bad news. Also, it is important for Parker to produce himself "fake" mate gay, Boris, while Sam insists on binding with someone who knows.
