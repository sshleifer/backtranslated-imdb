I enjoyed this film. The humor was not there at times but I enjoyed how the story moved between surprises and great in the film. This is the only second movie where I have seen the Verdone act (the other was 'Un sacco bello'), and I see why Italy has made trouble, but she thinks it was well done as a loving father. My only way with this movie is that I knew it happened in Italy - somewhere in the middle or south, I think, but I felt like there was no place representation. This movie could be done in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important for movies to have a chance to give viewers something related to. (Maybe I lost something?) :) If you love Italian movies, then I think you will enjoy this. Not Fellini or Rossellini - not realistic or purely-realistic. It is a wonderful story for a short time that can happen to any of us.
