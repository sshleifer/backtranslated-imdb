This film is awesome. kind of. it's dosing really to say a lot, or do a lot, but it's an amazing movie looking for how stupid. A high school is considered by a very bad disorder that hates one thing that all students love, rock & rock. Riff Randle Get everyone tickets to show ramones, and this peak movie and take over the school has led riff randle & ramones. This movie has everything, bad script, consulted interviews, evil administrators (ie clint howard & pj soles), amazing sounds, severe hatred, these components & much more come together to make it, classic. <br /> <br /> note - during the live condoms, beware that the viral crash is in front of the crowd. nude-o.
