This “coming to age” film deals with the experience of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love happy summer. Guided by Robert Mulligan, famous for his excellent work in "To Kill the Cycle," the film never finds false information. All acting is very good. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes an amazing film first. Watching this well-adjusted and well-reviewed film, I felt like I was looking through the window for reality, rather than watching the film. I have watched this film at least 5 times, and it can honestly say that it is one of the best movies made on being younger, being in love, and experiencing emotions, challenges, and young adult changes. Families and children between 10 and 15 should look at it together, and use it as a piece of discussion, since it raises a number of issues about brotherly competition, how to deal with being in love, parental responsibilities, etc..
