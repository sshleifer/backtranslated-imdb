The whipping of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can damage the hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow concerning the theory of Chaos, I do not know exactly how), each step, regardless of whether it is small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can cause serious events. This small jewel of film shows us a series of invisible characters, many of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (The six-theory of isolation can also be used.) Each story is a piece of jewel which is this film. The act is good and effective (Audrey Tautou is of light), the story is interesting, just the same humor, and the viewer leaves the reminder.
