Ladies Man is laughing loudly, and throwing us differently as well as having many stupid but better events (including the funniest love song you've ever written). Ferrell is his typical character in the role of brilliant side. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows attracts idiot well and has written some of the funniest lines you will find in any comedy out there. It is worth it to buy if you look every 6 months or so it will lead you while laughing as hard as you did the first time. I am sad to think this writing is small 4.7 / 10 and I encourage you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember children - "These more motion in the sea"
