I think the film is educational. However, it fails to treat the issue that has contributed to the complexity: many marriages. Also, the film fails to reveal what the LDS church wants. The main way was lost to telling the world what they believe. I couldn't get a clear idea of ​​what LDS's views are on the topic of the main religion. I have many LDS friends and they are good people. It would be good to get a clear picture of how they see the views of their prophet more controversial. Perhaps these statements are very difficult to be treated in the film format, but it would be good to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's real life. After all, it gives insight into US ideas about religion in the 18th century. Hope they make a document on this interesting issue, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We can have a Mormon president on a certain day. After all, Smith rushed to the president.
