I agree I only saw three Shakespeare games (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, & Hamlet of course) I liked, some I got (Macbeth), and Hamlet I got a masterpiece. I am happy to tell you that this efficiency is all as good as an intense and awesome game. Acting is very powerful (For cast by Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) And change over time (It seems like somewhere between the ages of 17 and 1800) starts as well as the characters around and saying their very bad from the script itself that any fan of Shakespearean play will get cold. If you are in this popular festival I encourage you to look at this powerful 1996 issue from Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh.
