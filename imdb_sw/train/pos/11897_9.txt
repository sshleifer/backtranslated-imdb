This is a wonderful flick of which the fans of indie films will know the truth. It has good acting, lots of lots, and good plot. One will be reminded of the movie as The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not too big, but the film is in the form of a strong show and actors, which appears to be missing in most of the major budget budgets of today's budget. The film goes along with there is a better direction and good camera function. No events were lost, so the length of the film is short. In addition, it looks like the end opens the opening for the series, which will be interesting too. So grab some popcorn, temesha lights and enjoy this.
