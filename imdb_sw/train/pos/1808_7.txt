Dog All Go to Heaven is a movie of an animated kid like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all popular in conspiracy, and although children will get very little, adults will be blowing their heads why this film was made to feel like a kind of gangster movie. The real modern is not clear in any way, it is a wonderful mix of making a child's movie. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player of the player, who has half of the casino with his girlfriend Carface (Vic Tayback). After the drink (dog .... drink ... in the child's movie. It just looks amazing), Charlie is confused and killed by Carfax. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to the earth, but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven. He still returns to the world and meets his former friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and plans to return to Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little girl Anne Anne was imprisoned because of her amazing ability to talk to all kinds of animals, which helps to predict society. Charlie and Itchy let them loose, and try to help her find family, while learning more about themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to children and adults. Children will enjoy funny characters and live animation, while adults enjoy beautiful, conspiracy plot, and more commonly developed characters. One thing going on down, is that it's music. Usually, that's a good thing, but music here is a terrible evil. They tend to fly around, near the sound of the sound produced, and almost without any help. In fact, these are the worst songs I have heard in an animation film, but unfortunately, all films are full enough to fall because of bad information. <br /> <br /> End of this film work, but I hate it honestly. Sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the movie feel like it needs a layout. Considering how a good winner who made it for this was, I would end it did not enable someone else and it would be closed to a good, good mood. This is one of the few movies I feel this way, but I. Overall, this is a good family film, and an unusual theme is thrown into, but nevertheless, good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 85 months. G.
