The most important thing about this film is the good performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite his physical nature have won all the character. If a person who has worked with patients with brain diseases, I can assure you that their performance was convincing. The great help that Christy received for his family, low-income, Dublin's working class, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture showed the help carefully not read the book, but the dialogue was carefully written to capture Christy Brown's proud person . I recommend this film to everyone, especially for ordinary movie lovers.
