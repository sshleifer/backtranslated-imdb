Vladimir Navokov's brilliant literature is brought to the screen again and many in the cultural world will see. The director puts us in the look of the Alexandria story, an unknown study of the false image of chess. Nastasya is a holiday in the marble break where the chess championship is considered. He meets with Alexander by lifting a piece of queen to come down in his pocket of the coat. The magnetic attraction is changing where he offers suggestions the next day, the mother telephoned the husband. He comes and asks Alexandria we find the old, Ala 'II of the sheath, where we see little Alexander, a young man. She is taken under the school teachers' school and uses her mind for 10 years doing much. Imagine Alexander reached his peak, looking for him but writing. The former teacher returns to cause harm, trying to give victory to the former opponent of Alexander. In a good chess game where World Chess Champion's victory is one way of immortality, the hour of chess grows, during the match ends up the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, an old teacher intervenes with Alexander being sent to the nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her belly and looking for her love coat finds her strategy to match and follows the action. Although the film unfortunately comes from its Russian roots, its low-cut backs are beautiful, Alexander has a role under the position. The director is increasingly listening to his audience, we can never get to play with the flavor of The Luzhin Defense is after the business to bring, excluded King rivals and your 3 paws and King, offering a fortress for a partner. Nastasya is a good match, but feel his conclusion is more complicated, but maybe the feeling was correct on chess checks meant more than he did. The protection of Luzhin elegantly gives respect to Navokov, the complexity of his work in the picture is a world event that does not fail.
