In addition to being a very enjoyable film, I would like to add that dress and environment were wonderful. This loving, happy woman has a lot of money. Unfortunately, he also had two greedy daughters who were worried about getting their hands on his money. The woman was alone since her husband's death. He was recommended to him in the theater that would have dropped. To prevent it, he bought it. His daughters were afraid that he was giving their "money" and decided to take action. Characters of the character in this film were also included. I would like to give you anything to have a copy of this film on my video library, but if it is still, it has never been released. Sad.
