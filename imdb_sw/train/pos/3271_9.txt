I was a great fan of this film, first of all you saw cast, acting is very good and helping make this film go very well. The Cybill pastor was given a new idea for his role, and they were worthy. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose photo-perfect marriage comes to an end when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot when he accepts "restored" again on earth as Alex Finch born (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life forgetting his old life when Corinne tries to continue with her. But ultimately cross Alexs way 23 years later when he meets with the daughter of Corinne Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly floods and wealth of unwanted memories (this is where fun begins, and the state of disgrace occurs.) Music is good and events are felt and very good. You cannot move away if you give an opportunity, a chance you like. Very good and sweet!
