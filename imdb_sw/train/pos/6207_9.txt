I saw this film @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed! And if you don't know and this oeuvre director ... it doesn't matter. This film can definitely stand all alone. I go to a second investigation ... it was strange I need to see again - and quickly! <br /> <br /> This film is very funny. Talk is very smart, and the performance of Parker Posey is better as its stars in the position of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the most recent feature of the world and characters portrayed in the film Henry Fool (2000). The view, the modern stylistic feature uses the common use of the planned angle (or dutch), which can be seen often in the old Hartley works that appear in short, available in the possible Movies: short work and Hal Hartley collection 1994- 2004, and Girl from Monday (2005). I watched this film correctly on 11 September. In fact, the adventure of Fay Grim in this story stands against the changing world after September 11, 2001. Without the entry of major criminals, I see this work, and the world of stories as a political and original geo-politics image A few, as previously, was planned in modern journalism after 911 earlier (see Syrianna: mark mark - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in these two films ... more interesting, say at least). At the end, for those closest to Henry Fool characters, Simone, Fay and Henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self referential. What it said, the behavior of Fay Grimm is growing in the film, especially when it was when Henry Fool was finished, but at the end of the film ... Fay's experience and experience has changed a whole and expanded on the course of the story. What can be stored in the future for Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I can't wait a third part in this story!
