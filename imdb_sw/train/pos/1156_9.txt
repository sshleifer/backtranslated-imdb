Years ago I followed the soap on TV. So I was eager to watch this film, and I was very happy to find it. It is a wonderful spoof of soap, and envy, the worst of ordinary actors, and all kinds of extra pleasant. But beyond anything - thrown amazingly with a wonderful script. What? How did someone get all the top voters to play in this kind of non-romance? And this small movie got the authors to write the perfect lines? I've never heard of anyone talking about this film or even accepting hearing, but it's amazing and I strongly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I will give you a time to make a house, and end up sitting in bed, watching, laughing and enjoying anything wonderful. Many speak to all who have done it.
