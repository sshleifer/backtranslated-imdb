Joan Fontaine stars as mad in this film of Victorian era. She beautifully makes a married woman who has a partner on the side and also puts her things to the rich man, Miles Rushworth who plays with Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine did its part to the fullest - was at the same time a trick, counting, looking without guilt, fear and delight. It takes an actor and a wonderful talent to pull it. Joan Fontaine looks quite beautiful in elegant dress with Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I strongly recommend this film.
