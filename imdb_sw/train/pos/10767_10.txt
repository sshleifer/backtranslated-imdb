Of course I would like to give this film 10 out of 10 if my uncle was the principal author of the screenplay immediately on crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for more than 50 years living in Italy. He was a great story teacher and someone suggested that he write his stories. So Rodolfo Sonego made. If you look at his profile, you can see the number of movies made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was a great star star in his story. My uncle visited Australia and my city, in 1968 to explore the "Australian Girl" areas and create a great film about the bride's agent after the second world war. You can see her humor in all her movies. I've got a copy of this movie on DVD soon. GREAT
