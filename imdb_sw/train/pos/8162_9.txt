As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen returns a very good performance of "Dentist". For its adequate compulsory gear on the top gear, the IRS includes, and the only acting wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing its purity every day. <br /> <br /> When Doc actually knows that his wife has a relationship with a local boy, puts a string of events leading to torture, murder, ant total practice! "Dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen performs the behavior of Dr. Feinstone described and hated at the same time. Although he is completely out of his gourd, the audience still feels sympathy for him. That my friends ..... is a very good acting. Good quality is made by administrators to help all around this film. Positive trends, good killings and yearly, and effective enhancement will enable you to be accepted in all the running movies. WORKING TO WORK!
