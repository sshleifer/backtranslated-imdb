This is a good game and a good change of speed from many modern films today. It is another basic-real shop, which means a lot of that can be done with great purpose. In fact, I don't know but I have loved stories. It is about a boy behind fifty years who gets interested in rocket and wants to enter the field instead of working in coal mines like everyone else, including his father, doing in this city of West Virginia. The main problem is the conflict caused between the boy and his father, which I think had passed. I would like to have a little tension between the two. The boy, still a young man, plays with Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first stars, I think. He enjoys, like his school partners here. It is good to see good children in modern films. Two other important characters in the movie are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (a teacher who encourages him all the time.) Once again: I would like to have more of these types of films made today.
