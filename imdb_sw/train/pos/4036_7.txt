Fortunately to get this film even to watch - it has not yet been opened on the tape or DVD. I saw it after the release of the early 70's, I was fortunate to make it through an effort to protect the United States, and it still has some time of appearance that stayed with me for thirty years. There is no reason to repeat the correct comments here. As the Director who came out after the success of five small pieces, Jack N has been said to have tried a small budget effort as possible, and certainly shows in walking and loading which could be reused. But it is also an unforgettable icon at this time: all very intense fighting games of the late 60 academic games, student movements, sex coups, and more. Why do you see this film? It is possible that the breach of land in certain cases: the male frisky male bonding in the water after the game; Karen Black and Tepper's car in the car will take you a little bit - but it's the first use of the word that I have never seen in the movie before; and common and non-anticipated use of impurities in general. There are some others I leave. Look at the beautiful surprise of Cindy Williams in one of his first films; David thin Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren clean out his blue uniform of the blue UCLA and read the blue blue uniform; Robert Towne - Doctor; and many people just play. Now: any relationship between Harry Gittes last name, Robert Towne, and a certain character in Chinatown and Jakes two? It gets "7" according to Karen Black. You will see why.
