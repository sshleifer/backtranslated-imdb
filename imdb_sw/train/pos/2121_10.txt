This is a beautiful movie that is wonderful with all the players. It will make you laugh and will make you cry. The end of the movie makes me lose every time. If you want to see a great movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert provides a wonderful performance with Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek emerges. Morgan's character is not an amazing thing. William Tracy as Pepi is a great relief of comic and offers some of the most important movies and performances. Felix Bressart provides a good performance like Perovich, a shopkeeper who reminds him of life that is a pleasure for those he works with. It is a simple story of how close workers can be and how two people who have a great hatred for each other fall in love though abnormal circumstances.
