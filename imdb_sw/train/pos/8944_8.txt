Bell and Candle's book was released in December 1958 and included James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was by James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second pairing on the screen (after Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, released earlier the same year). This was Stewart's final film as a romantic leadership as he appeared to be very old at the age of 50 to play the same type of part. The movie is about witches played by Kim Novak who is attracted to the man who played with James Stewart. He puts the spell on it and falls head on the heels with love with him. I enjoyed the movie and cast. This time at the time was the average success that was chosen by Golden Globe for the best Movie Comedy. GimmeClassics
