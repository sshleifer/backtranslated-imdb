Takashi Miike is one of my directors who have loved me very much and I was worried about making a children's film, because I would like to see him coming from his favorite films: Alien Q, Gozu, It, Ichi killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Recently she seems to be looking at a new location and I think she is succeeding. This was the first of his films I had seen he took that direction, so I was scared. Most of the purchase I bought without seeing and I was glad I did. Great Yokai War is the perfect children's film and adults should also love it. The entire film reminds me of a lot of movies that I liked as a child: Neverending Story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed these movies because they do not treat children as they are stupid and this is not good. The existing values, but, also, are as silly as any children's film should be. I personally was not concerned with CGI and prosthetics. I feel they are good and don't think children will see. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of death Takashi Miike, you might not like this. But, I recommend giving a shot. It proves that Miike is different from talented as I claimed that she is. He also continues to sign Miike's film out of this, which is a great guarantee. For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something of light or big light like this, I give them these other Miike movies: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'People' Birds in China. ' <br /> <br /> Good works Takashi Miike! Star 8/10.
