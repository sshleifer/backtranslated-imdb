After seeing a short time in the marathons of the movie the fear, I believe it is a beautiful parody that leads to the main point of its memory. Though these themes are full of today's audience, it is not a waste of time. Though the student's film provides a little excuse, the evidence is that it seems to have a little budget look. br>> <br /> As described by another inspector, it is less than ten minutes which is a lot of time to clean the mice to watch and a happy fabric, sit back with the wrong bread through the film. I think this short piece of film should enjoy as a memory of the head and the viewer should relax and around it.
