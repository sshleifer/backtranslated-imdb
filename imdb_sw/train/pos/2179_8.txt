Prix ​​de Beauté was made on a collection of changes from silence to the voice, which came later in Europe than in Hollywood. Pregnancy as a silence, was released in a dubbed voice in France, with a French actress saying Louise Brooks, but was released as a silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky to see the new revival of Cineteca di Bologna of Italian newspapers of silence in Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen a talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is more fun, as for all reports that dubbing is not good (Louise Brooks speaks English with openness, so no lips can be the same.) Also, the film has been made completely in silent style, and a few titles and a little need for discussion. Prix ​​de Beauté tells his story visually, and exciting, working on an exciting camera. Opening is once a kinetic, and the rapid events of urban life and travelers on the public beach. In the film there is an emphasis on visual details, on clothes, machines, decorations, and photographs such as a saved bird, a broken picture, a diamond bracelet. This is a technique of silent film at its peak. Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from care. Seeing this makes the heart more encouraging to think that this was his ultimate responsibility for the stars. He is very interesting, guides the film and his charisma and also gives a normal performance but very charged. His role here, more than Pabst's most popular films, is a woman we can understand and plead. Playing Lucienne Garnier, an old and wealthy boyfriend, who wants to get more of life and secretly brings beauty competition, and a quick success. He then broke the excitement of his beautiful and loving life for someone who insists that he has given all or lost him. All characters are fascinated by nuance. Pastor encourages sympathy and not just a fool: He loves Lucienne, but it is a little person who can not cope with him to live away from him or attract attentions of others. Even "someone else" in the story is not just too easy to take, although his goals can be like a partner's property. ************** *************** ************************************************************************* **** <br /> The film has put many beautiful pieces, including Lucienne's victory in the "Miss Europe" contest, shown by the comic effect of members of the audience, who apologize to heroine and flowers; his grief as a housewife, hitting the potatoes when the pendulum of the hour of cuckoo shows him the time behind him; A happy night journey (in silent version, this happens at the end of the film, after his marriage) where Lucienne, destroyed among the lowest and broken hearted by her husband's antics, decides that she cannot go on her presence now; and especially the final location in the estimates room where he examines his testie screen. Louise Brooks had never been more beautiful than she is doing here, and the beam of the delivery on her alabaster notes, her shoulders hit with white feathers, her face under a black hat hat as she reads her on the screen. Two pictures of his beautiful corpse and his live image on the screen are even worse: Photo of Louise Brooks, such as Lucienne, remains immortal despite her work of the worst film.
