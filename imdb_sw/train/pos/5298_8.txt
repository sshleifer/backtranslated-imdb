John Waters has given us a truly enjoyable film. This is certainly not the dreadful time of Waters-esque, but it is a tamer than its former items, like "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" harkens back to John's original stage that reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor which was apparent in the "Polyester". In general, the comedy really fun and some good time!
