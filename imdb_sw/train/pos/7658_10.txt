I have seen this film many times. At least Dozen. But unfortunately not soon. However, it is put in my memory never to leave is a place that Mickey Rooney, - "Killer Mears" knows that he will be killed and is close to the time of truth, He plays, and screams, and laughs, emerges from hesteria to euphoria and runs a gambit of sensation forever. I have never seen such a brilliant act with any who lived or died, passed away or now. I knew for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" had a great actress. However, I put it, my opinion for many years to think, I must be alone in this view. About 15 years or more after watching this film on television, I read the old Q&A of Los Angeles Times. The question was made by Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier You are thought to be one of the most executives of all time, then who do you think is among the many actors?" His answer was, "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was surprised, but not surprised. I once again reiterated his "Miller Mears" and I felt very good because I had seen this great power in him, and now I have my own support from another that I have accepted. Afterwards there was "Bill" and much more. time with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile" should be seen by all the characters. I really can't remember a great deal on the film after all these years but Mr. Rooney in it, will never leave. If anyone out there remembers this film like me? I would be willing to hear from you. In this picture I am only made in my heart only 10 gave up on the face of its performance.
