I was watching this film on Friday, April 7. I didn't see the last place (cos I was talking to my grandmother and mother at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to him? I looked a little while that her husband was hearing someone talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opening the door, he was already dead. What happened to him? What? Did he commit suicide? How did he arrange everything as a phone, at the same time he is at home when her husband speaks to this amazing admirer? Anyone can explain to me, please. I am so curious !! (At the end, I read that he suffered from multiplication of self). <br /> <br /> Pre-original.
