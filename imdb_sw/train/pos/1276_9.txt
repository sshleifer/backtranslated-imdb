I love this film. Photo art with Spillane's dishonest behavior Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and a regular feel for the five-year underground budget films. It may not be 'Falcon's Malta' but this film makes it a great contribution to that kind. Spillane is often criticized for misogyny allegations, but its 'its' is a way over their male counterparts for cunning and intellectual issues. Mike Hammer's younger brother, effectively played by Biff Elliott, blinded by the intelligence of a psychologist who meets when examining the death of a military friend. When the penny finally comes out his face is a picture. Good to see that 50 control did not encourage filmmakers to delete the last popular line. A classic budget under the classic.
