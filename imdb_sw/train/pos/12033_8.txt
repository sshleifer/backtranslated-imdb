When I was walking through the TV Guide, and I watched the "Suggested Theme" in the film section, reading the notes. The three words touched my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I see her role in "Sabrina: a young witch" quite bad, I hate such programs, so I just thought it would be a little, love story showing her ... little. <br /> <br /> Finally it started on television, I had my bucket already if I would puke on a fun or soppiness, you know what I mean. At first, you think she is a beautiful, ordinary girl who is in love, but she has good parents. Then when you realize that he has made his girlfriend kill his parents, so he can have his true love, you're like "who". You don't just expect this kind of role in such a style. He played his role well in my opinion, I did not expect to be able to act like bitch, and so, he did it perfectly! Thank you, the film was very good, I would like to look at it again and recommend it to others.
