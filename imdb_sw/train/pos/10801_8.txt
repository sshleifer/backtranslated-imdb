In fact, when I saw these years of film I wanted to turn it off. When I was a ticket for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actress playing Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and comedic trends make me shake my head as WHY he was not in the most comedies. He has the same thing as "Marty Feldman" which touches him but MUCHU, more talented ... without taking anything from Marty. The movie was really shocked by how close it was the original Jerk, but again, it was SO more more. In fact I think that if this movie was released first, and I saw the movie of Steve Martin's second, I'd think of the 2 was a reduced price. I know it looks like a BOLD, but it's true. In fact I like Steve Martin's great deal, but his performance is 2 for actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I encourage you to see if you can find it.
