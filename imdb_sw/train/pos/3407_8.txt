Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer provides a strong exhibition in this beautiful but empty film. Unfortunately, Dietrich plays a woman who has a good but empty life. Video of good movies and sets, and that's the trunk of Dietrich without clothing is also amazing. He looks so much; Boyer looks like younger and younger. The story of the woman who is searching for the meaning of the old priest who looks for life seems to be very good, but it contradicts the untrue sets and heaven works in some way, from two, severe stars. scored by Max Steiner, with good support to cast. The film runs about 76 minutes and it looks very bad, with some characters seem or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson's mother, Tilly Losch player, John Carradine caller, and Basil Rathbone has .... well do not know. He just climbs out of the desert and destroys everything! As others realized, John Gilbert was appointed as a star by Dietrich. I can't help but I think I would be wonderful. The role of Boris who lost the world would be the same as Gilbert's greatest. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her work would have found a track. I can't imagine any 30 film of Dietrich that made the color. She looks nice and wearing tight clothes. I love it's Valentino as a Shiek-like dress she is wearing with a pool. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth looking for lush sets and colors with two big stars.
