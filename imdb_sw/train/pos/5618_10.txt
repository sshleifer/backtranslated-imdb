This is one wonderful movie. Assistant than anything David Lynch, and what shows what the general director Polanski is since this is not his typical job, and is a HEALTH. It all starts with Trelkovski enters the tennis barrier in Paris. Recently he learns that an old tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and believes all other people living there drove him out. He also believes that they are trying to do the same for him. The result is an amazing and awesome look at the paranoia. All of the production has a common fear written everywhere: from image to music which the viewer can feel poor of Trelkovski to create. <br /> <br /> Do they all want to kill him? Or maybe just dismiss the madness? Is there a difference? Learn yourself. 10/10
