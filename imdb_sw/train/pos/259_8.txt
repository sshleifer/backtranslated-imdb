For the Danish movie, I must say, this is a very good movie. It is in its own class, but it has international capabilities. <br /> <br /> The movie has a big budget, and represents the most famous Danish actors, and a few travelers, who play very well. It can be viewed by anyone who has like adventures, and a bit of movie 'soul'. Do not be afraid, happy!
