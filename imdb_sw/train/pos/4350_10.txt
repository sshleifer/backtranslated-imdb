This film is one of those who have skills that emerge. It is land, foundation and film that will make you think ... with a smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you a journey that you don't forget. Sound sound is very good and appropriate; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. Certainly this deserves recognition for all films and actors! Finally, a piece of art that departs from the story of a clear love and special effects that are seen today. I have never walked from the film to warmth and feeling in my heart; for it was as if someone had been bound only in a leather skirt. See this film is to find the real treasure and rejoice in it.
