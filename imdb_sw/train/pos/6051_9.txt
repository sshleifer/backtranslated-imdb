This is a great British film. Careful script and multiple suggested lines, which capture exactly what the magic mushroom can do for the weekend. As usual by Phil Daniels it is best with those under the standard of British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles in his mouth is making a master and Gary Stretch and his emerging performances bring a huge part of the atmosphere into a piece. Although it seems to be paid as a bicycle movie, I think it will get the audience out of this, just based on that most people have been present and given a shirt. also a great original sound with a blind version of Freebird. This may actually be a 21st-century successor for the famous Ealing performances. Like weeds in the Welsh fields: it is a farmer!
