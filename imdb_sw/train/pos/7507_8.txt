Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is completely amassing a list of films that show their special time. Its original "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were best when commenting on the quirkiness of the community at that time. Although "Bettie's name of course" is obviously about Mrs Page, it's every little thing behind the scenes of the world of kinky photo shoots in 50 years. the story and the technical aspect of how it was done and put together. The B&W film of the film and photography takes time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through pictures of Bunny Yeager is very good. Support support is strong by David Strathairn (clean Edward's R Murrow role), Chris Bauer (like Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The movie star is Gretchen Mol who is very talented and very good. Mrs. always brings the edge and spirit to her duties. He had quite weight in the slightest appearance, Jason Alexander explained "Just Looking" in 2000. Here he is notorious Bettie Page. His smile attracts and his body is worthless. In fact he seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how a girl next to Tennessee could be the queen of the lower stars. As a person will expect, the voice of sound from that moment is severe. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the listed artists. Although the film shows when giving history in this sector, the third kinda's third goes to the block to block the magic of a clean film. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes this enjoyable movie look and one that will provide a permanent exhibition in the future HBO. Now please ask someone to find Mrs. Mol in a star to be?
