The Sentinel has a kind of run of a mill with a suspense / hidden clich√©d but it is lifted by some good acting and taut pacing. These stories have already been prepared for many areas through many permissions as we can endure, so what we leave is how to do good, how smart is setups and bad guys, how to create it a great plot etc. etc ..... so Sentinel works established due to its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland are all holding confidence with beautiful screens. Eva Longoria (the first time I've seen him on screen) brings satisfying support. Nothing of the story is implausible completely hit down a bit, but it deserves to lose. It deserves to see if you like genre.
