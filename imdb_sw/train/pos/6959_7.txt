well, this is the film Ivan Reitman. with rare discrimination, Ivan likes to love. His films are generally not "deep", but often enjoy enough. Super Ex-Girlfriend was surprised that I laughed more than I thought I would like. Uma Thurman is just fine, and I love her pictures. I also love Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a direct hoot. Never assume itself, the film is up and still not very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before .... it's a good tax though and maybe it's a current movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to eliminate your brain. It's fun to run with nothing wrong with it. When you remove "girl" items, you are left with stories about relationships, and relationships don't come out. It's a boy meets a girl, a boy leaves a girl's thing. And finally, the characters are looking for love. Not all takes "cast" and can also .... a piece of life to lose.
