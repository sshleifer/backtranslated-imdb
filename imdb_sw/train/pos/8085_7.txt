One thing I can say about this movie is very long, IN ONE! I actually bought this film a few months ago to see that there was a new version emerging. I was glad to find that it was made in 1978 for 70's (although I have never lived in it) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! when I watched this story the story was very good at first but then after 50 hours began to get boring and repeating too much. I admitt the animation attracted me! it was nothing I had seen before and it was very good to see. but the fiction movie could be much better, it could be much more to talk to his story than just 15-20 minutes scenes that just had wierd fighting. then for 5 or 10 minutes the movie took and started again but it ended unexpectedly. in my opinion I thought it was long. I know 13 minutes more than 2 hours and it's still long for cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it seem like it was 4 hours long !! but it is generally a good film I think and I will look back at one of "nothing to do on the day". i will see new and I hope it's best!
