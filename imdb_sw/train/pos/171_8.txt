I disagree strongly with anyone who can dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. Setting right after the worry, wailing 20 years, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Foolish, Dancing is his wise heart, and clear message about how to endure these difficult times. Yet this fast and highly-designed film is far from being a dreary story. In 30 years, Hollywood had a knack to run one of the entertainment * and * to brighten the audience-enjoyable after another, all without losing the image of the film. Dancing, Foolish, Dancing - one of the four films * which Harry Beaumont was inspired in 1931 - is not available for 80 minutes long, but its characters are well developed, his story does not seem to run, and despite many changes in the compound, viewers are not left behind. With the exception of Lester Vail as the love of flaccid Bob Townsend, the hand is very safe. Good material is William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (known as Jimny Cricket's voice) as a journalist Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in the first role of helping as Jake Luva's group. But this is Joan Crawford's film, and he shines quite well in it. He did when he was 27 years old, this less-known version of Crawford is probably unknown to those who know more about his future career. However, here is the evidence that long before taking home to Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star for the real sense of the word, a bright actor and charisma to bear all the pictures for himself. Score: Fourth from TEN
