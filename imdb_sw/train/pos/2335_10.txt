That's what t.v. you must be. And pushing Daisisi lives up to these expectations. The best and well-shown exhibition, Pushing Daisies is one of the few exhibits left in the first time that is perfect, is good for the whole family and plays your thoughts. It is not about normal action, sex, money or killing every other t.v. It is a show that makes you think and laugh, but although a basic plot may seem impossible, the concept is real to all of us. You want something that you can't have, we hope someone will ask us, flee from the past and find a family, even in the most impossible places, etc ... I realize that ABC has basically canceled this amazing show for this point, and it is more likely to replace its show other than the integrity of integrity. I think everything comes back to money ... it's so bad that now there are no other exhibitions on ABC which actually makes you feel good after checking.
