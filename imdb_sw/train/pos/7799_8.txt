It flows very slowly, but it is made correctly and finally touches it very much. A nice, real-to-life look a little Florida beach city in the winter of the winter - I've been there, and this is quite accurate. <br /> <br /> It is also the first aspect of actress Ashley Judd, and makes a great impression here. It's hard to believe this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it on the movie, and soon I used "Ruby" again. Except for 80-looking clothes, it stands very well. Ashely is very interesting and touching here, that is difficult to think about his next job without disgusting. Boy, say about failure to carry out your earlier commitment! Anyone who sees Ashley here "Ruby In Paradiso" would think of this elegant beauty of nature and continued with all the great art and artistic performances - instead she was "going" to a girl for dumb and films movies! We are very disappointed, but at least we have this good practice saved to show its early promises. If someone else comments, this is not for everyone as it is very slow. This is not an action film, not love. Director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another study of better behavior) touches the life of a little ordinary woman with great respect, allowing her story to build slowly and deeper. That way, I think this is one of the most progressive and respectful stories of talking about young women that I can remember - not about the awakening of Ruby or "how she lost her daughter", but about her life and growth. great. <br /> <br /> A good film, if you take the time to look at it ... I think it would be a better film to show young people and young girls (or boys for it) and give them the opportunity to think and talk. <br /> <br /> Dostic especially for director Nunez, who also wrote a script, which is true and very detailed that I assume all through the movie that was based on female-written novels by women, but in fact it is The work of Mr. Nunez. Tested 8 out of 10.
