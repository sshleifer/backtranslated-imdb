I must accept - the only reason I bought this film is because I am a big fan of Gackt and a big fan of Hyde. I expected a good movie with many shots which were, we'll say, pleasing to the female eye but the story of a little cheesy. I mean, synopsis looks out there. And now that I have finished watching - I feel the need to tell the world of its beauty! Hyde and Gackt all gave up the performances of the heart, and my eyes were still staggering from the cry that ended in the last half of the movie. You are invited to the story, and you feel to the characters at the end. The feature of vampirism - which I like, but it is very easy to destroy or destroy the movie and - it's a small mixture of story story like doing just a common, normal thing for this setting, instead of adding something necessary to story. I put it at 9 out of 10 for the first time ... and then I went back and tried to figure out why I didn't have that last point. It came without a thing. So ten out of ten are. After all - I am not much of the defendant - the fact that I am struggling to write a review in all ways I either really hate the movie or really love it. You can explain what I have with the Moon Child.
