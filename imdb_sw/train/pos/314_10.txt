This exhibition is a great story of history. It has everything from slavery, how they have been treated, religion, ways that the Jews were sent to hide, observation, faith in Orisha gods of Africa, how women were treated, including the daughter. Even under homosexuality. The ways in which partners interact with the Violante, the behavior is sad. He is so desperate that he destroys everyone around him. I am so happy they decided to open it again to t.v. again. Although I would like to see an unsupported version. Xica has been my heroine. I look on the way he uses his power to help all who seek it. I love all the characters and I have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I expect my Xica every night. It would be good to close in English so Americans can love him too.
