From the opening of the lead actor's lead, we are given a preview of how many mens life is run by women in them, and the humor that comes with every going on the day of “normal” life Eric Lartigau, the director examines how many European people they feel that they have full control of their lives, but without the help / support of women around them they can't seem to work. . The use of photographs in all the film is very good, and its cunning position of a senior family member (mother) appears. When there is more than enough laughing on the film, it still deals with parents / single parents and family members in the community. It is actually beneficial to watch, and only one of the French veins can do. So far one of the 50 or more movies I have seen this year, and should be worth starting five. I hope to add this to the DVD collection when it is opened and highly recommended for all ages.
