The ideas that are shown in this film are very careful and detailed and show what most people from around the world consider US policies, not necessarily for the US itself. It shows what many people around the world think about America and what Americans don't know about themselves. The 11 directors show every 11 minutes of everything that will give US observers a lot to consider when they go home after watching the movie.
