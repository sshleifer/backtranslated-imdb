This is the first movie I saw by John Singleton and he is a good director. The movie starts with a group of incoming freshman and shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps has a star tracking and sponsorship of the part and having trouble while continuing his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and humanity similar to Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is a rapist and friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian partner, and does not know how to go. Michael Rapaport is a child from Idaho who comes with the Neo-Nazis group and their leader is Cole Hauser. Those are three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who tries to help them. It's a good film and it's unfortunate that the studio was done several cuts on the movie.
