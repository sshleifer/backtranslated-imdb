Why didn't this take the full bag of Oscars? It is an amazing interpretaion of a piece made / done. These displays are breathing (especially on the entire screen ... pan & scan kills a spectacular show of movies and sets). Each frame is painting. It's amazing. The play is very close, and Branagh's enthusiasm for it is clear from the opening names. No Zefferelli here, just a great story of the only film can, but rarely does. Jacobi is perfect as the uncle of Hamlet's murder: he does not like a good villian pastor, but a good politician, enabling us to see what Hamlet is only witnessing evil. Branagh also makes false nails of line between artificial / real madness and retaliation in it. And many delegates are coming well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, who have no confidence when faced with Branagh's vision as I was. Slice of dimensions.
