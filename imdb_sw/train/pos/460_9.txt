This is a good series of crimes, and connecting three former British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired spies went back to help clear old cases, under the guidance of the younger, working-off Amanda Redman . The three former businessmen, formerly offenders make a brilliant team, using twenty-year-old detection techniques in the police that have moved for a long time since - sometimes with effect, sometimes for fear of their chief officials. The three are shown mercy, warts and all. There are incredible incidents of comic, and some very moving as each of the three needs to come up with the issue of growing old and their inheritance. The end of the first six-part series (we promise more successes next year) each of the characters was developed. The widow James Bolam cannot negotiate with his wife's death sooner. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his position as a grandfather. And even losing Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the old demons - and continue taking the medicine! When Amanda Redman has to deal with all the common conflicts between having life and work. The story lines have been interesting, if it depends largely on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is a partnership of the four best UK actors who have done a series that cannot be closed.
