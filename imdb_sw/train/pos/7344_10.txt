In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that would have been better if it was a short 10 years earlier. I am sure it will benefit from modern technology, but it would look better than at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> Artists and animated work good. In my opinion, this movie can boast the best art of history and one of the best design of the character. Animation is very smooth and realistic. For the time you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a good job. It can also boost one of the sexiest female characters, if not sexiest, that girls beets are easily accessible. Unfortunately, there are two bad tones about this movie that does not make it so appealing at this time. First, the plot and implementation is the same as modern movie adventure, and it's really old with modern standards. Second, from time to time you will benefit greatly from 20 minutes of conversation. Finally, the settings are not very popular at this time. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A good alternative to other short stories about Conan Mbaji, but not for the novel.
