Writing something real and really is a challenge. Knowing how to beat it and put it out is not much smaller. The movie of Ishai Setton is one of those where you can recognize Life easily with all its beauty. I have been touched by "big bad swimming" and since now, I will continue as much as possible. It's just a shame that I can't have anything to show my friends (you know, like DVD ???), for that talking is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone cannot go to the ceremony to discover such a pearl and this movie is very well done out! Great for the staff of this section, and I have tried to be distributed.
