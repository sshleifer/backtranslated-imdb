Just 9/10 from me, the ten perfect would have been if there was more than a plot of the movie, but however the Moonwalker to this day is still a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment. Starting with a collection of video clips from Jackson's work for a long time, it reminds the viewer why he often looks like 'King of Pop'. From its hit 'I want you back' to 'We are the World' many record winning prizes for the benefit of Africa. Following this short film type, although it is not recommended in the winning Oscar script, it still provides a wonderful and entertaining drama for the audience. Ending with perfect beauty (sexy!) Of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
