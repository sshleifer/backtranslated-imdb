This is one of the most relaxing, relaxing, and beautiful films made by the animation I've ever seen. For good music in movies, sounds and music can make you laugh if you're on the movie! This movie is not just for children, but also adults. It teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting who you are, you can do whatever you keep your mind, and courage and courage. This film can be grown sometimes also, which is often a good touch in movies. This movie is awesome, sad, beautiful, and puts you on the edge of your seat! Some movies give them a white feeling after seeing, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and good idea for the film, gave me a lot of Spirit!
