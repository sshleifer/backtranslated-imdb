That is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has everything - a really touching screens, good actors who make false art good looking, really elegant romance (it's a shame that such kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist), good songs with lyrics (especially last song), artistic color, and clothing and sets that make you want to live in them. The latter was only disappointing because I expected an interesting film to have a brilliant end - but it was still more amazing with a large number of movies out there. Certainly see this film out - repeated again. There is a lot of information you miss the first time that deserves a second look.
