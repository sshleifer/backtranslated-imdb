Elmer Fudd laughs when he has a convenient seat and read his comic book, his dog comfortably close to sleeping in front of the fire. It's all peace until gray comes. (Futi is wearing a kind of gardener and a big hole and carries a satellite with the title "A. Flea" on it.) He gives out the telescope and dog advertising. (We see a great bullet of the dog and gray whistle for excitement, shouting "T Bone!" He then sings, "There is food around the corner, there is food around the corner!" of this beautiful-but-obnoxious story that hurt the poor dog. Mutt is hilarious as he touches to flea. The sketch of his big stuck teeth next to the gray fleeing is clever and dog talk has made me laugh a little bit. This can be the canni of the funniest I saw on the cartoon! Pooch poor, under the threat of having a shower, since it is not responding when gray gray causes pain. It's very difficult to check if flea uses pickaxes, jackhammers and so on on dogs. He puts firecrackers behind the dog. It is cruel!
