I had to see this gem twice to fully understand it. When the father of the two children sleeps in the sleep of his two sons in a terrible revelation, they are broken between believing him and not. As the tragic events of this story are revealed, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their events. With an exciting stimulation after an amazing twist, this film is never appropriate to focus on the plot. Bill Paxton has a father, but the most famous performances are his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the most exciting experiences I have seen at the same time, and you will need to look at this a few times to get to know every aspect of the plot. I am giving this film 9/10.
