One piece of trivia that often forget about this family film is one of the business. At that time, in 1994, this film made a record of the most popular films in motion photo history (and could continue to hold). It was done in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - of course with respect to the original "Angel" of the film which "haunted" Pirates of Pittsburgh. In this remake they "hate" the angel of California. However, the resource was held at the third-place of Rivers Stadium which was Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittburgh Steelers at that time (Pirates now occupies PNC Park and Steelers in Heinz Field). The comment was held on the screen of a film which was five stories in length within the field and held (and could even continue to hold) a seasonal film record in history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all attended by thousands of sports fans.
