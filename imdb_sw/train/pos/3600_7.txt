At first glance I expected this film to be crappy because I thought the plot would be very professional. But I was wrong. If you have already read the comments published earlier, I agree that the female part of this film is not worth it. I've never had an idea that the main character was spreading its position as a woman. It is like Guzman released as a backbone, this compared to his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was very good, but at the end of prediction. Maybe it would be a better idea to give a big deal of losing, so that the viewer could be more surprised. In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez respected his respect and his way of abandoning his behavior. I can't explain why, but especially on the love screens he believed me. It seemed just real guess. I gave 7 out of 10, just because of the last half of the last.
