I watch movies for survival, taking which is good enough to distribute ... Losing those who do not cut. I don't know that I know more than anyone else in this regard, I just guide you how I came to look at the "Gospel of Lou" ... Anyways ... Many places of bad movies on my desk and I really stay for all. I am not "looking" everything, I just look at the TV regularly when I work on the value of production, performance, and how the story is presented. If something catches my eye I will take time to look at it. "Lou" took me for the first few moments where I scored my laptop and hitting my seat on the TV so that I could be totally. The story is well told, the characters become lovers or neglecters (according to the actor and actors interested in behavior) and they all played a lot. Sometimes I found the regular mistakes of the amateur in the work of camera and editing, but the emotional state of the story makes these errors easy to be deleted. I have heard the comments of some people say that sometimes the film brought tears to their eyes, sometimes it was even more intense ... I was surprised one minute and right next and was touched by this film. Unfortunately I was not able to find it because I was - if the word goes - last week with a short dollar. That's the way it goes sometimes ... but at least I was happy to see this and I can't wait to see what kind of answer it gets. Good luck and good luck to you Bret Carr (if you read this), of course there is a talent to watch.
