The Story of the Spirit (Movie TV - 1972) was an attempt by the NBC series. The movie was well written and well done, I thought, when the TV show of 1972-73 started, if the TV series is half good as a movie, then NBC has won. (I would like this film available on video!) This series was a great desire - even with William Castle having done. producer. If, however, you have the opportunity to see the original movie TV, Ghost Story, see. Not eligible.
