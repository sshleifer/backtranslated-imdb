After losing Emmy to her performance as Mama Rose in the GYPSY TV version, Bette won Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special showcase show for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has been living in the early 1970s, shows that it is still one of the most powerful artists in the business. From his opening number, his "friends", where he comes from the wings with a beautiful cloud, Bette commands action in style and charisma from the rap-styled number called "I Look Good" then shows that he has a way and joke. as a few other players in this business as he explains his way through a variety of options. Part of the show where he salutes burlesque goes for a very long time but he can insert his old joke Sophie Tucker here for good profit (though he really forgot the middle joke to tell, but ad-libbing it till he remembers it hysterical). Bette also makes us "Turn Turn" from GYPSY and tune the headings from its ROSE film filing including crashes for its first group WIVES film. He brings the house closer to the end and "Stay with Me, Child" from ROSE and its # 1 alone, "Wind Under My" from BEACHES. It is an amazing evening of the comedy of music and music for Midler fans, it should be.
