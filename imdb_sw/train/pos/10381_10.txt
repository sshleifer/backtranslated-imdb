The inspector passed by said exactly. I saw it once, I was happy, I saw the second time it was announced again within a week or two of the first call. I still remember some events. The order is the opening of the 20th century, the war mentioned in the head is World War I. One of the events was placed in the female section of the public place, which was interesting of history. When one woman touches first it is one of the most time of my film. I don't think this as a "gay movie," is a pleasant and loving time when two leaders appear to be women. I would like to see this film again; I would like to buy this if it happens on DVD.
