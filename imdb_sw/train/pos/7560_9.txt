Starfucker (which reads Starstruck in my box) was the most amazing movie I saw. I thought it was one of the best movies I ever saw. Why not 10? There is nothing perfect. Jamie Kennedy confirms why she is one of my dear actors in this very interesting look of the dark side of Hollywood. I have encouraged a few others to watch the film and all agreed that it is the best flick.
