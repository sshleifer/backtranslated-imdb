Really I'm surprised there are many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of the Slavic Film Festival at the University of the United States. But no American man has heard, which is a real shame! The behavior among people is what makes it surprising and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus trip - some of us have been! But I've never had this like this !! <br /> <br /> My favorite part is one where they stop for funerals. Then the man and woman emerge for the Love of Love in the forest but everyone follows them looking without knowing it! As he elevates his skirt and he enters it all - the watch begins to walk & they realize everyone is looking !! Talk about surprise! But ... really you should feel to them even if it's hilariously funny! When you see unlimited it is an amazing kind that you enjoyed yourself when they did! The verb humor is best!
