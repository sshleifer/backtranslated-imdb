A magical journey by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of UK movies have mixed fabulous ingredients to produce the epicenter of the movie! Some technicolor earlier than ravishing, SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa color music with the excitement of young Sabu, theater and villainy crime of Conrad Veidt and beautiful beauty and voice of June Duprez as all the princess works very well. Miles Malleson who plays Duprez dad, Sultan's Basra, also wrote a full screenplay which is the best grandiose. Don't do that! Since writing the above comments, I have found a recently opened DVD and can honestly say that I have never seen a good image until you watch this DVD-Definition version and the solution is very accurate and the colors are so clear that I was surprised - This amazing classic can be watched again and never fails to charm and fun viewer. Again, YOU WANT TO GET!
