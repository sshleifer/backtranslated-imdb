Why on earth should you examine the original documentary text of "Earth"? How long do you have in the world so I can tell you this? Okay, I can't extend my investigation of the "World" to an endless scope, but I must stand for what this is "must see". Documentary takes a round trip on immigration routes to three animal families: loaded with a female polar and her children with a real part of a life-carrying father that strives to hunt food in its own way, the whale's mother and her whale child take the whale tour of the immigration, and the mother of the elephant and her little (perhaps not the smallest, the elephant) migrate to Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield performed the work of "out of this world" also in obtaining survival skills of many types of animals instead of magnetic shots of our three family characters. The team of the movie's Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch, and Andrew Shillabeer were the animals in the camera to hit the natural places of nature with natural animal behavior; not to mention, the animal shots of animal animals were a b e b e b. "The world" is also a student's lesson on the effect of heat temperature on animals; The shark polar bear in the doc is a young animal poster on the result. So the fellow soil, it's time to take a trip to the document to visit the "World" today! **** Good
