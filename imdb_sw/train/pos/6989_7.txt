This film was seen in the very early part of the Secrets of Secret 3000 Science, but when I see this film, I don't think about the incredible TV series. I believe this was an amazing amazing 40-year-old flick, with a very amazing sound and pictures with a 67-year-old public domain horror movie. I was so happy to see Bela Lugosi and his wonderful crew, including his wife who needs water from the teenage gymnastics who would have to, the old hag, and her two wonderful children, one of the big village, and the other The combination (Angelo Rossitto from the 1932 Freaks). I also enjoyed the female female writer, who is a kind of style, but still happy to enjoy. My only problem with this best film is a plot, even ridiculous and not recommended for the movie. I don't want to destroy any of this film, so go out and lease, or, better, give it to several bucks.
