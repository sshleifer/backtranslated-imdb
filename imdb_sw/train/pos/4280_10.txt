A group of people is going to Belgrade in a bad bus headed by a drunk conductor and his dumb child (who likes to drive and his eyes closed). Their trips are often interrupted by a number of cases that are largely describing the collapse of the national spirit in 1941 and it is surprising even today as a common joke. The man "steals the show" is a 4-year-old farmer and his 4 children who are almost twice bigger than he. Finally, the film takes one big side and the journey becomes nothing but the song of the swan's death.
