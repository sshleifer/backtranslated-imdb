Some viewers have shortened this film very well. I just liked to add "Whew!" Comment one auditor made about the emergency part proposed by Elisha Cook. This was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some advocacy for its full functionality. A little bit of trivia that I surmising about: Cook appeared as a waiter in 1941 Barbara Stanwyck, "Ball of Fire." He was a nightclub at the club where Barbara was playing with the famous legendary Gene Krupa was playing, very hard. What? Too much to suggest that the cooking of a cooking spa in the future film, "Phantom Lady," was strongly influenced by Krupa's work, as confirmed by Cook 3 years ago? If you look at Krupa in the "Fire Ball," I think you will see the movement of the body alike. One hope, of course, that HAK did not influence any drugs at that time!
