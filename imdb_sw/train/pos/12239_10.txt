Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all planned. Not surprisingly there is no social or political message, nor is there a little attempt in that direction. What? Could that happen, or has been done at any time or place? It is impossible, for, after all, this is just, only, the movie, and the movies emerging from thought, not really. The only purpose of this movie is pleasing, certainly not educating, making it a, and really fun and heartily beaten with the wind. I think many agree that from the documents we expect light and legitimacy. But for entertainment I want what is today which is described as "no-brainer," which The Mating Game is in every way. For a few bottles and laugh at all times, this is a fantasy good fares.
