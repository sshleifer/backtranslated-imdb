Impossible Duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us an interesting exhibition and lesson in The Angel Levine. It's one amazing thing about the theme from a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and two of them are a special class of older Jews in New York. Mostel was a player and a proud to his business, but behind him and arthritis has prevented him from working. Kaminsky is more than a bed. He has slowed down the welfare. In despair like Jimmy Stewart, she cries out to God for help. Now maybe if you had found someone like Henry Travers things could be a different job, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Traps. But Travers had one thing to do with him, he was over 100 years away from this dying coil and all his connections on earthly objects went. God sent Mostel something very different, who recently died Harry Belafonte who should have at least been given basic training to angels before being given a job. Belafonte hasn't agreed to move from life, he still has many issues. She also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know she has passed, was hit by the right car at the beginning of the film. It puts its issues with Mostel issues and you have a good dispute, starting with the fact that Mostel can't believe the black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> This was the performance of the Polish / Hebrew actress Ida Kaminsky who received the Best Actress selection in The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. Another important role here is the Irish actor, Milo O'Shea who played a good Jewish doctor. Remember the O'Shea contract from the Decision, I was shocked to see and heard it took part of the doctor. Angel Angeline raises interesting and frightening questions about faith and color in this society. It brings you to a stellar cast and is undoubtedly made by a recognized author Bernard Malamud. Make sure you do it when you are advertising.
