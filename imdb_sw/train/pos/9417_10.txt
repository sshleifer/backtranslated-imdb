Anonymous film, the trick and lean, "The man in the white suit" is another breath of fresh air in the film's format from Ealing studio. While I think some of the modern viewers can first find an unintelligible thing, and many reviewers could fail to be organized by a professional plot, the theme and characters are used during the time of the film. The really great Alec Guinness gives another good character in the film probably not as a virtuoso such as "Eoyo's Heart and Koronets" of Ealing in 1949. This time, he plays only one character instead of eight, but as the founder of the universe and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the right tone and expression. With the prudent performance of Guinness, good performance, all others are beaten. Among the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger are standing. Thesiger is an extraordinary deception as a businessman with a disability but very influential, while Parker depends on whether the owner is ineffective and important of the mill and father. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, a comic actress, who is an unlikely peak in this film. Judging by the deception of the element and diction, he is very good in this film, beautiful and unusual size, but more than France. The place where he seems to try to tempt him is very well played and the pair is very good and amusing ... <br /> <br /> These themes are run very effectively, with no simple values. Problems of relationship between science, business and work are carefully and enjoyable. Assistant assistant Alexander Mackendrick, this film is professionally in all areas; A pleasant vote, the sound effects suitable to music and script wistful, all of them pleasing to silence. Film is satisfactory, with Guinness and Greenwood great. Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
