Guys and Dolls are a unique game based on characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a top gambler player who takes bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for one thousand dollars. Nathan needs money to get his / her own game crap and make a fortune. Bet was that the Sky could not take the girl just to Havana, Cuba and the "doll" she had chosen was Sarah. Sky ultimately corruption <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They take a fall of love, but subsequently accuses something that had no part. Nathan ran the game to decorate the pastor at night who had gone. Nathan Adelaide's 14-year-old pastor (Vivian Blaine) rejects Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the movie is approaching it all ends with the joy of double times <br /> wedding. <br /> <br /> Movies of this movie are just amazing no matter who is singing. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no voice to sing and really would call him but it was useless. He did a very good job (clearly seen if it was Brando) and played his character very well. I have seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and I think that this film was more frail, she also could not sing at all. However, singing is created by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine, and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in nature <br /> <br /> Production of Broadway's Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a strong voice and was a complete Adelaide. If you like music, and even if you don't, I advise you to look at this.
