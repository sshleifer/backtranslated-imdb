We saw this in one of the local local art movies in Montrose's Houston, TX area. It was a general surprise compared to writing in the newspaper newspaper but we were all beaten by craftsmen. It was done with beauty and (apparently) photography in schloss (German name for ch√¢teau) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a clear observation of the sexual relations of a group of men and women who are alone with the daily barriers. It's more surprising than I can remember. We came home after the film and we talked and talked until 4am the next morning. The version we saw was in English (particularly) so there must be at least since the first inspector saw the movie in (perhaps its original) German version. I searched and searched for video clip but never came up with anything. You would like to have a VHS or DVD version of this. It examines relationships at primary level and is also a good tutorial on how to engage with your partner. If someone knows the author / director, please persuade them to open again, preferably on DVD these days. I can't even imagine getting tired of looking at the clear performance of executives who are now probably all in forty years. Please, please return.
