I am very interested in the movies I see. I would hear about Moon Moon completely by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for a time with a Gackt fan and Mizer recently. I found that the film was released again and took it without a second thought. <br /> <br /> To be important as I am about the film, I will admit, practical events can be at some point for hokey ... but also means that, if another user suggested, it's the quintessential stability of the storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leon ... without getting into the vendors, the film hit me very hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are boundaries and as they often say, true friendship is trustworthy and like marriage, until the time of death. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt provide displays that show why they can make the sound of their song to their song, their music enthusiasm happens on the big screen and in the process creates a model film that will reach a person's soul and inspire emotionally emotional. After seeing the film for the first time, I realized maybe it would remain in a long cycle until my collection was going. I want to encourage anyone to read this post to give the film if you want to leave the current film trends in the film ... this takes a completely new dimension by using the old Yakuza film features and how you can go wrong with cameo from Ryo Ishibashi of "Takashi Miike" and "Head of Suicide" <br /> <br /> Person ... I can't just say enough about this film, but I will stand here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
