The French brother of Naudet did something that no one else did, they had a video camera on the day that the epidemic took place. They were in the # 2 Building, when you could see the paper dwindling, people were pulling the ground from flying from that height. I mean it goes away when both buildings have fallen, riding, the camera was still running, when the white dust was covered, they found the shop door and went in, but all these pictures are real and I think they did a wonderful job of catch us. The stars go to the Naudet brothers that have been made this amazing film that I look at every year 9/11 so I can't forget what this country has used. I believe if I remember justice, it shows the first death of the priest of the fire fighters, when he was taken to the church with his honorable burial.
