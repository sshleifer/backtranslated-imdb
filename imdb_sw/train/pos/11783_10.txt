Rock Rock: INXS was the best music I ever seen! It had some of the most rock and roll songs that were written, made by 15 very talented artists / artists. It was also (in my opinion) the heart-feel, feel-good, to finish the surprise in reality of the TV. In fact it made me shed tears of joy for the winner !!! Over 13 weeks of this television competition, observers knew and knew all the opponents. After 30-some events of the remaining competitors seemed to be more friends than other visitors fighting against real TV shows. And the fact that the INXS was, and still is, one of the largest rock rock rocks EVER only added to the emotional tension created by this truly amazing series. If you don't have a memory series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a good alternative.
