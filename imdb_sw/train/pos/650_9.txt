Great movie, rather than challenging than real entertainment. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotations here, but this is what I like: Alexandre: If you leave someone you love, what do you say now: "Furawell, I'm going." But disappeared, hiding as a criminal, is ignored. (you did not view it with English headlines) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this shows it all. There are many methods involved in the relationship between Alexandre and others, and yet everyone desires a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as the experience of Alexandre. A common definition is that the movie criticizes the possibility of "love redeemer" by showing unwanted meanings to people involved. In fact, it shows this in a persuasive manner, but I would like to know if the reasons were more affected: it is not that the saved love has destroyed the failure, but the people (especially men, I think) should work themselves and try to eliminate the moral values ​​before and not The way to practice the removed love. <br /> <br /> That said, although that movie is realistic and very good to look at.
