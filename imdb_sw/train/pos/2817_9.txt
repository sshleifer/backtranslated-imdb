This review is for a long cutting of this film. Looking at the Dragon Dragon when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I always loved this film and you can read some of the best views to get a general view. It is said. I've had a story of confusion all the time. The movie is, after all, the story of love. And it was always strange to me that the story of love should end with a 20-minute fight. The old version of the "original" begins with a huge chain of climb / rugby-like which is the last new sequence in an extended version. The opening of the opening is a dragon (Jackie Chan) relies on his house and pretends to be training and repeat whenever his father is around. <br /> Other series has also been a change or a long time in an extended cut and story makes more sense when you look. Planning is also better and generally works better. It hears more like a love story and does not stop asking questions about what is so fast and fast as the standard version does. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone who is a Hong-Kong movie, or just open Jackie Chan fanatic to get the extended version of the extended version and watch the movie as it was the original goal (or at least how I think it was a goal. so and rearrange some of the events) When I took a look at it, I felt like I had watched the new film of Jackie Chan though many series was the same.
