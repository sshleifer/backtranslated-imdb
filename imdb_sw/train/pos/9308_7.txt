If you are used to see Gabriel Byrne in great roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in Common Accidents I recommend you to watch this film. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all actors in this film provide very good performances. If you have about eleven (that's about nine of the quid) I order you to order online, or rent from you a movie rental place. Guaranteed to laugh, whether or not as a kind of gangsters. Puppy Time / Trigger Fun is one of those unforgettable movies, and you look at them regularly. You will say about your friends will be begging for borrowing.
