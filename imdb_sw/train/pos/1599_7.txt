"Moonstruck" is a delightful film directed by the storyteller, Norman Jewison (At Night Night, Fiddler on Roof, Hurricane). This film is good at many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, has a romance touch, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy. One thing I liked most about the film was the most unusual of the actors. Nicolas Cage seems odd to many films, and Cher ... well, Cher always seems odd. Overall, it's a fun, and easy to recommend. <br /> <br />7.4 out of 10
