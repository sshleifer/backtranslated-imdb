One of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone. And the next day we were in the supermarket in Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and I think who was coming to us in aisle! Barney Phillips, but no hat on - at least, I don't think he had a top hat. We asked him about his third eye, and said something like he had left home, and everyone met him that day he had asked him about. Friend / Friend. We were seeing all kinds of LA characters in those days. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a young man and spent a long time to get me "three hands" on another visitor! Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood and nature of 1947 until 1963.
