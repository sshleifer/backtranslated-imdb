Does there ever be more films than this? One reason why everything works well is that a group of executives seem to interact and have an impact on each other's lives. In its midst is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and cannot get face-to-face but who unite completely without being known as pals. But there are also different characters and many romantic comedies (including "You Got Mail", the latest "Shop" version) is not just whipped to support two ways and their needs. Everyone finds the hard part of the fabric of Ernst Lubitsch. One of the most heartwarming events in the history of the cinema takes place when the nearest Morgan Morgan is looking for someone with a Christmas dinner. You must see! **** out of ****
