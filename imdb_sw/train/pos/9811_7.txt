According to the Last of the Cowboy Heroes, about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy, and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film he did not obey because he claimed it was lost. Not found in years. The good thing for western fans someone was doing spring cleaning in Paramount because the publication was looked and is now on the open market. Albuquerque is a very beautiful west by Scott involving a married family with Uncle George Cleveland. George Cleveland sends out to his nephew Randolph Scott for the purpose of making him a part of his export business, completed in Albuquerque's fastest home. Cleveland is more than a business owner, is the master of the city that runs from the wheel. He even has a sheriff in his pocket. Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. That includes supporting the family when they are criminals. He is going to work for an opponent's clothing led by Brother Hayden's sister and Catherine Craig. Cleveland is full of all sorts of techniques and even sends Mata Hari to the west of Barbara Britton's man with a bug in his way to the courage of his opponents. Barbara is as big as a home farmer who keeps his own agenda. Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, which was his first studio contract. Albuquerque made the last film he did for Paramount and gave him a good. See also Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the head of the village of George Cleveland, a scornful man and Gabby Hayes, who is only Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque should be loved by the Republican nationally in 1948 by its great villain as capital city who heads from the wheel. Some democracy from the wheel had made their hash for four presidential direct elections and had gone. They had great hopes of winning the White House that year too, but things went awry and they had to stay at the ersatz boss to get his quickest at Albuquerque. I don't know why Cleveland was in the wheel since nothing was done for it in the plot. I think he was injured and played that part because he had to. Albuquerque still has a great appeal on the GOP market.
