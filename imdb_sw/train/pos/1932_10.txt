I think I usually face the festivals of the film festival and low expectations that they will be "quirky," and that any expected humor will result only from the cost of ease of the characters in difficult situations. What was unique on the Big Swimming It was that the director was able to maintain integrity and the development of its characters in his film while still playing a voice-sounding sound after the scene. There was a modern, perhaps because of the strict work of DP, I had never seen in the indie film, and even more rarely in comedy. For a special note here: Paget Brewster his side as a teacher math teacher. After seeing this performance I can't understand why Brewster has never been "discovered" by many viewers. He brings an important mix of anger and skill to the role that helps this image to achieve its potential. This is the most effective task of many viewers. I expect more from the director and this cast!
