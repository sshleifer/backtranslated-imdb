I saw this film almost a year ago, and I've got to laugh at Laugh funny. The real winner, in my mind. It was insisting to the comedy of the stupid, but in fact it had a real plot too. Much like a comedy hit, Elf, in fact. It was too short, it was hit between the hilarity. While still riding a Black horse, at a very normal time, you found yourself laughing with its antics. In fact you can find common ground there, because I am sure many people have done something that they will not think of a friend to know, not having your friendship. I realized how much people did not like this film, I was completely beaten. Such horrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite were much higher than making me wonder about the cleanliness of people on IMD. Take my advice and get a tax. If you find yourself laughing at least once, I will pay you for a rental fee. = D
