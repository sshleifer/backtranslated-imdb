This film has been on my list of wish for ten years and I recently got it on DVD when my grandson's grandson was given. He looked at it and enjoyed learning that it was about my generation - he was born in 1930 and was removed in 1939 and wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily I threw it from him and looked at it alone and I cried everything. Not only has it affected the mood, class distinction, difficulty and warmth of the human relationships of those years (as well as violence (what you have said and uncertainty), but it was right! (LCC) in the right color (white) and all the management of the explosives of the bombings and the work of the Great Rescue Brigades. among the most common life caused in the village and the burst of war in London was also presented violently in 1939/40 with my own removal from London and this production! but it went far beyond the correct representation of the truth and touched the deep confusion about the human response and only half the sentences mentioned the value of those years. The highest view in the work of John Thaw and the direction of gold and deserves to be more specific. It is a very good film and I have ordered several copies to send to friends.
