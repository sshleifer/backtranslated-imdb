I was writing comments on IMDb, but I didn't do it again. It happens that IMDb has been great, and therefore, stability has been corrupted. What do I mean? That anyone who does not like movies and does not have any knowledge about the subject, looks at the trophy (or vice versa), and if he likes it, he will give 10, and if he doesn't go to 1. Of course, he can't measure anything correctly. Now for the film. I am very grateful that I have been given 10s on several films, because then I must get this one and 12 or 13 marks, which is impossible. This document has something I hope to expect again in all my life in any other film. It's just simple, and it's not just a way to say; it's true. The last 25 minutes have a weight of energy, a sense of enjoyment and wisdom - words spoken by star-boys, in fact ... no possible match. I do not set movies, I will soon be able to find any meaning in doing it, but this is the type of film you should buy and set, and watch regularly, maybe 10 or 20 times as the years go on. I have nothing to say. This is true, the goal of me.
