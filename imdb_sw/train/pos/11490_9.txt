I watched this film many years ago and I have watched it since my time in my opinion though it is very raw it is very knowledgeable about what the future can hold I enjoyed the movie and this day is a very high rate for those who disagree but the movie should be judged individually by My opinion is great to provide a trip with all the children of cloning and the test of infection that are happening today we are to judge this film, this can be a drama of what to be but there you go. All the fears of today are closed even though I am laughing but this one gets me thinking and worried as a mother if I was interested, after watching this film I would like to think twice but i love the movie to make your own mind up to see the movie to - just know the story and ask yourself how far is it going to the child?
