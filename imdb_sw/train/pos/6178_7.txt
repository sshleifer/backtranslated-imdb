The fifth element of Mitchell Leisen as director, and shows his mixture for leading music, after his original movies were heavy dramas. He also plays as a cameo as a conductor. <br /> <br /> You can say it's the first movie code, and nothing like that was done in the US for a short time later (like 30+ years). Leisen hit a number of music to be like what the audience will see - no ordinary shotsu or from the top of the busby Berkeley. What I get funny or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> If others have mentioned the leads are the right character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their usual movie personas. Gertrude Michael however provides a little spark. Music numbers are interesting and good (Rapeody of Rapeody is particularly exciting) but this game is restrained and leaked - three killings are too much and have a little emotional impact on characters. This is where this film would be very good.
