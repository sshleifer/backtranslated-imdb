Good display. The basic foundation is that humanity is in a great way. There is a set of moral values ​​that are faced. People have achieved a number of technological achievements, but are people mature enough to tackle his new toes? There are ethical values ​​in the real world. There are religious poets who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (according to BSG background) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery. Apart from this, there are all other problems that we humans bring to ourselves. This is not a BSG - at least not that humans are running away from the worst trouble that was finally their own decisions. There is not a lot of shot-em-up or special effects of space either - at least not in the first few events I have seen now. <br /> <br /> What it has is a very good story, characters, and themes. It also has good displays from administrators. They can make a culture that is similar to a modern society, but a visitor at the same time be completely honest. As BSG, this show is about humanity - our strength, weakness, strength, and error. It may seem strange that the human race in different sets of the world has necks, old cars, and chickens. But those things are more likely to create a half-half background than anything else. Any person who denies such information is uncertain. If you come from the traditional style of the mafia or cultural and high-tech culture, human and human nature is not different from 150,000 years ago in a much higher time than what we see in the world today. Wonder if the authors are trying to tell us something.
