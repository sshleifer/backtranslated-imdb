To make an impossible schedule and no budget to talk about, the film was better adapted than you would expect, in fact it is more realistic for Peter O'Donnell's books and comic art than two previous films. You can read the current verse in the copies of the Vitan Books, or in the Revie community each month. It is one of the most interesting pieces of adventure at all times. The movie is not good, but unlike most low budget films makes it more than what you got, and it has your interests. In additional DVD, interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is definitely stone, is gas. Some people are wrong with Tarentino in collaboration with his name and film, but without it has never been made. He is a wise fan of Blaise, and took a good writer and director. All things have been considered, worth 8 stars.
