I saw this in the theater and I once thought that it was good enough for myself on the video. I am a great seed of Sci-Fi operation yet. <br /> <br /> Without giving any story away, it's worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi without having to think too much. The story is basic, and the plot is very good. Love your time to see! Maybe they will do good? :) out of 10
