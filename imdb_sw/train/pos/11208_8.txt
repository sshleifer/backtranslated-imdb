Oh, where are you going, my little, little ... <br /> <br /> Turn and you are two, visit and you are four ... advertise on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, with a description of Werner Van Braune's rocket science. I looked like history, science and humor were all interacted in the story of probability. That was fifty years ago. And the displays return to the Disney Treasury series, and what a treasure. I watched them last night and tonight and my 8-year-old daughter, who for the first time did not go into the room, but later changed her mind when she felt a few. When he saw her, I was looking for him, and at the end she was almost inserted as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a new wife and newborn ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, some predictions of reaching the moon were correct. But there are many details that are still quite accurate, and the general presentation is still interesting. I found myself with my daughter's teacher who can show her class, not just as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as happy and easy to understand lessons in history. Turn around, walk, walk again, you wonder how much changed for 50 years.
