Goldeneye always go down as one of you most sports stories in VG history. They are doubtful about that. But this game, although quite different, could possibly be a modern compound of Bond, of its time. This is not a bond game based on material from another. This was quite new; The game written. Which even had his theme of the theme! (didn't want to be a bond without it, haha!) Gameplay was good, and if you're a fan of bond games or similar film, you will enjoy it. Unlike most games / games, these beaten delegates expressed their own characters, as opposed to false creation for the game. Which offers to be more of the movies to feel. With the 'bond'-ability journalism, you feel like you're in the game as you lose in the film. <br /> <br /> Enjoys in all fields, from beginning to end. Even after hitting the game there is still more to be done. For the title system and unlockables to reach, with its multi-player message, this is a game of standing. Despite being very old now, in the game of years of years. It's still a good game that you can take and play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just think about it, I've got the theme of the theme being hit my head. This beautiful and well-written story. <br /> <br /> Story comes to life on the screen, almost as actors were in front of you, and it's everything like entertainment as the game itself. It has been done well, in the form of a true bond. Which can be called an amazing name, quite amazing. <br /> <br /> I need to go give this game now. If you haven't hit it yet, you miss it!
