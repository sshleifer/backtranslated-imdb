Farrah Fawcett is very good at this powerful festival of 1986, where he plays Marjorie, a woman who can escape the groups of someone who wants to be a rival. He did well for Farrah for being the "Best Actress" of Golden Globe. When his opponent Joe (very fiercely played by James Russo) comes to his home, which is collaborating with his two residents (which is easily out!), Marjorie needs to play together with the threat of Joe. It makes for other disturbing and frightening images! When they join them at home, they are surprised (say a little) with Marjorie's actions, and good performance with Alfre Woodard who tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and take her to the police, making the film more nail. I see Diana Scarwid very irritating, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the film a emotional piece of realistic game. Overall, the most affected is a well-thought and well-designed movie and I must look at it hundreds of times now! It's done for everyone involved.
