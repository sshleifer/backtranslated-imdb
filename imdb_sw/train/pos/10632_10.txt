This is an entertainment film; I didn't think the world made a clarity of the community from a small film. I personally find this amazing, thoughtful, and memorable film. It's fantastic is not different from the girl's cinder being Princess. This film was done very well I can add, in 70 years during the best experiments in the film and be able to mention the gender of the person. This movie is not about someone being homosexual or not, it's even about love, in all kinds of wonderful. This film shows some of the fact that homosexuals in 70 years in Hollywood, or California. Good boys are taken care of by older people not very good people. Women who had to remain deeply in the emotional closet or risk of having a job. The bathrooms were an important part of the homosexual community. <br /> <br /> Where fantasy begins !! Let's meet with lesbians and gay and add to alcohol and what do we have? Well this movie, which in any way was better than bad red again "The Next Big Thing". Perhaps someone should ask all employees to see this film and then try to do well. I enjoyed this film when I got it in 70 years and still brings a smile to my lips now. I advise anyone who wants a lovely movie, the tender-to avoid with popcorn and have fun. Some people need to reduce !!! And this is the film you should do with it! <br /> <br />
