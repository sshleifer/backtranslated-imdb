These three logs are tied to the tie with my other favorite flick "Problems in Court". This is a laugh of laughter for any Third Stooges fan. The boys are janitors on the recording studio when they hear good Christine McIntyre sings a great version of "Spring Sounds". He will be awarded a record contract, but he is a liar to be honest with his father about his career choice and prove himself as a real singer. When he and others leave the label, stooges decide to have a little fun and play his record and wear curly up like Christine. A woman contractor who can work with Christine, sees Curly and offends Christine and invites Curly to her party. Of course there is someone who is angry that they are in the party and they destroy his soul in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to return. <br /> <br /> What a great stall flick, this should not be missing! <br /> <br /> 10/10
