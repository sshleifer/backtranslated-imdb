I have never been known by the film to strengthen the debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this film will finally be remembered as a classic all the time. I waited for this film as I liked all, Lock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews I thought it was very disappointing. I loved this film and I can't wait any longer. This film is very different from Ritchie's original films, and is also better. I have my choice of preferred directors but none of them moved the argument like Guy Ritchie has just done with this movie. I believe she has taken some film decisions on the other level (I know many people will be laughing at this criticism of this film, but I believe when you show me right). This film is very confusing and continues for longer than 2hr or run time if I couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to create things together. Now I have had a good idea to take everything that happens in this film (some answers from the last hours of thinking, some answers from reading other people taking a film) and now can't wait until Sunday when I see it again. I hope people will go to movies and open ideas and hope to reward them as I and many others have been.
