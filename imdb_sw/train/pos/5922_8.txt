I've found this film to be exciting from scratch - like the movie Spielberg is - and getting a fun plot I tried to find out the reality. <br /> <br /> Right from the start - before the opening credit - the action will start, bringing in quickly locked. The two main characters are very interesting. (I have trouble loving any of Baldwins, due to extra Alec activities, political activities, but William was not so bad in this film.) It was, unfortunately, many places where there was a sound of the sound of a voice in a voice - something like 19K Hz. I think the microphone was taking video surveys on a set.
