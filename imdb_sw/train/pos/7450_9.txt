This is the best of the "Faerie Tale Theater" series of Shelley Duvall. Bad managers are a good comedy for good comedy, and these Arden are typical of the evil of infants. Jennifer Beals does a good job like Cinderella directly, especially in the garden area with Charming Matthew Broderick's Prince. Jean Stapleton does a good godmother of the female, although I do not know the reputation of the "southern lady" and some lines. The comedy support of Steve Martin as the Orchestra's Royal Player is the Martin of Saint Martin, but little has been lost in the show. <br /> <br /> As is the case with the series, there are several views of wry for older children (15 years and older). For small, the show flows smoothly, and they live happily every time. Children up to the age of 8 will continue to investigate after their parents finish exhaustion - I have seen 3 times a day to be very little.
