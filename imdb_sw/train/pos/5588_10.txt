At first I had a window of opportunity to see this all but forget the usual was back in the early 1980s, in one of our house art as revival. As I watched this dream of an epidemic in 1930 culture, I thought of YOWZA! They left the killings in Europe back that day. Unfortunately, this film was greatly reduced due to the initial release of the US and the Hayes Office of the Blue (the regulatory board of government, starting with "the most holy than you" Bible thumper, Will Hayes ... former office officer The Post Office, if you believe that), because it is the general theme of human sexuality (Heaven is preventing people actually having sex in the 1930s). The Ecstasy arrangement involves a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who is married to an old man, and later sadly. He (Lamarr) meets a good boy and has a relationship with him, causing a divorce from the old husband (no no one in Hollywood movies back then --- Divorce!). In spite of the fact that the film was released in 1933, perhaps the first time the director works in the sound structure (for example the film seems to have been used mainly in silent films â€” namely 1920 of expression). It is still important to find a window in the first pictures of Europe, with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930), and 'Vampyre' of Karl Gustav Dryer (1931). It has not been counted, but has an interesting swimming area with some of the sexually encrypted text, which would be much more interesting than PG-13 for today's standards (but would have dropped easily 'X', behind 30 years, if it was there )
