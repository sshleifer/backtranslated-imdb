One of the best if not the best movie rock'n'roll ever. And it's not just fun. In fact there was so much joke in it. Of course I like Ramones. But with all the "chaos" and "I hate the top campus" theme, the film does not quite take itself very seriously, which is what great on it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie in the Spring of 1980, and I noticed again soon. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me a nostalgic type. As I said, this film did not take itself too seriously and not as busy as many other seventy, eight, and nineteen years. And talking, not dirty or disgusting. Only PG tested. That's rare for a movie in this category. The great tribal church and the wonderful time of capsule.
