This film is very good. Goldsworthy art is very helpful in the middle of the film because you can see the art in the most beautiful, moving and changing and shining. I recommend this movie to everyone. I can't think of something else to say about it. It's just the kind of movies you see, because it really encourages them to see and has left me very energy when I was so excited.
