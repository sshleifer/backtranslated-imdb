When I found out that Brian Krause would be on this film, I wanted to look. It took several weeks to realize that I found this nature and love it. So I had more reason to look. Yes, I looked. It was much better than many sequels for TV shows. I hate what happens to Brian's behavior (you can make yourself) and I don't like most characters, one of Brian included. But the movie required happy and sad characters and jerk to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. At the end, I was celebrating for Stanley and his happy end. If you liked the original Cabin and Lake or if you like non-blood movies, I would recommend watching this.
