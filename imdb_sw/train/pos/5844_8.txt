In 1948 this was my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable Clothing was so horrible that I wanted to grow that she had to wear like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., had no power as a Hungarian administrator. Silly and fluffy as this movie could be seen the first time, when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw another day; I was surprised to see that it still did.
