Diane and I saw this amazing film today in Fremantle and we all agreed that the pastiche movies were head and shoulders over others. I say that because we were inserted by short groups, five to ten minutes that included films and the fact that this film had a theme that each piece included and that the theme was really love for its many forms. <Br /> <br /> This film was done in different parts of Paris and thus gave some taste for each part. I was only in Paris several times, I did not have enough knowledge to identify places but I'm sure Europeans and especially French people can easily identify the city's areas. In any event, the viewer is given once in every story because of their production efficiency so these city sites enter the results. <br /> <br /> The movie goes faster and the viewer takes into account one condition when the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not as clear as other Hollywood films, they are subtle and stimulating and sensible as for many lives without the media that include the beauty of life more than a nearby spoon to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and allow this magical film to bathe you as a spa treatment and when you leave I think I will feel a new one.
