FISHER ANTWONE is the story of a young person with emotional trouble of U.S. Navy. His problems brought Jerome Davenport, a psychologist who helps him to realize that his problems are due to his childhood birth. Get ready to shed tears or two. The movie can shake the heart more cold. I loved the story, which turns from something that is so bad to happen to anyone at the best end. FISHER ANTWONE is a powerful movie, most importantly about forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think is child abuse, adoption, and childcare services. Oscar winner, Denzel Washington is doing an amazing job at its first start. There were many cases that I enjoyed watching. They include the beginning (dream of a little boy? Look at the big pancakes of size!) And the end (dream has become a reality), which have combined stories together. Another strange thing happened when the doctor told Antone to find her family to find answers to her questions about her family that had left her. My favorite part happened when the young man was with his mother and his answers towards him. The valueless. All characters represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the leadership roles, Mr. Washington continues to show what he won the Oscar prize and is successful in all his duties. He had a great presence in this movie. Doctor, Derek Luke showed why he was right for the part of Antony Fisher. He showed the real work of stimulating the heart. Joy Bryant who played part of Cheryl's interest, Antons, is like the sun's sun on the screen. Chemistry matched among the sex characters. Novella Nelson who played part of Mrs. Tate, a disrespectful character, deserves special mention. A few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave the best performance. Everybody should see FISHER ANTWONE.
