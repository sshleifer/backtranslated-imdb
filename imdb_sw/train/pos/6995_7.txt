Instead of a piece of business involved with Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (and yes, the assistant of Renfield and his mother, the youngest and yes, the wife of the scientist (looks like Greeneway movie really lol) Lugosi gives his wife a wife from dead (why are they who know) so that his wife can keep looking good. She accepts the bride after making a good trick with orchids that makes the daughter fall on the altar. For another grandmother asking for dust, the newspaper writer HAPPENS just be around around, and decides A walk to the story, gets all kinds of signs about orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. A wonderful doctor who can or cannot be eeeevil. has a x-ray vision, since he plans his plans, OO! What will happen? I loved this movie as a pleasure of guilt. a here, his hangers on all is very strange, the story is actually quite bad in some places that makes it all more watchable. A little sense of happiness.
