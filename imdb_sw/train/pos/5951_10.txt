Directed by artistic, photographed and transparent images? Translation of Crosby looks similar, Hardwicke has its eternal role, while Bendix is ​​treating also? This referral of Yankee is common and ineffective. <br /> <br /> One of the great fun of the movie, of course, is the songs. As can be expected, Bing is good sound. And although Hardwicke's soul is cut off, we can hear the singing of the heart as he plays happily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous writing, "Busy Doing Nothing". It is also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, though enjoyed a great performance and the work of the concert as a singer, rarely had the opportunity to be heard in the movie. Does he have a beautiful voice that is not the same as his oppressive appearance? And she looks very much to pull her clothes Mary Kay Dodson. Director Tay Garnett gets a very large budget, using every resource for his mandate to submit any area of ​​efficiency as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse is also a problem, but who is complaining?) In short, such as the trailer explains, entertainment enjoys from beginning to end.
