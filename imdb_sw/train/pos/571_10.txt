See how the two brothers interact with each other through the whole movie makes me happy to live in the rural area as they did in the film. I have watched this film many times and have a book beside my Bible. After watching the movie I agree that this is one of the smaller movies that make the book right. I strongly recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to go fish or be out to do so. It's amazing. I can't imagine anyone who can play a better chance than Brad Pitt. Make yourself right and look at one of the best movies in the modern movie movie. Recommend to Then and as a guide to fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish from movie events because though it seems to be better on the film you do not know how much fishing and skills such as actually takes. Thank you for listening Look at this movie please if you would like a long sad movie.
