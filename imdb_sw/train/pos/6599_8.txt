In the corners of São Paulo, the middle-class middle-class and unemployed Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Soninha's boy (Sílvia Lourenço) have hidden secrets. Religious teodoro is really a man-stranger, employed to kill people in neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). She has a lover, a very busy woman, Teretaha (Martha Meola), and wants to be born again, going to the country with her. Cláudia has a boyfriend, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who provides meat for his father's shop. Soninha is a six-year-old girl, full of sex life, dusty soil and strong iron. When Júli is killed and healed in their neighborhood, the lives of family members change. "Contra Todos" is a small low-budget Brazil which shows life on the Brazilian capital city. The story is true, it uses common areas of a poor Brazilian metropolis (drug dealers, affected men, modern evangelical evangelicals, young people without hope etc.), has many points of conspiracy and ultimate Awesome, and the characters have the best performances, acting very naturally and making the possible story possible. The camera follows the characters, giving great dynamics on the film. In the DVD's, Roberto Moreira's director explains that his screenplay did not have lines, just a description of the situation, and it was just open one week before starting shootings. Administrators are trained in workshops and have used lots of votes, being the reason for acting in nature. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against Everyone")
