This film was completely BILILANT !! Each performance in this film is best, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a great job of the film if this is something to go. I thought that Joe Johnston was an unfamiliar choice as a director as he often associated woth blockbusters on the budget (Jumanji, Honey I prevented children). He pulls every area with his class. My favorite part is where Homer falls down and looks at the sky, coming down, as all his dreams were, it was good. Joe Johnston should focus more on these brilliant films, acting with Big Big blockbuster to do, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! for all involved in this masterpiece!
