I watched Antony Fisher in BRAVO. What's an amazing movie with a wonderful boy. This movie should look at anyone involved and how to overcome child abuse and be left as an adult. Denzel Washington places a good performance with a boy who plays Antons Fisher. Caution of Kleenex - Feel good with tears. When breathing is when it finally meets his mother, who was removed from 2 months of age. And one of the brave was when he stood by his mother pastor and sister. I saw this film in Bravo in 2008 and just would like to know about it years ago. Certainly the film added to my DVD collection.
