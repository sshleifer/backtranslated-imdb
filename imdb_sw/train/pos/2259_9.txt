I bought this cheap from residual rent on the local store. It was close to mint conditions, and I have never heard of it before. Obviously no one has been. <br /> <br /> I can't believe my luck. You are going to the whole world of emotions and you are trying to get a difficult message - a moral and non-winning Mandela Party, of course. Despite its great height (I had to look at it in two sessions) - it was like one book couldn't stop. Perhaps the songs are not all that they did not remember, but the spirit of something takes forever. I can't understand the views that music (open for action) is not true! I have seen the "South Pacific" and read the book too, and can ensure that music is not true compared to the book. I will enjoy getting this little until it will wear. One day they will do again in the best budget. <br /> <br />
