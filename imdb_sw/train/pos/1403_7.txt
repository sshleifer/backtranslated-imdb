Paul Verhoeven (teacher and famous teacher of the film) hurts back down, but still enjoys in the "kind of dirt way," Sneaky Man. The first acts are very good that the last act of slasher becomes lustful. However, I recommend this film to the MANGO to get special effects (perhaps better to date) and two good performances and titles. Verhoeven's moral questions are of course provoking, and although the film has opened many, this movie is a good soft base for the old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two big bad: Josh Brolin (aka Walking man-mate) with all the plan and elevator. If there was a level of access, why were they hit on the laboratory? <br /> <br /> The awesome horror movie on Saturday night.
