BASEketball is actually a real movie. David Zucker can make us cut our heads again, very modern, but often intelligent, biography. The 2 South Park creators, the main actors in this film, play very well, amazing amazing facts, but this is the first time to see them as actors. The film was often reminded of South Park - one of my fav shows. <br /> <br /> It is a very good and interesting film, so don't forget. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
