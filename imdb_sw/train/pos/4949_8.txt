10 or more information is one of those 'under the radar images' which are easily covered by many self-contained movies: honesty, advertisements and its two guides - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who form a mixture as an impossible duo. The main thing is, this movie all seems impossible in spite of the root of 'road roads'. How does Morgan Morgan named psychically (not physically) find where he meets this jaded check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to be with her husband shepherd playing with Bobby Cannavale in limited role) somehow left for us to witness more of their losses and fake magic - two people on different sides of the social currency - is a simple fraud. So, in short, when there is no bracelet! During the revelation of the world, this movie is a little piece of emotion that perhaps lost in the shuffle of indies that came out in 2006 but it deserves to be seen, if it is only for its honesty.
