Let me first say that I have Cerebral Palsy and I have entered this film to expect to have a allowance for leading performance. I left the semi-semi-believing field that they would beat the actors who had Cerebral Poor in the role, although I knew it was not. The exhibition was very good, and with a special warranty for Brenda Fricker and for Hugh O'Conner (I believe it was his name) as Christy Brown younger. Christy is a talented, courageous, arrogant, sometimes angry and angry â€” in other words, man. This film, along with Gaby: The Story of Truth and the King Gimp, is a beautiful picture of life and CP. There is no perfect picture, but good examples of people as disabled. It is highly recommended.
