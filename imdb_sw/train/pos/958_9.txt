Wow! I have seen many very low budget films recently, but this is good. The real appearance of police life in the city of East Germany is very different from other crime or series movies. I loved the great actor and completely refused any image about the police. This film is really like documentation and entertainment as a concert at the same time. Tradeoff perfect!
