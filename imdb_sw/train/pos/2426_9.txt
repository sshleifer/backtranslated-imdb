"Once in life" is a very good movie. However it is not good for everyone, because of the large use of bad language and violence of a particular situation. The film manages to represent in a reliable, reliable way "life" in NYC areas where drug problems are important. These exhibitions are used as a decoration for a well-thought-out and stressed-backed celebration (however I had a hard time understanding some of them because English language is not my language). There is a little something else sometimes, but I think it is well suited to the general direction of Fishburne presented to the movie, which gives the idea of ​​reflection more than being a good practice practice, especially in time management / action. The characters, though not simple, are easy to contact with the executives doing the best to pretend. The way I was very happy with the sound of the voice (B. Marsalis). If you are very poor, you should enjoy watching the movie immediately, twice, three times. I tested the 9/10 movie.
