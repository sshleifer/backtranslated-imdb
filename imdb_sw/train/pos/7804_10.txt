I keep watching this film regularly. I should look at it at least once a week. I am from Africa and check that the movie has taught me things that I did not know about Africa. All Denzel's movies are full of lessons for people of life walks. I wish he was my own brother. I also saw and love Masala Mississipi. It's an exciting thing. When Denzel tried to arrest his brother on the job, he reminds me of my old age when my brother was interested and I am always about to get involved with all the time. My brother was caring for my old father and wants to see me in the same way. How did Denzel get African scope from Independence movies? I first saw the movie in Africa and I did not know that Denzel was in America even when I moved here.
