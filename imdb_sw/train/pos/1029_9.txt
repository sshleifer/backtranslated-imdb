I would like to be tested for the 10 perfect series for better and regular development of stories and promotional behavior if it was not the last part of the 10th Season! The last part of the 10th season "Not enough", where (of course it will appear) Asgard has been killed in a very fast, senseless and ignorant way, leaving me with unbelief! From the immediate end of the series, it is clear that many of the stories of the story were planned for the first one more season. I think it would be that they hurried these stories faster to manage the Stargate SG-1 franchise for two future direct videos to DVD! <br /> <br /> Unless the return of Asgard in the future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the disappearance "definitely"), I think that fans have been lost by the bad disappearance of extinction! <br /> <br /> Does not end with a good sci-fi series.
