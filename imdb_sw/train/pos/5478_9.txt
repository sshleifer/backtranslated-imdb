There is no ongoing feeling on the story since enough monitors have done so. Here are different different slants from one of the "religious nuts," as one of the most severely tested inspectors put it. 1) "The Child's Face" (1933) provides a typical example you have put in the film how women can run men and sex. There is a lot of truth why Barbara Stanwyck shows in this film: look cute, call your eyelids, give your body for free ..... and men will fall on themselves to help you with whatever you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was a career development with the ultimate financial goal ..... lots of votes. At least four women in this film only give it, even if it destroys their lives in the process. 2) Last - many of the heretics seemed to hate it - it gives another great message: all the money and physical products on earth will not make anyone feel fulfilled. The sad comment that many "critics" here would like to have a message of fornication, preferring to spray on the substance. No surprise, I think. Any way to look at it, the film is a start-up and Stanwyck has other lines, especially at the beginning when he says his bad father and the lawless customers. For a little more than 70 minutes, this film goes faster and is gone before you know.
