What I anticipated: A great impressive example of a young sportsman with a good example of gal who loves him is still injured when he is a second banana with his greatest support for his sports team. What I have: The story of bones where two players and gal end up accepting - themselves and each other - that everyone should have a desire in their lives but everyone can forgive others to share the love they share. Sounds of sappy but with abnormal humor and great exhibition this story works! Barrymore is an ordinary Barrymore: a perfect mix of sweet, strong, and pleasant. We hope to be from him and he has given. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is a good surprise in this film. He brings in the role of a full mix of nut games with thanks to the usual things in life, as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon provides its lines to the fullest trick. He may be concerned ("You just passed through the field for me!") And in one breath it is caused by his love for the red Market ("How does the leaves feel?") At the same time. The description of Fallon "made" film. We hope, this film denotes the beginning of the best film work for Fallon, the biggest thing over the top-sophomoric humor size of the SNL alum (ie Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a movie that may have been victims of male and female characters listed on the same scope and release an unusual-over spot on humorous lines, many delivered by brilliant trick and Fallon . Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a fan of baseball - and she liked it as I did. It's not "Flick Guy" nor "Chick Flick". It's fantastic make-you-laugh flick. Go see!
