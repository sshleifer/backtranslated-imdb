Not knowing what the film was nearby, I watched it in the video store and after seeing it, I enjoyed it. Little saw many types of flick from the director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Dear). Great stories and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by his British emphasis. The only exception to this film was the end. However, it fits tax.
