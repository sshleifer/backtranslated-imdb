I have recently seen this film in my international business class. I had no expectations of anything else then another boring document (I don't say I don't like a text document I have been very unfortunate with movies in that class) Imagine my surprise when this film, which is actually movie, came. This film is to tell different cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere. Cultural strife shows how the world is different and how different we see ourselves until someone comes and gives us a phone call. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants to laugh, because that's funny. Well, that's about it! Cheers
