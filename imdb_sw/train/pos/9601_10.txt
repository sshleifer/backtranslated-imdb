Darius Goes West is an amazing document on a young man (Weems) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a cross country to see if "My Pimp Ride" will take out a wheelchair. <br /> <br> I recently watched this film on the Sunscreen Film Festival. It played twice for the festival period. This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit, and the spirit of friends of Weem. I don't say many times about movies, but after watching this film, I feel moving to do something for a reason. Each movie this movie has entered, this film has won some kind of award. It is in Tribeca Film Festival, and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I can't be surprised if this film went to the Academy Awards. It is an unqualified rainbow. If someone has a chance to see this film, wherever you play, go! Take as many people as possible, and go! It goes to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius comes from Georgia, so I expect Atlanta tickets to be displayed quickly, if not ready. Please, watch this film! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
