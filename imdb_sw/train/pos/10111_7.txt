Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. not a very good document. Inesthetically, it is lackluster and look cheap, people in it go on tangents which make it not clear and for cooperation, but this adds to its charm. I say this because it is an odd document that has made an unusual photo and surrounded by fellow oddballs and, as such, no other way of memory of the life and work of a man with his staff of misfits. There are some awareness of all the concepts and the absence of wood, and the display of both characteristics is credit for the credibility of the document. In general, it's worth looking for a fan of Wood and those of the movies in general, but don't wait carefully here. He expects a document made after Wood's heart.
