Old Mill Dam is more than a tariff for Africa and America '30s than any transfer of the whole race (Stepin Fetchit caricature regardless). In addition to those mentioned only, there are frog versions of the Cab Calloway, Oil Oil, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, and Louis Armstrong. This cartoon of Harmonies of Harmon from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is a very entertaining music and perfect reputation around. They all feel like a real thing that half of me think they might be. If they are not, they are certainly very revealing. Even lazy, characteristic of Fetchit finds an exciting job here when it gets chased by tiger as "Hold That Tiger" on the score. It is highly recommended for fans of 30s animation and jazz music.
