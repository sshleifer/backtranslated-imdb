I have seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's still good every time I see it. It is a very exciting version of Opera Carmen, and a fantastic play of Flamenco, a set of open skeletons, and of course, amazing music. <br /> <br /> This Carmen story is a story in the story, another, until the end of pain. Obviously the lowest budget of Spanish production, the film has a dance with some of the Spanish players Flamenco. The opera mix of increasingly opera music and the boots of the players on the wooden stage, makes the storytelling more powerful. It is a freelance film that works best and maybe my favorite at all foreign films.
