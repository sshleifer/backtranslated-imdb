Loosely intended as a sata of D.W. Griffith's endurance, three years was the first attempt of Buster Keaton for a full feature of comedy. The only analogy of tolerance is the "book" of opening and the fact that similar stories for years have been edited in full film. Keaton's intention to approve this model is that if it is not successful as a feature film, it can be reduced to two reelers. Fortunately, three years succeeds with skill as comedy and has some funniest routines I have seen in any film Keaton. There is nothing unique or focusing on story lines. They are boy-boy-boy, boy-lost-girl, young-find-girl squares, but the satires period is riotous and set standard for future work with Mel Brooks and all films of this kind. However, I do not believe that anyone has ever hit this comedy. No one can play lovable goof like Keaton and stunts in this film are some of its best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as the opponent of Keaton adds an appeal to this film. Anyone who thinks that the comedy from the 1920s cannot be counted by modern viewers need to see this movie.
