I have been eager to expect the opening of this film for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I noticed how he could make himself in Seuss' Grinch and make his own character. I had no desire. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master in his business and no one can do this work perfectly as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for adults and children similar to this movie is sure to be a classic time-free time for all to enjoy in the coming years. I already have a vision of my little daughter sitting a year after year looking at this reference to the video, and of course I will look at him and laugh as I did the first time I saw it. Obviously, this movie has Jim Carrey written everywhere, and I don't believe it would come together without him. However, the hand healed there was a delight and enjoyment of themselves, especially especially the Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for the antics of Carrey. Implementation of the set, music symbols and all the clothes have put their hands on magical, surprising products and I believe those involved can boast. It is not very easy to turn the 22-minute cartoon into a full-stage live action, but Howard has succeeded with flying colors. For those critics who do not agree, perhaps it is your heart that is a very small size.
