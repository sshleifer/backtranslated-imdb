Before you see this film, I see a lot of views, which everyone has good views of films or bad ... when he was seen or even intro, I was shocked by Will Smith's and Woody Harrelson's "message" to try to create and perhaps interfere with the whole plot until he finally understood what was going on. I'm not a very emotional person, I believe that a good job should not be sympathetic or sympathetic to it. But the act of liberation, there are no many films in my opinion can show this. This is one of them who can. I agree with one person who commented on this film to show the "suicide" action is a deficit, however I do not believe that it is the "message" that film is trying to send, but "sacrifice". Very little, but that's the message for MY views. This video has potential. Work is worth every penny, the script is wonderful. from someone who doesn't like to watch filming ... if you like this game you must go.
