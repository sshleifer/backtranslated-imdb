Many comments that people have made me feel like (sorry) uncertain. Kasdan wants to give life, only, a normal life. Normal stories, where characters have a knowledge that changes their lives, and then disappears out, music up to, and the film is over, inserted into this much larger canvas. Several characters in this film have such displays, and they continue. Sometimes they can hold on to their understanding, sometimes they can't, and that's the way of life. In other words, the Kasdan's most common formats for the continuous investigation for life? no end of happiness, only at the end of the end; and everything before this is still in the process, still always on grabs ?? and, if you insist on the head, examining the role of miracles in our lives. Is it a miracle? Well, life itself, to begin with. Then add to all random events and cross connections that make life, or several life linked, and you have miracles and buckets. Kasdan emphasizes this theme gently, instead of insisting on it, and reinforcing it in various ways, in the memory of the device, in the middle of the film, with Mac and his wife, lying in bed, each dreaming their dreams, but also showing, later in the film, how these dreams have power, inside the film, forming the truth. This is not a film with a simple or clear message. You should only allow it to play in front of you, then allow it to sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what happened there. That is, of course, the best film of Kasdan, its mature, more quiet. Reflect on life from one of our talented writers and directors. This tragedy is, of course, that it was not allowed to work for several years now, mainly because of the label barriers next to "Dreamcatcher." We hope we didn't hear the last from Larry Kasdan. Beautiful movies from the great artist. Remember that art is not good enough to do it perfectly.
