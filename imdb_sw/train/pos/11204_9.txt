Use of the symbolism of the objects, form the structure, the role of the characters in the area ... all of these used to abandon the fun with Hitchcock that you can see really the fertile knowledge she had. The way the wife goes from one corner of the ring to another as the struggle goes on, editing when the wedding ring is put on her finger ... when these can be seen with the standards today, during the silence that talked much about the story without the spoken word. Even the head has four meanings that I can see; The boxing boxes, wedding rings, the partner's ring buys, and the triangle of love in the heart of the story.
