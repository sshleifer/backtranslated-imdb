If you stop the boat, on the boat, from the bus, then on the bus. and so then leave unconnected and in the cinema song which results from not actually showing real life situations. Long-term travel routes allow the viewer to be confused as 'waiting-in-line' to hear the characters should endure. Break the heart? yes. Vital? Certainly. The transport restriction is the key to the 'destruction' of this Turkish family. Good film and good acting. Sadly, but worth it.
