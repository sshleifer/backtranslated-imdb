If you are under 13 or over 13 and are very enlarged, you will enjoy D-war. If you are a good fan of all kinds of non-brain film, you will enjoy D-war. Otherwise, don't worry! I saw a movie today with my brothers and friends 3. They liked it and it made me feel good. After the movie was completed, all the children (my relatives and friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the playground. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Making and leading is bad. Story story is very simple. But, since half of the audience were children, they were shouting, screaming and enjoying every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This has led to a more spectacular experience than it was. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie to take your kids, but except for the last battle of the war, D-War is desperate. I give this film 7 out of 10 especially because the children liked it very much.
