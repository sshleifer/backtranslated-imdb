Even though this film came out of the year before birth, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It is a star Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand the homosexuality of his son. As many parents, she does not know anything about what it means to be gay and has all the different ideas of how gay people are. His son, Norman, has now grown and lived alone. His father, Ben, knows his son is a homosexual, gives his son a visit to hope to change him. The head comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben gets to the rooms of Norman runs into a female prostitute and thinks it is his child in the drag ("Norman ... Are you the ones"). The movie was with me laughing from beginning to end. Redd Foxx is good. Although most of the content is normal, I found nothing wrong with how the equipment was stored, and even has a good end. It is highly recommended.
