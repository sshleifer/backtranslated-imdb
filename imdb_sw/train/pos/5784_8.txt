I found that many people put it on "Kerching!" The board seems to hate this show, which really I see very amazing. I think it's one of the best British children 'shows there. It is a shame to end because it is very interesting (if it is a little sometimes) and has characters. The main character is as little as Del Boy, though quite neat. And her two best friends tried to make a million pounds to her mother by establishing a online business and getting a pseudonym of "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is a simple mind and a kind of comic aid). In each show, other characters have come out and new ones have entered, but it has always been entertainment and improvement.
