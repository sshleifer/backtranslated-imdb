I thought children in the show did a very good job. I especially enjoyed the behavior of Emma. Well done! Stunts was very good for a low budget show. I was able to follow the film and enjoy without looking at me every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the photo with the fairy of the tooth and burned it. The blows of the spirit of the spirit of the children were also good. Another good tip of the movie is that it continued to move along. There were no many slow events. Adult instructions were also trusted and thus helped keep recreation. All night long enjoyable watch film.
