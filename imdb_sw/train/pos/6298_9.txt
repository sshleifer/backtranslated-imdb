Great fun. I went with 8 friends to watch the sneak preview of this film. We came to see the difference but after 10 minutes wondered what heck we own ourselves at this time jokes become funny and stayed funny in the movie. In the first section you continue to wonder about these 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many more examples of this translation) and because they continue to repeat the same joke (with different deviations) they get funnier and funnier. Searching this malinski all the main characters is brought to the first one even wackier than the second. Up to half of the film was just about we didn't even know the name of this film because there were no opening features and we went to watch this sneak, but we are sure to have a good time. The house was closed (appr. 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it and the other half liked the film. If you like amazing movies and good conversations you will love them. Apart from Clooney This movie should be much better than the IMDB rate 5.6 that writes this time, but when more ppl has seen I am sure it will continue. 7.0 is wise to think, I would like to give 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)
