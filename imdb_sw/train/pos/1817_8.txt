All Dogs Go to Heaven has on the canine underground. The film is fun for children with a fascinating and dark - but fun and fun story with a lot of song and dance. It deals with Charlie, a fellow criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless girl who looks at him, and through this relationship, he understands the meaning of life and dedication. This is a good animation you liked through my eyes as a child. I would strongly recommend this film to children. I don't know about how adults could respond. (I tried to look a few years ago on VHS, but those records don't last long, do you?)
