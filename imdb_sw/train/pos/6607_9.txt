I would like to give 10 out of 10. However, there are confused areas and areas that lead to the most of the film. The story line is good and has been well included; you will definitely want to look this quietly to understand. The characters are complicated and so it is a story line, expecting just enough information to stop cutting your head, it's a film where everything is explained at the end. The animation is great and the combination of a dead woman and film film occurs in a beautiful film which is different from anything else I have seen in the animation. It is a black and white film and its dark stability in a few cases so it is worth looking at a good T.V, or plasma. Characteristic words preserve this film in the English version, but it would be more persuasive if there were French accent stamps that happened in Paris, I enjoyed more French and English titles. One is all well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they are! And if you have enjoyed this film you can also love it; Waking Life & Ghost in Shehena 2 Don't be guilty, this is just a personal opinion.
