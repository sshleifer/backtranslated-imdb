Early to mid-90s were high, in my opinion, for a historical game. At the end of Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all showed a different passion and strength in their time periods. Rob Roy was a special and exciting flavor of time and place not usually represented by the film. In fact it has everything - a fascinating story, good acting, wonderful dialogue, and pleasant surroundings. I was especially attracted to true truth. I can think this is how early 18th-century people spoke and acted. Another interesting thing is the destruction shown by the characters. I thought it was horrible and surprising, though more often than a trick, than most found in the modern films. The movie was very racy and charged for its purposes which was unique and very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The speed was very tight, and very difficult when bright. There was a lot of controversy and political issues that had been a bit difficult, but still did not stop the main story. <br /> <br /> Step was also well done and inserted. The only thing I will ever find is that during the action point on the film, there is no sound. It makes it very consistently, an exciting series, as we don't have music surveys as the direction and resolution of the area. Rob Roy will always be on my favorite list of films. I would recommend to all.
