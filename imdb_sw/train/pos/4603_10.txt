There is one explanation, which is not unusual for Jackie Chan movies, but it's here. It has a very difficult and serious environment about it when the wonderful things are also. Jackie is dangerous and psychologically here. He is not a hero who has been attacked and then he fights back (with a common backward pattern), but he is able to go and start shock. His way to beat the wicked in glasses is amazing. Every time it goes "delete!". I am also very pleased with the area when Jackie goes to the pub and beat the criminals who had fought with her boyfriend. It's one of the best blitzkriegs set to screen. Besides, the whole area is shot by the history of some character set on the wall (it also looks like a rabochiy poster from our Soviet era) and some Russian lines on the left (I saw that it was quite an accident). That seems to be strict (and nostalgic to Russian people). I also like when windows are being played in the movie. Here are many of these things. It's amazing amazing characters falling / jumping / running / driving all the way. <br /> <br /> All three movies are good. I was preparing to see the bottom-slide of quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with wonderful and wonderful stunts (and not just the character of Jackie Chan appears in all three movies - which also better and continue to continue). <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each movie with a few words: No.1 - great (in all elements - it's one interesting story since the beginning to the end) and funny (most scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - bright (Jackie is actually * beep * here) and pot (Jackie gets suffering); No.3 - unknown (a woman fighting with Jackie is amazing) and bombastic (should I mention many guns and explosions?) <br /> <br /> About others - much has been mentioned by others. It is a trilogy that can be viewed regularly (at least with me). Its place is about 10 among the workstations / comedy. It is finally released in Russia on the DVD (2 film has the best option - Chinese / Russian songs with English / Russian headlines) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
