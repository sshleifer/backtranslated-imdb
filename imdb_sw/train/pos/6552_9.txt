Usually I don't like Emma Roberts very much, but after watching Nancy Drew is a kind of changed my mind. The actors in the film did anything exciting and surprising. Often when you look at a secret film you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this film it's like you're really there. All symptoms are appropriate together until you finally understand all the crimes. I still wonder how he saw it. The whole movie was very clever and people who watched it with me loved the movie too. Clothes was my favorite part of the movie, it was very good. I don't think there will be another film like this until the series comes out. I am giving nine because the popular girls have not seen the same place, but they still make me laugh. It was a great movie with a great secret. I certainly recommend watching it.
