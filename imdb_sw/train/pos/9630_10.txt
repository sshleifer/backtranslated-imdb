I've seen dirty work several times and maybe it's Stan and my Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this one, Stan and Ollie are the pit of the chimney and get the work of cleaning the chimney at the home of the Third Professor (Lucien Littlefield). While Tambi makes experimental experiments in his laboratory, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of confusion trying to clean up the chimney and make a living mess. Finally, where Ollie comes into a special form tank that Tambi uses for his experiments and this makes him a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls under the chimney and loads of land bricks on his head, but does not seem to suffer much from this. The dirt work is Stan and Ollie for their pleasure. Enjoy it very much. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
