This film is real. everything looks like a comic book. sets, clothing, and plot are good. Clark Bartram is no longer our famous fighter. he seemed a little more at the end of death, but still removing it. superman is also great. The jump effects are the same. but his fan film so we would like to expect to be greater. The bullet and superman catch the car was highly reliable. it was cool. This is the movie I will see if it is true. its got everything you would like in the movie of batman / superman. One exception though, I would like to throw a joker instead of a 2 ..... I generally give this film 10 because it's a good film.
