This is one of the most popular movies of Brian De Palma but not the best. Body Body, Fury and Carrie are the best movies but this film is better than Sounding and Night. De Palma is greatly affected by Hitchcock and this movie is to eliminate Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a supportive wife who thinks to have something and after a man of mind, played by Michael Caine, returns to give, Dickinson meets someone in the art of art and she sends and sleeps with him. After this action is better you do not know what is happening but there is murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer. Dennis Franz is a investigator on the case who does not believe Allen and needs to find the killer himself. It's a good movie but not the best of De Palma.
