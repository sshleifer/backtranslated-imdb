And this is a great movie of rock'n'roll itself. It does not matter how it changed (during the film on the disco), it ended as one of the last movies that children want to collapse, but the prince stands in their way. Think of the 50-year-old rock'n'roll movies that the day has been saved when Alan Freed comes to the city with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is real and safe for children, and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweat for dance. Go back to 1979, repeating the plot, but editing the DA RAMONES, who no one found to be one of the biggest bands of the next century (and then for DJ guest shot, "The Real" Don Steele). Also, all the features of the comedy-exploitation film Roger Corman, except for two-day shooting schedule, other Corman repertory players like Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (since "Blood Dam"), and one of them of the great day-day movies. One of the few films that use deliberately and leave. I showed a new DVD to a friend who could only remember to see its parts through stone stones, and admitted that this is one of the best movies to watch a drunk, not the least for the best to lead women and beautiful pictures of Ramones.
