The National Gallery of Art showed the time lost ideas previously uncut version of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores important scenes to reduce to the top release censors. The character of the cobbler, moral goody goody-individual in the nature of the release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of Nietsze philosophy and seeks him to use people to claw his way up. Also, the original corny ends which I assume are in the current versions of the VHS are eliminated and ending are restored to its original state. A wonderful film of deception and power. In hope, there will be a reissue of this film on DVD for all to appreciate its main features. Look for him.
