Winchester '73 was a film migrating to Mann from the b's film in the main league, saving James Stewart's work after the war in the process by releasing him as an opponent (though he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves credit for that). All men will go to the dark place - Mann and the devil's most attractive Gate, which remained long with MGM until Broken Arrow's success encouraged them to open it? but a film about a man who hits his brother as a head gun is given from person to person on the way before ending on one of the loved ones of the loved ones of the loved ones is still more powerful than you would expect from the system label. Big talk, thrown to amazingly? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? with the best mann to see visual add bar with this.
