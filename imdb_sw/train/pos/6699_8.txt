When Sabrina came to our screens I was 12 years old, and so I spent my young years looking at a young witch to get all kinds of extraordinary celebrations. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite plans, the sense of magic of sitcom 'sitwitched' sitties but this time the character was lighter. I always loved Sabrina because she was wise. He was also friendly and easy to go which made the enjoyable look. The original characters were the best; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, viewer, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, embarrassed left very early) Hilda and Zelda her aunt began the same, but became angry. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Kraft as well as he was always so close to discovering the secrets of Sabrina. I liked about the first three series was the original idea, discovering the family's secrets and learning new directions but as it became more predictable. Many characters came and left, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then decided to make Sabrina in a ruined college. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 Sabrina was involved in university, no book spell, no aunt living with him and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were bitter. The last series was humble, and I just looked to see what happened at the end. I had no Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong in some way and Miles had gone like that. The last part made me feel better though (SPOILER) with Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day to sing Aaron was beautiful! Generally a great deal if you have forgotten the poor two or the last series that reminds me of a lot of youth exhibitions. Magical.
