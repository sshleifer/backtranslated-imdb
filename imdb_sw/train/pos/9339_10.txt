For those who do not have such a reference, clubberin had 4 fists to beat one body ... <br /> <br /> Any way, in a comment. I don't forget WCW Saturday night. Some of my time of fighting was often done at this point. I remember watching Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his working days, Mr. Steven Regal, Heat Harlem, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I would like to be here during the list of everyone. Point is WCW with an amazing list of Hogan days before and it produces television. Dusty Rhodes on commentary in later years gave me a completely new reason to look at when I started smoking as a young man ... I very much Vince will put him on a mic for a show or two, maybe on a second American Bash? They tend! Here comes DA PLUNDA! He was good. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
