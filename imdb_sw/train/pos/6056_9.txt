Super Speedway makes a good demo of a new sound system of DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel. IMAX cameras keep you in a race car, where you travel around a range of speeds, reminding you of the driving speed at the Grand Prix (if only it appears on DVD!). I enjoy watching it again and again. Only from, and why I did not give 10, are some of the sequence of a glamorous view as the film has been explored. Sound sound also requires a little stop for unbelief - all you can hear in the real car is the engine. You can't hear swooshes when you go under bridges.
