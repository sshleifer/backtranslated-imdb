Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker have reunited their songs from 35 years ago when they created a trio called "Cream." That was the days of the psychedelic of Britain and America and these boys watched: all hair, long, long clothes and wild clothes. They played a rock and blues mix and it was, for the most part, good things. Well, these people are now 60 years old and they can still sing and play on a high level like this beautiful DVD disc show us. I was learning much by Clapton, of course, who has never been given, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, and I have never seen for many years. They were surprised. When he was younger, Baker was so gaunt appeared as a freak speed around death. Now he seems to be healthy, and the shape and play of his dance was solid. Bruce appeared a little haggard but his voice was beautiful, as beautiful as ever and pleased to hear on these old songs. This is a very good material and makes from boys who know what they are doing. Some people criticized this show for being under the key. I disagree with that. I have no complaint. The festival was very good. The second song, "Spoonful," was the best, the show of my concert. It was highly recommended.
