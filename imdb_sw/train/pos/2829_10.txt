Of course, Personal Study II is the biggest movie I saw. Importing Japanese (wrong) translated into English, is a pleasure to watch. Not a lot of meaning, but that doesn't matter. It's a great comedy around without being funny for purposes. <br /> <br /> The film is a few and not available on the video, but I have taken several late, late nights on the cable pay. My text has been watched several times and several times as I slowly, man-to-person, set up this gem of film in the world. Joanna Pacula has a teacher / partner for Ken, our hero. (It seems to work with his checks.) Ken plays with Goro Itagaki, the port of Japanese pop SMAP, who offers all of it and has beautiful hair through the movie. Stacy Edwards, of the "Men's Company" popularity, shows on the film also and may be glad that she got another film later. It takes at least three views to solve what the plot is. On looking at you you can enjoy things like the usual amount of vases. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but very valuable. My friends and I will discuss all the events. Yes, it looks like we are unavoidable and we are ... but we are lost lame who have seen "Personal Study II." Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this film. You will thank me for it.
