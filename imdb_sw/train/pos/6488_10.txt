War is hell. But this WWII document is in heaven. It is not just this series of respiratory, looking at the perfect World War II, it is a cleverly defined poem with the best for Laurence Olivier. <Br /> <br /> This series of documentation defines the type. It's very long, of course, but you will enjoy all and want to return to more and more. (I have a series on DVD and I probably watch a series three times a year). Really, this is a bit of filming. More than Olivier, the most beautiful part of the series is to listen to the ancient hosts describing their stories; if it is about a real war or about looking for a hog pig to have something to eat for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll go to watch it now (again, my ... at 11).
