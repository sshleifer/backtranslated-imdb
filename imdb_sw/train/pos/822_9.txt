The last film in Lucas saga is a good, attractive production. It is often seen as a bad duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a summary on the IV section (and just a notch under episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the best third-party film in 6 parts. Besides I'm concerned, it's still a great film with great entertainment. It is not a movie with a beginning, peak and end; The film system works with only one purpose in his mind: to bring about the closure of Lucas's world. There is an ultimate air associated with something around, which makes the film also interesting, but fun. It is also a great joy. New characters are brought by the elderly facing new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provides (as usual) good comic support. Leia and Solo are a good romantic duo, and Luke is still a good sense of recognition. Again, it is the internal dispute of Luke (and Vader) that provides his backpack. Lucas's furious ideas are still very clear, and the film's theme of honesty, hope, and liberation emerges. I am happy Lucas has finally dropped the idea of ​​making a part of VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great book for a long, attractive and interesting saga. It is not a perfect movie, but it enjoys the best matinée style.
