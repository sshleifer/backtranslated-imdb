This is the first one to see the film I saw last year! It is an incredible, large-scale, substantial, doubtful course (they went to this super-screen Technicolor of the most spectacular visual sight,) and actually has a deep characteristic and what it says about society. It is a true sater that drives everything from the State Security for competition, while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much of the world's life is scared. Carrie Anne Moss returns in comedic performance I've never thought it will come from him! She's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is as good as Fido who can just mix and exciting! And Dylan Baker as Father is very valuable. In fact the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as an evil man, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with a sexy sexy sexy girl (get an idea now?) Funny, though-stirring and just a wonderful round! Go to this movie! It's like something you've ever seen.
