I don't have much to add to what was said earlier, but it's a contemporary film, and the first time (and possibly only) that the studio has closed the film completely on the last Children's Dead. <Br /> <br /> Warner gave the boys great support, from director Ray Enright and 'A' budget, with a close magical trap of assistants. On each side, we get one of the gem displays from real benefits. They are so many to list, but it looks like almost everyone on the Warner lot (I don't have the biggest star) to walk through this picture. (See if you see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> Only on high performance is from Eduardo Cianelli always reliable as the boss of the attack and complex messianistic. He plays this character almost the same as that of Thuggie's leader in "Gunga Din". He is something to watch! And Marjorie Main is the best and finds its best role since the "Last End". <br /> <br /> My quest for this is the second element of the double bill and something like "City of Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray for Advisors!
