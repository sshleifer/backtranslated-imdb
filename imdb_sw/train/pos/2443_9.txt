This movie can't put the Catholic church with a bright light but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately not everything in life, including religion, is both good and happy. Sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem to be the right thing but to go back will not seem to be as good as they did. "Love is divided" tells the story of the family, that includes religion, but in fact the story is about family, and the family's ability to stay together regardless of what is being done. This film also depends on real events that will not say that this story, location and location, is true, but if you look at news articles from that time you will see that the churches were not being done the way that was beneficial to the family. The two churches are the fault here, the Catholic church for imposing that principle on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with the Protestant church by telling the mother that she must obey her husband and her priest and not put up a war. In this case all leave this family down. I believe that the film has a good job in demonstrating this fight in the church and family. In any case the form or form is to set up a Catholic church, on the contrary, it shows how one event can change the course of the religion and how one person can have a very serious impact to reach it alone.
