Being from Philadelphia's suburbs and local history, this film offers a better view of Philadelphia's harvest in the 1940s. from the north of the city. Good shots of old houses of the line as they appeared then. The movie gets a little "chatty" regularly - causing the viewer to lose interest ... but the whole story is solid and moving very much. Anyone who has enjoyed this film should also try to see the film "Bright conquest", as well as local pictures of the Forge Phoenixville Valley Hospital, PA - and events from Phoenixville. Military Hospital has been a college campus. No these films are in any format and I can't think of why. I have both in VHS from home recording, as shown in TCM in recent years. I strongly recommend any other history out there from my location!
