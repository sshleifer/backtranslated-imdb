Four words say why this film was made - "He did bad". The great achievements of Mae West's car's business believed copper label that the Gay's melidiramas' 90 was a suitable proposal. Here we are paid for fast moving, well written that easily affects the behavior of his stars. Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly opponents; Jackie Cooper is very difficult to take, but it's Fay Wray who stole the film with her business girl in distress. With a strong director - such as Walsh confirms that - Wray can carry a lot of punch, and he is completely trusted as a friend of Raft and Beery. Much of the sky, this is a forgotten film that deserves to be resurrected.
