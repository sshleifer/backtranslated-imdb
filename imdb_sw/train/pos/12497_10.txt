If you have never seen this film Mary-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is: "What are you waiting for?". That's another awesome and wonderful movie and twins of the brothers that we all know and love so much! It is exciting, romantic, exciting and very breathing (wise-wise)! Without doubt; as always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are very good here! What? Any true fan would want any other way? Of course no! However; it's a good movie in every word of the word, so if you have never seen it then you should just now! I mean right now! So what are you waiting for? I promise you won't be discouraged! Sincerely, Rick Morris
