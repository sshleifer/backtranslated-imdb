You can call it a secret, maybe a little exciting, or an intelligent film. The story takes you through the life of one who lost his life and wants to get it again. <Br /> <br /> I say I was so surprised that I enjoyed this film. It is not usually the kind of I care though the characters soon became people to me and I wanted to know what they were and what would happen to them. Like many French films on English we did, we can learn more about the behavior and vulnerability of their environment on their person. This film is driven by character and will not be disappointed!
