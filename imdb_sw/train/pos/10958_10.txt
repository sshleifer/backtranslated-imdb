This show is so amazing that I can't stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite the fact that I have seen all the previous events). I have been seeing Silverman as a great talent and this is ultimately the car of the talent to enjoy with many viewers. I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of time ... I can't say that on most TV show ... can you? This appearance is finally something new and interesting and (most important) interesting! This is a show I never miss and it's one I buy a DVD as soon as it comes out. You enable yourself to watch this show ... I'm predicting a long time of this series ... And just to be clear, people who suffer from this show just doesn't get ... maybe lack of understanding to understand ... they should stop making their own ignorance by attacking something that they don't understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" means Silverman, or who claims to be trying to "tremble" ... is far away ... He is the opposite; only Google and you will see it as a great participant of human rights, etc. If you do not know that he is increasingly accepting all these non-power views, you find it. And if you don't, let's just rest and stabilize it so we can all enjoy hilarity ...
