Bar some worries act (there are musicians at the end of the day), this for Quentin Tarrinno's words is "Best movie rock did ... period" <br /> <br /> Think of the 8th Mile, but without rapping - a small musician, trying to prove himself to the local community, while struggling to deal with a broken house by an opponent's band. Casting on sexual interests and exclusive exhibitions, this is a true milestone. <br /> <br /> Prince provides consistent performance, such as Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Beautiful script, good direction, good plot, and interesting displays. Don't forget some of the best music of rock / pop / funk you'll hear.
