It is impossible to masterpiece. Not very well written. Movie theaters don't think. This movie was not terrible but it was no better than average. The great story about young sexually immoral people should focus more on the prohibited romance and why this was ... they have to enter into it rather than hitting the face basically because the mother says we can't. Some parts should be dropped or recycled to be more important for the two main problems. Twice I was wondering if the author / director was a fan of George Graas' classic American Graffiti. It's not wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie sometimes looks like that, it means coming! The worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had a very small part, meaning double coming! He was alone, with one or two lines, who actually tried to accent to the south. (Take good listening, it was there even though his character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if he had other stars they could follow and we would have more movie sound of sound. Oh well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not a artist, too. Very bad. I generally give this B- and that's a little generous because I am part of Mrs. Amick.
