The Moon was one of the most popular movies I have seen. I was very interested in this is an example of adultery / death, and obstacles and guidelines through life. The movie shows a lot of Kei Vampire to have the power of fornication and its benefits. If you have a natural or eternal life, this is what people like. The Moon shows the pain and loss that it did not die, as the impression of the effect of losing almost all the characters especially for the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the 'Moon Child' indicates that the film is approaching the end where it is clear that everyone is a month that shines the way others, giving guidance. I have the same behavior of the film displayed. The shortage of the film is a certain part of the impact and special effects since it made the film right. The area where Toshi's behavior can be more powerful and true if most true feelings in acting were put into it. Some of the special effects such as gun shots could also be more accurate without making it seem like a video action game. The sparks generated by guns were also fake and I think that they would have been removed or stabilized. However, I think Baby Everyday should be a movie everyone should consider watching. The idea of ​​the image and the image of the cinema provided will be easy to be accepted by everyone and may be of interest to many viewers. It is a very thoughtful and fun film.
