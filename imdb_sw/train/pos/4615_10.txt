I think your people are subject to this amazing film. People see it as an ordinary movie of fear that has been set up to intimidate and prevent us from getting sleepy. Where if you tried to do then you would get 1/10 but I saw this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after Stephanie beaton all. This is why I think it is worth 10/10 for a clean films. <br /> <br /> The overall comment on this film is that it has a bad acting, a simple script which is 10 years old can produce and that can not be taken seriously and people are rating for less because of this. But I see this as an enjoyable hub ... which has a fantastic script that is made more by entertainment and executives and though it's not very bad is very entertaining.
