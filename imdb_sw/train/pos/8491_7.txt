I saw this movie when it was new. Later I hired Japan after being here three years, I was afraid I could improve when I looked at it with the sharpness of my increased international experience. The movie was so surprised by how accurately shows the collision culture between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I came from). Not all things are transparent, but the voice is perfect. I am still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this film with its handed-to-side treatment in the story. Interestingly, although Japanese and American actors spoke Japanese in the past, talks have been found again in the Japanese edition to cover the obvious problems of second-language delivery. I saw one viewer uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what you expect from the encounter with Japan by watching this movie than reading "strong" books on this issue (many of which are written in the 80s and funded by Japanese propagandi companies). <Do not be distracted by hitting the flat for the average rating caused by a star star who, among other things, felt that it would not agree that the Japanese would like to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese makes many industries to be close to customers and avoid the friction of business.) This is a very hot and wonderful movie that I would like to rate is not for a few of the 80 clichÃ©s, like playing for almost cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been a funnier.
