Making a break from his refugee who fled in the 80's, Steven Spielberg led Whoopi Goldberg to deal with Alice Walker's "The Color Purple", about the great life of an African woman and America in the 1930s. this is the woman who had a star in the movie as "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that can be simple - no, do it INAWEA - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Training. There is one area that can be the best work to edit that has been on the screen (you will know when you see it). I can't believe that this did not conquer Oscar; may be the second film of Spielberg behind the "Schindler List" (perhaps even tied to it). Also played by Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia, and Laurence Fishburne.
