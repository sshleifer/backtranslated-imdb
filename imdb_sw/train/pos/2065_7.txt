The fearful symmetry is a good place with several mistakes. The first thing about the event is that it is done near the Mount Air Mountain Base on the southwest side of Idaho. The 'Deep Throat' Season takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in the southwest Idaho. I wonder if the power of the air is one and the same but they decided to use the real name in the fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good conversation, always together. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, former school teachers. They should have loved children at one time, you can not only imagine how. As he must be more concerned with the animals at the same time. I liked the idea of ​​the period, but I felt different. If visitors are able to capture people and bring them safely back, why can't they put the animal in the right place? And visitors now have problems with returning animals? I don't know Mulder theory of the problem and continue over time. If he is an expert on that. I also thought the performance of Jayne Atkinson as Willa Ambrose was not done well. In addition to these nitpicks, I still enjoyed this part because of the fascinating concept of visitors of the DNA of animals with human DNA.
