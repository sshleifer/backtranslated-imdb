I can't remember many details on the show, but I remember how I was interested in that and how I decided not to forget any events. Unfortunately at that time we did not have a VCR, so I have never seen a series again. However, I can remember how I felt when I looked and how happy I was always. Sam Waterstone was my famous actor today (I think I was almost in love) and continues to be one of my favorite day actors, especially because of his appearance in the series. I would like to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to a good height so I could see again and repeat childhood long gone ... any ideas? Does anyone know the site released in a series or has tape events from their first transfer?
