Perhaps the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best movies, but I think everyone will agree with me that fighting with the shops is one of the best fights to fight. There were also unprecedented stunts, which were very surprising that make this film normal. This film has led to a lot of practical movies and I think that today's film actors should learn from this film (if they can fix it, make me with modern technology that can make them better). There were also popular scenes that made this film enjoyable even when Jackie did not fight. Althou I think they could put more fighting events in this film.
