Watching the film was very good and the film is lighter but the end of the film will not be expected that lasts a lasting thought in the mind of a person. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Abhay and its work being a witness during the registration marriage. Soha comes for marriage and her partner does not, leaving Soha alone on the road she does not know to return home and have nothing to live here in this situation Abahy returns to be her assistant, this is the basis of the story. Some are seen only by the end of the story is the sweetest sweet that Abhay faces with which puts you on the seat. Talk and music are good songs are good patterns are good and so as the screen you feel that the movie is slow but looking for the story needs is the same. It looks especially for lighting conditions I enjoyed this home with coke and nuts. My rating for this is 8/10
