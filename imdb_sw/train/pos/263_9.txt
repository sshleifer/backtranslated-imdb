This was the power of Poirot / Suchet, a secret selection of television. The characters were clear and did well. The program and the main set - the hostel of students - were the best. Japp was not something special but for me it did not bother the story. One important feature, many Poirot viewers do not recognize good behavior or good behavior. I also think they are sharp in their secret sentences of Poirot. Finally, I have read a few of Christie's novels - not even in recent years - and I feel that the anger of many viewers is interested in changes from the novel. Please, viewers, consider what was shown to you on the film, not what you think should be. That said, the Poirot secrets differ in quality, but not as inspectors and voters could believe. With the exception of the exceptional Pigs of Pigs in the plot, character and themes, Poirot's long films are not good or bad. For record, I have seen many films of Poirot / Suchet. Finally, the film without Lemon, Hastings, and / or Japp is neither good nor bad because of the absence. There is a presence, however, is obtrusive (almost always with Japp) or worthless with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
