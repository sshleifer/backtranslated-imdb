Imagine what the school would be like in a world like this: children are one big group that has a very good taste in music and unite against headmen and bad teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" is done in the world. It's like the Ramones live. All characters are as innocent, innocent and charming like Ramones songs, and music itself is, of course, wonderful. Comedies of secondary schools have been further changed over the years, if you compare the film as "the American Pie" with this classic late 70, where no sexual jokes are made entirely. Since remake appears at work, it is possible to expect that the charm of nature will be lost along the way and will be implemented by the dick's dick, half-funny, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that Ramones can not be changed. They were a full band of this film and no one else could even get close and take their place. Therefore, the best thing to do is to leave alone alone, such as quirky and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
