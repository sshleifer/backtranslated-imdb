I first saw this film about 21 years ago when it was ITV (before the cable days and satellite) Matin√©e. I was in school with groups and I was completely locked in the film. I have been buying a video for 10 years and I want to get a copy of the DVD. David Niven is my best actor all the time and I think it's travesty that he was on top often when Oscars came around. I also think the queen should have knighted as made very easily to the cinema industry if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. how the film turns out from black to white to the color and back again made well by the film has the stellar actors like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and the early appearance from Richard Attenborough.
