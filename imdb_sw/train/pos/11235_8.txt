It's done well, and with a "new journey" is a great continuation! Fab see James Cawley in the latest section "Vigil" Check out! <br /> <br /> I love growing qualities, and I think we have a good chance for TV actors on a piece produced by a fan. This period may feel good, as they say about ste, has improved over years and experience and hope for more experience, powerful script editor, and when taking time with CGI which HF would like to be more amazing than it is already! <br /> <br /> Good job for all involved! <br /> <br /> (I have a great soft spot for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT acting), although I 'm already!' Shelby's great (like little uptight) and it's cool got the ship. Flintstone, but they do not have a strong wind commander and he has also enjoyed himself.Dawi, Adviser, and Rawlins are equal to money in front of me, such as WONDERFUL Nechayev (is a good emphasis - REAL Russian! He gets a voting for me, and CGI is kewl. Some green screens, but for a small budget whaddayagonndo ?: /> <br /> I really enjoy it! it's not good but it's fan-and so allowed to be different-sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay Norton'd to be too thick (Graham Norton'd to be shy.) Trek doesn't pay attention to that hetero couple so why gay and snogging homosexuals? You don't have to show the sex of a person to this level - I hope they reduce it and b but Aster & Zen should be a signless people - I don't treat my friends of the opposite sex, They are just normal. <br /> Music is a mixed package. I can tell you all the things of Trek OST and many functions, but time can fall flat now and then (at the end of "Worst Worst Part 2" is missing and destroying, and edit. Love facts using "Galaxy" Quest for "music!" /> <br /> I certainly can't wait any more! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never stop, never horizontally!"
