A typical Clausen film, but it is no longer unusual. Clausen writes, leads and plays one of the leading roles. That is a very good film about ordinary people living a normal life trying to do better. 4 key actors were amazing. Fritz Helmut was persuading them. You believe that he is quite sick. Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is a real actress, but seems to be the best nurse to take care of an old man. Everybody has problems with those who do not believe he ends up having fun. But nothing good comes easy, they should fight to win their lives and love.
