Lovely car. Often a short laugh, shop and pub events were pregnant - laughing without control. The characters are recognized and the conversation has been well thought - I know people like this! Humor is an amazing gentle and film (this may seem strange) to put me in the mind of the Comedy Ealing. It is a small film with lots of information. Certainly takes several views. I have watched it a few times (I have been showing all my friends!) And look something new every time - a bit of discussion, something I didn't have to take before. I can get very good and get a few shortcomings in the film but I'm not going because it is generally a great fun, a feel-good film that is really worth looking at and which a person with a sense of humor should enjoy. It's a film that will find friends and I hope there's a lot out there. Oh .... and has a great voice.
