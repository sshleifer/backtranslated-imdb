I disagree with "ctomvelu" about the talent of Jim Belushi. I happen as a very Belushi. True, I was worried when he first appeared in the area, because I was a big fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm-screen that has got far too far - and has developed well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of its original films - its weight is givingaway (not true to most of us?) - and I like the film. Yes, there is touch and exciting, so if you are driving a car, blast and improper sex, then you might want to pass this - it's a hot film of three lost soles that finds each other. Do not make a mistake, I am with the three keys mentioned earlier on a successful film, but I also love good stories, strong like this. <br /> And though Belushi and Kelly Lynch provide the best performances, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter - who is really good. I don't know what happened to his work, but who is responsible for leaving the ball (a parent's agent??) should be shot. You can't ask for a more complete introduction of popularity than this film, and yet nothing of note has been heard from him since. <br /> <br /> Another sad story of Hollywood ...
