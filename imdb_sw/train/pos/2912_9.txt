We move around the "star" way in a very small way these days, but here is one worthy. <br /> <br /> I had glued on this show all this. Song selection was perfect - it had songs that I wanted to hear and reject pictures of the new songs. I liked that the band was only five people on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With this powerful songs, you do not need a circus to be valid) <br /> <br /> The crowds of the crowd were wonderful, too. What? How many artists can affect the original fans of Beatles (now in their 50s and more), get small children to jump on the "Unable to Buy Love" lines and affect everyone in the middle? During the watch, I realized that after the death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney immediately became a follower. Paul was not the only one who lost John and George (regardless of their last relationship they had, it must be hard to lose someone who changed the world), but also lost his wife Linda and never found to create the recognition of Lennon's murder. I agree that Lennon's murder was terrible, but only now I knew that Paul was a kind of forgotten in that situation. I was so happy that she again found love for Heather. For those who complain about sound / video quality, I have no complaints; all were exposed on my set. I think these people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the second structure comes out; they never have satisfaction. <br /> <br /> My regret just didn't buy a ticket to this show when I had a chance. Thanks to this video I was enjoying. People remember John Lennon, they will remember his first murder and then his music. Now I have a new thanks to Paul McCartney, because, if nothing, he will be remembered for his first music. And let's look at other desires will not change this, because McCartney's list is very good.
