Featuring the amazing performance and Will Smith with a story that comes to your heart more difficult than a guitar player in the middle of the solo, "Second seven" society changed the old co-director and actor (Pursuit of Happiness), flick which I loved too. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his movies can fly unintentionally if the mergers are connected to the project is not too high. It is not bad I have decided to Will Smith's plan early, I put both and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first place and area when the character of Rosario Dawson is introduced as having an incurable heart -disease . <br /> <br /> However, I still think the author / director made the right choice to set the bookends (bookends is the first and last scene) that way, it is a quick source and tension in the movie, finding step by step how one can be sent to the last sacrifice, and it was amazing to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character growing and growing, knowing behind the mind always kept for these unhappy two One of my friends who I saw the movie thought Smith's behavior might be and the divine gifts, and I understand why: his performance is close to the angels during the presence of the seven chosen ones, however sometimes he could be fierce and terrible, and when he alone t he the full weight of his situation got very much for her and she broke completely. It's a really good performance. Finally, I can't forget to mention again the accidental location of the accident, which had been deliberately designed for movies connected to music. Keep this on your list.
