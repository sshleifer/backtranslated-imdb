He had put this in my TIVO on the rainy day because of the cast, other hardworking people in the industry, and when I finally looked I had no desire. This film has a taste of Altman (he is mentioned in the last features as a "thank you") using the seemingly independent lines of a plot that resembles a film approaching its climax. Macy is clean, clean, and honest as a person who can't seem to escape "finally" her, Sutherland shows and shows as few can, Neve adds a deliberate increase to the lower environment, adding Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission Impossible on TV?) , Not to mention John Ritter and you have all the good FILM features. The script has not been opened, the conversation is not open from the photo and the focus (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). To stop faith and enjoy, this is when it is properly used.
