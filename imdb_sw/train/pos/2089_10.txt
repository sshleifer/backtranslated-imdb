"Good World" is a good movie that hears a lot about again. There are many disasters and major events, but it is also a love story of love. All of this happens for a short time more than two hours, which are concise with today's standards. Special effects and clothing are very good for the period. I wonder that Luise Rainer received Oscar for such a role. Basically only has three emotions: presentation, hungry, and heart-broken. Exhibitions and actors in Asia and Asia-America are severe. <br /> <br />
