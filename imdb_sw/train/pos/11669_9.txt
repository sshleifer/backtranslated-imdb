Be an example of the first movie of Errol Flynn's adventure and have a good story with two brilliant brilliant stars in Maureen O'Hara (it's a beautiful beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all who have even love it A little for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood for the best!
