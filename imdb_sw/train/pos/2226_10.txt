I am amazed at the lowest IMDb of this movie. With all the basic respect, its low rating is a representative of the IQ level of those who measured it to be poor. They love to see movies and cheap items, a big budget, and more than a prison. The first bad way of people is that this is a terrible movie. It is not, neither has the film deceived you in believing it is one. It is a psychological thriller. It is for people who want mental experience when watching the film. Reel.com review is a perfect example of how I feel about this movie. Other inappropriate reviews are not so important. It's almost like trying to make the original film for the change - it is not available today - it's something wrong and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal some vendors for morons who said it was boring and didn 's mean. Martha had intellectual intelligence and experimented on herself as a caring mother when she was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that in the first look, we sympathize with this cold monster's blood for the duration of the movie is an agreement with the film's guide and writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should at least be counted at the 6th level of originality alone. I recommend this movie to people at the other end of the IQ people - they became intelligent people - since this film seems to be concerned with those who would like to watch the Scream or Nightmare's Freddy. <br /> <br /> Kudos for acting as well. With a low budget film, you are surprised that this film did not hit your local movies and great leadership, writing, and acting. Please not be deleted by rating by IMD. This movie has its value. I actually recommend buying a film since the first look at the tax will not do this right.
