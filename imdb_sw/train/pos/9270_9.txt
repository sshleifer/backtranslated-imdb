I know, before reading this review, since there is no way, this is a statement against the Iranian people ... if you want to read something in it, than in hope you see, that I am against politicians in general ... have doubts ... I can't help you! It is not in Iran as this film is banned there (see IMD announcement for this movie). Which is a shame, because the film is good. Not for "Grbavica", this film would have won the International Film Festival in Berlin. Certainly (it was a driver, or a second place if you were). Why? Because it's a movie about repression. Not even this is a complete issue of women. It's about the government trying to keep people down. A very clear example that the government saw the need to ban the movie. But to ban nothing is solved and / or can make this film disappear! Another viewer had a good summary of the verse: "He loves a tragedy on the tragedy", which writes very well!
