Paul (Jason Lee) is a member who only happens to cooperate with a king-named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his placement party, Paul gets a little drunk and somehow has gone to take a good dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back to his digs. "Nothing happened", as they say, but duo wake up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen's phone. He goes to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul removes Becky out of the area, although his kids are lagging behind. But, there is even more joy in the future. At dinner at home of Karen's parents, Paul runs Becky again, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some to explain what to do! But, instead, Paul chooses the stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. What? Karen will see that Becky spent the night in Paul's place? And, what will the result be? Sorry for critics with pan like this. They should definitely shine, since this film is clean and fun. Of course, it does not hurt the things that Lee is a very interesting person, Stiles are a good beauty or that Blair is natural as a beautiful but original fianc√©e. Other cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, are also very good. The appearance of the film is amazing, such as clothing and California settings. Better, the script is of thinking and has led, and very interesting to the audience. In short, if you want to attract the funny proverbial performances, get this film tonight. It may be the material of the Academy of the Academy Award but it is absolutely sure to turn the bad day into getting a good one.
