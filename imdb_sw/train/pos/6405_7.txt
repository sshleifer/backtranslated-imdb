I thought that discrimination and discrimination against Carl Brashear was more advanced for the effect of Hollywood. I don't believe U. S. Navy had ever been the most racist. I can't imagine a full Captain, an Attorney Officer, telling his Master for giving it to anyone. Certainly not at risk of his life. And there has never been a Chief Executive Officer as a hatred for everyone but WASPs as a DeNiro character. There is no drunkard and drunkard as he played, he could rise up to the Chief Teacher's first place. Cuba Gooding has not kept the film wrong.
