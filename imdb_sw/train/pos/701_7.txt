I did not know what except so I think it was better to not save a lot. Do not get my mistakes not a bad movie. Tess Nanavati is a new guide with the author so I think he deserves a lot of kudos to make this film. You can say that it has been an act of love for her. Acting (out of Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of the film is not great either but with the film under its good budget. There were times when the line of the story gets judged and there are places that link, although I don't feel that it is too restrictive to the ability of someone to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as I do, I say go to that. Gag reel was fun, I can not destroy it but there is a certain area that makes you buy a DVD worth only so that you can watch it regularly. If you love the film then see the Pink Mirror, the film is also made by Jagged Edge. I know Dominic fans will enjoy a little piece of heaven.
