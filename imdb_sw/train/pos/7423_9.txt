I recently watched the '54 version of this film with Judy, and when I appreciated the story and music, I found that the film did not look for it. I expected 'remake '76 to be the same story, except for the loss of Barbra. I was very surprised - it was a real and modern look of fame, money, love and the price of all. This version is more realistic than '54 one, and better music, better acting, more promoting line, and, of course, deep love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the top of the US Institute, while this promotion remake cannot make a mark on any defendant list.
