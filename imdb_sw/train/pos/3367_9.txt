This film has a good actor, a beautiful picture and a powerful line of story that makes you think who, how you identify yourself, how you come in, if you agree to play or stop free ... There is already a better comment dealing with these things. I want to comment on the official set of films. Basically, it is two people on the roof. There is a unity of place and time, with 2 characters, and the radio makes like a drawing. Many directors have turned into Greek events that the film, many directors have made modern stories like the Greek epidemic, but no director, in my opinion, has succeeded as Ettore Scola in close proximity to the purity and strength of the major Greek tragedies in the story line and to keep officially. The masterpiece.
