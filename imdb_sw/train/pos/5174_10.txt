I swear that I could watch this film every weekend of my life and never never bother it! Every aspect of human sensitivity is taken so hard and acting, script, direction, and general sense of this film. It has been a long time since I saw a movie that actually made me laugh from laughter, reflecting sadness, and feeling every feeling that is coming through this excellent job! We need more MOVIES like this !!! Mike Binder: listen to ???
