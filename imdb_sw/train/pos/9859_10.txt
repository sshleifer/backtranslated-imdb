Ice Age is not just an annual animation (in my eyes) is also the best feature of animation I've ever seen! Teaser was interesting last year and I have spent many hours of fun on the site. Scrat is cool! And so are some of the little Zero heroes. <br /> <br /> Animation is very good. Your heart goes to the characters in this film. They have a good line of dialogue and planted well. It's hard to say who stole the picture. I saw their journey with laughter, tears and surprise. Nothing was forced or done. Feelings were real, especially in the second half of wonder. The last film affecting this detail was Anastasia in 1997, also the Fox production. And before that was the Land Before Time 1988. All have a real charm and seek to entertain all the audience, not just those who are not concerned. 10/10 <br />
