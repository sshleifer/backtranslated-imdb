I never read the Shakespeare Hamlet before I watched it but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the conversation through it. My view on the movie can be discriminated because I have never read to play before, but I've pulled into an appreciation for this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who have ever lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. But now in the film ... \ t Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet are not compared to Kenneth Branagh and King. What I liked about this was that it worked well as "MOVIE" and not like playing it. You don't need to be useful with Shakespeare to engage with all the hammer of pain that should go through. I would like to recommend this film to many viewers. It is my two cents.
