I first saw these years of films during Cinemax Friday after a series of darkness (back when the cable box was built as a keyboard), and thank me. Although there is no point in the film is taken well. The Depardieu & Dewaere exhibition is very interesting. not the US), as it seems to feel things like violence, theft, and casual sex. This movie proves that with talented talented and talented leading movie stars is a good movie regardless of the issue. I was worried about Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and in the future I would look at him with Depardieu & Miou -Miou in getting your Hankerchief.
