Diane Keaton gave the best performance in this sad but mysterious story involving a few young people and their dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "Stone Family", '05' who had a daughter alone and loved her more than words can describe. He called him all the time and told him, "Surrender Dorothy", which was the words used in the 'Wizard of Oz', 1939. A car accident suddenly occurs and Natalie gets so much with her friends and lovers. As Natalie examines, the more she sees about her and her true relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially all the good work from all support supporters.
