I don't know "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is a graphic novel? I really do not know), but I must admit, hear about agent / hero movie, I expect something completely different, than what I got. Though it was amazing to view this for the first time, it was good to look at this argument together. You can never tell him where you would go (some twists appear, but in general, you can never say, it would end his going). More stellar performance from leading actress and real good help, make this look enjoyable. It is not as full as others can expect or expect for such a film, but a very good mix.
