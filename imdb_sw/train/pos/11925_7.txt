I happened to find this movie on a single afternoon cable. I agree that I have never been a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good film related to sports. I found it more interesting was the model of the family's development program. As a professional who has seen the good and bad mental health of the community and the system of development, I was very happy to see a film that showed both up and down this system: people jump from family to family, biological parents do not always take the participation of work, and changes that may have an exciting heart and mixing the heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are an anchor of this film, and all brings very reliable performances. Perhaps it was just my emotional state, but I found myself in tears at the end of the film.
