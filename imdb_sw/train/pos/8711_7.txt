It is more than my understanding that many trash from Norway is planned for the release of the DVD, and still the gems like these get shot in restoring their old glory. I offer this 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films made on Norwegian television. This film is not subject to a historical gem which in many ways reflects the first foreign film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Does Ridley Scott or anyone in the staff have seen a series of mini? Yet it is impossible, the fact remains that the events are very similar. Well, the budget is under the Norwegian film, but as a result, it is a very good job since the age of the Norwegian decision-making, which for a long time continued until the 90s.
