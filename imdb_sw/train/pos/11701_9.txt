This is a good movie for All Generation X'ers. What a different world in 1972 compared to our psychological age of 21. You can find the meaning of America's last 1972 and was like watching this film. I found that the dress and car styles have brought me a better memory of the country than it is now. Thinkâ€¦ back there were only four or 5 TV channels selected. There was no AIDS, Islamic terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Birds Flu, Snipers to Give Way, etc., etc.. The Vietnam War was just over. There will be 7 years before Star Wars will come out. Private computers and internet will still be 29 years. So it began to visit small Protestant churches throughout the country shown on film developers (This was the day before VCRS of course). A church pastor who will be willing to show a thief in NIght for his congregation would get a copy of the film. Then he would start the evening to show in the meeting place of the church or lunch room. Members of the congregation could invite friends "and unsaved" to their families and would be a social event of the week. If you can adopt a low-quality film production and just look at its nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy more films. Of course I'm talking like gen xer. If I had a machine when I would like to return to 1972 and say the benefits for the 21st century we have now.
