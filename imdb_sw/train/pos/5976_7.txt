Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of the film refers to the 80's Heavy Metal and awesome movies - two things that I love so much. So, as you can imagine, this film was interesting to me. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne has a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about unidentified young high school students who, as we all lost, ended up in the world of "Evil" of Metal. Metaldude loves it and, of course, has been raised with a miracle - to play his latest unused album. This allows the singer to go around to kill people with demons and sh * t to help. Well, it's very fun when, but you know what? It has an amazing number of good reputation. Good acting (including Gene Simmons as DJ radio), a very good good effect, very short, beautiful environment ... For all, it's really a good film. But what is interesting is music. Surprise, huh? In fact, this "uber-evil" Metal guy is one of the most amazing, high-pitched, right, Motley Crue refuses on the planet - and "Metal" is slightly more than a putrid of 80 / Metal Metal Metal. He blows all the pictures here, from walking around like a gay fairy, looking for meaning, shouting "Rock and Roll !!!" at a high enough to make King Diamond retch. In addition to non-emotional music representation, in fact it is very good. 7/10 www.ResidentHazard.com
