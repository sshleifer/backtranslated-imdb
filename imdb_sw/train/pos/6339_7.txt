The Grinch section was released to Jim Carrey and I was very impressed by his performance. I was not a big fan of his mother I was worried but very surprised by the results. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Nani The little girl I saw on the screen for a long time and showed maturity over her years in her acting skills. I was crying one time! I've never read Dr Seuss's book of the story so I didn't know what to expect, humor was quite dark. In general, I enjoyed the film (away from the songs!) And it would suggest, by looking at the family especially.
