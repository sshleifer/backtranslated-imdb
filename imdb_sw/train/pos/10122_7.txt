I found this hard to follow in a way that seemed to speak in the middle when I tried to make the head or tail of who fought and why. One of the problems is culture / one language. Here we have a problem of Chinese / Taiwan / Japanese which we know little and just because we read English lessons without a course without opening some trick. Another problem is that it appears to be only half of the half described twists and coincidences. However, it seems unlikely that there is a very bad movie of the movie and this is not true. A lot of stylish and sex-based disorder, a window on sexual acts of religious sexuality and a family element. All in good trips but maybe check out the story can really help before watching this.
