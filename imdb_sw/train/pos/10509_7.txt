I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is different from that; The fact that I am more excited about this, despite the fact that this is not my kind, leads me to the decision not to read the book. After reading one word for Austen, I can't compare this with any work of his work. What I can say is almost every line of dialogue in this is clever, confident, and well delivered, with the main source of comedy in this. This made me laugh loudly, with British equipment and full words. Each acting acting is a spot-over, and Paltrow completely nails the match match match. The characters are well written, reliable and consistent. I have seen a couple of them very irritating, however, and when I think that at least some of these were meant to be interesting, it was interesting to repeat a lot, and faithfully did not have the first time they were seen. The layout and movies are amazing, and everything is perfectly visible. Plot and pacing are good, you have never been bored. It takes in the way * true *, but perhaps this is what the audience of this prefers. I can't claim that this is not pleasing to me, it did from the beginning to the end, and I would like to look at it again. There is a short language here. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10
