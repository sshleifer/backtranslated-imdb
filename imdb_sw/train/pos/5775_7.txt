Yes, people! LOL! I remember seeing this film Saturday Saturday Night Features Features for years ago. It is a good monster, very happy with a bad act with two wonderful mountains that enhances the aspect of schlock. Boy 2 of the boat's boat boat is a movie! LOL, and you will love the boat area where the English boy and his wife are talking about all the stars and day and sun. Bloody blood! You can tell them they were not worried about the plot, they just wanted to beat the film film as quickly as possible. Below, you will like it if you like 70 sand.
