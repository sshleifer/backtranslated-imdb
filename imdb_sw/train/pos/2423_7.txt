Once in Life means that once hoodlum, always hoodlum, and no one comes in or from 'Life' for free. A nearby park in New York sells drugs and run because they can't do it in a legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they are just lazy. This simple story and many walks about many innumerable characters can take pity on the audience for its great players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, developed, and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who is also the star as Mike 20/20 (all of the hoodlums have names), and is the basis of his play, 'Riff Raff. It feels like playing from beginning to end, especially during the long-term area where three players of the square take off to decide who can be trusted. Often the conversation comes very fast, faster than it is, and I think it's a great flaw of the film. A mixture like publications in the film is poetry from the street, a type of rap of the iambic pembetameter, which is a violent and passionate world of this movie unfolds. Poems make it difficult to evict these people, hoodlums who kill, cheat, and betray, as unworthy of our attention or under our contempt. The worst thing about this film is that its origin does not only show how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reason that all of us do. One is very foolish, another junk, and the last finds a conscience when the audience is wondering, or even laughing, because of the killers who want to rely on the forest to tell him a joke in his loss.
