I enjoyed this first with the director of Pete, Hideo Nakata. If you have seen the Ring before you will be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this flick. It has a subtle deception on it which works better than regular (and predictable) strokes that affect many of these movies. If you love films that give ulcers, then maybe you would like this. Good start, bright and Hideo Nakata. 8/10
