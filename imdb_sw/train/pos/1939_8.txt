I don't know why I have chosen this movie to watch, has a strange head and from the details that looks like something different. Every time in its time it is best to try a film that is a little different from the usual opportunity of the hero / awesome film of Hollywood and this film was certainly different. From the beginning this film has been interesting to me but I could not think why until the end of the film I realized that the movie was good because the characters were real. I thought the act was very good and the development of behavior made them care for them and hope for things to end for them. I think everyone who looks at the film in some way is associated with one of the characters and this makes it a great look and some good laugh for the beauty of the participants. At the end of the movie you get a sense of well-being, and it's left with 'the same things' kind of feeling. I am sure this will have a great appeal and should be given a chance.
