It's not good when you write a comment, so I'll be able to comment on ... <br /> <br /> I liked this series for the first time. Adventure, action, comedy, game ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth most important person in the cast. It's not a great deal. But when his behavior (General Hammond) disappeared at the end of the seventh season, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from farm to office, the quality of the series fell suddenly. I don't know whether because Hammond was the most important thing I discovered or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series has turned to ****. The first seven times, though, were amazing. Stargate of the film was the first time I saw it, but it was, even though this was not a natural intention, to introduce a brilliant in the series. I recommend that you look at the first film, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the film again (you will have a new experience for the next time, you believe me), and then look at the other television series. The last three seasons of the series are not nearly seven, but that does not mean that they are not good. It means that they are destroyed if you have been destroyed by the first seven seasons. After completing this series, make sure you watch the spin series, Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy heir of this brilliant series. TODADIA on 7-18-08: I found that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a great loss.
