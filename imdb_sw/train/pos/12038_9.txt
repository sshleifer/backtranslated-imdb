Yes, a real true! That is the UK's regulation of all, the originality and the small use of special effects (and on the budget). I saw at the end of this spectacle at the end of the British TV show of destruction in 1994. It really should be viewed by everyone who loves a conspiracy, no big names but not under good work. if this drama is impossible to be opened any time soon. I have recently given a Woman In Black on VHS, so now once again I will enjoy this realistic UK game. You should try and enjoy too! Mark R. Horobin
