I eventually got into the DVD book to get the movies I didn't find in the stores. I chose Souler Striker because I love Christopher Meloni, and also as small films, which are often ignored. <br /> <br /> This is a treat! Meloni has the same charm in this section. It is easy for the pigeon hole you alone to see him as his foot Elliot Stabler (LOSS). In this film, Meloni is out of the most unusual mid-stage that hits skid in many ways, but finding a happy way for the unexpected. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is true and has not been done. I haven't seen Busfield since 30 hours, and was happy to watch. But it was all of Chris's film. I was a girl like a fan again. It is slowly beginning, I will accept it. I thought some "buttons" can be edited. But in general, this film will enjoy you - a man or a woman - because it has a sense of honesty, enjoyment of relationships today.
