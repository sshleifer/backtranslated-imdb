This is a gory aggressive and very influential. Corbin Bernson is a great command of this movie with its photographic photographs of a professional control of the exhibition. Linda Hoffman has his wife to cheat and she is very easy to eye - unfortunately for her, a little "tryst" and a boy brings a severe punishment for a good doctor knows well - embarrassed on that nice smile! The last hour of the movie is devoted to Bernson's character completely losing and watching it falls on a little actress named Virginya Keehne. The most talented artist, locks the limelight from the time of braces comes out. Good feet, too!
