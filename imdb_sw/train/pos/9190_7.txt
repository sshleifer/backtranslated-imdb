With Tony being seriously injured, two things happen: Tony sees himself leading the life of a businessman who attended a business meeting, when his family and friends have gone into hell trying to cope with the loss of a possible person. The dream system is right out of the former TWILIGHT ZONE, as Tony finds himself changing the moderate Joe while trying to deal with a poor-to-pack mixer during a business trip. His exhibition as schnook of blazer-and-wearing more in the middle of America and under that Italian from Noo Joisey. Good touch. AJ's wonderful-haired-hippy-dippy AJ (which Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one time) has a good place with his old elder. The best time with boys trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately decreases in the national crisis. The gem goes out of the new Gene's death might have been a bedroom case, which is interesting for what we learn to learn about gems.
