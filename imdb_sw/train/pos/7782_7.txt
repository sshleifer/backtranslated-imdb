photography was good but I had difficulty understanding what was happening ... there were many marks? ... 2 goldfishes - does it mean something in Thai culture? there are no many conspiracy, not many happen and only meanders. no real beginning, no real middle and no real end. instead of really exciting. It was difficult to get into characters if you never felt you knew ... it was difficult to know the scenes were imaginary and which was real. The argument felt uncomfortable and emerged. I don't know what the brothers of pang were expecting to achieve. Maybe if I am Thai it will mean more ...
