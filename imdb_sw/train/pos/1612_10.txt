This film stands on the head and shoulders on most movies of movies. It's almost entirely! Writing, acting, designing, humor and all pathos are amazing! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is interesting and interesting! Every character is fun and memorable, from heads selected by Cher and Nicolas Cage, for many support tasks - - Olimia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even his grandfather and dog ! Each of these artists, along with Norman Jewison as Director, does on their common quality in this joint work. For a number of actors, this was a great film show, so we also have the most exclusive - and we have current power stations that have their work changed and their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film several times all the way - which can sometimes delete the results of the film significantly. More surprisingly, I realized several years ago that every time I channel-surfed my way into the scene from this film - any location - the area was forcing and beautifully crafted. There are many amazing and memorable events of the original meeting between Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage says his story of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour in opera, in the center of the glory produced by his trade of gold pipes; Olympic Dukakis told John Mahoney to fight with his pupil in the classic line of relationships with his colleagues: "Don't worry where you are sick!" Danny Aiello in his mother's bed of death; Nicolas Cage "take" Cher as stuck to the aria grows back! There are many romantic voices, among them Sabrina (two versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> Not even the Moonstruck!
