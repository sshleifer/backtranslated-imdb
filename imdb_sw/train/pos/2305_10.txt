I thought this was a very good movie. It would be nice to see a little more on the film about 2 sisters to know about everyone who loves the boy before being killed. I am sure if the film has been done this way it would have a very long end, that's why this film was very good. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers that you can find everything and that if you are two sisters involved with a boy, (one boy) who works with pain and harm makes things easier and easier to work between 2 of them . It is good to see love stories that have an unpleasant thing in someone's life that you can still get closer to more. I enjoyed watching this film, and I'm still doing it now. I seem to be looking at all the time. It would have been better if it had been part 2 for this movie, maybe having a great sister to come and have her baby, this would have been the end of the story since she died, this way she would survive even though she was dead.
