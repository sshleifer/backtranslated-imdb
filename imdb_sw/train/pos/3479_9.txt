This show began with many private sessions. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show started playing short periods with Shaggy, Scooby doo, and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had a 20-minute change in short periods. Some voice actors did not catch. After 15 or 16 events, Frank Welker (who played Fred) was not there. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 events, because the first executive voice who played Velma is not available. And the web ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to make the shortest with Shaggy, Scooby doo, and Scrappy Doo, because testing was high. So they had to make more caps. I would have been hidden as 15 sessions. It's still a good show.
