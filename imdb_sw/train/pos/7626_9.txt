I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I am still wondering how Kurt Russell shows Elvis precisely, under his direction and words on his face. Sometimes she fears how she looks, does, and speaks like real Elvis. This thanks is given on the DVD, so all of us have been waiting for finally to have the best quality of the full length of the film. I have heard opponents, who say there is some accuracy, or some things have been left out, but I think I remember that John Carpenter had only 2/2 hours to work with, and that this was shown on television (just two years after death of Elvis!) that did a good job with this. In fact I haven't seen another Elvis movie that even comes next to this. It is highly recommended.
