"Hot Millions" is a well-written, effective story about a player who steals (whoops! - a very low class word for striker, according to the leadership of Peter Ustinov) "a million fire" from the London branch of the United States. create shell organizations on the continent and use a secure computer to transfer money to them. (Remember, the police's spoiler, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Starting in 1968, this movie's movie can seem to be worried for many more computer users; but as a person who has worked with a computer since before this film was released, I would say that however, this is faced with being written and for non-reading computers, perhaps for the purpose of enhancing the combinations of the droll's flick of this UK. If someone has a little taste for this type of entertainment, the film may appear coming to the ads. Fortunately, it has the finish-bound finish; unfortunately, the last credit does not provide the classical music used in it - a piece of symphonic at the end and the duet of the piano-flute in the middle - just a song called Lulu that I don't remember at all.
