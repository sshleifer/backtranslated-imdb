Prisons are not always available during the discussion of the best eight-year films, and there is good reason to be because they are not one of the best ... but if you are looking for old films that have ten years to give, this is certainly among the best of small / small films. The movie has a relationship with the blockers; at the beginning is the initial leadership effort for Renny Harlin; A good director behind several practical films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and the second we have the first chance to the Lord of the star star Viggo Mortensen. The movie is not original but the plot line is interesting. We take into account the prison that has been opened after several years. This was a prison in which one person named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being created by the prison governor. Normally, the soul of the dead person is not resting in peace; and when the opening room is opened, the spirit of the death document has already redeemed. <br /> <br /> The movie is not exactly the Shawshank Liberation, but it takes care to create its characters and when the main stage of the film is always a panic, the prison game behind all makes on an interesting basis. This is also good for other reasons beyond the basic premise, the film does not actually 'plot' to go and we only rely on cooperation between characters to put things interesting. The horror of the film is often bad but has never been over, which may actually be the reason for this film rarely remembered, presented in the additional ten years. The killings themselves are good and thoughtful, however, and give some important things. As the film goes on, we begin to explain more in the past story of the guilt of revenge and when it is interesting, other things about it don't matter and it draws the little film. Still, everything comes to an exciting peak and in general I must say that Prison is a film worth tracking down.
