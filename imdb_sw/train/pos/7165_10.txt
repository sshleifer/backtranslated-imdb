I have written these years ago but only I got round to look at it today. I have been sick so I had gone out of things to watch! I am very happy to see it, and which I could erase my memory and look again for the first time. This movie is very amazing! It reminds me of the Fried Green Tomatoes at Cafe Whistlestop. <br /> <br /> The story goes back and the end of the film we see what it is. Some people have said this is a children's movie. I don't accept it - it can be done by Disney and many characters are children, but I'm 23 and I liked it! There was a time when my back was hit. The story is different from any other film these days, full of adventure. I have ordered the book from amazon, I can't wait!
