I have seen this film for the second time on television. It is interesting, warm, emotional, very romantic. I have often seen practitioners who can reveal their movements and kiss to another - Pastor Pastor, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson just out of their own. Masterson probably has a difficult role and is simply pleasing. The film is in the line of all the romantic movies such as When You Are In Ulala, When Harry Met Sally, Inning in Seattle with "many kinds of movies" like Big, Back to Future, Peggy Sue is married. I hate to say this, because this was so sent out and I could never change any of them - but I think it didn't succeed as well as the above-mentioned movies because the office of the referral box was not as good as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner when the movie took place. It is not well written - for example, characters are not particularly memorable. However it is implemented in full. Sexual love can be interesting, "feelings" of people who come in love are very close, loveless love and openness of everything, a sense of loss and desire to unite that relationship, so touching released. From time to time, you will find yourself moving. True, the same movie is done in Heaven - one sexual passion. <br /> <br /> Do you see this - it's very good.
