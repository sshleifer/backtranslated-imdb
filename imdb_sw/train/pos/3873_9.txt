This movie is lighter, pleasant, and beautifully. The rain is very good, and the colors remind you of the pictures of Vermeer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun comedy in the most beautiful way, the way up to American and French levels, and indeed it's better than English too. <br /> <br /> Every character is touching, and translation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is very good, Sylvie Moreau is better than Catherine's series, Stéphane Gagnon is good, Emmanuel Bilodeau is good in the role of her weird, and Geneviève Laroche is the best friend! Keep up for hours before you get any wrong ideas on this film, so make a chance, and add your own comments.
