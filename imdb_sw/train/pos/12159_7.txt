- After their children were put in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) began to receive threatening calls because someone fell on their children and left easy. Participants decide to move to California to avoid the trial of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school which has recently succeeded. One of the students has a good father who did not have a marriage that Adelle loves quickly. At the same time, Helen is busy raising the rabbit and being too little to the publisher on the radio. It is a temporary player before everything falls and women enter the world of madness and murder. - I can't help but compare What Problems with Helen? Does anyone who dismiss Auntie Roo? Also plays with Shelly Winters. Where the movie seemed to have hampered its Auntie Roo madness presentation, there is nothing that manages Helen on this film. It can take a good deal of movie time, but once it blows, Helen is Mbaya Bad Mutha. You don't want to destroy him. Winters are very happy that said it was difficult for me to not enjoy its performance. I can't destroy the movie, but Helen's items are capable of quite high-over-over. <br /> <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds are completely ridiculous in its position as gold-tap pipe. I felt that he thought he was in a movie that would make him a nominee for some prize. This is not Kane's Citizen! Quit act very strictly. Hey, Debbie, you don't realize that you are the main purpose is to be the victim of the extraction of Winters. - I just love these-star-star-in-date-twilight-of-their-working horror movies. What's the matter with Helen? it's fun any like.
