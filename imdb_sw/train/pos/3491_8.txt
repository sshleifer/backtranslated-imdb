Release is the best, doing a good job, an interesting plot, full of doubts ... but it is difficult to complete all the elements on the film that is not recommended 80 minutes long. If more time was taken to develop a plot and planning, it would have a more positive impact. Another 30 minutes of substances would have made this very good film instead just good.
