Very good movie and true story. Dan Jansen General skater ever. Movie's touch and beautiful whole family can enjoy. Jane's story Jansens battle with cancer and Dan Jansen love her sister. The key promises made by Jansen winning gold medal confirming his sister Jane had the right to believe in her talent in skating speed was appropriate. This photo fits time. I would like to make more films of this quality. Thank you for the beautiful film and the best actors and beautiful stories. It is a very touching story of good family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their little child and sister.
