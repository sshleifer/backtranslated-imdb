"Bell and Candle Book" was recently shown on the cable. We didn't see it for a while, we decided to explore this comedy again. According to a hit by James Van Druten of Broadway, which was a Rex Harrison car and Lilli Palmer in the first five years, the film was changed to screens by Daniel Taradash. The film was led by Richard Quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Of course, based on some comments submitted by the IMD, the main issue seems to be a pairing of two stars, who was collaborating with "Vertigo", released the same year. Film artists didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released. In fact, most of the older men of the old age were always associated with younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie set by Manhattan at Christmas is a wonderful comedy that has a happy audience. Kim Novak was on her beauty as it was clear that the camera loved her no matter what she played. As a witch becomes a human, his Gillian is beautiful. James Stewart, who plays the Shep 'Henderson publisher, is also seen with all his strength. Mr. Stewart was the best comedy actor who shows here why he was over. <br /> <br /> In support of Elsa Lanchester's wonderful roles, play Queenie, is adding welcome to any movie, as she proves here. Nicky Holroyd's Jack Lemmon, the Gillian brothers, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as Sidney Radlitch. This is the best way to spend the nights at home to look at "Book Bell and Candle".
