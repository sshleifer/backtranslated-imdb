Most publications on this page say that this film is a little dark for children. That depends on the child. This is not a 2-6 year old film; is more than 8 years with many more people. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I really liked it. At that time many animation movies were very young for my taste. This movie deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In these characters of the film can DIE, and sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional stress in cases where the perpetrators endanger their lives. Good people are not always sweet and beautiful (like other cartoons). They have a real "motivation", like revenge, and greed, but also compassion and friendship; it shows that things are not black and white always. The Best Movie
