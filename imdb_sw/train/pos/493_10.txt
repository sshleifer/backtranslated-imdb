I've been a fan of Star Trek for a long time I can remember. They announced the settings and displays of the fifth series I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Business Time was worth waiting. It was done well with a perfect set and good work done by all the characters. NX-01, Enterprise is a perfect tool to show the beginning of what many people like. <br /> Scott Bakula was just as great as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave the functionality of the command as a T'Pol Subcommander. That is just two people of the wonderful new workers who have the courage to give us a great history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> Business looks like it will be a good series and you should watch, and I recommend that. See.
