This is one of my favorite two or three shorts, and of course the best efficiency of Christine McIntyre and trio. He is pretty short in short, but here he is quite brilliant. His singing is not very exciting, it is really very good, but the plot is being built in such a way that singing plays for moisture instead of smoked. We listen to McIntyre singing the volume of Spring no less than three times, but you have never been old, because we do not bother his voice, and because it mixes well with antics Stooges'. The use of soprano operation in the comedy is to remember the role of Kitty Carlisle in Marx Brothers "Night At Opera," but singing is more part of the comedy here than "Opera," and McIntyre (perhaps more in other exhibitions than here) showed the talent of The comedic of yourself which Carlisle never did. Investigating by Stooges, singing McIntyre, and a well-designed plot combines 5 stars out of 5.
