This second film is interesting as the original except that there is no doubt. We know what he will do and what will happen before it is shown on the screen. Then pleasure comes only through various tricks to occur with their series. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that will lose the wheel, that the car will have an accident, just talking about the car. And that's what happens. Now details and details are for you to discover in the film. That he can be encouraged by a dumb woman is obvious and must come but we know that he has already seen him through him and that he knows he is cursed in the trap. Now, how will he come out? That's what you should discover yourself. And don't worry that he will find a big businessman but what a story. Speed ​​boats do not match our busy beaver on the river. We also know when it will be hurt. They did not know what the bullet jackets were in those days. It was so recently discovered that some of the GI had no such equipment in Iraq. But what does the film mean? Emphasize this on the hunting of traders and this blindness that you do not see is prohibited that creates a problem. But the film is a regular and perfect model that no value is ever that can stand in the form of this legal contract against the power of evil. Why not just legalize these products so they can be considered properly and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it's not less fun to use, do it. It is prohibited or restricted. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
