I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back when even though it didn't have any special effects, acting was very good. And still has the same message today, although technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this film, it will be interesting to see remake. I also enjoyed music from the film also, Larry Norman was a very good writer at the time, although now most Christian music is now in worship and music features. I was curious about what happened to Patty after the series was completed? What? He continued to make more movies, he finally got married and promoted family? I'd like to have updates.
