This is one of the jewels that were not overlooked by Hollywood made. - A British youth who fought against WWII whose aircraft is about to fall, has a radio communication with a young American woman who comforts a brave pilot, knowing that within a minute she will be dead. For some reason someone who has already died has gone away from destruction and eventually learns that he meant to give a report in heaven. When a healer is sent to ask him to try to accompany him to heaven, someone refuses and claims to have his "day in court" to resist his case. The man says that his situation had changed at the end of his earthly life, that he had come down in love and thus had become a different person, who deserved to live. The "Heavenly Court" is a fun movie! "The advertising of their colleagues" is a clear indication. The story, as wonderful as it is seen, is engaging and will make you play for two hours of play. The last part is very good and will require "Kleenex treatment" for many viewers. This film is in my favorite of all 10 personal moments, has my highest views!
