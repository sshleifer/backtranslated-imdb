The movie is really poignant, unique and lift. The story is universal because it is a war between good, evil and the world between. The most important thing is that its rating is correct, misleading, and caused. Blockbuster is counted as though it is a movie tested by X. The fact is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read a small and simple layer.
