Although I have agreed to agree with other comments made by people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say I am like it. Not often can a large bunch of 80 paps found out of Wham! The video, so very suited to see (£ 0.79 a night in my local store!). Beware of the open seams and zip on the costume of the monster, the fact that the 'hero' looks much like Keith Chegwin and the lines as classic as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally we meet Kor ..." Kor: "Surprisingly, is it not? ”<br /> <br /> Amazing! I also like the fact that although the video box appears very exciting with pictures of a fortress surrounded by the sea and the danger of pigs - like a good brave bird (among other 'interesting and dedicated' suggestions of what is going on in the real film, none of them happens. No, I don't think ... certainly not a bright sea or a sharp bird, it's just trying to make you interested ... classic for my opinion this film gets 10 for the value of fresh entertainment!
