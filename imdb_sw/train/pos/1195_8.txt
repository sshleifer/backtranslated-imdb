I saw this film about twenty years ago on the show of late. I still remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was acting as an actress as many critics saw him strong, close to a thin, leading man, and only liked to watch his movies because of his looks. This film, however, has shown what an interesting actor would have been. He did not have enough responsibilities like this during his long career. This is its best performance. He is completely faithful in the true role of the people. From what I read, he was a very difficult and easy to go into real life and never fought against these roles. He would only do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could handle many different and difficult tasks. Another thing I remember about this film is how Lloyd Nolan's angry attitude was. Nolan was a good actor, but this attitude greatly strengthened me. The last part of the film is connected with me for all these years. This film is worth looking.
