All people show this film, and perhaps many professional film experts, not just. This film was made by a series of matting and artistic techniques like the works of the famous Czech film producer, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I give them a movie of Zeman, such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Safari to Beginning Time, or On The Comet. If you can't find the film, then read the review at AMG. They will describe the process used. If someone was looking at Zeman's work and try to compare with any sci / f fantastic film of the time, the audience could not find it then. It is not appropriate to compare one of the styles of filmmakers to the usual technology of the day, because Zemen and Hines "do not count". They have a unique style and they should be judged only by their creativity. If you look at this film from a point where you know that deliberately attempted to create a collage of mattress mixed with live action, you can easily think that it did a good job. It is not easy to make a bunch of cutting off the computer. I thought that the creatures were also very good, also considering how they did. Hines took a great player, and I think his film will not be judged for years to come. The person who develops the film should have made the audience away from what they see, rather than letting them go to the playground waiting for a typical CG job. As for the characters, I think Hines also took a page from the Zemen book, since most of the Zemen actors were not expressing themselves for the first time, but they began to concentrate on the film and action. It is a great comfort to me to have this film in my library. I will look for the years to come, two whole hours.
