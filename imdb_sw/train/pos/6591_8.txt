An invisible person is a show everyone s gotta love! Reminds me a series of past 80 schools (team, airwolf, knightrider) Special effects are small but effective !! but the most important thing is the fun that they had to shoot this series. Shows the truth! all that is best suited for the responsibilities there and looks like they can do whatever they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! for me it is strange that very bitter rituals are his acting style does not get a shot in the great movie (Mr Tarantino this was a show that you should be led! instead of a great risk of great boring (csi)) Get this show if you can. well worth it!
