Take this film why, not remake, but quite a different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of the gravity of popcorn. Appearance, it's amazing. Everything else was the same. <br /> <br /> Why, I think the movie is awesome, but I love everything Burton has done. People should be calm and stop acting as the end of the world b / c of this film. You didn't think it was remake, and not. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. . I took it as a parallel world.
