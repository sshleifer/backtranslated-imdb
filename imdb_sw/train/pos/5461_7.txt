To avoid the life of being pimped by his father (.. and waiting for speakeasy) who dies in the explosion, Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who loves only) walks through branches within the bank business in Gotham capital. When a partner who is supposed to be his second son-in-law (and a new Lily partner), heaven is the limit for Lily if she has written her different relationships in the diary and the trick informs the paper that she will receive if certain payments have not come into her hands. The new president of the bank, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of pouring alcohol to lots of votes, but soon finds himself in love after meeting him in the City of Love. This makes Lily's mouth water as if he will now reach a successful stage of cheating a wealthy person with a wealth of honor. However, the environment decides which will lead to a decision that threatens its success of achieving its wealth. Trenholm, now her husband, is sentenced to a prison and has lost the bank. She needs money Lily now owns or will have nothing. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a whole movie despite being a regular police Warner Brothers. Putting in the pre-code gives the filmmakers the opportunity to define bad issues such as a woman having sex to achieve success and how it can lead to tragedy. A positive trend from Alfred E Green suggests through the subtle thinking of different ways and speech through good acting from the good performance of Stanwyck how to prepare something without a definite action. It is clear that the film shows that money is not everything and all jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily's death. Lily having Lily to reach the metamorphosis of miracles with a loving person did not tell the truth. He spent all this time on the platform just to fall to someone who was not quite different from the others he had used before.
