The movie looks like a walk-in for "Sexual Research". Most likely I have never been very involved with the fireworks of the female artist to erase the male organs and so everything that discusses "Now, who caused this penis?" it seemed a bit free. The discussion in this film is horrible, although visually this film has had its time. I almost almost dug when Tassi came into the painting of the mind but then the movie pulled out again on the penise. It is highly recommended for those who have not seen one at a time.
