This is a common point of flick from '80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Put in the future police situation that the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular television shows is "Man Race", where the abducted captives are mentioned and killed for millions of entertainment. Installed as a show show, where the audience will vote for the "favorite stalkers", trained killers who hunt and kill "showants" opponents show. The audience is also winning awards by defining who will be killed by whom. And the host plays with Richard Dawson of Family Feud, who is an experience of the game that makes him good for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) accused of the massacre of massacres, he is forced to play this sad game. This movie is full of the Arnold banners, such as "back" before entering the field. And he insults the gunman and flamethrower and "What about light?" I would like to keep going, but I don't want to destroy the movie. It's fun! If it was planned or not, this film serves as a great passion for today's "Reality TV" passion. There are already many programs that show people who endure pain and abuse for the entertainment of the audience, and even court cases have television for their "entertainment value". The running man shows what will happen if the television truth hit the ground, and it's a scary picture. One can only hope that networks mean commonly stopping off. Overall, this is an enjoyable film and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
