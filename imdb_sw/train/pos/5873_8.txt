This would be a true tribal fire if they chose ANYBODY WORK for John Abraham. This is a good actor. Be it comedy, drama, tears-jerkers etc.. It seemed like at some time Priyadarshan discovered this too, and much had to fly around like a monkey to make his scenes a little solo. The most unpleasant buttons of the hilarious movie of ABSOLUTEL otherwise. The best player come together in sounds since Hungama, IMO. As Hungama, it is a comedy of the situation held on the shoulders of the screenplay of beauty and of course, Akshay Kumar. This may be his best performance so far. It is best to be a shoe for the best player in each award job. AK has always been good at comedy, but it takes on different levels here. Body language, facial expressions and the only way he provides each line. It is a creative performance. The hall was going to the peak at the best length of the film and I don't think I've seen the situation with a movie in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have a "one" of the heroine. It is 3 stars incredibly HOT + Beautiful girls who I thought did a very good job. Pretty sure they all make their debuts. Raresh Rawal is as stable as usual, although its procedure is wearing out over time. Rajpal Yadav is the most irritating person (his patient over-up in every movie). Rimi Sen have nothing to do. Overall, it certainly requires the value of the dock. I would like to say it is FUNNIER than No Entry, and that says a lot. It may be better if they choose someone who has more power than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
