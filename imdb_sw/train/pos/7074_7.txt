Terry Gilliam traveled again in the future (he had already done in Brazil "to describe this story about the virus that destroys society. <br /> <br /> Script is completely crazy and simple tricks on it but it is quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he has thoughts (futuristic events are very good). For the cast, Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe good (whatever happened to him) is the same, but Brad Pitt is very angry, every time he plays the roles that his hand has done so forced and unreliable. He should play only successful young people. My rate: 7/10
