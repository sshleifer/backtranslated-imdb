I tell you that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was tired and looked through t.v. and found a "home room" and was already in 5 minutes, but I walked. It was amazing and moving. It shows what can happen in anyone's life. I give 10, more as possible. The director / author and executives performed an amazing job. I think young people should watch this film and they will learn from them. It was beautiful, celebrated, secret, and more. I cried for an hour! I think the director / author should write more movies like this. I liked it! I didn't even know about this film, which is sad because it was very good. I would like to go to the movie so that many people could see.
