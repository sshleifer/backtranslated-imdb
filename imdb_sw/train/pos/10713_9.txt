An angry boy who has lost his parents in pain is taken into account by his grandfather. Together they find a common base in Gaelic's stories that have been banned from generation to generation of people on the island. Although bad events, such as the Highlands permit, include in the story, there is an amazing amount of humor and confidence in them. It's all done in Skye, so there is a measure of beauty twice. The scenery of the mountain is to breathe, and is a small chance to hear Gaelic of Scotland. I am English, so I had to read the readers, but Gaelic's spoken voice is still amazing. Exhibitions are just what you would expect from non-performing actors carefully - in other words, you look at the real thing - people who care about the Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially Skye, performed a few extraordinary miracles to make this film. Anyone who has little interest in Gaelic, human history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, different cultures or social justice should have this film.
