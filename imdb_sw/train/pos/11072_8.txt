it's all very simple. Jake goes to jail, and uses five years with con and chess masters. they have compassion on its history of loss and failure, and sadness he lives because of his belief in his subtle tactics and control the rules of the younger. they decide to give Jake greater freedom: from his inner fears, from what he believes to be himself. therefore, they take him on a journey where he should allow all fear, pride, all hope - regeneration as a true master of his will. <br /> <br /> is a wise movie about a journey of brightness, on a non-sports gambling we do and within us. 10/10, of course.
