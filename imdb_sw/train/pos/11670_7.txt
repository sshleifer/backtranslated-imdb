The featherweight plot and anxiety features do not make any difference when the movie enjoys watching like this. Good steps and stunts interesting - for their day - make this film a real zip. And there is a real comedy from chemistry rush between two leads. Quinn makes a good villain as well, although his role is completely paralyzed. But do not get over the great role of Maureen O'Hara, this is like sex as any Hollywood movie of this time. You can forgive them for the time being done, but it is still difficult to get past. For all the heroes and worst screens of the screens, this is still a bit better than a good boy.
