Kubrick again puts on display its amazing ability to make a perfect trick of the film. Particularly through the movie, but also using a skilled mark, he creates an amazing and awesome sound that sits on the entire film and gets my back from the beginning. In fact this is an improper ambiance that makes it a glitter that is, in my eyes. Of course it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest exhibitions that I have ever seen. An example of fear of mind has become mad. Duvall and Lloyd are fake, being good, but it's easy to look back at the two when all the film is brilliant. Plus is the character of the actor and the great name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
