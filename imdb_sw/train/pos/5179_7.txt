Indian Summer is a warm film, with many features, which can make a good afternoon afternoon (with little editing). The movie begins in the past with a group of children displayed on moose, which sets the tone fully before the refusal now, while an adult group from the "golden age" of the camp is invited to come back again to spend a few weeks vacation with camp commander, Uncle Lou. The film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters while remembering their time in the camp, and creating new memories in their recent stay. The film succeeds in a great way that brings its characters into this beautiful environment, and gives them a chance to develop without worrying about the development of the plot. Look at these people to remind you, and their relationships with each other is what the film refers to and why it works well. Not available on high and melodramatic, always keep its temperature, charm and reality. I have never seen a film where nostalgia has been taken well, and I found myself in spite of having never been one of these camps as a child myself. <br /> <br /> With a hot, nostalgic movie, I strongly recommend.
