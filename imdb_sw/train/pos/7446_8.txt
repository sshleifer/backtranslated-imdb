I can't agree with any comments. At first I saw a film at a British TV station, presented as an indie film and taking a film under this horn I think is a different thing. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I walked right away. The program can be as bad as the JS show (ie no plot) but acting is an evil, cautious and it is all in a wonderful garbage movie. It says a lot about America rather than brutality or Ken Park without a drama view but offers views on the American community, and more especially for TV tourists in America (and I believe there are a lot of them!) They are interested. After all we are the neighbors we are talking about, aren't we? <br /> <br /> Happy 100%!
