This film was seen by my wife and me when it occurred in 1978. It was a revelation to us. In fact we thought that we are the only gay and lesbian couple who have ever married and have children. Obviously we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect and perhaps do not want. But we all have chosen that love yet. And no, it has not changed our gender orientation. This kind of stuff is for Christian wackos. When we were young we both had issues, but never with the opposite sex. When we were older we stopped having issues that arise. <br /> <br /> This story was not searched. However, the view that they became sexually suggestive is not true to me. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the past 40 years. We still have gay. End of the story.
