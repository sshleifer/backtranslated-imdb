I really like what I saw of this cartoon so far. Indeed, the animation is not the best, but in fact, I'd like to see this type of style more of the cartoony done quickly and cheaper than the old model made quickly and cheap (which was starting to happen more often and more - it's just the style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it). There is nothing wrong with the angular lines and black-dot eyes - in fact, I think it's very good. If the child has never thought of the scooby-doo structure it was very good, but I think I would like to know if it's better. <br /> <br /> However, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and I believe it or not, but I think she has a more detailed depth. Of course, the show does not interfere with the natural nature of "Sululi-solving", but that was just an old form of fatigue. Do not make a mistake - I am sure there are authors out there who will be able to bring much more interest to traditional Mystery activities (which were not at the end of late), but for the moment this show is a deviation from the level. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but not just a comic aid. They are still ignorant, but eventually they have the opportunity to use what seems to be (terrible!) Mind. They are an old old eating slackers as they have, but now they seem to be still going on with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's legacy. I used to get the original joke of Scooby-Doo to become a fresh and hilarious cheese without the best fun, but this show really makes the sense of real humor. Also, I never did like Casey Kasem as Shaggy anyway, so the new actor doesn't bother me if she does other people. (I still think Billy West was better, though) <br /> <br /> Overall, while not a great cartoon in the scope of all the cartoon history, it's still a success among other things Scooby.
