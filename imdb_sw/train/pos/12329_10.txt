Before you watch, please make sure you have seen the Living Dead Dayâ€¦ This may be better than 7 minutes I saw! Interestingly, the crappy 'special effect' (string, string !!!), and running pieces of bread ... what you need more ??? <br /> (Don't watch this movie while eating bread ... you can get scared!)
