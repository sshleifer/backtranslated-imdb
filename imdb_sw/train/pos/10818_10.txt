Why does this have such a low level? Surely I do not give ... Is it because of a bad act? Negative conversations? Yes, who cares about these things in the awesome low budget movies? With diligence, acting and discussion are not important in these movies. People who hate movies just because of bad and bad conversations should not be allowed to test low budget movies. These movies should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> However, when talking about the film, right? Yes, I loved it! I bought it because I expected to open, but it is not obvious and the cat is very bad (often the only animal player was put on the body of the participants and the disabled), but I didn't care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, acting is the hilarious actor (the worst acting is the GOOD thing in the cheesy movie down the horror budget), the conversation is hilarious (bad conversation is the GOOD thing in cheesy under budget horror movies), the zombie singer and the big dick is hilarious The child of a flying demon is hilarious and I can continue to go on, but I don't want to say a lot ... But I can mention that there is a place where a girl hits a doll doll if it's lol lol alive! Oh and the zombie singer loves to sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> The best line in the film: <br /> <br /> The view of Detective: * pulls the coke * Detective Sloane: What * beep * What! what do you do? What was the wind blowing? What is hell? View of Detective: Not man, it's ... Ehh ... Cool treatment ... Method of Detective: * Effects heroin in his hand * Detective Sloane: What * Beep * what you do, the way? What? You * love madness? Investigation Methods: It is a cool drug. * Methods of Detective: * Regularly strikes a random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What! Hell continues, Way? What are you doing? Detective's view: This evil man was fighting with demons and then began to hit his head on the rock! He just started to hit his head on the rock! I think it's on PCP or something! LOL!
