I just saw this film in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who did that, so I thought I would like to look at it. I thought it was a very good film and waiting to wait to look again. The participants were very good and I loved all the music! did not have much to talk in the film, which at first I felt very strange - but once I came in, I thought that the story and acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought it was too much for thought. I want to see the movie again because there is so much to continue in that I forgot the little things, but know that I came out of the playground to think about the film. It was shot very well and the whole thing was special.
