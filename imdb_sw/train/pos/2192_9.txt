Dan Katzir has produced a great film that takes us on a fast run through true love shared with the problems around modern Israel. For anyone who has ever loved it, the film also brings back a sense of uncertainty, uncertainty and heartbeat that makes love become bitter-sweet. The state of fear and separation that came with difficult times in Israel at that time only helps to strengthen feelings. Immediately, you are faced with Dan's trouble, and you can't fail to be deeply transferred. You cannot write a game with such enthusiasm - the difference between the realities of the Emergency, disconnected from the Iris, and the reality of the situation in shock makes this seem to be seen. If you have a time of enthusiasm, and you have been in love, watch this film.
