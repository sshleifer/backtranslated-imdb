I didn't know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but she liked it very much. It was dark, big and attractive. I also felt very real, I felt that I was sent back after the 1800s. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with respect and power, showing us how the strongest young man was Australia's greatest killer. Naomi Watts is good in the role of being a lover of Kelly community. It is highly recommended - and that's from Aussie!
