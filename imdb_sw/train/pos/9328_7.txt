The perfect man is a story about two 30 brothers, one who seems to be "perfect" and another who is shadow, constantly walking in the rehab drug centers. After the death of their father, the two were gathered after a long absence and the resurrection of the ordinary brothers. It is not until the "perfect" brother will make an amazing revelation that he has AIDS that a less innocent brother eventually makes a move to get his life in order, and take responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie does not work well to write a little brother "return", although it may seem to be the whole time (anti-drug is not easy). What makes this film a more tender is a cure for AIDS, a topic that has gone through the movies over 5-10 years ago. And also the development of almost almost sweet among two old feuding brothers is very reliable and well done. Two workers were very capable, if not very charismatic. First efforts of efforts from director and author Leonard Farlinger whose brother died of AIDS. The latter is also done well. <br /> <br />
