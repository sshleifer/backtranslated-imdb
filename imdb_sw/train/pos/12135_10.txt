Each picture of star motion Bette Davis has to feel. Before the star stars of Davis and Leslie Howard in the "Human Bondage," he would have a more score of movies. Legend is that Davis 'stole' of Oscar 1935 for his performance as a cockney servant, a non-mother and boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story goes to be AFI comforted Davis by giving only his Oscar 1 to play with Joyce Heath in "danger." I think the Davis fans of "Human Bondage" who agree with Oscar-robbery will have a separate opinion of the 1934 film that AFI did not give to its event with the 1936 film "Danger," the performance which received its first Oscar year 1937. <br /> <br /> I have tried to look at all the photos of Bette Davis's motion, TV interviews, videos, advertisements for WWII & TV shows in a popular series. Considering, it is easy to identify why this film, the "Human Bondage," has given Davis the opportunity to be appointed for its performance. He had only 25yo when the film ended & almost just reached the red carpet of Hollywood. All people began to see Bette Davis as a star because of its performance in "Human Bondage." That's what makes his story work. But, RKO saw his greatness in "Man Who Played God," and lended him from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'll go with AFI, for 41 years after they have made a wise decision of Davis's 1 best of Oscar actors for "risk," 2 years later. To do this, AFI can be useful in bringing the best in one of the 20th-century Hollywood actors. Because, from the "Bondage of Humanity," continued, Davis knew for sure that he had reached into himself to get an exhibition of gold. Of course, he deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as many as 6. <br /> <br /> "Risk" provides an example of the example in the depth of the character of Davis. For, it is "dangerous" (1936) that becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, dead in the middle of the red chair. Although in the "Human Bondage," Davis is very similar to the edge, still on the road to the road and ready to withdraw from all his work of making 60 years. <br /> <br /> Maybe by giving him not legitimate Oscar in 1935, instead of the born star, the actor was given the inspiration to achieve more of the difficulty within himself for the great work of a talented actress. It is known that his modern enemy was Joan Crawford; The star which displays are still not available to Davis'. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'. Howard Stern is a star radio star, too. Most of the people on the stage and the screen of the money are stars. Few became chief executives. The most important difference between them is something that Bette Davis can feel: the difference between the desire to do a good act or a star. Try to compare these two movies as I am, looking straight after another. Maybe you will know what AFI and I did. Davis was close to becoming one of the most 20th century executives in 25yo and achieving his goal when he was 27 years old. He spent the next 50 years with a very high bar that was not reached. . . still. <br /> <br /> If AFI has sent a message that he could arrive "In Human Bondage," the life story of Davis as a good actor can be caused in the kingdom of stars, instead.
