Bruce Head, one of the best pictures of Carrey since ... well ... for a long time. It has one of the funniest scenes I have seen too long ... Morgan Freeman plays well with God and even chips in a few jokes which are amazing funny. It has one or two romantic moments which are a bit of boring but on every beautiful movie and some funny scenes. The best place, is where Jim asks the voice of an anchor man. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
