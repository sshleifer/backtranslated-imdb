He had never heard of a Man in the Moon until he saw the last evening at this HDTV station. Look, my taste is like others', eclectic. My favorites run from Blue Velvet to Dr Strangelove for Spirit and Mrs. Muir thru wizard of Oz and Loved One, Eraserhead, repo man, and Internal Spy. <br /> <br /> Man in the Moon is superbly made, gentle, humble, fun and awesome film, beautifully recorded, one of which executives actually live in this moment rather than act. This sweet story will be in our personal library. This beautiful story of life in a distant finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting. It is difficult to remain tough at the last minute film, especially when the girl has her great heart sister's sister searing personal pain and forgiving all. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing a luxury or bearing you cry loudly for my dull myth, it will end up with this suggestion from one who enjoys a film that speaks with our whole heart. If you do not have any other film purchases, please buy someone in the Moon. This moving story is one that you enjoy enjoying regularly. It's fun with the gem, all the films also a few in this world of hard hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtue evinced in Man in the Moon is happy to behold. Paul Vincent Zecchino \ t
