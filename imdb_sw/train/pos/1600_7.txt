This is not a bad film. It's not funny funny, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> entertainment. It has a pleasant time. Cher provides good performance <br /> <br /> in a role that contradicts its real life life. His performance <br /> alone is worth watching. If this movie is out of it / isn't selected, but at the '80s <br /> <br /> level it was better.
