This is one of all my favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines many of the films as he does. This flick contains all: Action, Adventure, Fiction Science, Good against Bad and even Romance (without even "innocent" intermediaries between Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe better, you won't be in Mensa "get" and enjoy the movie as you do with some other Miyazaki movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies take a break from thinking). This is just a flat movie that enjoys everyone who will love, so make yourself a permit and go. The only unique drawing is the United States of Dubbing. I've seen Vander-Geek being just angry. But not all lost, the original Japanese version is on two sets of disc and it blows! Who cares if you can't understand the Japanese you said? If you can read on the second second level then check the original Japanese recording and subtitles. You can't regret it.
