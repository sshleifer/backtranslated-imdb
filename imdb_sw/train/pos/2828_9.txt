After tracking for half a year, I finally found a copy and was not scared. It's not despair because I am one of those who die of SMAP fans who need to see all their work and I finally had to see a movie called Goro's fire. But I couldn't believe Goro had to make a similar film. In his honor now, I am sure he pretends that he made this film. However, they saw a perfect man looking at shame, easily ill and half a very sad moment. The man, still do not believe that he made this film ... I had to cover the eyes in many places without believing he made a movie like that .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad to look at it. Thank you for the good ....
