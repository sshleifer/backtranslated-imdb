This is not a very good film, but I love the authors and director of trying something a little different. The main theme of the film is futures and small, trivial things that can change very much in the future. Somehow this reminds me of a MIRACLE film, although instead of a single random event, the seemingly simple things happen frequently and each one helps to build for a good conclusion. Plus, the ordinary man of bald looks to understand all this and he is talking about this at a short moment - if he is a kind of great potential but none of his details in the film (like two people fighting in a tower at HUDSUCKER PROXY) <br /> <br /> Jacket's DVD shows only Audrey Tautou. This adds to its success AMELIE, although she is just one of the many participants in the film and no one-star role. These are faster, good acting and conclusions are not so bad. The only reason I had no high score was that some of the characters were not very happy and I think the movie would have been enhanced by small parts.
