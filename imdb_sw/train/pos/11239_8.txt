The Frontier secret is known to be a series of Star Trek series of network of the longest network. While the quality of production is not the same as the production of fan like Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier concentrates on a lot of stories, and in that case it is very good. <br /> <br /> Frontier's secret doesn't have a body set; instead the actors are beaten on the green screen, and nature is inserted by the string. One of the great achievements of Frontier is a huge amount of work they produced. One way this is successful is by inserting a standard set of hiding, rather than post-production. Although this takes a lot of time, it is also important to note that the quality of the image results are not as high as it was produced after production, although it still serves its purpose. Although it cannot be a cup of tea tea, Frontier's Secret is worth a shot, although it might be better to start looking at the third season, for where the producers start to beat the effort.
