I saw this movie the day that last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's on the video and I've seen it again. I love this film! What they do sometimes is dumb but that's what makes my third movie all the time. Special effects are the same, but the magic talks will give you. I am the kind of person I will say I have been guided by this film, so if you like dramas and other things, try. But for all others, enjoy! Acting is very good. Hank Azaria is hands down (he is not commie, nor fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, do not fix it) and then William H. Macy give its best performance (showing fargo) Everyone has thanked everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was as good as an invisible boy. Two problems: the most boring part of the film is the subject of love between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the hearing of the Casanova meeting. Some of the events are quite a story in any way, but it is an explosion. Kinka and especially authors have drag in the area until all is hilarity gone, but they are altering and you're ready for more. I swear after seeing this, you will be exhausted from the peak of the burst (which I think was very good) The camera is also very good, moving faster with the actors. Also, Tom Waits provides better performance (he has this very bad cold) and if someone says, the best part is when the characters show some humanity to them. Captain Amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to Casanova on his full plan - I was rolling) and the rush is pretty cool like Casanova. One pig: the best player (eddie izzard) is almost lost, but his heart is the right place. So all in all, beautiful movie. I give twenty stars and I hope that one day, everyone will see the beauty in the best film, six million Millions. Laugh right now if I think about it. 20/10
