IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first professional contractor, ANISIO, kill ESTEVÃO (plot, at least at the beginning, does not 'well describe why) . The boy does that and after he gets his money he begins to involve two partners, in their company and saying he wants to work there (as an administrator or something?). At the same time he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO, and began to join him! In this story, where crime, corruption, betrayal and insomnia go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be abused, except MARINA, who is the only person who does not know what is going on and did not give someone any? This film shows in a bitter sense of sadness and cruelty that is located in the capital as São Paulo, where crime is a daily presence. We can feel emotion but also be involved in the characters like ANISIO (carefully played by Paul Miklos), which have girls who paid him without a ban, and even engaged in the man's daughter! In fact it should be a monster doing something like that, but of course I know there are people like him out there, in Brazil or elsewhere? It is a very good, cruel but realistic movie, about the sad state? Acting is good and sound too.
