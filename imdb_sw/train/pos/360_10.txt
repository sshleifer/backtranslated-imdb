11 Oscar selection and win zero !!! What? I still understand why - not as actors in the movie did better after that you can do it by awarding them with extraordinary roles as done by Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc. - were all amazingly - I have a desire to find the literature to talk in Oscars that year ...... it should go to the Shoulda-woulda-coulda community of judges .... <br /> <br /> His amazing book - but really in the style of Alice Walker's style has a way of appearing as she spreads her characters - so I am very happy that the situation with the screens took a few things. Wonderful performances were amazing - African events are highly recommended - the African part of the book should be placed in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - But oh oh! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they don't think Africa out of Safaris - so they must have a Zebra and wildlife compliment area when we all know no West Africa ---- and more of all why to find people talking English Who in West Africa speaks Swahili? I had to get it out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - wonderful, films - out of the world - CLASSIC yes! <br /> <br>> I own and look at when my soul needs rejuvenation.
