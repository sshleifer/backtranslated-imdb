When I first saw "Agriculture In the Dark", I did not know what the plot was. But when I saw, I was shocked at what was shown. When I saw the second time in the Australian cinema class, I realized the second step: communication issues. You see, when Lindy Chamberlain's child (Meryl Streep) beat the baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were sad but they didn't show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and so they could not mourn. But when all the people in Australia felt their lack of depression, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it himself. The word is, the wrong message communicated with the public, and turned people against Lindy. Although this was a clean accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters due to the presence of media media, regardless of the external political views of the media. <br /> <br /> About the exhibition, Streep works very well with Australian emphasis (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is very similar. You will probably be deleted from what you see here. Certainly one of the best movies of Fred Schepisi ever.
