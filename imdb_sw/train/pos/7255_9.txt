This is not the kind of entertainment you expect, at least many people I know do not. It is a picture of cruelty to the body and mind that happens in the best fight, the characters seem to be clear, especially because "you read their thoughts", something that is often found in books and rarely in movies however it has been done very well in this piece. I would like to put it next to "All of the western stability" and "Die Br√ºcke" because of leaving a permanent feeling. I would like to make it screens at school, as well as two other movies - however getting its copy showed that it was very hard - which is embarrassing.
