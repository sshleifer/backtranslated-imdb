He says: "No one hurts, everyone is successful." Before we say that, we know the opposite is true: Everyone hurts, no one is successful. This is a new stick in American movies, or maybe the old string has been restored for a long time. Consider "East promises", "There will be Blood", "No Country for Older People".

The first script of Kelly Masterson is almost like the Hollywood movie will ever go to the Greek catastrophe. Providing tariffs for his former colleague Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet for skill and carefully returns the black stories to the wonderful game of school behavior.

By compensation, Marisa Tomei is a fierce fire. But of course you don't need to tell you that. Why Gina's behavior would like to have a boy like Andy, we were not told, but that's okay. The action is a character, after all. The unique touch and magic of Carter Burwell music makes this beautiful film a jewel. Don't miss it.
