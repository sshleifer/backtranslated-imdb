True story of two cocky brothers and their falls from grace (through drug abuse) and future liberation. One brother, an independent specialist named James Franco, is a very intelligent yet intelligent person. Another brother is a hard-working doctor who judges himself as if he is involved in alcohol while having problems living according to his family's expectations for two children. It is not a heavy burden as drug stories want to be, and all in the true realistic picture of the family dynamics that drug addiction brings. I would like to recommend to anyone who is interested in such studies and thank James Franco for his efforts in what was the work of love.
