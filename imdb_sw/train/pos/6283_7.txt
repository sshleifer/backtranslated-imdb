I also like the great epic pictures - I'll keep them from choosing - it's good to go back with a few beer and click on a simple step sometimes. Film where the plot takes back to pieces. The film where the discussion is not carefully written that deals with itself at the end of the purple prose. There are films that are relevant to the bill ... but in my opinion Going On Seconds Sixty is one of the best. <br /> <br /> It is an update of the movie that shares its name. It also collaborates with the image of the image, but it is not a complete implementation. Anything that was good on nature has been caused. Any postponed is also accepted for the great thanks to the budget. Often these types of efforts are instructions for full disaster - see remug-ugly remake of Italian Job for one that blew - but here, due to the cast of many better actors, sixty succeeds. <br /> <br /> The program with a lot of discussion is not much to write about IMD about. Often you will have instances where the line of discussion goes back and forth between actors, each of whom will say differently. Many people found this suppression; I see it raises a smile. Each actor gets the opportunity to show his style of style here, and Cage, Jolie and Duvall are leading the packet of doubt (and it should be noted that it is also exciting to see Mrs Pitt not give the first bill here). Saint Nick's best Chemistry (see checklist) and Angelina leads for a short time. <br /> <br /> The offender is not a little afraid - I have seen playing Chris Eccleston's roles of a guy before I know he can handle, but I think he had been deliberately targeted to do his undisputed role as insisting and action. We know the heroes will succeed, somehow; we just sit in the car with them, enjoy the journey. I think a lot of these events were played in the language so far in the cheek that passed over the heads of many people showing this miserable. In fact, I had no idea of ​​some winks of the fourth wall on the camera: it's just a kind of movie. All this style and not much - something that often reduces my tolerance if it is not implemented * only - it would be useless if the action was not available. And for the most part, it is. Very strange. I found that it seems to be a common trend to use fast-cut shots almost-up for direct action these days. I personally find this kind of stimulating thing. I like movies like this where the stunts are amazing enough not suitable fake ramping tension to lay tight shots at all. I have been told that Cage actually made many stunts of cars if he could eliminate without losing his insurance (in real life i mean - his character does not matter) and shows. One can transfer the car and this is used properly in the finale of the slower weather conditions that runs the Mustang on the ground through the country - and the FUN route. , this film is not "epic, photo-affirming after 9/11 photography and mandatory effort of the definition of society". Planning is not compatible, some events can be cut and not a few managers. But car movies didn't come much better than this. So if you hate cars ... why do you read these comments? I would like to take more than many of the "Flaccid And The Veryedious" iterations (I think the franchise) any day. 7/10
