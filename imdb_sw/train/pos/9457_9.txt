Can you explain how just feelgood and right to touch this film is? For several weeks this DVD left me on my shelf every time I went to the shop - when I saw Steve Carrell in several films before, I didn't want my process of thinking - so I opposed the opposition, even finally I used to 'Do! Hell! ' view! And I was very surprised! I just liked to buy it earlier. After looking at it three times a day I am still happy how the widow struggles with three men, wishing that she has not existed since her beloved wife, who meets a exciting woman, impresses deep and interesting (dare to book bookish?) Way, gives us light very different from a life that makes him remember what he was looking for. The woman's hunger to be her hard brothers - that shows Dan with shame and with the heart of the heart, seeing a "special person" bringing such happiness and joy in the family home with the life of her brothers . You just start to feel for him. <br /> <br /> Then when the blind comes to Ruthie Draper - that's the turning point in Dan's Dan! It seems to give her a comment, likes to love Ruthie - Green-Eyed Farmer! Give a hilarious area as a couple couple to compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-developed things like Dani begins to turn on Marie. Other events of prohibition - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, with his brothers, begins to explain what happened just .... when Dan's face decreases brings a strong wind of breath! <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> A little heat of heart and a little gulp like Dani knows what he has lost in life. Dan plays guitar and singing in Show Talent .... his voice snaps a bit as he goes through the song. ... gem completely! To accept what happens at the end of the film and his daughters ... both love their father and want to see him happy, they will not allow him to resist his love for Marie; Dani's lack of defeat his daughters because he is their rock, their fortress ... and tell him more than that in just a few words. I would continue to continue but I will leave for now - maybe come back and add more comments here recentlyâ€¦ but I will finish by saying ... if you want to watch the film That is very good, with a loss of comedy to enhance the game, which never feels compelled or crass, which comes up as a real example of a man to discover a new life - not just a woman but also with his extended family, then see it again. DAN IN THE LIVING LIFE - 9 out of 10 for the best movie experience and the Sondre Lerche experience, which takes you around all the time while you are thin, with a well-planned exhibition and setting. I can't wait any longer!
