This is one of the biggest movies of love stories I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts can be seen on the date, but this is not misleading by the film. One should try to explore, reject and enjoy any kind of art in the view of time. To clear the standards of "Gender in the City", Charlie Chaplin was very awesome. However, when he was convicted of those looking for America's 1925, he was amazed. Sayonara is also an effective film in his look at the blend of love, America's "ultimately apparent" pride and hatred, and the complexity of different cultures. It is the second natural step for films such as the Gentleman Treaty. His goal, however, is not just a social definition, but a fun and enjoyable, and a number of verses that no one has ever forgotten. <br /> <br /> However, even when taken just like a love story, it is severe. Although, the reputation of the attacking Brando, he is very close to the status and reputation. Buttons and Umeki (all who won Oscars) and all other supporters add more films. The star, the real star, is doing a great job to make you feel the same for Brando, when he breaks his sense of responsibility and trust. His words when he meets the first and speaks to the Brando is common and a few things often similar in the movie. Discussions between Taka and Brando in his Tokyo dressing room at the end of the film are the same. Of course, it does not have a drink, drink, and worse, which shows us love in today's movies, but that makes it better. It shows true love and passion, and not just "warm." If this film does not touch you, then you are too young, too stupid or dead.
