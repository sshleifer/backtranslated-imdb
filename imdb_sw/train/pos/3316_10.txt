Bette Midler cannot be opened in this festival. He gives him every time he is in action. Although we laugh at jokes with his antics or we look at our eyes in one of his great ballads, Bette Midler listens to his audience. If you can't see it (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the best thing. The interesting thing to look at is how his strange voice has changed and has increased over the years but has never lost its power. His more version of "Staying With Me" loses anything spiritual from ROSE or THE MINISTRY OF THE RELIGION, Here's the most pure and hearty as ever. I will enjoy this festival for a long time.
