This was an example of Mick Dundee but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier. I liked to laugh with a lot of sounds. The central action of the bright and Barry Crocker in the role of the head, Australia who invades the UK to mislead the poms in its infinite free ways. A few brits will be disappointed with Barry's opinion many times over his forces. The relationship between the two countries is the first but friendly and this is shown by the last line of the film, given by a certain McKenzie who runs at home. "I was starting to love poms."
