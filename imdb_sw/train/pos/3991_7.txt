"If I sit down I won't stand up again", that's what the mother (one of the head) says to her son when she tells him to rest (she is just a widow). He means that rest is what the woman of her age and in her condition should do: rest in peace, self-care. But he is not in a state of "rest", yet. He also has a daughter who insults her in every tragedy in her life ... Suddenly, revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a 30-year-old muscle painter than he (Daniel Craig, James New Bond) when he "thought no one would touch it again". It is a story that makes you think about many things, especially about what the woman's 60s should do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have continued to be in that. I mean, nobody was surprised when Sean Connery has something to love in the movie by Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it was otherwise? The old woman, the little boy ... nah, that's already there, is it? The movie has tons of bravery every height, except for a 2 or 3 series which tones break out and comes open and evil dialogue. Those vulgar touch and how the son and daughter know the condition of their mother's love (it is not very interesting - you will know what I am starting when you look) - it's the only thing to worry about in "Mama". My rate: 7/10
