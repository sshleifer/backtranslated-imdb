No many comments, so I think I would add one. Do not go to other views! This was the best movie. RKS is one of the few directors of India who can actually put a very good movie. AB and Akshay gave another example of a great actress, such as boomeras too, which was a little unexpected, but it's good to watch. <br /> <br /> Wondering there has never been too much on release. <br /> <br /> Or a film / award awards, based on how good the movie was. The best for Khakee I thought and I thought Khakkee is also a good movie. <br /> <br /> Is a long movie, but it's worth and when you look, it certainly looks a long time. <br /> <br /> Take waiting for the next RKS movie with the next AB, movie Akshay they always seem to do well together ... example Waqt. Bohoomika has also done very well on the film and should do well if he keeps in the same style later.
