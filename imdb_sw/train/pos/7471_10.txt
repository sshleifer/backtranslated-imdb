In spite of the best Skype tracks of Vanilla, I expected to be passionate about the film because I heard that you did not find a good review. However, I left the movie completely for fear of how beautiful Vanilla Sky is. There was no effectiveness in all films, each character is reliable. During a romantic relationship between Cruise, David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia is really tears and close (perhaps due to the fact that they were soon becoming a couple of real life). Vanilla Sky project will confuse them in the last three of the film and there is a very small opportunity to assume the end. However, the end is closed to the end, you have no incredible mix of feelings of sadness, shock and understanding for David Aames. <br /> <br /> Movies are intelligent and you should consider. This is not hard because the chance is that you will be fully impressed on the film and will not take your eyes on the screen for the second time. I leave the movies to forget all about the film I just watch. But Sky Vanilla still continues in my mind the day after watching it. I recommend to anyone who wants to change from a simple film, shallow.
