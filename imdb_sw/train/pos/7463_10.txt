It doesn't look like this film gives us. You can love it or hate it. I loved him. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments (s) that said, you just gotta "feel" this. <br /> <br /> Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend painting made by Monet - a painter. Monet's style is drawing in a little dabs so up almost painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the issue is. Cruise says that painting has a "vanilla atmosphere". I believe this is a feeling for moviegoer. This movie is like painting of paintings. It's a painting film! And it is not unfortunate that the head of the film means the painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your usual plan. Requires more ideas. There are signs and events that are running around no, you can't be sure what is going on. But at the end, all are defined. You will need to focus on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of considering the most difficult way about it. After the end is when you should think about it. If you try to make it as it continues, you will get bored. Let it just happen ... "go" and ... continue to be clear. Remember what you see and store future analysis. I have seen all the high efficiency and think that it is very unique, abundant creation, and detective. But I will not criticize the mind of those who did not enjoy it. It's appealing to a certain taste. If you would like to have a spiritual presence, psychedelic, philosophical, persuasive thinking, challenge, spiritual movies, then see. If you prefer a little bit of light, then get up. But if you like as I explained, then you will enjoy it completely.
