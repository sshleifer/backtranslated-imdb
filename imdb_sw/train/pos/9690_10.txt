Paulie was good, cool, fun and perfect. I walked on this film, hoping to see a regular "family" film, which at times would find me not knowing and descending down. My intellectual film was changed immediately when I was quickly struck by the film's beauty. It is rare that you get a family movie which is sure and can be integrated "good". Many are reduced by cheap, written and produced only to attract younger members of the family, who will then send the unfortunate elderly with a desire to lose 65 minutes of eye restrictions and extra squares. Oh yes, Paulie had a plot. It told the story of the little girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie pastor, who can't talk and talk regularly with her. Dorky jerk dad discovered this, and thought Paulie had a damage to the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter, and quickly drove them out. We follow the adventures of Paulie (and misadventures) trying to reunite with her beloved owner, meet many memorable characters along the way. Oo, Paulie really could (talk) talk and had a fast jersey Jersey Jersey. Cool. The plan was enlightened and entertaining, to protect me. Paulie is the best movie of the family I have found and enjoy it wholeheartedly. Forever. Great. Choose a copy and stay back and enjoy a real family family, and a whole family. No sleep. I promise.
