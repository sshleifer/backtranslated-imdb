Director of the type of adventure of raising George Stevens (before the most expensive turnover such as 1948 I REMEMBER MAMA and GIANT of 1956) which set the standard for all future follow-up. Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's poem of the same, GUNGA DIN follows the trip of three military officers in the 19th century India. A good trio must be confident series of battles and other various dangers including the worship of thuggee and the temple full of gold. Their screen adventures are still exciting even after over six decades, and they have encouraged almost everything from the opera space of the cliffhanger-STAR WARS (1977) for RAFERS OF LOST ARC (1981) planned exactly. <br /> <br> The most important reason for the success of the image, however, is the perfect exhibition of the festival and the trio film of very proud actors. Victor McLaglen has never been as good as a very tough guy, Cary Grant is the final comic of the comic, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr is like a shocking hero as he can imagine - maybe even more than Errol Flynn's opponent. Chemistry among the three actors could not be improved, and such as the heat and reliable comradely is exactly what missing from the most modern stage action - and they get great support from Sam Jaffe's wonderful, who defeats miscasting physically physically and makes a characteristic characteristic of human beauty and the stability of stability. Great hit in his day (the film was considered to be the second largest financial maker of 1939 behind the remarkable achievement of GONE AND WIND), and yet it is arguably the best film of its kind.
