College Girl Joanne Murray takes an unprecedented job of studying students' homes to build apartments, which include selling unused furniture. This is done during breaks, so secret psychology includes unused buildings at college. "Dorm that Dripped Blood" is a flick of the low budget which is quite entertaining. The work is very bad, the plot is predictable, but the effects of money are very good. The most amazing "Before the Day" .7 out of 10. I enjoy seeing Daphne Zuniga's popularity of "The Initiation" runs several times by car.
