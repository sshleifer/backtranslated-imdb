When US journalist Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a special wager. Not Poe's belief that all his basic stories are based on real experience, Foster receives a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that can not spend the whole night in the Blackwood haunted castle. Once installed in the left fortress, Foster finds that hayu is alone, because it is accessible to many beautiful women and good men, and a metasiksiki doctor - who explains that they are all lost souls that have been destroyed to return to their stories of their deaths ! At first I looked a bit of the classic glory, I was mesmerised at all. I saw this movie is normal and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is definitely beautiful. The music mark makes the sky twice as inducing terrorism. The top portion has taken me to the loop, since I wasn't expecting it. It seems like Synapse did a good job and enhanced the image, because this film seems appropriate for its age, and it is an Uncut International version, so that boot. This is the film that is with me from the collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
