As I said above, four stars are not enough. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life for about 17 years. For people who do not like or understand it, they should not have genuine appreciation for art or you may have a short time to consider. Even if I haven't seen all his films yet, I would like to say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It is very tragic to see that movies are as good as "color paint" is not always good because I think we all need the first recreational needs of the first time in these difficult times. <br /> The movie like this is more than just movies; they are pieces of art that need to be counted more. The idea that it was chosen for Oscars 11 (even the Best Photo of the Year) and did not have one spoil is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes. Spielberg was not even elected to the Best Director! It should have led to Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how the right life for other people. <br /> <br /> If only movies have been good ....
