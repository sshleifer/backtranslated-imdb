Fire And Ice is an animation film set in the fantasy world. The movie is about a village destroyed by a great glacier which is the home of a bad ice master named Nekron. The only Savior of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to take revenge on those killed by glacier. The glacier of ice passes through the hot country and the king of the country named Teegra has been kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn puts out to find him and also decides to search and kill Nekron. Fire and Ice are led by Ralph Bakshi who is one of the adult adult animators. He has brought us artistic works such as the film Fritz Cat and some films he wrote himself, like a great Heavy Traffic film. I did not like Fire and Ice as close as I have another job of Ralph Bakshi, but I have seen the movie very enjoyable. It had a very good animation in part and the story was enough entertainment. The only basic complaint I have is that I would like to have more stories for the film because the story that is used is very narrow and there is not much. Also I would like the film was less because it's less than 80 minutes while running. It is still an entertaining film of entertainment that differs from Fritz Cat or Traffic Heavy is appropriate for 8 children and more. I just want that there is a more advanced story and it lasted longer than it did.
