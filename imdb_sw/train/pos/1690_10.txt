I've found unwanted quotes looking for video clips; They forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You remember pterodactyls. Old Man 1: I can remember the fall of it, the hook line and sink. Old Man 2: Oh, I didn't. Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and take off with the army boys to fight with the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Are you still dead?
