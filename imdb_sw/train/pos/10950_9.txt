When I first saw this show, I thought it looked attractive. I looked at it, I saw how it was around Sarah, as a character that sees the world ... around her. I got it, but he didn't laugh too much. <br /> <br /> Onstage and in her show, she is a racist, ugly, worried and hugely independent. I did not mention him at first, and took it all to the value of the face. Then I saw the film, Jesus is Magic. I think that he had been a Saraman Silverman's degree for me, explaining to me just the 'language' he speaks. He is like Marilyn Manson, who works hard to give us good ideas and pictures, but finally realize not an attack, it is reported. And as soon as you understand it, you are happy and eventually someone gives you one. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to just recommend intelligent people to understand, or that this disgusting show is to prove your idiocy. When I like a lot of 'smart' presentations, I still don't see the humor of your Coordination. I get a feeling that it's good, but I just don't know. Most people will not be able to find the Sarah's Silverman Program, but I'm glad I finally came. The creators of this show are working hard, each part is not only entered by dialogue and plot, but by songs, or the dream system, the number of production. These people have not included something to fill the time and please advertisers, seem to be on the mission to make the best show they can put together. If I would like to predict the future of this show, I would say it would go through the Development Capture by Freaks & Geeks. It will be available to be deleted before time and live on the hearts of fans and on DVD. But the heart, the creators of the SSP, your audience is out there, and we will look for a long time just to leave you to show.
