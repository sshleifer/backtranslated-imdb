This film is an hour or one of the best entertainment and has a really good time. I loved the behavior of Matt, and also Tiny. They seemed to be the most involved and mysterious characters, and indeed they are very interesting. Matt is very good (if not her good cousin), and a police woman and a lady of a blonde bike offers an eye-catching candy. I must say I have seen the effectiveness between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brother's place, he loved it. In general, I loved the film and it will get approximately 8. Penalties however, I was disappointed in. It was the foot of the foot, instead of an explosion of proper laces. :)
