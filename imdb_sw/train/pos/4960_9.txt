This movie is a little ray of sun in the dark season. It celebrates the best quality described as an old friendship. Morgan Freeman has a character like Freeman himself - a successful actor acting 70. He has gone to a small shop, instead of a vegetable that he wants to explore a place that he can play, as a manager of the space. Recently deceives employees and customers, especially good, if they are a player, a young woman (Paz Vega) who heads over "10 or less" items of tracking. <br /> <br /> 10 Things or Less should not have great information to do and does not pretend. Following Freeman and Vega when they are friendly, and if an old man advises his advice, instead of a home trip - the company's favorite movie to pick him out does not show up and Freeman has forgotten his phone number so that he can't call help. I had a small blues case on a Sunday afternoon in New York and this flick healed what was shown.
