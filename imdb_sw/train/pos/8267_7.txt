Brown's Harvard is a hard movie to push. We expect more from our films today, so it helps to remember that 20-year-old listeners were more guilty. William Haines is as beautiful as pride who stumbles through pain and shame to gain success, even, glory. All relationships in the movie feel very much because of the relationship between Billy and Jack Pickford, the nerd city. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even games ... It is a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
