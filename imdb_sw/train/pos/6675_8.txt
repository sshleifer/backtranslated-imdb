Leading behind this film was wonderful for comedy. Many exhibitions appear to be from the comic and dark book (visually - not the story of wisdom) than I expected. In fact, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you're in a very serious joke of sex as this has very little of that (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). When you review, several jokes come out and get funnier. If you have ever read a comic book or watch a comic film (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked it, you will enjoy the trick of the trick on the movie. If you love them, you might like a respectful shock that this film has for those. If you liked this movie, dvd has an extra bonus. (8/10)
