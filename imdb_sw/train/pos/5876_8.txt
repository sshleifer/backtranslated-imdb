Now I liked this movie, it was very interesting. For Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think after watching this film they should make more films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself in a little trouble with 3 female women at the same time, but the way he deals when someone comes out of the door and then another was very good looking, made quite well his film and I hope he does more comedy like this one later, John Abraham has his best friend, plays his role well and he is underrated I'm happy that some of his amazing work has seen but he is a very good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia plays a small role in this film and plays well. <br /> <br /> Memory house is very good I recommend this movie to everyone.
