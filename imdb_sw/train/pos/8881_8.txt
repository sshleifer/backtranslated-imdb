First, we must consider the time that this film took place in 1995. They were coming into it, and it added to its taste. Remy was a young social youth trying to find a way and could not, until he met him and had a friendship with the Nazis. They took him. Coconut is not something, but as many groups, it fills something that is lost to economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played an active part. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was a hot star of shooting track, and the work ethics of course and chip on his shoulder. He continued to strive for his own sympathy and trouble, and he had a partner with his professor to take him out. Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to get in, until she was on a raped date. Then he learned himself to struggle with his gender, and to intervene in politics. This film deals with racism and as many factors related to racism, the view of people itself begins. <br /> <br> I read a lot of comments on how there were no 'bad' characters of black color but there was one white evil (Nazis). So? Remy was not shown to be a bit wrong, he was trying to find his way, and he continued to fail until some skin skins accepted him. He was afraid, it was sad to see him pretending how he did. He even says right before committing suicide, I didn't mean, I wanted to become an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry people black, Ice Cube was the amount of intelligence, and Busta Rhymes was shown only as a bubble thug. Both of them had no opinion for their colleagues, and generally seemed to be not very white people. They were outraged like the Nazi but not up to the Nazi level for general evil. Sorry if this makes it seem right, but there are black groups like the Nazi? No. People say it shows white = -a black = good. Not true, the worst perpetrators of Nazi and police, which are more real or real in real life. Kristen was a beautiful girl, her lover (omar epps roommate) was beautiful, and even Remy was a good husband, she was miserable. Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were very sensitive, angry and worried characters. Although their frequent harassment and police seemed to have some right of their anger. Remy's ability to consider it seemed to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, made well. Like all movies related to racism, it is a large piece of discussion. I don't think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis however.
