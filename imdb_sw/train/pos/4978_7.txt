The most beautiful Temple of the Temple. The actors of children striking their lines seemed to be normal for that day and then. Perhaps the "appearance and hearing" needed to be done. Besides that this is fun. Due to the film period there are some aspects of this, from a social perspective, which strikes me like both development and freedom. I can't go to those here, I would not destroy them but let me look at yourself and see if you see these things. Starting as early as it was easy to see from this brief fascination which was ready to develop to the Temple. That makes it worth watching if you are a fan of the temple. For some it is a good way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your glasses of night milk to turn over the stove.
