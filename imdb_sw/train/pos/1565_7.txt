I just found the Saint Strikes back for the first time and found it very good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as Holy, where he chooses Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this, Holy has been sent to San Francisco to explore a shot at a nightclub. With the help of her friends Pastor Fernack who has come down from New York, they are helping the daughter of the crime boss. <br /> <br /> Join Sanders in the cast is Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> Not a bad movie of Saint. It should see. <br /> <br /> Testing: 3 out of 5 stars.
