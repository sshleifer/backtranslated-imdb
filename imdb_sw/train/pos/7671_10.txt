Dr Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done again! Anton Mordrid has been in the world for 100 years waiting for Kabal, the evil witch, to come to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used training as children, so Mordrid knows all Kabal's techniques. The film is a bit confused and starts, but soon you hear part of the action. I will not give you an end, then go see Doctor Mordrid! I have found a movie very enjoyable because it doesn't have much violence, nor sex. The film described the plot and that's what I liked! I see the most beautiful films that seem to look at the times. This is because you have been inserted into the film. Doctor Mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie! I offer 20 out of 10. Value to see! <br /> <br />
