I remember first looking at Sabrina during the TV in the UK on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am now 24 and still like now as I did when I first looked at it. I get a little stick from some of my friends to watch yet "children show" but I don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal character and later Morgan also became my dear characters. I remember spending a lot of time looking at various special events to honor Sabrina at the British TV channel Nickeleoden. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, was the principal in "Clarrissa Tells All" but better in this. I was beaten when they decided to finish! I hope soon to be released on the DVD here in the UK - I will be the first on the line! lol x
