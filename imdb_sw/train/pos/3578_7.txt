At the age of 12 Arnald Hillerman accidentally killed his brother Eugene. His feelings are caught by the fact that his family cannot interact with him (or feel wrong to do). His sole use is his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have compassion for him. Realism will attract "2-life lovers" film lovers, but will not satisfy those who want to act with threats.
