I have seen almost all Cynthia Rothrock's films, and for me this is funniest. It reminds me of the first movie Jackie Chan. True, Rothrock Girl can't be the greatest actress, but it's very nice to look like a military artist and as a very beautiful woman. This film, while probably not the best movie, was more entertaining.
