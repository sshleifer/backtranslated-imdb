Usually, when we use the word "refugee", we mean it is bad; The great version of Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" screen proves that "runner" can be good. This is actually one movie of entertainment. As the top head, the yellow fabric, the head attitude of fear, Beatty builds a detective that we can involve all: ready for action, but not without its weakness. From there, other characters are around the world themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as interesting as one could expect any player of the crime to be; Mahoney's Madonna (Madonna) is probably the most amazing person; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is an average villain: ruthless but cold. Those characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), who are more than 88 music Keys (Mandy Patinkin), and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also watching. Oh, wait a minute. I haven't told them a plot! The program involves Tracy trying - and failing so far - finding the way of the Boy Boy Boy. At the same time, some of the most incredible events have continued in the city, answers that may or may not be closer than anyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty had trouble doing his age, then he made good use of it here. "Dick Tracy" is one cool movie.
