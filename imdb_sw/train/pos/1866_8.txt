A great story, according to a true story about a small black man with all the problems along the road. Since this is the first movie of Denzel Washington which he himself could lead directly, I must admit I was worried of tad, but who is not ..? But again, he is a good actor with many years of experience, and the final result has been great. The story is told in a good way, to make you a problem during your childhood, and a young life, to see yourself in these situations. So, it makes you hard, letting you know not only going to hell. For all, the story of touching about the boy tries to make it in this f *** ed up the world. (The story is based on the life of Antyon Fisher, born 3. August 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who is also the author of this film) It was highly recommended. 8/10
