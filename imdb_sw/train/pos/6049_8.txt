Freebird is a perfect marriage trip on the road, the head of the group, "hitting" film and feel good-movie of the UK. It is an interesting character who puts this film away from other films in this kind. Star Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and makes their characters identical to the truth. The main story circles their journey from London to Wales, and adventures and mishaps occurring along the way. This small film also has a good heart - not only for cycling fans, because it takes into account the characteristic of each other as well as dreams and regrets, such as Gary Stretch's Fred who wishes to leave the family. The movie is also great - a letter of love for the Welsh country as well as grittiness of the streets of London and the usual life of pub in the cities of the Welsh country. <br /> <br /> Beautiful, beautiful sounds, wonderful sounds, suitable characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird to heart!
