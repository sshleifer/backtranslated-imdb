I have seen this film many times and every time I look I can't help but accept it. Gunga Din is one of the most common movies that took place in the Golden Golden Years years when the characters themselves had to draw the audience to the movies without having to rely on the wonderful effects and the man made "monsters" carry the scene. The natural charisma and comraderie shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is a very interesting and entertaining effort to watch. The language and language behavior in which three actors perform their work efficiently and effectively. Others may regard it as "corny" but I find that the "classic" film works fine. One must remember when watching this film that Europe was involved in War and Germany and the audience went to the movies to avoid the fear of war and interest and sent to places where people were bigger than life and doing heroic and good works always could win over evil . Gunga Din does it perfectly by allowing the audience to laugh and with the actors during their tough run. In short, his classic film that does not take itself seriously and does not want viewers either.
