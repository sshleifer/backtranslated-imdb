first, I'd like to say that, when I know my part about star wars, not fanatic. I don't know how many chromosomes Wamp Rat has or extended family of TK427. what I know is this: the star wars, all the movies (less so for part 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what Lucas has found and dreamed for courage, but it works. Star Wars are more than a movie. is an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I will say. Star wars touch on the discrimination of the whole world, good and evil. it makes it clear, to a large extent, that any real person from any environment can understand. The VI period is very effective, and concluding the epic struggle between a child and his father who is used by a working man, but also, with the addition of prequels, shows even more for the story described behind. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader forward, and viewers feel that it's a story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was an amazing depth for all. it felt true, as that the capsule dropped from heaven to the head of Lucas, giving the historical details of the galaxy far, far. Star Wars are definitely something bigger than normal, and I must admit, whenever I see them, especially this, I feel very small. I feel like I have found a world where good and evil is very clear. I get the feeling of screaming when I see them, the feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing can hope.
