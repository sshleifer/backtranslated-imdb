"Zu: Fighters from the mountain of magic" was and is an amazing classic! You will never think it took place in 1983. The use of Tsui Hark's special effects was very creative and innovative. (He continued to do this in the Chinese trilogy of the Ghost Story and later production.) Even now it can measure up to other movies in this kind. "Legend of Zu" is connected to the "Zu" fighters from the mountain of magic! "It is not necessary to see this film to understand the plot of this. Tsui Hark would do if he laid his hands on CGI Now we know, made this film. Maybe sometimes it is many but the general result is so nice that I don't have to be important on that. There's a lot happening on the screen, you just don't believe! The great disgrace that this movie was not shown in the movie in Holland. Because this movie screams for the screen time on the movie! This movie can vote a lot of Hollywood budget like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I can mention to mention In many films Tsui Harks combines the game, fantasy, military art and humor, somehow it's not in this film again. The gend of Zu "offers on the front point and the most positive effects you will see. Classic indeed!
