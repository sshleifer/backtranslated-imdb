Esther Williams gets her first role of MGM with her role and gives away something to do with a good start. This film is a modern spotlight and a whole head that can be repeated over a million times / later - a innocent girl hated a guilty woman. Esta <br /> seems to be nice and if she would like, maybe she would go to <br /> <br /> to make more films and better but according to her background description, <br /> <br /> pretty much gave the job to do marriage. In any way he is the one who enjoys and engages in his pleasure to see him in a completely different role <br /> out of 'swimming music'. Universal was wonderful for <br /> <br /> to make films and old MGM stars after the studio started to create its big names as it started to hit down the hill. Star <br /> <br /> like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others performed the first quality of the film in Universal as they still had a powerful drawing at <br /> <br /> box office. I wish Esther has done more but since she hasn't had, <br /> <br /> makes this more special.
