This film takes the story of Cinderella before the 1950s and makes it well, if it is based, the use of Isle of Man as history. Ugly's sisters have become girls of high quality English, and with Kathleen Turner as the mother of you are happy about the beautiful dress of the season. The story has been changed slightly from the traditional version: earlier it is a failure that is composed of "King Lear", and in the future Cinderella has more than usual. It looks splendid and works very well, but it goes up on a regular basis.
