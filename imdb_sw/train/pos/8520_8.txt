I thought that movie was very good. I enjoyed the act and moved well. The director appeared to understand the story he was trying to tell. I see a great budget that comes today, indeed they had a lot of money to throw but it seemed so much. When you see a film like this for a small budget you should put it in the account when you look at it. There were other things that might be good but most are related to the budget. Acting was good F / X and queues were done well. Several publications were someone who played the camera like. and the boy who played the baby. These types of films have saved LA to work and this is one that has proved the same.
