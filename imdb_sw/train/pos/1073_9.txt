It took us a few cases of "intervention" of the Angel of Darkness as a story and a series, since we were turning from The Sopranos, a system of different ideas. But, as soon as we got the essence of the series, we walked very fast. It is embarrassing that the series ended only when it started just for the best in the best community: Dark Angelwas over the TV series average. It blows the stones and stones away from the ongoing action, but the cooperation of the characters and the social impact of "mutants" reminds us of the constant arguments we face (and do) every day. That the story is set in the future continues to be advanced on top and prevents a message of anti-discrimination from our faces (therefore not destroying "fun" for those who do not like to be taught during leisure), but every event and human / social interaction continues be useful at the moment. We all do judgment, we are faced with our own hatred, but, at the end, the question of who you are lying in: you sit back and close your mind, or you go and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series enables them. For those who have never dealt with that question, this series "comes into" the message under a recreational activity. It is better well done and well written than the TV series; I've been so desperate to finish before you refuse on the top gear.
