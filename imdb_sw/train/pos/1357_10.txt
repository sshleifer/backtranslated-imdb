Wow what part! After a week saw Mellisa always making friends about Annie's friendship and Brandi I almost close. But that was nothing until you saw Mellisa's search after running. Seeing him kicking off his casting of dirt and shouting for someone to find his carpenter was something that had been a television. He kept shouting at people away to put his clothes "all else" as someone would put on his secret clothes. Are you as 40 years old and still slowing down? Then Joan begins to call Annie and Brandie every name in the book, and she gets up and stops show! Both rivers have been destroyed by the remains that remained only on this show for a long time in order to keep testing. Mellisa crying and refusing to do an external interview, confirms what the United States thinks everyone thinks, you are a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can't find my way! I like how Annie told the camera she could drive Mellisa to think her way, and then did it completely. Mellisa is the most intelligent opponent and certainly deserves to win the entire game.
