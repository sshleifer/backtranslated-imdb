this is one of the funniest presentations I've ever seen. it's really relaxing look and I was in many stitches. I think there is a reason for social awareness and this too which makes it quite interesting. if these were white girls would have the same answers? maybe you'd like, maybe you didn't? The characters do not know the limits (see my lyrics) and do not use anyone from their distorted sense of fun! There are many funny animations. My favorites are bob one builder. it's so flawed is the skill. if you would like a comedy comedy then this is for you. if you would like to put the exhibition probably is not non blonde's yet another hilarious British BBC comedy shown on TV! It is a wonderful show and the characters are offered to the public with no comments laughing loudly! It is not possible to keep the face of the direct look of mad characters and public effect! This series easily enhances to the best comedies produced!
