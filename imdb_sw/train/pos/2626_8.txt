"King of Lion 1 1/2" is given to the funniest non-exhibition exhibitions from Disney. I recently saw this film again after seeing it for many years. I remember the first time I saw I had no expectations at all and I was very excited about this visual and entertaining film. Is it better than "The Lion of the Lion"? In many ways, yes. Although "The Glory of the Lion" was not so bad, it had several problems: lack of a good script and a bad reputation, which has been affected by why otherwise the same film. Alternatively: It is good to see the Timon and Pumbaa Creativity breaks back through the way we (or indeed I) liked it in this film; in "The Lion of the Lion" were very bitter and I did not like the series of "Timon and Pumbaa". This movie would have been easy to be stupid, but unfortunately the filmmakers did not turn wrong and instead focused on making this film very often. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy alone. Color is quite good. There are two new songs, which are attracted by two new characters, Timon's mother, (recognized by Julie Kavner's Marge Simpsons) and Uncle Max, which is fun. The relationship between Timon and Pumbaa is shown by touch. Emotional displays are well connected to the story story and do not feel out of place, which can be made easily (especially in comedies). But there is something that prevents this picture by getting 10 votes from me? Yes. Although unfortunately not very much, I will say: 1. Most of the events from the first film are used in this. Personally, it was difficult to see past events linked to new ones. At the peak, some jokes become fools. <br /> <br /> 3. Story story, this is the story of Timon and although the filmmakers are trying to link his story with the Lion, it makes the screenplay feel a bit rushed. But hey, this description does not impact this otherwise amusing movie. It is only the only acceptable Disney, which should be in every film collection.
