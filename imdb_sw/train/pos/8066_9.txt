One of the best films of John Ford 'The Informer' has no great features of Western America. Instead, the great drama of Ford was known for playing at the bottom of the British actress Victor McLaglen. Former old elder, who once met with Joe Louis in the ring, announced a photo of winning the Academy Award of shame IRA Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. The plan is very simple: In 1922, Dublin, a hungry and shy man who had been thrown out of the IRA because he could not kill the information in the cold blood, he himself appears. For £ 20 he enters a friend to "Tans" and for the whole night he drinks and offers his blood money quickly to change the way of guilt, refusal, self-pity, and the desire to escape its Actions. It is a wonderful difficulty given to the very simple Gypo character that is more successful than the film. In many burly movies of burly kind of Gypo would be beaten as heavy, he could have two or three better lines and keep them so fast and the villain could be their showdown. In 'Gypo' he himself is a hero and fiancé, when the shock is in his inner trouble, everything that is open to the audience. <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel was previously held in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very common budget. The director and his associates, especially the cinema movies Joseph H. August, used this advantage in creating a claustrophobic jewel on a man in battle with himself. Apart from Oscar 'The Informer' McLaglen also won his first Ford Ford with the success of Best Screenplay and Best Score.
