At first this looks like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it became a really funny film. Former Workers Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA chose Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar win, and Golden Glove who spoke George Burns) were a great duo of comedy, and brought together to revive their hospital's sketch for TV show. Brother Willy, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin) is their confidence they can get again with no hard feeling for each other, how it is wrong. They can't find all the time, they both forget, especially during the conversation, but they do it finally. Also star Lee Meredith as Nurse in Artwork (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Daughter Al, Rosetta LeNoire like Odessa, Willy nurse and Muppets from F. Murray Abraham's position as Mechanic. I think the best line of film is Burn says that Matthau called him "son of the bastard". Selected for Oscars for the Best Orientation of Art-Setting Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Other Material, was selected BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy, and was selected for Best Screenplay. Very nice!
