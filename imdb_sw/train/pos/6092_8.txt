Classical worship is difficult to predict. Who can guess that Vision Efforts, the Fight Club, and 2001: The Oddysey Place, the movies provided by critics and the same audience on release, would be very popular? As many IMDBers, I find myself an expert on film. Unlike many of those who hated envy (confirmed by a bad rating of 4.4), I have been jealous of being one of the funniest movies in the last decade. <br /> <br /> The movie program is stupid. Negative discussions, events are limited, and the script looks like written by a fourth farmer. But that's why the film is hilarious. You see, in order to recognize the feeling of envy, you should enjoy the film from a non-detached view. <br /> <br /> Why would I like jealousy? Because the movie is bad for the point that it becomes good. This is a recipe for classic worship, and envy definitely fits the bill.
