I, like most Trekkers (or Trekkies, do not care!). "Business" is amazing. Pure view, completely different characters, new amazing pictures, pop song for intro. (I was shocked!) I can't imagine anything that I didn't like. sign for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Trip," no one misses you! Put in Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
