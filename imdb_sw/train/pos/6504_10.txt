My wife and I have looked at this series at least three times. I can't imagine how much better it can be. Is this not a "full history" of WWII? Neither the library can hold such a history but it is the best summary of the history. Many details, many personal stories, and still continue the overall picture to view. <br /> <br /> Olivier's description is very well written and, of course, has been well-presented. The interview comes from all over, but Russian, because producers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very important to own this full software on DVD. We appreciate our copy. The producer does a good job of providing pictures and actions where there is no close to any memory: There is almost no museum films and warships, for example, but still, part of this lesson has been done well.
