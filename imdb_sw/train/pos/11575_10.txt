by saying that, I mean that this is not a well-made movie but it is a very good version of a realistic and more effective experience so far. And if you're buff WW2 then this is a treat for you, because there are three from four member states they play roles in this film. It displays the best performances but then this is still as described before half of the document. I am a fan of the hardest death of our closest heroes of the second world war, and must have hundreds of these movies to show how they did that will not be forgotten for future generations. Because these children have not read books, they are watching movies. So you want an extra action, private Ryan's tax, this is true about permanent pain, strong tolerance and the fight to fight all the time they seem lost.
