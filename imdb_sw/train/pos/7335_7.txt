And Ralph Bakshi many of his films seem to be like two swords arranged. You will find something unusual but only you should put it with silly and cheezy unwanted. The Lord of the Rings was a great mix of stories that perhaps did not always shine in the animation department. Fire and Ice are a good success from Bakshi from the animation view. Rotoscoping is much more information and animation you have to look for power. It still finds some of the best fragments of cells and painting images of the past but the top-all looks well better since the last epic of the epic fantasy. Animation is close to the true and natural style, and contrary to the LOTR where this style is often contradictory with the actual content, here enhances the unique film status. Unfortunately the film cannot create a meaningful story from its simple environment and actually most of the characters of the characters are very clear. Lorn and Tigra are simple events but even Necron's great wife was hard to follow the guy and the Furry Face Mask (also known as 'Guy'). Even though most of the sound actors were correct, there are some odd quirks in the listening and Tigra department especially looks really scary whenever they shout. However, I believe that the original nature of natural entertainment is increasingly unnecessary implementation of the secret line. A large cover of characters is something that you will not be able to get more but it helps you to remember that maybe this film should not be taken too much. It's still hella cool and realistic.
