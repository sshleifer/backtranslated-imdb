With the opportunity to view some of the Slavic Village-Broadway pictures I couldn't wait to see the last copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this film on the last Friday of Cleveland, laughing loudly for a long comedy! It's a great slapstick. The brother of Russo did a good job. The whole Casting performs a good job of comedic ... There are no slow or dry groups ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is as good as a refugee safe in this flick. I was the most influential by William H. Macy as a fool "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" put you in "stitches". I believe they have funniest responsibilities in the entire movie.
