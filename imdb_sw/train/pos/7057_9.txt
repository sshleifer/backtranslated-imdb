As an adult I really enjoyed this. I looked at it with my two grandchildren aged 3 and 2 and was impressed by a 15-year-old man who hit a mouse. <br /> <br /> Music is fun and animation is amazing. This end does what the return of Neverland did not fill. Good tracking on Cinderella's story; but what of Drusilla? Another good? I hope so!
