I really enjoyed this film. (Why was he surprised that it had a low rate from many users on this site!) I don't say it is the center of the movie but it was a good way to spend cool, snow on Saturday night. It's amazing, painless, and great corporate stories with women of friends living through difficult times and bad things that girlfriends love to do for each other! (The desire of women, we have already been!) Bill Paterson shines as Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell proves that he can be a good actor when the role is the same as he sets his mind. (And indeed, there is "better to get rid of the wedding" that I have ever seen or dreamed in this film ... more than anyone I have ever known!) You will laugh and cry - do not ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... is a secret gem which would have done TONNES of office box. (now I need to look around to buy a copy!)
