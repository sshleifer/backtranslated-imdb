I first looked at the Walking movies When I was 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a good job, they must have a sense because since watching movies, I have tried to learn a lot about the real Buford Pusser as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me a cold and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I would just like that he was alive today and that there are so many people like him. I would like to thank him for refusing all crimes and to be brave. I am so sorry that his family had to go through such fears and pain. My heart comes from them. So from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and 3 Walking Tall's web sites and actors who showed him, please don't be impressed with the movies and actors, they would only try to let us know a good person The real Buford Garden had a big family he had. And for all the young people who may not feel much about Buford, I tell you to watch Walking movies and learn more about him.
