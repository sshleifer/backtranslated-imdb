When I think about this film, all the parameters that come to mind in some way relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, fragrance, color, so I think this movie should be judged for the issue. Look at the rich tons of gold around the sleeping young women with fire, or swimming in the turkey, with a flood of your senses with a sense of joints, leather, soft soft, fragrant oil, hot fire, satin rustle. Don't just look and listen, get in, then the droning voice of the journalist will let you know.
