This document opened my eyes why the UN foreign people thought about the September 11 attacks. The future of this tragedy is examined from many countries and perspective. I believe that this film should be distributed more at this point. It also helps in the healing process to see something else than information on the terrorist attacks. And some pieces are funny, but not abusively so. This film was highly recommended to me, and I am experiencing the same feeling.
