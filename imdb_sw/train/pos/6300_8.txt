I loved this film. I thought it would be easy to look, and easy to forget. I ran after watching this purchase DVD, obv is not easy to forget! <br /> <br /> Script is brilliant, and casting cannot be more perfect. Each character has their time, and the hard work on this film, the comedic time had been seen. <br /> <br />
