It has been several years since I got this, but remember and would like to see it again. It's kind of being "cure" to me for my own experience. A thirty-five-year-old man wails over a high school game that "missed the ball" and his team is lost. He thinks about him 20 years later, "if I want to hit the ball" and how his life will be better because of it. Then, gets the opportunity to know .... and gets a little more than he did. It reminds me of when I was in secondary school, twice I tried for us to dig / dance a team and didn't do it. This team was the closest thing to evil in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that." I did not try until the last two years of HS and after the second time, I used it very hard. I would like to hit and break my leg wrong before experimenting and wearing cups to cover the harvest, and that has led me to do not. That was 1987. For many years, even now sometimes, I think "If I didn't hit my foot I couldn't wear those stupid tights." Now the skirt and I think my life would be better or even better than I did, but seeing this movie made me realize that we don't know exactly how different things might be by changing something a little bit back. Who knows, it would change the period of events to the point that I did not meet my father's father. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who has at the same time liked they could change. Be careful what you want!
