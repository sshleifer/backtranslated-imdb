I must say so, by looking at Hamlet's view of the student, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is much better. His commitment to staying true to the original writings must be applauded. It helps to play up to the screen, and makes it easy for people involved in text when looking, as we did when we learn, follow and analyze text. One of the things I have heard is often being charged is to make Hollywood titles in play. I find that this helps the audience to identify the simple characters, as opposed to having all the participants who look and feel the same that helps in the common confusion associated with Shakespeare. Also, its change helps to delete most text predictions. Just as the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia went to why and why Fortinbras occurred only in the last castle. For all, it is not just that this version has good performances and all actors who know and don't know Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that a person is not supposed to be Ph.D. English book understand and enjoy.
