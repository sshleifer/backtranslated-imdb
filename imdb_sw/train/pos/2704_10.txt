I have been disappointed, if not surprised, for lack of thanks this film has received. Once again, Billy Zane proves that he is more than a good boy of Hollywood in a quiet performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos. Making this silent film is correct, because there are many music and sound. It has a manic speed and is filled with sufficient skills that Ed Wood finally started to be counted. Look at the list of throw, and realize that everyone shines. No one present just to show their face. I believe you're all in the film showing their appreciation of Wood, and doing a broader variety, the physical act does not appear on these many days. But, today, viewers are trying to figure out what's going to be more hit than they show any kind of eshetic thanks for the movie. And IWUETDID does not have a sensible alert audience. It was made more due to the love of the script of Wood. Even after his death, social parasites caused the most serious blow, and deprived of a little classic world. This is a very fun and realistic film that deserves to live, at least on DVD.
