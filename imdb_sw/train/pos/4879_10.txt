The Chinese pastor who denounces the national arrogance of arrogance, the rule of ruling rule around the king in pre-Japanese army, is accused of being a 'communist' and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and her ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a great image built on the reputation of the mother's role in human history. Yoshinaga is not under the role in the role of the head and it was a great scandal that did not have the Oscar of Asia for the best female role in 2009. It went to a little girl with very little power. This feature is very progressive and the 'human' element must be seen for all true children in the world.
