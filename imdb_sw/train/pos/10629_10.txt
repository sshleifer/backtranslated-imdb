Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster, and pot cut. . . If you don't care about psychological or horrible thoughts, and you have a special place in your heart to mislead, this is a film for you. The first amazing modern, "The hate of the minute" has the most common embankment as "the Tranquility of the Lamb" and tribal ethnic groups as "Dark Army." Editing and effects have been done well, much better than many types of films. Kallio presents a hard story of suffering drawing throughout the Bible and the Poe text. While a large budget, the big name of the name is not very much in the way of the substance, the independent film has revived this reputation of death. If you like Michigan, a good story, or a good desire you may look at "hate minute."
