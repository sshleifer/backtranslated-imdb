Season after season, players or characters in this show seem to be the people you would like to like. What? Does this show that it has been caused by that or has been selected the same? Each section defines the individual and ends up being killed. You are happy to see them decreasing though they are very bad and sick. You are happy to see them breaking others, they find themselves, playing dirty, getting, running and finally taken by Trump. The amount of tears also appears to be growing in season. The gift that attempts to pay compensation and previous humiliation is also greatly reduced. In the new season, it's like "You are meeting with xyx who will teach you about uvw". The characters are annoyed, together with each other, that you wonder if the executives were paid? Only a good man gets to win. Watch out for your conscience. Those are your colleagues in the firing line.
