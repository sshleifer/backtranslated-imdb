Very interesting quiz. The best movies of Tim Burton ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & Chocolate Factory. Movies, notes, music, outdoor sounds all Tim Burton. There is a need for a relationship, or a great influence, I've never investigated enough to know where. As I saw in the sessions, Anna Friel plays poor Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see him on the screen I see Zooey. Don't make a mistake, Anna Friel does a good job. Her character is sweet and very interesting and you get the conditions easily. It is more than a problem that I continue to think "Why did not get Zooey Deschanel". Lee Pace is doing a great job as well. I kept trying to remember where I knew and just go and look at it. Wonderful! A great, short-lived series of 2004. If you like to enjoy Daisies you should go to the tax, which are other than Brian Fuller ?? hmmmm <br /> <br /> Loved to see Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little shop awesome) again. Two low-quality traders who do not fail to bring to their exhibition.
