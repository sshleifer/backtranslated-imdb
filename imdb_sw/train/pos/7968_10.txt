I saw this film first when I was 6 or 7 years old and I wasn't sure it was something special. Then as I continued I watched it a few times and began to grow on me as I started to understand the film values, which I would come later. For a while I left this film alone and I didn't have to look for a moment. While you are looking for an ancient movie to watch a few weeks ago (now it's 15), I dug VHS's bound home. After this look I was left on the nature that I could not tell the truth. The movie gives you a great feeling of joy that you look forward to. Film films of three different animals completely cooperate to find their way home sends messages to home even no matter how you different you can find common ground, something that you need all. The way of involvement of the characters is very special. Since you have a wise and experienced wise retriever, look at or lead the 'space' love of happiness if you are a young American bulldog, a clever sassy, ​​dangerous but confident. The film tracks these friends or three friends on a journey that is unlikely to create a magic because it begins to believe that this trip can happen. I don't want to talk like a soft tissue painter when it comes to the film I assure you it is the opposite, but the uplifting part of this film is without shadow shadows coming back, when the shadow tries to escape with space and sassy, ​​with pain is told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is silence until the shade of limps on the horizon for fear of all. There is a narrow line between heart and corny trash but this film is a pure magic even at the age of 15. This film cannot be Lord of Rings but by Disney to produce this amazing film by using animals and to lift it in how it makes even in this age is 10/10.
