This is a movie for those who believe the movies is the seventh art, not the entertainment business. Lars von Trier builds the state of the German night after quite a stirring battle. You are getting into a dream and you are allowed to go only to the last features. The plan comes second, but it is still an exciting story and complex issues raised. It's very strange.
