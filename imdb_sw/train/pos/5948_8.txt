Some of these banners appear under the crash because this is not Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly does not pretend to be either. You will look long to find the largest fan of Rodgers and Hart than me but Burke and Van Heusen did not have the most typed liver than what they knew Der Bingle in and enjoy some great songs - But Good, Moon Month Comes, Always You, Future forever, etc. - in line with his personal style and here they come with other good - and unbeatable - ballad, once and for all, with a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite in If You Involve Your Toe on Moon and Busy . The flimsy plot does not mean to be taken seriously - why else do Merlin heavy when most, if not all, of other versions he is a friend / counselor for Arthur - so if you start to wonder why Sir Lancelot has been bought by historians as a matter of The humor and honesty when you have passed on the abuse school you do not enjoy much of what is basically an enjoyable movie. Equally makes what it does to make, pleasing, very good luck.
