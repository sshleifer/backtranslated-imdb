My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Alternative films and films (a small venue, and uncomfortable seats; the public had to wait while film writing was changed) were the perfect match. There were many buttons used in the film, but Fassbinder presented it with cunning that I saw them very much. The voice was also brilliant (sometimes returning louder than talk). Everything was seen to be the right place. And I loved how the war war had been presented. True happiness! <br /> <br />
