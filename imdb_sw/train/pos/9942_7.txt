The best Korean film about Taekwondo is not only, but what it takes to be good, if the way to fight it cannot beat a man of taekwondo in his game because there are rules, such as there is life and school and this film has less than this idea. The military art in the film is not good but it can be fun and enjoyable. Friends who continue to achieve something that they would soon be able to have power through mind and heart. This film does not mean to be taken too much if it has slapstick, but it also carries the message. <br /> <br /> beautiful video again from Korea.
