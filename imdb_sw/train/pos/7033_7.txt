First of all, do not call this remake of '63 film. Although this version is a truer on the play of action, it is very long. Compose was good and some different. Chyna Phillips is not a good choice to throw. He was about 30 when he made this film, and it was difficult to believe he was a boy. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but over time he gave me a head. Tyne Daly is winning his place as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was as wonderful as Harry McAffee, and demonstrated that he could even hold tune. As a '63 film, they gave us anonymous Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch was delighted with his role as Birdie and showed. I have even a voice of voice and I would listen to his voice. So what made this polling for TV? It was a long one. They place in new songs and events. Although some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Let"), was it so important? Now don't be wrong, I liked it, but instead of watching the '63 film (see my opinion). This was just the case of other actors who perform responsibilities, making changes, and again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with music and music. Give him any lyrics and can sing. So here is my advice from someone who has made a few contributions to Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch entertainment taking on the play, see the '63 film. If you want to view a version that likes to play, see the '95 version. Just take it in volume. Don't be a hero and try to watch all in one session.
