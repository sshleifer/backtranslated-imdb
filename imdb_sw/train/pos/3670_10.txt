I lost this film on the DVD without knowing what to expect - and if I was going to study film making in Canada everywhere, I would certainly bring this to class. The story, based on the most non-unlucky film team in the history of the film itself, has been written brilliant and very talented actors can give each punch at a time. If you could not laugh at "Hollywood Hollywood" I suggest you see a mental health professional immediately - you can have serious issues. <br /> <br /> In addition to a good script I saw also a great chemistry among actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where do they just do? Jennifer Tilly (playing bad actor) with Martin Landau, also offered very good performance, but still performance. <br /> <br /> Great movies, even cast better.
