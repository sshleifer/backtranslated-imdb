It has not seen this 1958 film for a very long time and enjoyed very much Kim Novak with Gil Holroyd who is a real witch and aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a wizard and Gillian also has a warlock of brother named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian keeps his eyes on Shep Henderson, (James Stewart) who is linked to the girl will go; Gillian traders describe magic and cats and change his mind about his planned bride and then becomes full of desire and love for Gillian. The story says that a real witch cannot fall in love, mix or right and this begins to prove a serious problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided to do something about this situation. A great film of regular viewing and great classic film from 1958.
