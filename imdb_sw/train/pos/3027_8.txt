I watch many movies, good, bad and different; there is usually something of interest to fix, even if it's just setting a design, or a reliable function of a good character actor, or a fortuit laughter that happens from looking ateptitude captured forever. Still, I was completely surprised by this film, one that I have never seen. Graham Greene has been translated into the film often of course, in masterpieces like "Thin Man" and in low cars. The "secret registry" is one of these small vehicles, but it can find me elsewhere, despite the lack of chaos, the Bacall and Boyer exhibition displays as (respectively) Britain and Spain, and almost no complete of any chemistry between two leads. Somehow, this last "problem" begins to work in the favor of the film, for how love can expand the truth in the state of the fascism of the massacre and the bourgeoisie meeting on one man's tragedy? The most compelling feature of the film comes directly from a complex psychology of Greene, which surrounds the film. I know others see the intentional strategy here as gentle, and I can understand it. However I found that plodding accentuated rather than react from what the claustrophobic universe. I was obliged to look, not to any good executive (though Boyer is amazing as usual, he can combine a combination of world wealth, desolation, optimism, and power for his good voice and pleasant eyes), but for less- growing escalation of small hopes of one person against the world of oppression and money. What is a thief? Is love good for the face of death? Where only the end of profit and exploitation begins? The film is not available at the level of art, and so it can not expect to answer these questions, but it is more than just entertainment, and its killing and guilts are widely supplied. Lack of glitz, the "bubble," of "hitting" notes helps to make this film very useful. And there is no end to happiness, for the last recorded history.
