If anyone asks whether movies are a form of art, you can do worse than explaining this film. <br /> <br /> Just before it is a perfect mix of stories, script, artists and movies at any time done by cells. The experimental story of the winner of the bombing missed by his heavenly pilot in the English mist during the second world war, with his future brides and heavenly powers (or is on his head) ) is played with panache by David Niven and Kim Hunter and it involves a lot - especially in the opening events when the attempt to lose (Niven) describes its problem with the radio operator (Hunter). is made by photography by Jack Cardiff and amazing production designs. The top touch extends to the heavenly shots that appear on the black and white color and land presented in Technicolor - this is even referred to by the fantastic Marius Goring. <br /> <br /> It's not just highpoint in the UK movies, but highpoint in the cinema, period.
