One of the best features of Gilliam's films is that well-designed exhibitions, back-up, and bothering characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of many movies (where a movie producer is a director-employer who is paid for a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "12 dogs" is evidence of the vision and style of Gilliam, as opposed to making films for themselves. "12 dogs" are different on Gilliam's similar repertoire: strong / overcrowded society, the main character of the protagonist, the excitement associated with unbelief, and similar situations. In this film Gilliam performs the best of the lines of confusion between the two areas, using the complexity of compelling listeners to believe rather than know. This gilliam direction of filling up certain shortcomings causes the ridiculous criticism of the gallery. The difference between Gilliam and the art of the art is that Gilliam's choice has both meaning and all its images are meaningful. Two of the closest Cole swimming at the beginning means to draw a comparison that leaves the weaker audience. His head is a symbol of equality in the future of the disease, but it recognizes him in the world of 1996. The title is a symbol of the creation of Gilliam, because it requires many stories to the body so that it can be fully understood. For all, Gilliam's commitment to making films that are interesting yet still require ideas and interpretations from the audience. The movie has great value to look at, because there are tricks and tips that can be lost during the first look. Certainly one of my favorites.
