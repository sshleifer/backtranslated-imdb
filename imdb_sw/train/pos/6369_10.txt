I loved this movie! I am happy to see if I am a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed it. The action takes to run at the beginning of the film and just continues to go! This is a bit of departure to Disney, they don't spend much time on character development (my husband said this) and there are no music numbers. It is a very interesting step. I really enjoyed it and recommended it to anyone who likes Disney, young or old.
