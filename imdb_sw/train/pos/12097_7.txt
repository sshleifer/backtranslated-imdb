This hard story begins simply, with an English journalist accepting a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend the night in the Blackwood fragrance fortress. Immediately, the writer circles the dusty rooms and zones, until music and photographs of a couple of waltzinge take him to an empty room. He sits on the harpsichord and starts playing the tune he heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder and beautiful wonderful Elizabeth Blackwood. He informs him in a beautiful / beautiful way that he has prepared his upper room and that man always expects this night ... The Night of the Dead. So it begins a series of amazing events that convince journalist all night. SPOILER INHEAD: probably not surprise many viewers to learn that Elizabeth's good is really spirit. This does not prevent him from falling in love with the journalist, but makes things more difficult for them than for an average couple. This is an enjoyable movie, and everything completely: ghosts, a spooky fortress, a constant vision of past events, sex and abuse (although both are beaten down in the version of many Americans have seen over the years.) , which stimulates Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. He has an incredible charisma with someone else who has ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
