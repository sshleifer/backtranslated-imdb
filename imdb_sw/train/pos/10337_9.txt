This movie was very interesting, I would like to have this for my collection of the 1970s harvest you must see the list again, I know this of the characters, people who have met over the years and that encourages me to find this comedy, unfortunately this was not DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a good match as his wife witch and sassy, ​​Norman's mysterious son without sure if he will have a future if it is out, Dennis Dugan a wonderful man funny. Miss Dobson hooker with heart and a small conscience. Love, disappointment, wonderful relationships of this family movie fits back to performance, play mode and a combination of events like this can and should get its way as a remake, I think getting access will be very difficult maybe impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld play the role of Dennis Dugan, this shows several cases of Seinfeld which also brought me back to Norman is that you, to keep them very closely impossible if it is impossible to fix a pretend girl friend hooker and parental loyalty. This film was a wild travel guide of cabbie, remind me of the part of Kramer takes his caddy's advice on his lawyer. (part from Seinfeld) Parents are there jaw dropping time, relaxing on fun It's screaming back to me.
