This was my popular film as a child, and I've been in the production of a few times so it will always be my favorite muscical and I doubt anyone can ever make a story of Oliver Twist on the screen, better than this one made. My baby's entire time '' bad '' must be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only was he afraid of my life from the time I looked at it as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman I can feel more of the character of Nancy, a boy / girl who helps Oliver find a worthy life. > <br /> Jack Wilde as a dodger of art, it was wonderful, and I don't think anyone can make him, like a street pocket player, and a good friend of Fagin. Music is amazing, especially Fagin's numbers, I am also very grateful they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, not to work with him to be such a bad habit. I think Carol Reed did a good job of stopping Nancy's Nancy, putting G of the movie tested by hitting her beating, but giving enough away to show Bill's violence towards her. This movie is interesting, and exciting as music singing, as well as being a moving game following a little boy when he tries to find where he is in life.
