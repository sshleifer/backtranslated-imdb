(has a little demolition) <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find a parallel between two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life", Bailey gets to see the world as if it had never been born. In the "Far Country", Jeff Webster's Stewart, by not engaging in helping anyone (except himself), gets to see the same thing: The world in which he (for all common things) does not exist. <Br /> <br /> By not participating (and by trying to take care of anyone), Webster is obliged to see those who can't help but the service causes harm, being pushed around, and even killed while having nothing. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey to look at the world that has turned to a broader because it has also decided to be involved and not to be born. Both videos are finished with the same picture - close-up of the loud bell. Stewart, by turning his philosophy of non-participation, has, apparently, got his "wings".
