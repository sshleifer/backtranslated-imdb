I have seen Man Running several times as I am a fan Stephen King and having all his movies but now it's better because up to 2 days ago I didn't know about this site and I didn't know that Paul Michael Glaser that was associated with this film was similar to Paul Michael Glaser that I grow watching Starsky and Hutch television show. For me this is a good surprise because I can't tell you how often I cried when Starsky or Hutch hurt. The part that Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died I cried harder my father had left off. What? What do you expect a child when he is 12 years old? Now, I am looking for a film and plans involving Paul or David Soul and whatever Stephen King has his hands on I'm so !!!!!!!! Except just say happy birthday Paul !!!!!
