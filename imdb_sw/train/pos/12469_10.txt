It's a good movie. I'm growing that some people think that this may not be the basis of true story. No matter this, the movie is good, and you all can think not what balloon and mermaid on it ends in a mermaid city and so on, rather than thinking that "the little girl's desire came", and this means that all our dream dreams it will fulfill if we hope in us, and do all the world to make them true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie), and her mother, were the best actors I have seen for a long time. Good for them, for all actors, both for the director. If someone can tell you this, please tell them, "A 25-year-old boy from Romania thanks for making this film".
