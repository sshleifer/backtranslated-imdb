This movie has everything. Emotional, dynamic, love, Stephane Rideau's adorable naked beach dance ... It shows a real need for corporate and external communication in any relationship. Because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple that happens to be gay does not mean there is a very important understanding for anyone in it. I will probably make it a gay film, but one that can be counted and loved by same-sex people as well as gender and gender people. The lack of Mathieu to address his feelings defines the way our society does not encourage us to act like that, and so is the result of quarrels between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see !!!!
