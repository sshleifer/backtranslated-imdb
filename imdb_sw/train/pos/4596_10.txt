This is the best film of Jackie Chan, and my personal favorite. After U.S despair made 'Guardian' led by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and put it in pig in Hong Kong. It may also be the most serious movie jackies, and viewers are fighting on bone breaks. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his staff have put great effort in the design of the fight. The bones were broken and blood was shed in the process of making this film as you will see in credits. <br /> <br /> Script is a simple cops and robbers thing, nothing special, after all written around action. I must say that the English version consists of dodbing dodgy, but it should not be too far away. Therefore, get all the young people, make the beer and enjoy. By the way, the film was known as "Mirror Story" and stunt staff. Why? I will enable them to identify myself !!
