Forget Neo and Bourne and all those frozen half made modern heroes. They only look at the age of 12 to enjoy the audience of viewers who want to become their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allowed a bunch of cakes that do not have a beard and still fill the youth want to see something that looks very much like a flick of action. <br /> <br /> However, they "practice set pieces" are very painful to watch and any girl can compete with their penis without question. This recounts the oldies on our financial screens over the last few years. For the best (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, join themselves .... did not have a beard!) <br /> <br /> I say it's a lot of time a new hero and put their last rule. This movie "Largo Winch" is far from perfect, and maybe also possible sometimes, but at least Tomer Sisley gave a very good performance as a hero of action. And only one time when he was cut off was MÃ©lanie Thierry with his beard! I'm resting my case. I did not know when I entered the sports room, but this could be the film I was waiting for ten years. For the first time in France since Belmondo, could the film be comfortable and enhanced in the B form without combining its performance. At all times we should chew it was a huge bunch of ivory or something that was also prevented from reaching the broad audience ... In other words it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, interested in you) ... "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be popular and quality of film making. I left the memorial room, hungry for more.
