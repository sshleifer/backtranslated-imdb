I for one I enjoyed seeing Jim Carrey in a film where being on was not a goal. His character is like all of us. They want more - good things that happen to us and expect God to give. Morgan Freeman made God great. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us is already ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity becomes itself. I thought the character of Jennifer Aniston was very weak and understandable in essence the person looking at television wants to be that way but it is written. I think the review has destroyed several areas of great potential because everyone who saw them knew what had happened before it happened. I have read several comments and it seems that some people are looking very little. This is a summer comedy and not meant to solve the problems of the world though there are few messages that we can all take to heart. <br /> <br /> Lovely film.
