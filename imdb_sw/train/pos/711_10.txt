"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably drop down in history as the last flick of the rebels. To show a group of high school students using Ramones music as a motivation to wake up against their chief (Mary Woronov, "Eat Raoul" popularity), the whole movie is a mile a minute. It's a great excuse for fun, and I'm sure you will. Users exploited? See. Dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eat Raoul" *)? See. Swing the mouse? See. However, this is a kind of thing that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn't know the music of Ramones, it's a good pleasure. And the Roger Corman executive producer and Joe Dante lead, how can we expect anything less? The worst secret that Allan Arkush director later declined in price as "Caddyshack II". Star PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has been seen in each of Joe Dante's Movies, and many of Roger Corman), Don Steele, and of course Ramones. Treat the actual. It looks like Bartel and Woronov are always united. It also performed collaboration in the "Hollywood Boulevard" of Joe Dante and the flick of "Chopping Mall" (also appears by Dick Miller) ... which added their work from "Eat Raoul".
