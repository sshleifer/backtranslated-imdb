I just went to this film because I was sent there and I would like to leave immediately because the audience included mostly older people and I felt out of place. However, the film was so amazing and far from considering the ancient people. All characters were real and trusted and I found myself discussing movies, characters and stories of the future. There are a few cases out there but it is important to help you understand the best situation. For all, this is a valuable and valued film - a very small size but that doesn't mean that this film cannot be interested in people who prefer ruling. It is an exciting and interesting experience of the film.
