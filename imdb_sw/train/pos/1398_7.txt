Another part from childhood that, as an adult, I look back to a different perspective. This was one of my favorite moments of my childhood, one that stopped my show of this show. However, while watching this period after 20 years, I would like to say it is one of the lighter, it is laughing with amusement and amusement, rather than the most dramatic and well-constructed stories in this first period, their first season and best . Perhaps this section was written with a R&R fan a bit too! As Mr. Spock says, the story is not logical but there are exciting lines like, of course, at the end of Mr. Spock - asking Captain, McCoy et al if they were happy with their R&R and they responded in confirmation, he raises the eye and says "Interesting. .. "just the way Mr. Spock can do that. An interesting story line, of course, the idea of ​​amusement park is really exciting (rather than a false "amusement" and is often a paradox of Disneyland, for example), being able to have someone's real needs. True, a great idea but not well done. And coming from Theodore Sturgeon, one of the best SF journalists who used the first season, someone wondered how much it was given to the script which Sturgeon turned out. Now, here's a little trivia I learned on this site: In 1987, James Gunn founded the Theodore Sturgeon Award for a good science fiction story. And I will remove others from this site: In 1968 he {Sturgeon} wrote "Fun Machine", a third script for a series of Star Trek TV {Amok Time the other}, which has never been shot. The main reason why it was not used in the series is that it has provided a special impact on the costs that would have been too much for their budget. However, the script was changed in a book by Sci-Fi author James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) and published by Books in 1996. <br /> This time still enjoys, especially if someone doesn't think much about it. Just laugh and enjoy the second part we can return great things to protect the world.
