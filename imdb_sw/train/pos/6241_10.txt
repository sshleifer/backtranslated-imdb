The first time I had many responses of people who remained after seeing this: shots that people sunbathing oil, etc. were cheap shots through. Well so does the arbus diane meets. . . Whatever it is. . . but not long before realizing that this was not done in a misleading way, since the pictures have been revealed I felt that the problem was for the whole audience: we are conditioned with Hollywood and also movies from almost everywhere you really feel that watching people over a certain age make sex is something that does not say, something that should not be shown. if this was all the film released it would be a great deal. However, the story of a woman with a bad girlfriend and her drunk friend attracts as tons of bricks: the story of animation, amazing performances, and thinking of the scene. that blonde guy is a creative actress. finally I want to contradict those who say this film is about how these people are sad. An old man who is about to do with a woman who finally plays for him is a very good character that breaks the mold, so don't let the film down. His dog is killed. this is not a beautiful picture of the world but it is not. . . completely disappointed. however I was very grateful to the film manufacturer for making such a beautiful film. I can't say every thread was as strong as the most powerful, but I say this film hits the donkey and would recommend it very much. . .
