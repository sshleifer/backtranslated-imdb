This is a great, horrible movie that takes the center of the mid-80's delays and how the evil music has appeared. I can remember that I had a young iron when I was a child. It does not help that I have found the grave of dirt in my town grave when I was ten. He is looking for this iron child who was wearing old bodies and used their bones for a wonderful sacrifice to Satan. So maybe things like to keep him out of metal for a while, but I like now, as a 24-year-old. All about the strong demon power. And you gotta love the area where gita shoots lazers and vaporizes the headbangers in the crowd. This movie is awesome, if you like 80s and bad movies, this is for you. 9/10!
