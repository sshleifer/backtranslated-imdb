What Is Good About It: Some of the most effective and realistic effects that will get under the fan of the fan of the season. It does not depend on the sound of the hackneyed voice coming in its "gotcha" time. Even if you have seen everything, there are still a few things in this film that will help your jaw drop. What could be better about it: Work was, sometimes, flat and powerless. It had a quality of "shooting-on-video" somewhere (though, largely reached a situation that was struggling), and the camera function has been completed with unnecessary useless plans. Although the effects are real, I think they would go to the well very few times with some of them. At last it seemed to run away, and explained what could be more time-consuming. The viewer is left to do many things for himself, not as a challenge with filmmakers, but because they are lost. <br /> <br /> Still, a good film of indie which is several steps easily on average. Indeed the value of the lease.
