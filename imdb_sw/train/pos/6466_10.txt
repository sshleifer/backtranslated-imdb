I loved this film and also the audience I saw along with Los Angeles. After the film, many people were crying and saying how the film affected them. I can see why it was the biggest hit in his country, Sweden. The film is well-mannered and the behavior of everyone was carefully planned so that you will eventually know these people and care for them. Music is very common and the main song in the film is very breathing but encourages. It should suggest this film for everyone to see - even people who do not usually go to movies with headlines. He certainly deserved the Oscar Selection because of the main theme of the film emerged without pretending in the small community of the city and people of everyday. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the possibility of a human spirit. YOU WANT TO GET!
