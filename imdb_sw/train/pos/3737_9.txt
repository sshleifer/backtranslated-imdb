First, this movie was a wild journey all the way. The story of soldiers training, fighting with their chiefs, and finally pulling together. Starting from beginning to end. This is one Drama of War worth seeing if you are for a constant encounter (sometimes more than a reason) and fear of boot camp. The system of how participants interacted was wonderful sometimes, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story, from camp to Tigerland, and even at the end to help him. The free design of the creative hand added some taste or taste of the film. Keep moving, regular action, and constant frustration. Sometimes, it was help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> In all the film, it was becoming increasingly true. Some points in the film (mainly sex gifts) seemed to be just tad too though they added the effect to the movie that would not be there without them. It was a very false movie, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the best Colin Farrel movies (if not its top performance). Acting for each character was very good. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
