I liked it! Fred MacMurray is as wonderful as Skid Johnson, who is happy, proud at the same time a very dangerous saxophone player who loves Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there. They meet in Panama after Maggie comes with the ship and ends at the bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony is hit in the nose after his insults Maggie think of a free woman - all because he removed his hat from the public. Great by Maggie to finish stuck in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are better together. Maggie always in her when she needs it. He urges him to go to NY (see the film and find out). They have these amazing events together where he sings in his hands when he plays saxophone. I certainly recommend it.
