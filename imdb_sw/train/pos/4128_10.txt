For all the violence on TV and in local news, it is comforting to have a non-violent show or adult language, it is still entertainment. My kids expect to look with us every week. Each of us has a favorite chief and favorite judges. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We love to learn about the history of the main ingredients, unique vegetables and season. We play together at home to say who the winner will be. <br /> <br /> It is a good time for entertainment, as well as news. The best in our hussle, the bussle life, is the time that the family uses together.
