Director Samuel Fuller concludes the brilliant appearance of knives: cockpack cocky unwittingly raises microfilm from a woman's bag; it turns into a letter to the Communists, and now he and the grifter are looking at the police. Noir's film system is all its glory - pre-ingredients that clich√©s - including water areas, floozies, saxophones on sound sounds, and hell one of the fistfight fierce. The exhibition of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are the same on target, with a smart, bright script is colored color. The Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar selection for an obstacle to help the role as "professional stoolie". Interestingly, the sky, hard as nails. *** from ****
