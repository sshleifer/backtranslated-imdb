This is one of the most unfamiliar movies, beautiful and compelling, dignified and quirky, real gifts. I see it is important for any trip to Italy, or any holiday at all, because it reminds you of the birth up to a wider experience (yup, getting magic). I loved Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every leading guide and assistant is perfect in this film. In addition to clothing, if you are attracted to fashion and clothing, it is very good. I just want to bring it back to the DVD because I wear my outdoor version! It's absolutely worth your time, just make sure you stay in to watch it, without disturbing it.
