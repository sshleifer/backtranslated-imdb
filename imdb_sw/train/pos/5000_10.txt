The comforts in the United States should be given on a different network, or at least be given the opportunity to have their full events. Unfortunately, this was not so. Given that the US viewers (apparently) are cautious of spraying tomatoes during unhealthy humor caused by badly, or are concerned with the scattering function (both voice and smell), it shows whether this will be a few and far between. One of the biggest problems is that it is strange, it was made to anonymous audience who knew what to expect but they looked at the audience and board rooms that had no clue to what they were looking at. Which is sad, but not expected. I would like to see at least three more seasons of this show even if it was released for the release of DVD directly. Materials and cooperation between the creatures were rich and limited and there were other talks waiting to be under the face. But because of the political accuracy, the dialogue is done only in my mind.
