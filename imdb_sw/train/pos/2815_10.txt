They can't believe my eyes when reading a bunch of comments and other comments. As was the odd film of a certain dudes to run. <br /> <br /> Movie is beautiful, beautiful, high, high on the violence though with a minimum, and all the powerful way to the base. He loved every bit. It cannot remember any uncomfortable things like this made by laughing and military art. And now the most important thing (at least for me): is the free computer effects. When I look at other Hollywood actors to remove it out on the screen in a modern high-resolution and damn action on "budget" fuflo "(the Russian word that means" cow cows "), I understand that any * baby beep * can do this - you can adjust the wire to the body, add the effect of a good PC, and insert it into an action film. The game "Chinese football". And it's just a little of Hong Kong movies made for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Have a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with the movie This is not possible to mention the most beautiful performances. Some of you, I think, does not like. Like me - it's amazing. Look at a dragon friend who speaks boldly to criminals and suddenly gets punch punch on his side left of the head. His facial expression is transformed into something modern and comes to the dragon for child expression. And look at the size of his mouth - it is close to one ear to another when he does grimaces. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a high level and a thousand views from people around the world. We are very grateful for our Russian industry for the release of old movies of Jackie Chan. Its modern is very weak in my opinion of humility and does not deserve much. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - movie stories in its kind. Thank you for the attention.
