Do not believe all the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes, it is done at an affordable price. Yes, gore is delicious. And, yes, acting is small. However, this is an example of the original flick, and if it's your "thing" (mine!) Then you will enjoy this. There are good things to this movie than pay attention. For one, Christopher Young's unknown score is very interesting and aggravates violence to perfection. The latter is a welcome welcome to the end of the upbeat of many movies. And finally, but not down, the environment is what made the film. The creators of this film could do the best work "wear" to put it to be more confident as a university dorm. However, if you stop this evil, the settings are good. Four participants alone in a large, abandoned building, a building ordered to wait reduced .... decreases in probability. While watching, allow your imagination to do some work and you can enjoy this film as I did.
