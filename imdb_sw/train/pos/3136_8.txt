An incredible effort to merge, incorporating the most suitable plot involving Adam and Burt and restrictions on the original TV series. Many of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from the book Burt's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I think his book was inspired to make this film. As a book, it left the fans of a series of original hunger for more. If you have missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth to borrow a tape from a friend who can write it. I'm making copies for my children right now.
