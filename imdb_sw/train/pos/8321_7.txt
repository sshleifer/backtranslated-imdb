This is a good film, even if the premise is silly. It was the pleasure of guilt to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to cancel the roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs. Volkano). That's what makes him a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, had the same ability, too, and put himself in the role, and make Einstein a pleasant, cheerful. I think you can say that both of them like to show beautiful pictures, although they love in different ways (lovely women and loving lovers).
