This was what I was looking for when the starring DS9 started. Not for a little DS9. That was a good show in its own right, however it has never given more fans what they wanted. Business is that show. While being identical to the previous journey varies enough to be the original in its own way. It makes fun of our search enjoyable again. And that was one of the primary ingredients that made it earlier to be loved. Another achievement was the relationship between the staff members. The audience was very concerned with the staff. Business has many commitments in this area as well. Chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. When sexual tension in the show can often be crutch, I feel the tension on business can cause more and say more than usual. I think when we deal with large scale characters of different races or even forms, we get very interesting ideas with television. Also, we have to recognize these exhibitions, Blalock strongly convinces as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula actually have a sense of power and character that provides good performance. Some of the presentations presented well too. My only gripes are as follows. Theme. It is good is different, but a little to light heart for my liking. We need something a little bit more. It must be an orchestral player. Maybe something with a little electrical sound can be enough. And my other complaints. Most suppliers add. They can fix this by selling less ads, or doing all that shows two parters. Otherwise we will end up seeing the last act of the exhibition is closed as fast as one of my voices of Voyager.
