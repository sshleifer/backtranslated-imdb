From the rain, late end of the early winter of the early 1920s ... where there is still sadness and many young widows and vets with disabilities from the killing of people and killing their women's dreams - known now as War The World's Great ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this beautiful Italian castle on the hill; one widowed widow who sighs her with a mixture, two women who will revive their own husbands, and a four-year-old woman who is tired with her dead dead friends ... The two and the former soldiers - almost blind - to find the spiritual "spiritual" for one holiday in early April of Italy. NOTE that they are filmmakers. Learn this film for how the situation and beauty can tell the story. (Maybe not the most enjoyable film ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Put on coffee & hot chocolate and invite girls on the last cool winter day ... Spring is coming ... Enchanted April promise you!
