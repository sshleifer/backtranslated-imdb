Now, I have seen many movies in my day, but out of everyone there are very few who have chosen me so much. I am a 19-year-old man who is attracted to this film directed to a small audience. This is a very low gem for those looking at foreign movies. Almost every acting is reliable, the graphics are of respect (which you can't even care about as you look at the film. It is basically what this film has done to me. It's one, made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel for the characters if you think, and three, it's a very promising story. At the end of this movie you will hear well. Indeed, what a anime out there did not include a little child turning to a great hero and nothing to overcome some great evil. It is a formula that is widely used. But, in this case it is forgiven because even though they use puppets for certain characters and some moderate animations would like to see 5 years ago, the appearance of it is not judged. It touches too much, the end is natural, and puts it on the film as required. If you try to compare this with other movies like "Troubled Story" or anything will vary your opinion. See as it is and you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It has been good for a long time since I was attracted to this. The only other movie I got this feeling is when I saw TMNT come back when you left. There is something about this film I saw about TMNT that really made me love it. So do not go beyond analyzing or taking this film seriously, we are happy.
