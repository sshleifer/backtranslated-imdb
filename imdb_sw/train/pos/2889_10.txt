*** You do not consider this to have a spoiler, but I would be cautious than not worry *** I've never seen this film when I was younger. I was the first time I saw my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it regularly. <br /> <br /> For the small work of Ilene Woods in her life, she was a wonderful voice to Cinderella; very interesting; very reliable. Music matches the film perfectly. Acting was good; liked the mouse! In fact "you hated" Lady Tremain and sister of action; they were just bad. The artists showed a badly damaged character. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, especially if you are in love stories. My daughter has seen movies about 25 times and still gets excited at the end.
