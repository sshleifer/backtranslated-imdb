A wonderful mix and beauty of talent among the director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as the secretary trying to save his master from the electric chairman to monitor under the wonderful "woman" amazing, and Franchot Drop as a bright creator and killers. There are also some interesting parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a trigger drum out of the trap, along with other characters who make part of the plot. If you have ever seen Rain in the most beautiful places, she has been allowed to go to the river here, especially in its events with Cook. The Franchot tone also has a very different person, and though it is not a part of the lobby, he acts. Although the plot has been taken very much, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
