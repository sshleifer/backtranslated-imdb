One whole, this film is not perfect. It does not 'relax well' together as the line of the story is basically a hook group to hit the joke. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit 'also 80s' and tend to date images. br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know the movie has something special when you and your friends still mention silly quotes from more than 2 decades later. <br /> <br /> Plus, there is a group of common faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne, and one of the last responsibilities of Alan Hale Jr., Skipper from Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> Also, there are some wonderful moments, like when Johnny sends babies with a price gun, or a Pope appears in Johnny's neighborhood. Also, the area where the fake priest makes many words in Latin is better. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, audio louder ... Post meridian, ante meridian, the width of the uncle"). <br /> <br /> Other Scenes include Ramone Maroney to kill English language Danny Devito claiming Griffin Dunne 'playing ball' Peter Boyle thinks he lost his penis a fake movie VD <br /> <br /> this movie cannot run home. But as 'Porky's', it has enough bits of comedy to make it remembered.
