That is why I still have dreams of privacy. <br /> <br /> This awesome movie (music) seemed to be appropriate for children in the 1970s. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/>. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, claims to be a dragon, looking more like a newt for cooperation, and a strike of talking of magic facing the witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered as 'a bit of alright' at that time). Sticks are found in the 'witches' contract, with witches who are gay. Dress the boy in the drag then as a 'fairy' to restore the flute. It is not suitable for children.
