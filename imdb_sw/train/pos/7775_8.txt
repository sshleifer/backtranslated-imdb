Another in them do not em like that category. This story of a family with real bones in her closet is still as pure, sometimes on a fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are on top as their brothers worryed Hadley, and they actually took the place and ran with them. Malone won Oscar and Stack was selected in support groups, all respected are highly qualified. They conflict with a leading area. Neither Bacall nor Hudson can not be called bad players, but both have had a better place and played more than they do here. It is difficult for me to accept Rock Hudson to play the red blood blood as he does here, but that's more personalized than anything else. But that does not eliminate the value of the overall entertainment of the film, which is great and this movie looks very much. If you are going to a certain night and this movie comes I will say you look at it. It's very good.
