'Round' Jack Sander is called that because he is a clerk of the clerk who fights with anyone in the audience. If they can finish one round, they win the prize - the most popular way to draw customers in past travel shows. Jack likes the girl's ticket, Mabel, though his head is turning fast when Bob Corby gets into the ring trying his place with Jack. Does no one in the war knows it is that Bob is a field, so he can beat Jack - though it takes work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to be his partner to stop and stop the drama. Later, Jack improves so much that he, too, becomes legitimate. By slowly, he uses his way up to the title until he is ready to take a Champ. Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel started running around back behind Jack - although now Mabel married Jack. So, when the final fight takes place between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. What? Is he good enough? Will you wake up against the help of Bob or prevent its performance? Enter and see. This film was led by Alfred Hitchcock and today this kind of incredible films are known to the famous director of mysterious films, behind the 1920s, Hitchcock did not have a fixed type which inspired or wrote (did this for this film). In fact, in many ways this film is a further indicator of Hitchcock's silent style, as a similar plot came into one of its next silents, MANXMAN (also with Carl Brisson as a missing man). So, when this looks like a normal pig's day's match, it is not too much for this great director - even for its large-scale expansion. Overall, when a little predictable and after Ian Hunter playing the playing field appears to be a fool, the film works well. When away from quietly, it's good to see and pack a good punch.
