Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone in the world. They live in the 1920s of Ireland, Gypo and Irish colleagues are part of the underground rebellion against Brits. One Messiah, wanted to be killed by English, returns to the city secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 payment also proves. Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into the pit of despair and intoxication. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for information. Once, Gypo, with money to burn a hole in his pocket, is their chief suspect, but they, his friends, do not want to believe. Mjazi's story is simple in its plot, but it is difficult in its ethical and emotional issues. Easily one of John Ford's most comprehensive films. What Gypo did was bad, but we can understand his intentions. We also understand his tenderness, and there are many mercy that happens to him. Script is very suspenseful, too. It is a kind of suspension where we are sure we know how everything ends, so we have to give them teeth and carry with it. Acting is amazing. Victor McLaglen, who acted in many Ford movies, perhaps gave his best performance here (and won Oscar for it). Every other executive in the film deserves his kudos. In addition to the amazing script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's films that show more. I like the dark side of Ford. In his mood, as well as in his landscape, the artist reminds me of my two popular Ford movies, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); it is similar to the grapes of wrath (1940) in these things. 10/10.
