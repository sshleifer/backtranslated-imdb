I looked at this series when it first appeared in 70 years. I was 14 years old and I looked at my friends' houses as my father did not want to look at. It was a weekly worship every Sunday, and if anyone would like to tell you to fourteen-year-old elders to look at a document in a close silence of respect, it must mean that this is something special. The fastest hit of world wars 2 makes a hard lesson for the document. The actors broke into what they found to be the most important of the events and dedicated to one place for each other. The areas that had been covered for a long time as 'wolf' which covered almost six years of the Atlantic War. At that time Stalingrad's battle had one part itself. This document cannot be made today easily because most of those interviewed have died.The list of key players is visible to give you an amazing insight into thinking at that time. Anthony eden foreign secretary, Carl donneitz, h eau of boats, Albert speer, the architect of the brave dog and future minister of arms to Hitler.in one of the future events we see in the traudl, the secretary of Hitler, who was with him in bunker it was to him that he told him the last document and the covenant - he came out of the bunker after the suicide of Hitler and running through Russian lines. And many others are doing a great role in the realities of the events shown. If I have any objection to the series it is that the bletchly gardeners' code has not been included but the disclosure of their part in the battle emerged after the series was done so I cannot blame the design makers. <br /> <br /> opening names and music are great, and Lawrence Olivier's description brings a natural attraction to the script. The best version of the document made? of course.unimissable
