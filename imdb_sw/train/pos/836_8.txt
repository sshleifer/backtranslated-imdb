This will not be possible to vote better than a year, a lot of many and hollow pits. However we are talking about a movie where a man-toddler and pastor of white bread have builders so a few vagaries should not come as a surprise. Brosnan is the best in this role, it has gone to the James Bond timber (the role he lost). If she can maintain this kind of quality I hope she keeps doing comedies. Greg Kinnear is also as good as Brosnan's direct. I have read a few comments here on Hope Davis but I thought he was as good as mousy housewife who was in the dark. There are lots of good votes like Brosnan is aware of his way and the few events that I almost die. My father (counselor) almost lost when Julian identifies himself as "runner". Much like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another comedy hit-man, humor can be very dark. If you're going to be ready to enjoy it.
