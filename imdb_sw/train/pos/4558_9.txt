MY FOOT TO LEFT, IN MY OWN, it's a great biopic on one of the world's most talented authors and writers. The exhibition had sounded, the sound was good, and the throw was perfect. I thought that Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented person, although I couldn't understand what he said a lot of time. In addition, when he screamed, I was a little afraid. Also, it is only sad that he suffered from brain damage. In conclusion, if you are a fan of death by Daniel Day-Lewis or as biopics, I strongly recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented world writers and writers. You're in real treatment and good time, so don't miss this.
