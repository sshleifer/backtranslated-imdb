The only reason I have not given these 10 stars is a form of DVD-no menus, extra, etc.. However, if you ever had a dream to do something for your life, this film is for you. If you believe yourself and your dreams don't let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most proven films that I have ever seen. And magical. Acting is good, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening chain is wonderful. This is one of those films that the "cult" status has been used to be near. I have proposed this film to all my friends. Others love, others cannot finish. Whenever I think, or feel, something is impossible to think of the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Surely you want to make more films.
