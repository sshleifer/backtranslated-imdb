I entered the film after reading it was a festival about a person with an unusual gift, who was made a monster and a community. It is worth saying I expected something quite different from what I got. But it was a surprise of joy. My friend and I all thought the movie was romantic (the fact that male leadership is not a bad look seems to be helped), and there was a steady development of the plot, action and even humor (the fact that takes them until 3rd part of the movie so far the name each one has been cutting the movietheatre to enable you to accept and invest in the story. In short: Not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I'll be able to buy this movie when it comes out of the DVD.
