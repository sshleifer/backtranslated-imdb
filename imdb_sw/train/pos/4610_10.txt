On a cold day, on December 28, 1986, two people aged 14-year-old have hired a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, seemingly interesting", "Who is Jackie Chan?", "He did not hear of her". Two hours after watching the film, in the daze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and largely out of pocket from collecting JC performances!) The film still reminds me of no other. Ok, maybe I have a soft spot so if it was "my first" (Cannonball Run does not count!) JC movie, but it's the best movie. It contains all components of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Other comments say it is dated, it was done in 1985, of course it's a date! But then Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in Rain and Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Stories where what Hollywood action would be today? PS set standards, many areas have been stolen for use in other movies. With full knowledge you must see it on a large screen, you miss more movies (yes, she has fallen under the bus!). If you have never been, see MOVIE HILI now !!!! <br />
