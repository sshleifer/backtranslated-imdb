Gregory Peck gives good performance in this film. Last 15 minutes (or existing) are good and Peck is quite fun to look at. It cannot however be said for all the film. It's not bad and I'm sure it has been done with good intentions, but just the real reason (if I was honest) to see it Peck. For others you are only better to read the Old Testament.
