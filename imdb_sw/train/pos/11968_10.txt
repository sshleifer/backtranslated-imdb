Full House is a great show. I am still today growing on it. I started looking at when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and still looking. I have fallen in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. he is my loved one. he had such a sense of humor. if there are people on seeing that difficult to watch the show, you should because you will join. I was urine after the first show I saw, which was just the first event, in 2002. it really showed. I guess the fact that this show should go down for many generations in the family. and is also great because it is a proper show for all ages. and for all parents, it teaches children's lessons on how to continue their lives. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. it's just a great stay-com. I give 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH is a good time to look at when you are sick at home or at an old office. It will make you feel better. Believe me not at home but I still know that it will make you feel better. and for everyone who thinks the show is a fool, it's very bad for you because you can't reach it even if you are happy with your life. in fact you should look at it and you will get input. I just tell you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this amazing show. well I need to go to lunch. Remember you must start looking at full house and soon!
