What I like about you is one of the series you need to see but you are not sure you will see, the beginning is cool and puts you in a series just for fun, the second part i 2-3 season which is more than a stale, comes and goes into what you want. what is happening and many are that they do not end with something special because the second part of the series always goes into the run, this is also done, the third part is to destroy and destroy the whole series, usually, but not, this end is complete for the series, perfectly suited, I was really very angry about all these in the life of Val, I actually wanted to live with Jeff last, but later changed, they chose to take Vic in series after nearly 3 season without him, and it was a great surprise and also made the series up. <br /> <br /> Seeing often the series is really cool just don t expect the second part to be good but not the third part makes what is needed and making a series of one that was worth something around, I'm happy to say I was happy with happy on the series and now I'm going to go to see the two boys girl and the place of pizza, when I have seen the whole series I will return ...
