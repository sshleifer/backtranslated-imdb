Carol, a little girl in the middle of the story, is planted in a foreign country, Spain, during the War War period for 30 years. For this girl, everything is new, foreign. The war with his father is a constant concern, while he is responsible for the culture of the region which is the years behind what he has in New York. Imanol Uribe leads this film in number. The Carol family seems to be split, while Carol's mother was married to a man who is a strong air force and leftist group, some of the family's sympathy with Franco and travelers who won the war. The story adds anything that is told, the better, but it's a simple looking movie. The amazing location of northern Spain is shown. Don't expect too many steps to have a lot of what is happening around Carol and boys who are friends. Clara Lago plays Carol honestly and guilty. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who is Carol's friend. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, a person whom Aurora had left behind when she left America. This actor, who usually heads the role in many Spanish films, has nothing to do, for he keeps getting hard at the movies.
