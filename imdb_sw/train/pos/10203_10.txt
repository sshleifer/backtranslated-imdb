I like movies and including the comics, the comics are different then the movie but still I would like to give: 10 out of 10. It was amazing. If the movies have been awesome again. I would like to have her children. And I am a woman. Read the pages you will reject. Yes in this film since Brian P. artist for him died we can not get as close as a good artistic work. I mean they have no effect on these people who did well, but different versions for different people. Strokes different for different people as the word goes. Any boy who does not stand on it is insane, or does not like women, or you just know to make a fool. If I could focus on my fingers how to love and how many times I have read the comics I can run fingers indeed, but hey there are always toes.
