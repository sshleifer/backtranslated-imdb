For myself this film goes down to me four of all time. There is no difference. James Cameron has proved himself regularly that he is the author of the story. Through films like Guests, Madons and Partners both are obviously a knowledgeable and confidential director away from the action and false science goes. He sees the story and adds extraordinary quality to the film. But Titanic is very different from its other beautiful strokes. The film promotes unique and allows space for surprise, development of the plot and the development of interesting behavior in the story that everyone knows. The story of a popular travel journey on his young trip is a legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a real, interesting and entertaining film on it. The acting acting as Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack and Kate Winslet plays the Rose became superstars once and release of this film and in the film more I get annoyed when the characters help are not given much to do but in this film it is more deliberate because as an elderly Elder (Gloria Stuart) tells her story is quickly apparent that it is Rose and Jack story alone, no one else. Emotional is quite satisfactory and can not leave a dry eye in the theater or at home. Music has become romantic and legendary. It is the best performer of James Horner ever and it offers much from the film and audience. The song has long been disappointing but I am still excited about it and this film is. Only one problem, usually James Cameron problem, is a conversation that is memorable but in such a bad way as in how cheesy is in places but all aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and romantic headings that sweeps you off in a lifetime journey. My heart is not going on from this.
