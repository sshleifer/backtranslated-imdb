I couldn't hold tears when I looked at this beautiful document. It was a heartbreak, distortion, and stirring all in one. I recommend this document to anyone who is looking for something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or just, something that will make you think. You look like John lives a few months ago of his life. You look like he keeps going through his days with a good view. One time you start to see that he is a really amazing person. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggle will make you cry, laugh, and find a very simple life to live if you only take one day on time.
