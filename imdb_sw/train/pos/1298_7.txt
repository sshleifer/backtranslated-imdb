Try and wait, after losing all his thoughts, hero, computer scientist, have no reason no longer live. No one. From a community of people, it seems to live his life as a certain kind of entomologist, learning his colleagues. all of his desires will deal with this poor man. The area is a night-club shows a wonderful relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life has never filled it unless he .... Well now the movie takes to turn more than usual to talk (Clouzot disease maybe) but just for a moment. <br /> <br /> Form is weird more than a comment There is a high t sound, one for the author who always tells the main character as "our hero", one for the hero described earlier. The story takes place, now in Paris, now in Rouen, the town of Guy de Maupassant. <br /> <br /> This oppressive movie is only suitable for the audience of information. for a very brief description of the movies mentioned by X, but because after looking at it, you may have a feeling under the dumps.
