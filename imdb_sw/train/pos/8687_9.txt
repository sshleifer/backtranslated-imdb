This was the second entry into the normal Columbo series, and it holds well today. Since I can look at it now on the DVD and see how it is built, I am very interested in the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who led the beautiful MACHO CALLAHAN with many TV channels) - see how the killings after being killed are shown in the effects of division on the two fingers on his two fingers, see how the genocide itself is shown in the connecting style, see a point-from-view shot of a corpse. Also, the symbol of wild but amazing music before the garden from jazzman called Gil Melle was amazing and has helped to create an environment. And the performance of Brett Halsey as a golf course was extraordinary - the trick and the difficulty in the role that nine out of ten would be one hub. "Form" is not yet set when this section was hit, so there is still some surprise in Columbo. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp, and Ray Milland are the best actors and are pleased to see them working - all men are coming from many other tasks still losing themselves in their characters here. For all, this entry into a series of Columbo - and MANY's others - is as well as crafted as a very good feature film.
