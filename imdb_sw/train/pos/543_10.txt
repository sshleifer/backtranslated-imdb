This movie is the best movie awesome, bar-none.I like how Stanley leaves only women in the lake. I've been a fan of the work of Judd Nelson for many years, and he beat me off. It is a mixture of fear, and rituals, and romance, not very interesting. His evil, but looking at the beauty was captured me at that time and there. Look at him in his eyes, I never forget. There's something about it, I haven't explained.
