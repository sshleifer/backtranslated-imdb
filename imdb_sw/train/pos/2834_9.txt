I haven't seen the most comedy of German, but if this film is nothing to go, I have to see more! A simple yet effective story takes two very different people from a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, a unemployed mother, finds that her husband's husband has a relationship with a wealthy lawyer's wife. I will not give anything more, but the result is a very good series of events and perfect conclusions. My passion for international movies has expanded since I saw this film first. I recommend to anyone (any adult ... do not allow the entry of young children to deceive them into thinking it is a family film) who love comedy - even those who have no language and language.
