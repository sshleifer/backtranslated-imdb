It is fascinating for romantic and interconnected items with good performers who hit each other in real time of comic, which is good to see. When Cher's spineless boyfriend asks him to help her make peace with her younger brother, a brave, no one can find the next result. Operating sign, approval of the Catholic Church, the love of the sting of snow falling ... "Moonstruck" is not available and is soft. It takes about 15 minutes for an image to run (there is an early sequence with his grandfather and his dog in the graves which are very bad, and the next area with Cosmo and an old man at the gate that appears to have been found), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with The nimble skills, and the sound of the ebbly movie and kooky spirit are all infectious. *** 1/2 from ****
