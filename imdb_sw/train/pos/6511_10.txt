As many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I would show this! I think that has done well and think through. Everything about it denotes a barrier that is not meant to be taken seriously. The form is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons and one bad guy trying to get a good man. By using shaggy known by Scooby-Doo characters it is very easy to share the viewer with physical humor from the beginning of every 30-minute session. It is a good part of Scooby-Doo which has hated fans. The classic have shorts Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy from 80 years. These discounts had their chances: Allow new content to be sold, created new fans, and set up Scooby-Doo products on the shelves. I would like to admit that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Tip!" it is not suitable for this traditional role but perhaps I have been looking for shorts of Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy have: a full-filled show that focuses on the best characters / funniest Scooby-Doo! Good features of the show: animation, sound, cautious attention, bad guys, the connection of "Best Friend" between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, regular humidity! Wrong elements: No, although the modified Hidden machine is very close at a time. <br /> <br /> Beauty Warner Bros. Animation! One of the long-lasting cartoons!
