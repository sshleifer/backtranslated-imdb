Good film. The whole photo was done in Budapest, so I am proud. My little problem is that the trains in the film were of the Hungarian Railway Station (M√ÅV), and it is clear to see that they were used in a large train, not in domestic rail - according to the story Chikatilo took its victims to railway stations local. Apart from this, the film is very good.
