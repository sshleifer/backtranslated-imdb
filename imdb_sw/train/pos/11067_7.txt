At the end of the film I still don't know if I liked it or not. That's the way it was with many of the reviewers. But there is not a bit I still feel that the movie has a value of 7 for the amount of effort laid. THE WORLD'S WARRANTY, 1. THE WORKERS AND THE WRITER. And 2. those who write and make investigators think. when here I see that GUY Ritchie took this way also in fact and left all the ideas for the audience. I felt that the film was a mixture packed with some of DEVILS ADVOCATE and CLIGHT CLUB .. it is definitely classic: something that nobody understands but admits. I do not understand: why was the (Jake Green) there was black (that's how it all started), all buttons and secrets in the movie were taken into consideration except this. If you read this review to find a solution like what this film was all about: I will set it up very late when you hit me and if you still decide to watch this film or not: then answer this first .... when you come to the puzzle written as 'no one has ever been resolved' would you like to try? I love you
