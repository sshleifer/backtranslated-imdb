Are you wondering where the romance novels and other papers are provided? According to 'Jake Speed' they depend on real people, they live adventures they write about and publish. This movie is the best family entertainment, the amount of violence, and the worst clothes. Language is also not a problem, and jokes are funny at all levels. This is 'Austin's' ability to watch 'Indian Jones', without the top-of-the-top antics of Michael Myers. I strongly recommend this film for children in 10 to 15 types.
