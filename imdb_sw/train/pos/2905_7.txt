This is a very interesting movie, easy to watch, which puts you close almost all the time. The Director's work is recognized and the kind of humor is its trademark. Film is the history of police partners as a bad weapon, but the joke and comedy are of Argentina's kind. It is that one of them is a psychologist who has played with Peretti and has to go with Diaz (played with Luque) on his job while also helping him (Diaz is worried because his wife treated him). Some of the discussions are crafty around the world: they are understandable and lose anywhere. It is very good in general, it would be worth 8, but I was rated 7 because it takes less. For personal opinion I must add that it is "bravo" for Argentine Traders, considering a little good coming soon.
