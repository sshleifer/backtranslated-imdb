Someone needs to be jaded really without being inserted into this film gem (and I have seen hundreds of Indian movies and sounds, too). Actors, beautiful surroundings, places, and surroundings, deep feelings expressed, songs turn (especially the music of Udit Narayan, favorite) - everything was interesting. The human element (fully) was also inwardly, to create a game and run copper, and let the heart decision. Alok Nath is a very aggressive actor, so clear with the feelings of the characters it shows, he almost steals the show from young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves romance really - which will go beyond the beauty on real love - like one of the best movies out there, Hindi or otherwise!
