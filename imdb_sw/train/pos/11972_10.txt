I was looking at the House as a child. I stopped examining it for years, but about two weeks ago I began to refer again. Now my children are watching the festival and they want to watch it too. My children can't believe that DJ, on the show, and I am the same age. <br /> <br /> I love so much show, because it is a show you can watch with your family. It has good teaching your children can learn from. There is also any drugs and abuse on it. Also when children, on the show, have a problem that can open their family for help. That is the message of children should get from the TV now, visit your family for help, not for drugs. Children should look more like a Full House rather than half a mess on TV now for a day. I also love to show because it laughs and falls down to the earth. It talks about the problems of real life and family issues. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote 10th.
