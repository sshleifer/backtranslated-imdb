In fact there is a lot to complain about this version of the video of Molnar --Farrell's best-looking movie in his head position, but his reading in a row, in fact, is lying. This is also facing, largely, from this counted as the first movie that uses the reuse. Seet seems to be bad. There are two good powers in this show, however: although the conversation has been beaten, the display of knives is perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, did not remember him today: especially for ROSE HOBART, where Joseph Cornell rejected the arrangement of EAST OF BORNEO for her only vote: Melford's stylish visual original melon. Its magnificent and simple beauty (though interesting) performance helps to fix some of the damage to the closed parts of this movie. However, one of Borzage's themes is the amazing power of love, and it is the custody of the heavenly pieces that do so, thanks to the access to heaven's train to go to 'hot place'. H.B. The performance of Warner here is as always, perfect. So we have here a destructive version but very interesting. I think the Lang's version of 1934 is the best, with heavenly events in the version of Henry King of CAROUSEL, remake of underwater music. But I was still very happy with this edition and I think you should give them a chance.
