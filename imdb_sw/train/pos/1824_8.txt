All dogs Go to Heaven is a movie that I have always loved. When I was a child, I was watching this every day. It is suspended if you view its IMDb level and the general view of the general public. This is not a bad movie as many say, it's a very good movie. This is good and your children probably love. Although it is rated G, some parents may find this to be a little violent. In fact it is a beautiful story of darkness, where dogs are similar to groups involved in gambling, extortion, and even bloody murder. The movie follows a dog named Charlie who escaped from the pound, killed by his old friend, going to heaven, but ended up returning to earth. Many young children looking at this movie can feel like watching a great children's movie. <br /> <br /> There are some events that can be scary for young children, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this film, it reminds me when I was a little child. I am sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, this is a film that makes it feel that way. Exhibition from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise is great, and this is the last movie that a little girl named Judith Barsi was. Unfortunately, he was killed a little while, which is embarrassing because he had a great potential and did not 't deserve what happened. Now that I know his story, I can't watch this film again because it sounds very sad. <br /> <br /> Animation in this film is good, sound work is good, and the story is good, but it's a little different from many other children's movies. This was popular during his release, but it was more closed by Mega Disney's famous Little Mermaid. This is a non-pregnant film and adults, but if you are a child, or if you grew up with this film as a child, then I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
