I don't know why some people criticize that it shows too much. <br /> <br /> It is a great, beautiful picture - maybe it's not the right material for a normal time, but still ... A lot of comedy. Help tips are completely hilarious. Private events and often Siegfried & Roy jibes are just above average, but they often have smaller squares or other links that make you open to lower laughter. This display was worth 8 pounds I paid for. <br /> <br /> rating: 8/10
