Alain Chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of the lovers of refusal who eventually get together is old, if not old, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is "old bed", happy and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to destroy his life. She has trouble, 5 sister and mother of matrix - G7 - who decides to get married. Enter Charlotte Gainsbourg that is interesting, interesting and should be a simple program. Charlotte should be like a friend of Chabat's partner and then not just turn on the wedding day. No further discussion of marriage from G7. Of course, well-planned programs have a tendency to eliminate control. <br /> <br /> There are very powerful responsibilities from Lafont as a mother and Osterman as a powerful brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br>> There are some strange events like Charlotte's first should have a charm, then a family rebellion. French farce and English.
