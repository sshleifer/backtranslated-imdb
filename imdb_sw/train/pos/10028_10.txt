When I saw this film I was shocked by the great film. This is the only movie I think I'd give a rating of 10 stars. I am sure this film will continue to be on me. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett your best. I don't think anyone can work better than Kate. If it's rainy day and you can't decide what to hire, well, this is one. You will love all acting, special effects, and much more. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie rent or buy now !!! You can't regret it. <br /> <br />
