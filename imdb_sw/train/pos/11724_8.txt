Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is hosting a cheap price. After seeing that her aunt is dead she has forgotten some things, elvira goes to England to lift, hoping it will be money. But for her fear, elvira knows that all the aunts have left her is her house, her dog and the book of cookbook. Elvira decides to stay in the house anyways, but with amazingly looks dark and its wonderful qualities, he can not live in peace. All the neighbors now turn around the city against him, and from Elvira's pride and looks, everyone looks well, because Elvira is on Fire! I enjoyed this film very, very happy to look at Elvira in all these adventures, he is very good. The whole movie puts you in a sense of halloween, certainly, it's quiet and joke is cheap but it's fun to look at it. I would like to give Elvira, Mrs Giza 8/10
