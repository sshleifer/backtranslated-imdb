This is a great document on domestic violence in Cameroon. "Sister" of the law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 were charged with male penis for abusing their marriage and defeating a divorced woman she wanted through the Islamic council. It is for a long time - about two hours - but interesting for two people and defenders and lawyers who effectively represented in court rooms led by female judges. It will leave you, as it has left me, and many questions about how these changes occurred. How did women get and when they took positions in Cameroon? What? Several events mentioned in this film had a major impact on women's general treatment for their husbands? Was it to divorce the Islamic court, against the clear demands of the husband, just one event? I don't show that filmmakers can answer these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made is worthy of audience.
