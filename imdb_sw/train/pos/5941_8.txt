This is a short film made by a fan that makes it a preview of a new film that includes Batman and Superman! It is a kind of film that fans like and look at sites like ComicCon and was made by a man who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> Apart from this film goes, I could take it off. Certainly the effects of CGI are not perfect and the dress is far from perfect. But, this was given to the budget for decline and for this fan film is amazing. I was so impressed with Superman very much - there was no little wimpy boy! If this was just a preview of the actual film - they would have the fans climbed from here to Omaha to see it. Good work.
