The film doesn't do well in the box office. I saw it in the preview of sneak. I have enjoyed this film every day. I live in 1 cities mentioned in the film that the former players moved to. It is not the best film that is put on the screen, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with the role. <br /> <br /> The best line of film at the beginning, with Robin Jack's character: "I was SOB!" It's done here if you don't miss anyone. He was happy during the DVD a few years back in the box box / box box. <br /> <br /> Not a football fan or a fan of real games. But, you don't need to be one of this film.
