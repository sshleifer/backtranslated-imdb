First of all for this movie I have one word: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best movies that has touched me, from the story with his performances, so he played so much with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very surprised by this last, because he brought deep into character, for it was a very difficult task. However, two of them formed a pair, which surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showing the way, a loving, continuous friendship throughout the day, placed in the film. The story takes time around, as the introduction of characters is long, but finally we have compensation for wonderful stories about love and humanity. If you have a chance, see, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for a long time. Just amazing - 9/10.
