A great film that requires a taste. If you work, wham my films and hate bad stories then it's not yours. Otherwise, if you would like to sit in front of a good mental video regularly I recommend this very much. Easily the best film produced in this sound century. The only one of the other Indian films is 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. However it comes second to this masterpiece.
