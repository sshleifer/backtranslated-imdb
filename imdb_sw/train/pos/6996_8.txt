This movie was a very big flick about something that affects us all. I know I have run many times. Thank you good Will Smith has gone to the social issue of text messages while driving. People, don't do that. Forty-five minutes is not enough time for this reason. Personally, I wanted to lose my mobile phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the playground saw the message and call their phone for empty popcorn bags. I decided to delete all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do so. If you care about your family, enable them to view the Public Service Publicity in the text message when driving or they can kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
