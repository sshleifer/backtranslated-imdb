There has been an opportunity for recent filing movies that I seem to have not appeared without warning before. I found this treasure on a digital cable this week and it's a very good surprise! The focus is on the founders of the surfing of huge waves from 60 of Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could only watch movies about Laird Hamilton - one of these athletes of this generation - so some are just sand. There are loads of good surfs mixed with previous and existing stars' interviews, in a good, recommended and inappropriate way. In all the interesting movies I see this describes a great story of the wave, and I think I love it. Enjoy!
