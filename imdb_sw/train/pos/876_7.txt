The super, odd film from Audiard, Read My Lipu is pulpy, lonely- thriller hearts. It is perfect for a good grizzled charisma of Vincent Cassel and has a good performance of content from Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a regular feature of Audiard in the same way as Karin Viard likes to Jean-Pierre Jeunet: very good (known to everyone if it is not possible in this film), mixed with the potential of the low profile. <br /> This is almost the definition of his role as Carla, a dog placed on the office, despised by his colleagues using his deafness. However you find a friend of exploitation, if you would like Paul in the past of Cassel. Each uses other competing talents (theft and oral reading) to fight through their circumstances and create a romantic relationship. Devos / Audiard manage Carla's attentiveness and his servant, a world full of wise, delicate. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001) Audiard already appears clearly in control of its handling on tension, action and its investments with real visceral experience which will hit the biggest - Messenger-nine years later. 7/10
