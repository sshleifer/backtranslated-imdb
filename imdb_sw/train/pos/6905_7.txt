I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his equal position. It was interesting to see how Richard Dreyfuss was concerned with changing the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and worthy of responsibility as in the past. Since everything happens because in life, I believe he had to replace the dictator because he meant to stay there for over a year he did. I think that he stayed because he had to see how his life compared to the poverty he preached in Parador. I think he took so many things in life and he needed to find a real look for staying in the country as long as he did. But .......... anyways ... this is why I have this 7 film out of 10.
