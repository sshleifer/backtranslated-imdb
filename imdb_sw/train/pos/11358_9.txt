The video video DVD video is the only reason I have given this film 9 instead of 10. That would be better, this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that reaches several themes simultaneously. If you love movies about serial killers, but are fascinated by the wonderful culture of the region in the old Sovjet Union, this film is a must-see yet. <br /> <br /> I can't compare to "Silence of the Sheep" for several reasons. The typical killer's way is shown, well done in Citizen X. You see several details of his personal life, because "you travel" with the killer, which gives you some idea of ​​the source of his frequent anger and sexual confusion. The only other movie I saw was as real as this was "Henry - a picture of a serial killer". If you were interested in the film, you need to look at Citizen X.
