“After dark, my sweet” is a wonderful mix of feelings and weaknesses. The film runs slowly, very slowly, but it takes the rythm of telling stories about murder and suffering. Jason Patric had never been strong and powerful (man gives true performance), and Rachel Ward is all just sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, psychological temperature, old footprints ... flashback scenes, weakness of Patric Characterization, all becomes a secret mystery. I recommend this one reason is the most red movie of the film that I have ever seen. See the love area of ​​love, it's a wonderful thing.
