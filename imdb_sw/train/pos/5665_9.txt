They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity Division. A little place of Mayberry-like with one little difference. Sheriff is Satan really. There is a spoiler. Not if you can't see it for 10 minutes however. Oh, but not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to stop him from doing good, but it is a war. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows Caleb and likes to spend time with him to teach him the dark ways. Without doubt. Sneaky. He can not come as bad. He is often a hero. Everyone gives him great mercy, because he often puts a disaster and saves them from them. So whenever you think someone will eventually get rid of him, one of his friends comes from a place of destruction. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite times, Lucas and Caleb were out of the forest in the cabin and some gunmen decided to steal. Lucas used as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. The thief (Ted) was struggling to beat. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had a half conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have struck them now. If he had a real conscience, he didn't want to be a criminal. So he began to call Half-Ted. It was very good. He was mocking the criminals. And of course he stayed 10 steps before Half-Ted at all. And of course he was in full control at all. In fact they were with you to love Satan. The best display. it was one of my awesome displays of all time. The Twilight Night Night Stalker Circle of American Gothic Fear of Physical <br /> <br /> That's a good company.
