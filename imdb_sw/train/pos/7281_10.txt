I first saw this movie on the local center on Sunday's hour of fear depicting back to 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a little child at the time, but I loved it and not really afraid. I thought it had a cool and natural story. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that it was displayed during the day of T.V is not in those years. I have searched for this film ever since, I have seen it again and again, and I loved it many times. One can imagine John Waters would have built this film. It should not be just a terrible film, but one of the sleaziest films, the trashiest has ever been. And surprisingly, you hear about this as having a ritual after having films such as "Blood Festival" or "Eye Mountains" has found over the years. It has the following worship, but it should be true of tribal worship, in my opinion. As far as I knew, this came a little before the Festival of Blood came out, and this could be one of the first "gore" films. In fact, this film contains elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and the little Russ Meyer was thrown to a good measure. However, I recommend this to anyone who likes horrible, colorful, black and white movies from the early 60's (I think on the end of the 1960s).
