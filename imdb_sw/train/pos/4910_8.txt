This very good film faces tension. The buttons are, of course, over - police and Widmark, a public health doctor, will take criminals who do not know that they are carrying the disease before a massive disaster will occur? But the smaller elements provide tension in each area - between the Widmark and the police captain, among the bad guys beaten by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the dead man who is Palance believes for falsehood is a manhunt issue because he is infected by The way to value products, between Widmark and his wife, and with the basic question that the public is better served by informing the danger or hiding the situation to avoid complete fear. The movie is shot by Kazan, a very long choreographed long takes a shot in the New Orleans area, ending in an amazing peak, where Palance runs like a mouse from his supporters, through docks and city warehouses. Interpretation is very good, perhaps the best I heard, covering movies, making and shots lights, production patterns, creating non-academic characters in small tasks, and damage and symmetry in the field, as a seminar with a knowledge of films 1950 with a typical film in general. Watch immediately enjoy the film, and, if you are interested in making movies, the second time with the definition of learning.
