INVITATION IN - US head of the worst American film "Le Mouton Enrage" (meaning, I think, Pastor Sheep) - is an original movie, the fact that it began in 1974 seems all more surprising. This film was far ahead of its time; even at a high level, it fulfills things that seem to be rich and new. Selected by the director who was under less than Michel Deville, instead provides information in a way that combines social inquiry, comedy, secrets, love, sex and satire in a very unique combination - leaving at the end a great surprise but subtle to give all of that has gone ahead of sad and more understandable. Release is royal, says writing and theme. But it's the Deville's taste of taste, keeping it always off-horizontal but interfering, which pushes this film "lost" to a very high level. (Discussion by the director of the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely read if you have time.)
