Heh, if I tell you to compare the Dark Knight and the 18-year-old community-changed movie tested 5.9, will you call me mad? That's just getting your attention. Every day I meet people complain there are good movies, which only seem to know the latest bloggers. It is not wrong to search for and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who cannot be closed for a long time, according to technology. The worst review actually complained about the "shocking" story of DT. But it seems to me that the storyline is quite clear, and I had no trouble following. I have not seen comic books, but I'm not a big fan of the United States, but I am happy with high and performing decisions. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high for a story that would say. But, if you see a movie that gives Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect? I had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, do we really see that movie? The role of the head, though not as capable as it is seen, was still able to smell and delight the audience. Madonna was more obvious than "breathing" in her role of cheating, but added much joy to the story. Al Pacino was surprised and defended himself. It seems he is confident enough to go to the shock on his original successful roles. We can see Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro blowing our holes to make us laugh. And many thanks for make-ups <br /> <br /> I'm not quite bad. The feeling of surreal has found me.
