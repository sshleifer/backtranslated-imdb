This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on the DVD, and the disc does not have specific features, or even a list, but I don't care. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge the film in case of case, according to, among other things, whether it's a great studio or a small film. This is a small film and I am willing to forgive small things. That said, I believe it has one of the series of creative and original headings that I have seen. I enjoyed the act of all the great players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has more funniest lines. The behavior shown by Claire Forlani may seem to be untrue to other people, but I personally know the real people and emotional problems that are easily seen in life decisions as their behavior does. This helped me to take nuances where his pain could occur through his veneer of humor. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for children, indeed, but it does not participate in free sex and dirt. There is very little language of adults, though, but sometimes it can be very funny. (Especially, the attitude of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> Also see delegates from known executives.
