This is a film that on the face would seem to be all about J. Edgar Hoover putting himself on a big back to fighting the Klansmen, following the Indian killers, hunting the famous hunting 1930s, fighting the Nazi in the US and South America during World War 2 and includes in New York in the late 1950s. Of course in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover's rebellion by keeping secret files to honest Americans, asking people like Pastor Martin Luther King, Jr, but worse, his The secret of love with its director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about the issue, I recommend to see the Citizen Cohn film). Hoover aside, This life story in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes a good film, but called. Vera Miles as his dedicated wife is also good. But Jimmy is a movie. Just as Hoover regulated production and always ensured that the FBI seemed to be blameless, Jimmy Stewart gave a human film, the absolute effectiveness of Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The back mark is also good. I have read recent online articles showing that this is a forgotten film. Jimmy Stewart was one of the most popular films of all time and her films should not forget. TCM was the last show of long ago and I hope to show them again.
