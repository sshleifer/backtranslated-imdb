Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, better, Jeff Fahey, all in one film. Wow is all I can think about saying that. These are the four actors under the ground and work well together. It is like poetry how they play and make it commonly seen as they were best friends for the young even to shoot the film. <br /> <br /> The film itself is both good and one that can be very intense to see the first time, and four stars help the ability to view again significantly. I can't describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, when the more time they look at the couple off and fill their voices, close to tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> beautiful film, good cast, go to see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
