Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the talent of acting! One part was the best! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there is still "I'm not your father â€” that's your father and omigod you have misled me!" The trash but the script enabled participants to feel and live at that time rather than show us how they would feel like if - like so many TV soap. The camera function also provided a little more than usual, there was no regular boring shots but did not have unwanted shots in the shots or mobile device that was made to add "art edge" gave us what we needed to see also pictures with very good pictures! Nothing was more stimulated or an example that were real people in a real place involved in reality, the show had nothing in the sports game and it was absolutely necessary. It was a relief to have a real decision and so good to let our country see how our talented executives can be given a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, all ten channel cast and work-wonder workers! Please continue what you are doing, your efforts are highly appreciated and don't know!
