The events of the planning were slightly lighter, but when they arrived in the desert it was very happy to see. Because I'm calling you the real truth is because, surprisingly to me, Charley came out of the race very early. When his hands were bitter, I expected the usual stress and then adjusted the miracles, but instead left the race. When the worst of the show must have been when Max was stuck in the desert and almost no water or food! The end was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the teams doing it. In general, it is not as a Long Way, but it is certainly a fascinating look, as one gets a race in the world's largest tournament.
