This is a reconciliation, team, and a great part of Justice. From reluctance to resolve, Clark has made an important leap from a skeptical boy who was afraid of a controlled fate, for Superman who, like the Green Scroll, puts his feelings to his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. This is not just an exciting story about group work, honesty, and friendship; this is also about determining the most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I don't want the last series, but I hope the following events will face what Justice reveals without "restoring" any pushing and setting a good end here of Smallville --- with a wonderful start of Superman. <br /> <br /> During this period, however, we should see more differences between Lex and Team. Nine stars should give enough credit.
