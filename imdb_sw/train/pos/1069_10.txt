I bought the Dark Weeks 1 & 2 weeks ago, after the two episodes of the season on the 5th Center. Nothing was designed to show. I haven't enjoyed anything since Firefly (also with an amazing show). I will accept the 2nd season not exactly the same, but there are still amazing events (see this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Port Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is good. I've heard some of the season 3 plans, and I must say, I can't believe it was canceled - I won't hurt you - but it would have fallen! Also I think it has great potential as a movie (though it currently appears not very available). As a confirmation of my obsessiveness, the number of barcode Max is 332960073452, and in two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away and have to watch both times twice. It's very good.
