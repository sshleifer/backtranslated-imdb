This series was as if you could expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is indeed one of the most frightening, wonderful, of the youth that you forget. Just as external borders (another great show) this little series does what is not much. It was good, and it was worth running long. It was a good show, that even the children could look, though some of the exhibitions were awesome when they wanted to be, but they all had a morality at the end (like Twilight area) that made you understand what you didn't want to end, or what you did. I remember watching some of these at Sci-fi when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Certainly it is fun, show imaginative. I loved it, and still doing it.
