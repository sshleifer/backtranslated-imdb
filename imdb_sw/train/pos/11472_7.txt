As a fan of looking more at something that is being hit school, this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea. Released as a series of video recordings made by two men concerned (I can not mention people who kill as boys or young people), months of preparation for zero (codename for the day they will attack) the film tries to give the situation from the other side of the gun. It seems to be willing to show the pain they suffer, but it takes into account the actual preparation. The problem is that little in terms of feeling is given directly. The only half that the feeling was getting worse is the end, as expected. But leading up to this point, it has never been quite clear why they are planning this out. We are told the story that must have been despised, but the film also seems to contradict this. Without damaging the film, it is easy to say it is a great attempt and it has the same good intentions, but it is lacking because of making improper films. All redirect is amateur, to continue the concept of the video itself, but the story is continuously weak. The film seems to want listeners to decide a lot, but also cannot provide information to the event. The end is sudden, and it doesn't matter if it completes everything that the film started.
