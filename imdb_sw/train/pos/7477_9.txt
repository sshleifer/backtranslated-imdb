This film has such a great impression and its voice sound that resembles a film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his passion for filming and fun. This movie was not the first time I watched it, but after 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It takes place in New York, and it continues through its life. He gets destruction in his life with his partner (Diaz). He passes through depression and then a combination of genetic thought. This film was beyond my expectations, and is one of the best Cruise films ever!
