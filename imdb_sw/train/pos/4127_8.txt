I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo whatever is not similar to nature, however sometimes the spin-offs can stand on their own characteristics. I like the new chef of Iron because it is similar to the Japanese version but at the same time it gets the spirit of the United States. I love Alton Brown as an advertiser, because he explains things to flair. Iron cheeses are very attractive. I know nature is the best candy in the world at the time, but Bobby Flay is the American Player of the Chef just hit. Mario Batal seems to be more happy during cooking, making comments and being sharp while creating. I have watched the series and find all the players working well. Judges are not always the best choice, however. There are a few differences, as a lawyer turned out to foodie, but many of the judges are involved in having the ability to handle what has been done. I enjoy watching the hustle pastors and opponents are amazing. Food at the end is always amazing and sometimes encourages the kitchen. Probably anyone can ask, want to eat what is used. The only thing that I could change completely about the series is to ask people on the show to strengthen a little. Sometimes the feeling is too extreme, and not always fun to watch when you expect more amusement. I loved this version by William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was about as high as before, but I can be a very expensive proposal. I would have lived with this version and be hosted - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, which would have me moving for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original version of Japanese and you can accept this series for personal features, you may find it to be a pleasant hour.
