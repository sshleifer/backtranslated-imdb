If this film proves only one thing, it is that Keaton is, and it will always be a comic heart, even when dodging bullets, towards the electric seat and getting the worst news of prison information. But "Johnny Dangerously" continues to prove even more. In the 80 years, ZAZ's boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were a priority in the world of type spoofs. But there were several fraudsters on the throne. At this time, Amy ("Fast Times in High Ridgement") Heckerling tries his hand, with an incredible amount of television authors behind the script (go and watch). <br /> <br /> The trapstick of the fun of the 1930 shelf of the cinema and the "gag" of the cinema hits almost everywhere for the loop and even adds a few cliches that were not back to time. <And it's not just Keaton who is relied on as Johnny's head, but it's also boys and dolls such as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost every other actor in Hollywood that happened to walk in the neighborhoods. You would like to be surprised by how many faces you will discover. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And joke? Well, when they start, they come quickly and angry, like a machine gun. There is so much to count at the beginning, hit by the theme of the theme of the things with Weird Al Yankovic. But you should watch while uploading again. And they should restore again many times. Everyone is trying, they seem to be happy and I was laughing a lot of time. At the end, though, there was a lot of time to think about how certain events could be funnier - not usually the best thing to think after looking at the comedy. But to a little night when there is nothing good on television, call "Johnny" and be ready for some "risk" laughter. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. See "Johnny Dangerously" ... don't be "bastidge".
