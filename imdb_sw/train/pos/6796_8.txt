The Killer of Zodiac (2005) was an interesting film from the German director of Ulli Lommel. He leads, produced by corporate stars in this recent production. Not only can make an attractive film at an affordable price. But he reaches down when Herr Lommel works on a video from close to all his film list. I have seen parts of the film from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Wolf's Love, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes comeo from more of this film's film). Even though he uses many old pictures, he does well (and gently I can add). This film follows the boy who draws the original Killer Killer. he also resembles the author (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about a common killer during the seventy years and early seven years. The author's friend (David Hess) helps him try and get this goddess. Does this killer stop? What? Will the author put two and two together to redeem some of his former glory? What? David Hess is still a man? You will need to find yourself and look at the Killer of Zodiac. This video is not about the original Zodiac killer. I've heard people about this film on video. So. The director of the modern artistic style of school shows the fact that it is shot on the video. My only complaint is the use of stock shares from the original Herr Lommel films (but I understand why "wink" "wink".) Don't believe hype. This is a sense of emotion and sense of street level. Such as the faint at first says, this film does not glorify the murder. It should be like those words. Very much for the fans of Ulli Lommel.
