Sorry to say I don't know what Hollywood makes. Indeed you give us a film as Batman starts. Oh, through Hollywood I think they can cover the story line in Batman's film, but please don't know what we want to actually see Batman and Superman together. I hated this trailer because it has left me need more. I was looking around to see when you came out. It was like a terrible shock. Graphics where a beautiful line story seems stable and had all of the trappings of the great movie. Unfortunately it will not happen now. For producers, directors and administrators all good work but I hate you for doing that for me. You have let me want more.
