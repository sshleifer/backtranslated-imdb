Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see throughout the year. The stabilization of this film stimulates you from opening the opening and cannot allow you to go. There is no one false explanation in the entire film. Hand-used camera is never available and always where it should be. The three young women whose lives we follow are true. There is only one spot where viewers remember we are looking for role-players. The only true girls are trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is a movie on its basis, and although it will probably only be seen by a few of the movie-goers, it deserves to be released. this key. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay follows.
