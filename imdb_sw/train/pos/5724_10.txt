Many pieces are falling down on the back! I wonder there are people who didn't like you! I saw it at 10 am and I am still scared! And I've seen hundreds of awesome movies! By crying loudly, I have 22! I mean, OK, the voice of action, not very good, maybe even b-movie-ish. But the real look of fear, sound effects, flow! From the very beginning, beat you again and again with unpleasant events, forgive, terrible! Many clich√©s still no one is wondering / awesome! You know it's coming, it's coming, coming, BOO! and still jumps from the seat. Grab a river with a blanket, call your closest friend and don't look at the night! Hats off and Japanese!
