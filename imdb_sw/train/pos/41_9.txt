"Who did it?" has a lot of laughfire and gags. Not just one of the best films of Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies produced in Columbia. Director Bernds originally wrote a screenplay in 1946 by Stooges, but when Curly Howard was banned, it was done by Columbia's comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version opened as "Pardon My Terror.") It was obviously very good for Partners The crossing, and finally was carried out by Dealers at the end of 1947. Old Man Goodrich called the spies of sheep, Larry, and Moe for fear that he would be killed. When they got to her home, Goodrich has disappeared, and her goons and her boyfriend are trying to pull out Stooges. Will you get Goodrich and bring the pastor and goons to the right? <br /> <br /> Sheep is more funny in this film. His response after Mickey and Christine McIntyre are good; gives his logo mark (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre tries to hear! Other other funny: close-up Mug Moe look through the camera lens; and fight with darkness and all members involved. Nikko goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most common characters that have been shown on the Stooges film. With her kink hair, she would almost pass to the stooge, if she had no tower on everyone else! "Who did it?" is a gem between Stooges and Shemp movies. Even dead fans of Curly will enjoy this! Stooge of real size. 9 out of 10.
