Gena Rowlands has an actor who lost her trap on real-time when she witnesses the death of her fans. He becomes increasingly being transformed by the truth, and the result of his turbulent feeling intrudes and his work as an actress. In such a case he breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, but still manages to engage his audience makes an impressive film (as a little self-important) as the corresponding Cassavettes' struggle himself as a film manufacturer. There are many ideas thrown in the world, and the result becomes a little distraction (I still tries to understand the relationship between dead fans and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in their rawest form makes it frequently interesting and thoughtful -create film. It will be great for a double bill to Mulholland Drive <br /> <br. />
