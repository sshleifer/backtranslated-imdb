Bill and Ted's trip is the best film I saw. Although acting and dry etc. is poor, caring. The story line is brilliant and joke and the words they come up with are better, ideas are also good. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part is definitely when they 'melvin' death, I was losing for 10 minutes and missing the second part of the film. This is very good then the first, which was good too. It is possible the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best part of the film, is when Bill and Ted are shouting the best and playing solo guitar, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring 3 film!
