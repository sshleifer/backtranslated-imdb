*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and considered to be quite racy at the time, Douglas Sirk's top candy melodrama color is still a wonderful thing. The program involves works in a wealthy Texas family that is unemployed, which includes a big brother Kyle, who can be uncertain, weak, injured and drunk, played with Robert Stack in a very touching and evil act with his sister Marylee very much. Dorothy Malone. Mrs Malone's work is a telescope to us through her eyes, which uses us to show us her feelings, which include ambition (by Rock Hudson) and envy (by Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actor I have ever seen in the movie that first comes first. Now you have given us wrong, his performance of saying that the youngest is quite hoot, and it is one of the great work of the camping work of the 1950s. , and he can not be able to subtly or shading. His performer is one note. He does bad things, and in a great montage, like a very unloved father played with Robert Keith at all times with his death ascending staircase, Sirk mixes with Malone almost mad acting orgasmic as he does. Stack, (who should win the Oscar) & Malone, (who won the prize, but should not be) the real stars of the film, those who put each hysteria, both sexually and otherwise, while the "real stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall goes to gray and pale color paint a color-colored pigment paints with a color-colored pigment paint. Malone's love interest who laughs and wails over rock through many films. But Hudson does not want his part, and instead is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one was so happy and no one was so happy for too long. The Stack-Bacall marriage falls off when grown after a year, and drinks a very good alcohol because of her thinking because she thinks she is sick, and cannot give a child Bacall to prove that she is a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man, and had a long and interesting career in the film and theater in Germany, completed his Hollywood work at Universal in the mid-1950s and a series of "films" or very colorful colors. Although they were mainly adapted from pharmaceutical or trashy drugs, in the hands of Sirk became masterpieces of that kind. Sirk had a good sense of color and design which he brought to play in these films filling his great space screens and characters who played their emotional lives between the weird colors and lights, making the shadows to believe, and lots of mirror lots. In the "written" characters always lose windows, listen to doors or walk around. So last, after many violence, accidental accidents, abortion & more Sirk completes the movie with the last and surprising scene of "regeneration" and amended Malone in man-made suits, sitting on a desk that developed a miniature fuel.
