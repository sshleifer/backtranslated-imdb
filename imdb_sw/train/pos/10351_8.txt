When the Chamberlain family is camped near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her child being beaten outside the tent for dingo and then begins a problem that no one should have experience. For it seems like the dingo story is not trusted to the public or the media, and the whole thing turns out on the circus. Lindy doesn't help either because she can't play on the jungle or the court room, she herself alone, and she's hard to burst, so everybody thinks she is guilty because there is a piece of evidence that she has not come to light. Sam Neill is as good as Michael Chamberlain, the pastor of the Sabbath day, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are as uncomfortable and ignorant elsewhere as they are in the country too, because the Australian public does not believe the story and the media only hot fans. Finally, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a hard life, but a few years later, a small piece of evidence shows and she has been released, but even after family life was destroyed. The story of heartbreaking, has done well, for a long time but it is worth looking at. 8 out of 10.
