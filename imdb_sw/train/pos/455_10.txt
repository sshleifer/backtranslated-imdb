"Magic" is not a very powerful word for this film. You find yourself excited, and see others in the best light ... Any movie that has the same civilization effect on the audience should be very careful. We are usually included in this beauty. If that's not enough, it's funny. The exhibition is, without exception, wonderful, but special mention should be performed by Miranda Richardson, and good Josie Walker - all open as roses. Why not this film on DVD? It is worth living forever.
