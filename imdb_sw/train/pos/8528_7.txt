I love Peter Sellers, a lot of time. I have never seen him show up the brit up to this movie. He removes you well, though you will see the bits of Inspector Clouseau in a mix. Not available until Goldie Hawn comes. I don't remember that Hawn's youth will provide such a strong performance. His time was good and his words were very valuable. The way he reduces the usual traders and cheat is good to watch. The view of words as I have often seen from the film at that time. The last thirty minutes of the movie fall. It is worth only to see the first seventy. Hawn is a nude for a few seconds of glory earlier. Enjoy ...
