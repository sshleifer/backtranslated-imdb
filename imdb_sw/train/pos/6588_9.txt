After checking several sessions of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers do not have any kind of nature. Here is the old false science fiction, tied to the original form of the original concept - and can only - make it - work. <br /> <br /> Talk is good! Male workers are skilled in their work. Most of the characters are attracted well, with special gold for the hero and more pleasant on his side. And many stadiums are coming as good. So what could be wrong? How, the female characters and the best actors of the cosmetics chosen to show them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on displaying the female characters in this - almost good - series, through which makes the final product seems to be a cheerleader caused. Why, I ask, why? All pieces fall flat at any time a female visitor or a regular character comes to the screen. All these workers are not completely trusted in their duties, and you are not sure that they can do their work. A blind person can say. Just listen to them talk. They offer their conversation with the whole game with the effect of 16-year-old at prom prom school. Who will believe these women is a Phd scientist, senators, company administrators and medical doctors? In the shell of seeds, if producers have the option of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, I think who will choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers. Too bad!
