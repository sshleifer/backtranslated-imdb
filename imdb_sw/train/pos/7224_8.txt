When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster - held on the DVD cover - showed the same image as the Rubik Cube. It is an accurate picture: originally written by Ira Levin's point, who wrote a job as a child of ROSEMARY and STEPFORD WIVES, playing was one of the most popular Broadway callers, and under Sidney Lumet's translation translates to the screen very well. DEATHTRAP is one of those films that are very difficult to talk, since doing so in any detail gives away a well-known field. But the opening of the opening is very clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the most famous sports writer, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a whole night of opening, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends a script for the play he wrote. It is called "Death of Death," and Sidney sees it as a real hitfire. Just a kind of hit that will revive its work ... actually, hit the death to. And when Clifford visits chatting, instant events begin to lose in an unlikely way possible. <br /> <br /> If Anthony Shaffer caused the same, DEATHTRAP is the most stories at home for action than screens - achieving full power requires quicker that life performance provides. However, under the guidance of experts of Sidney Lumet, it makes the display more-than-honored on the screen. Much of this is due to cast, which is very good. Michael Caine is doing a very good performance, Dyan Cannon is so interesting and loving as Sidney's wife is concerned, and Christopher Reeve gives what might be a good performance in his short-term work. If you can't see it at first-rate production, this will be more to do until someone comes. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
