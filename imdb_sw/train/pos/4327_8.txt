I love this theme - I have read Bleak House and I know it's very difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I need to admit they made a very good show with Nicholas Nickelby set. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. Sorry, I think she is the best Lady Dedlock ... I don't know who could make Jarndyce better, but I'm equal to Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist will be easy - this is a long time, and if you don't care about all legal situations can be bad or boring. I think this theme is enough to be active. I loved Mr. Smallweed - it could be entertaining. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should be given the opportunity to judge ourselves ... I will say I have loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again, as I usually, after seeing the movie, maybe I could be more important. At the same time - I think it's a good presentation.
