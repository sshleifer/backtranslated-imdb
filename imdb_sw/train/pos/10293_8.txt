'Bruce All' scoops Academy Awards with 14 records of Oscar's success! It will help 'Titanic' as the most stimulating film of all time! Jim Carrey's experience will be so high that he will announce his presidential candidate for the White House of 2004 2004. These beauty fantasies will continue only if the film makers (Carrey included) would have God's authority. The same foundation is an important ingredient in Bruce's 'Carrie' laughter. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who has been very focused on being the main anchor for God for general crimes for his own problems. God, in heaven played with Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce 'God's Gift' to accuse him if he can do God's best work. Of course, Bruce gets 'deleted' away from its new fun and fun uses. Carrey has joined his usual comedic form in 'Bruce Wote'. Jennifer Aniston was not 'mis.pittiful' as a Bruce girl. However, my great David goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not leaving the dog out of the house at # 2, and showing us the bathroom area at all times! 'Bruce All' is not a comprehensive Carrey film, but it is quite 'Carreyism' exhibition! **** Good
