Documentary offers the original theory about "Guns, Diseases and Steel". This series shows several pictures for supporting the theory, and protects the theory against common resistance. I was very worried to find the comments of a servant complaining about the lack of new information in this series. They say the gift of a document that is taught in middle school. Indeed, it does. In fact, I was very happy to look at the previous information I knew since the middle school and unexpected analysis. So, if you would like to know what works, if you have tried a try to determine how you worked, if you went to the field to see how the field works and how the cow is drinking, you will enjoy this series. Sure recommendations.
