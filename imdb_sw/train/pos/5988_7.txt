This 1939 film tried to strengthen the best of Michael Curtiz's "Angels and Dirty Eyes". As directed by Ray Enright, the only thing that is interesting is how these children were compared to what is going on with young people in the cities of America today. The film is only suitable for the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well together. The last dead children have a big part if the plot takes over them rather than older people. Somehow it is amazing how the burning of the same way some of the homeowners carefully took over here in New York. It was a quick way to return to the property almost never focus on the social problems created. In today's weather with many guns around there is a new reality. Little children of the story seemed to be just pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
