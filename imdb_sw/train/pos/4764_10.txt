There are some comments about this film that says it is bad and the best and the best actor like Pierre Fresnay should not accept it. I think, on the contrary, that, even when the film is strange and has weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so frightening that it changes the film into something better. His work is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very special place on the purification of wine in cabaret. <br /> For someone who doesn't believe that a priest? even one hit? he can change it in the blood of Christ, the place is perhaps wonderful. But for someone who is raised in a Catholic system, it is very emotional even though it is not very good. The death of the little priest is very frightening. But it's very good. Pierre Fresnay returns to the act of murder in an object known to the earthly madness of his character, a banned Morand who, in this evil way, returns to his duty.
