Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film and the final and moderate exhibition, certainly not. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> The emphasis is more than a fairytale than a film of adventure. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the end of the movie. Story story is well written, and puts you on the edge of your seat. As every story, it has a short of values. So we know in our hearts that evil brothers will not take the throne but the innocent man who can overcome every obstacle and trouble he encountered during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, a young and ignorant girl. I need to give more credit to Claire Danes. He literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this looks which fit perfectly in her character. In addition, he and Cox have chemistry that makes romance in even more films. Others cast are known actors and actors who actually makes Stardust movie interesting and '' high '' <br /> <br /> Overall, movies are FANTASTIC, magical and interesting sites of the plot. he was so desperate that the film does not get a nomination for more awards. I should give at least 9/10 stars for this.
