Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are preferable, but what gives this neo-black juice is the odds of the Hopper, the behavior of the cruel and humidity of JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> Surprise gets wrong with a man-strike, and tries to make a little dough in it, but gets on his head. I have seen a wonderful parallel in the opening of this film, while Cage goes to the trailer in Wyoming to get a drilling job, with the help of his friend ... and opening area in Brokeback Mountain when the character makes the same thing! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is much better here ... cocky, one-point villainous, seething and wrong violence. JT Walsh (RIP) is also as good as a dark-aged man, trying to live legally (well, close). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 true characters here, except hard-performing deputy in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. From the first blows early, and from there is a beautiful adventure of noo in another city of sleep. It meets. 8 pts.
