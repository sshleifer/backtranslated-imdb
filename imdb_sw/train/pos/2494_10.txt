The first two weeks of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and had a drama game where Bill (mother) was struggling with all the common problems in life but that feature was very exhausted and did not mix well with The elements of the comedy which is probably why it has fallen. Afterwards it became one of the series of funniest comedy BBC you have ever done! Chemistry among the character of Bill and Ben was very surprising and there were always many brilliant and unexpected drawings in each series. The Christmas events were a hilarious and realistic treat for Christmas. The show is standing when actor Gary Olsen played Bill was lost which was very sad because he was a brilliant actress like Up 'n' Under and a very good RIP <br /> <br / > This underrated show seems to disappear from the TV screens and should not be repeated many times - Although it appears on UKTV Gold once in a while but should be repeated on one BBC or two to show this brilliant Comedy for new audiences
