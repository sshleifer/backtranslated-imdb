"Dangerous Offender" is a story of a girl who seems to oppose social, and how she got it. It depends on the true story, and although I was distracted by the description of one single reference to the head, the character of the title, and the commitment of the attorney of his lawyer, I have to admit that life implies art, and that there are people out there like that. <br /> <br /> Movie succeeds, for me, because, though there is little play of character behaviors up to the end, it automatically moves to sympathy for it, as the film shows how it got its status. now - which proves to be destructive, rather than anti-social. It is really a moving film, which will bring nose to your throat, when you think about it - which will be many times. With its many mistakes, (including difficult to check, sometimes, because of physical activity, and suicide attempts) this is another production that I am proud of Canada.
