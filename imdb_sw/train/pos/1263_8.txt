I enjoyed this film, especially given because I enjoy seeing Sean Connery and this has an extra bonus to Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it too. The story has a grandmother seeking the help of Connery because her grandson is in prison and says she had been badly sentenced. At first it seems there may be some racist issues, however later comes the chief officer on the case is black himself and it seems to do bad things rather than forcing him to confess from a boy. The boy is trying to tell another murderer who is in prison, who is about to be killed. He is also a very good man, for he takes much pleasure in what he has done, writing the families of his victims and trying to get people to send them. Most of the channels turn around and change in this one and some of them will not be expected. I just enjoyed the behavior of Sean Connery trying to understand all the problems. The movie also made me mad in places, especially when you know what finally happened. You get a very good cooperation between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne if they are all very well in this. Finally this makes the celebration / thriller more beautiful.
