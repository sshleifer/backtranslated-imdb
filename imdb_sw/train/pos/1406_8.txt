Note H.G. Wells "" invisible person "? Well here is another movie like it, just over extreme. "Hollow Man" is as if there is no single story on the appearance of an electoral weapon. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who goes out into the world of invisible and makes it important for military purposes. The first time to make serum was a simple place, to make someone come back was not. Most of the first experiments ended up solid. Until one night, he had finished the form. And who else, but Caine will be a laboratory mouse. Gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came, it was close. So when Caine did, she decided to use for fun. Then when he was confused and invisible, the team tried to bring him back to the world of the body. However, the form of visibility occurs so that we can work as appropriate, and Caine could enter spirituality. So he lives as an invisible killer. It would be better to get out of town rather than take the lives of people around you. I would like to care less about those you have done wrong. Great movie, many fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
