Two movie back behind that dealt with Indian POWs; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a boy who gives everything to someone, Deewaar considers the main issue itself. It is no secret that many of POWs of Indian breed in Pakistani Forests for years - who are not Indian Indians. it has neither time nor mercy nor the other side. I am sure some of the Pakistani POWs are India too, but let's look at the movie. Full practitioners. Others were acting actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc.. Amitabh Bachchan who is responsible for the Messenger, did well. Khashaye Khanna did his part well. There was nothing to Amrita Rao to do more than a few songs and two songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was strong even though not too long. He did very well here and his conversation talks were amazing too. If you compare it to the LOC, it was nothing but a long movie and story going everywhere (if you had no story) - Deewaar is a well-directed movie that is running a good speed and makes it right for all actors. 7.5 / 10
