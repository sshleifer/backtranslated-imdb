This is the best movie I've ever seen! Maybe it's because I live just a few miles from the village is a story, and I know how things work in this area in Sweden. The movie tells you the truth, you believe! It all criticizes and respects the life of Dalarna, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more open minded and more concerned with your close friends and relatives. But if you live in another little village anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will also know much from this film. Thank You Maria Blom!
