This film is one of the best American 90-year movies. If you are looking for a great film, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for action, a lot of laughter, and language in different cheeks on fighting fighting cops, this is well worth checking. Everyone stimulates a little environment, but that's really the film about, and everyone is very funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a great chemistry and they need to make another film together.
