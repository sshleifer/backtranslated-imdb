I remember when I first saw this movie - I was in the office working on weekends and the TV was on the back noise. But I slowly found myself more & more involved in this movie I never saw or heard, until I completely absorbed. The question of Life & Death (the title of the United Kingdom - Heavenly Skills in the United States) is interesting, compelling, modern, and moving, all in one very large, well-designed, well-designed package. It's a classic that really has a title up there with Casablanca, It's a wonderful Life, Gone and Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. Why has he not received public information similar to video storage? Fortunately, some skilled critics have put it on their "On Every-time" list. There is hope - 1940 of Fantasia was not hit '60', and the wizard of Oz was dud at the box office, but it made a hit by the TV. Buy - hire - see - it needs! NOT a disappointment!
