I discovered a few days ago that the creators of this film put play in words in his head. This film is not particularly about the act of "riding big cars," but especially on people who are sports heroes, making periods, changing stress. In my youth I lived an obstacle from Sex, one of the most beautiful cases of breaking and caring for the world. I have been out of the surf of 15 to 18 foot, and I've gone and bought with 10 and 12-feet waves many times. The experience is why I am completely surprised for travelers on this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to be seen by all to be a natural man, can eliminate the Maverick's BY HIMSELF rides for more than ten years is more of my appreciation. The first security of any game security is "Do not dive / dive / swim with yourself." Where did the ignorant people do not like, and lived to tell them about it. I can't go out if the water was 75 degrees and all sharks left. In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves on the leaves makes every body of the body over my body. These are not just shocking waves, these are the water-displacement waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only ends up to 40 to 60 foot waves (I can't write these numbers), but actually working on faces like a happy day in Rincon, I was relieved away. There is a commitment to focus on the great wave of fighters that are similar to that of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great film. I gave 9 instead of just 10 because it refuses to mention that there is a big wave-out in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama staff, and I think they deserve to mention. Arrange in Ken Bradshaw on Outdoor Parks and 10 is!
