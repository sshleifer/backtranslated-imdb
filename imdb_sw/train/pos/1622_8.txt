I only saw the cartoon for the first time and identify the caricatures of the most popular black sellers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "oil" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (regardless) Louis Armstrong and chorus girls come from the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. Actually ... the presentations, but this was what ... and these cartoons had meant to be adult entertainment on your local movie before the main feature. <br /> <br /> Hartoon & Ising cartoons seemed to be more "cutesy" and more upscale, (after all ... we are talking about MGM) than the short animated short time done in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or under Columbia. Even very early Disney Mickey Mouse had loads of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt just washed it before going "Technicolor". Disney had cartoons with pictures of black color characters too ... for example, 1937 Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now ... parts of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will also be tracked, analyzed ... and even deleted by future viewers.
