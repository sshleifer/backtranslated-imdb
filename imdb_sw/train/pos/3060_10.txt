You are always sad when the "fringe" movies are overlooked by most of the films. "Fear" is an amazing and surprising observation of a character who feels he has experienced a shortage of his own life. William H. Macy, like Alex, is the same all the time. A good actor seems to have a special talent to connect to your heart, no matter how bad their characters are; we cannot always tolerate the lives of the characters they play, but the feelings of fear and frustration that you entertain us often realize very well. Head, "Fear," at first appears to be worried, due to a lack of feeling. Sometimes Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. However, as this story continues, it becomes apparent that anger and despair, not apathy, are the driving forces of the existence of this person. More than once I remembered his work "Fargo," another powerful film based on behavior. In "Fargo" and "Fear" we witness a middle-aged man who somehow seems to have left the synch with all life. He has lost his way, and the only way to return to fraud seems to be though dark. He knows he is making bad decisions, but despair is more self-controlled. Alex joins with Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (named Neve Campbell), who meets a doctor's office. For this purpose, this coalition is unfortunate, more work than fate. Alex gets some comfort with Sarah, feeling that he is a fellow drifter, like him, a man who has lost his way and he is running for life throughout his life, waiting for his strength to come to an end. <br /> <br> Deleting movies like this is a wise and persuasive way for Neve Campbell to respond to critics who question his ability to act. It is often the characters who have played who are weaknesses, and give Campbell no depth that can make his muscles act. This function, however, can be the brightness of the eyes for many. <br /> <br /> In a world full of films, not only have more films like "Fear," but also they will reach and be counted by a wide audience. If you look at the movie for wealth and depth of reputation, instead of a recent special event of art, then, for you, "Fear" is not used. A.
