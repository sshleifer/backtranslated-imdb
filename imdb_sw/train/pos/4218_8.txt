I haven't seen too many Columbo movies ... in fact, I think I've just watched one or two, apart from this. I've loved Columbo, though, somehow without even seeing much of it. Peter Falk is and has always been a perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The full proof of this is that although the series started all the way back in 1968, recently (and probably not the last) of the films were made in 2003. That's 35 years. This series has a 68 film (except my count is off), all that is done on TV. Everyone knows the character, although no one has ever seen a movie that has shared with him on the movie. That is quite successful, if you ask me. The program is very good. The only problem I have is that the killer and murder is revealed in the beginning (though it may be the same for all Columbo films), without leaving the secret but how Columbo solves, making it worse (since there is not much to expect at the end of the film). Stirring is good, there is a difficult area that is tired. Acting is very good, especially for Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have a great cooperation of the dialog in the film. The characters are well written and credible. Conversation with the script is very good for movie TV. Then, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for TV film, and certainly fit to watch any fan of Columbo and / or crime / secrets of flicks. 8/10
