This is the second version of Eytan Fox I saw. Wonderful actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who played in the Water Walk, has a little role in this film as well. But the real stars are the youth of Israel living together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and Palestine who connect with Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There are a variety of Friends / Gender in the City that goes on (especially gay), and all just want war to end so that they can continue their lives in peace. But, that's rub. It does not matter how many banners you put or how much you make peace for the peace you have, the war will not continue. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides on the table, but they just want to continue with any reason. There are many in the Israeli side, both here and here in America, who just want it all and will not take peace. There are many in the Palestinian side who are obviously without the work should peace come. It is not the intention of man to end this war, and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always in your mind when you look at this amazing and dedicated film. It won't go. You know the bad thing will happen and, of course, it does. For both sides of the dynamic, and retaliation as an impetus, the tragedy occurs every time, and that is what makes this a friend of Friends / Gender in the City. There is no discrimination. It's a real life, and it was a good thing to see.
