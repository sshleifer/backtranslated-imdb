Dick Tracy is one of all my favorite movies. I must accept those who have not seen. You may like or dislike it. It came a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were allowed only because the plot was very simple. But according to the comic artwork ... what do you expect? For creativity, this movie is amazing! Set, making, music, dress, and good actress makes this film wonderful. Film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's a few things these days. He was led, produced, and star Warren Beatty as an ace of the ace of the anti-Boy Boy Caprice and Al Pacino and his squad. Madonna steals show as Mahoney Fat Breathless. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best liners I have heard! Madonna fans would like! One of the most cool things about the film is that they used only seven colors to make it look like comic. This film is a piece of photos that have not been publicized. In general, this film brings the child into us all. It's a film that will leave you exciting at the end.
