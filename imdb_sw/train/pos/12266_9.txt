Imagine that I had lost this great cultural event in Swedish Swedish last night, and it was just because my girl insisted on keeping the TV (so that it was easy for her to sleep!) That I got (yes she had seen an advert for earlier but of course she forgot about it and expecting 'early nights' ...). However - this should certainly be an unusual idea - to introduce a film document on interviews made out loud over the past 30 years. But for films and other films, it adds up to the most beautiful and well-known artists of the 20th-century 'most famous - Georges Remy aka Hergé. I will definitely read my Tintin album with a different eye after seeing this film, which makes it easy to integrate the differences in style with the content and different periods in Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I will have a few who I don't know to have). Of course my opinion of the album has changed over more than 25 years that I have been ready to read, if it has my views on my favorite albums, but this adds (at least) one more direction to them.
