Vow Cherish is a good movie. It depends on the novel of the same head, which was the same, although it is different from the film. It really made you think how you would like to answer if you were in the shoes of the characters. It is recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, wife, or family member - in other words, everyone! Although production is not the best quality of Hollywood - there are no serious consequences - yet, values ​​and values ​​were shown more than they did. And cast it did a good job to capture the emotional relationship between family members, and the damage that occurs when one of them becomes ill. You don't want to miss this!
