This beautiful production of BBC TV 1983 (not a film, as some have written here) of the love story of "Jane Eyre", with Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is an interesting version that has now been , for it is more loyal to the novel and Charlotte Bronte in the concept and discussion. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes classic for very specific reasons; when the film producers begin to talk to the power of the classic life then that classic has been destroyed. In amazingly producers of THIS "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and honesty towards nature, which causes a spectacular concoction that fits most often to look at, enjoy its various array of sweetness and happiness and emphasize. The performances are pleasant, the music is the same, even the Gothic structure of the house and outdoor shots are good, and set the appropriate tone for production. My only critic, though small, is that this version, as any version was made by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian attractiveness that has developed the character of Jane and affected his moral choice. In today's modern world woman in Jane's situation did not think twice but to remain with Rochester after knowing that she had a mad wife and was still married to him. "Oh, just to get a divorce", he could tell his man, or he would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew that she could not live on this course in life and self-esteem. Why? This decision was on the basis of the Christian faith that he had been taught since childhood, not from the College of Lowood, but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was killed instead of turning the other cheek. One day I would like to see another version showing this influence more fully in the situation. A common novel that ends with the writing of the heroine "However, come to the Lord Jesus!" it should not have the foundations of that faith.
