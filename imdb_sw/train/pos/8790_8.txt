Hilarious film. I saw this film at the Sydney Film Gay and Sydney Film Festival of 2002, and laughed from the beginning to the end. Acting was a trick but very surprising. I don't know quite about the "World of Truth" influence, we find it here, but the film is live without understanding for the show. Heather B stole every area that looks like, especially when working with a red coal star. It is highly recommended. I would like to see this released on Video / DVD later.
