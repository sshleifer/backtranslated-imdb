Especially at a time when the science of fiction was not done (1973), this is a strong vision for the future when everything has failed. Too many people, and no work. Only people who can live in comfort are rich. Installed New York in 2022 (I think), and reminds you of your worst ideas than Calcutta. I should have been aware of Charlton Heston's role after seeing him on Touch of Evil Orson Welles. He was (perhaps it) who can show many people who are heroes or heroes. Here, he is broken into being a small caller (takes a few food from the rich), and is totally corrupt (fully accepting evil). All movies seem to be a nightmare, and sweat extinguishes everyone, except in one of the non-weather rooms. Even though I had never seen it before, I knew the last known (which is not disclosed here), but that end is shade. <br /> <br /> Art and Edward G. Robinson: go to the council (made up of older Jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where reality has been revealed. And then go to Thanatopsis to look. <br /> <br /> Gritty, before Star Wars dystopian science fiction.
