Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best executives of our time and one of my favorites. It is amazing how much he throws in each of the characters he makes. I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having a good time. The TV was over - there was a movie in which we do not pay much attention. Then, all of a sudden, we all stopped talking and laughing. The glass did not fall, the fumes did not go, the food was getting cold in the plate. We cannot take our eyes on the screen where a little person whose whole body was against him and who had control over his left foot, took a piece of chalk and his foot and for what seemed to be ever attempted to write just one word on the floor. When he finished writing one word, we all knew that we did not see only one victory but three - the triumph of humanity and spirit, the victory of the cinema that was able to catch the moment like this on the film, and the actor's victory who did not act but who was his character. Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is a riveting, odd bio-drama about Christy Brown, a person born with brain disease in the Dublin slum; who once became an artist and writer and who loved the love of his life. I love every Day Lewis exhibition (I have mixed mixture about its performance in GONY) but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in "My Left leg"
