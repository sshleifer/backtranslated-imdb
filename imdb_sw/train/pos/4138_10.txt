Another reason to watch this exciting film is Florence Rice. Who is Florence? That's my first answer if opening features went through the screen. Recently I found who Florence Rice was, a real beauty who returns to a very good performance. As they all do in this link. From 1939, its time difference but in it there is beauty. It takes you to another world. It starts like a light comedy but then returns very much. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to the heroine. She is quite happy, at the same time stable, living in a difficult situation from a girl to a woman. He made more than forty movies, and I'm going to look for another thirty nine. Alan Marshal is a Flynn / Gable mode and reflects a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offers a momentous time, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30/40 movies, Don't miss this!
