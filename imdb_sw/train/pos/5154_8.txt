As an amateur historian of WW2 / Germany, I couldn't wait for this from DVD. I missed the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what is already said in the previous 8 pages of comments about incorrect history. The best work would have been done to hide Hitler "charming." I had a little problem with some choice to give, not so much for their acting, but for their presentations. Peter Stormare doesn't look like Rohm, why didn't they make Babson like Hess to wear a wig? And my great complaint. Much has been done with the blue eyes of Hitler, why didn't they make Carlyle wear blue contacts? On the other side, I thought executives who played Goring and Drexler seemed good. Again, as long as people looking at this are aware that this is supposed to be entertainment 1, 2 history I don't think so much harm will be done.
