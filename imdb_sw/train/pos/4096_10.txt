Perhaps I have my corrupt ways, or the fact that I have a very bad mind, but I took this film for one very strange night and to my great surprise, I enjoyed it. Yes, I read the back statement behind the DVD box and read that it was banned for 25 years and I thought I was ready for anything that could give. I was deceived after seeing ... well ... everything, cut a short story. I can see why it was banned, not just for sexually explicit scenes, but for animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Of course, if it is freely according to the story of the Beauty story and the Beast, my own favorite, describes the story of waking up the girl's girlfriend about dreaming of duchess chased by anything-of-hell-something -like-like animal with a large erection and a large amount of spill. Of course, the animal finds what he wants and duchess decides he loves it and continues to stimulate the forest. But not all. Oh, there is much more! Not only do we see a normal sex, but there are also humping horses, a child of children who fall down and who deals with a slave when he has not finished bed to give him ... satisfaction with a girl who loves masturbating and petals rose. Creative and enjoyable, but it took time for my dad to talk again after he had gone to bed ... I had 15. Words of advice when watching this film: make sure you are the only one who knows what you have and look at the curtains closed. It can be fun, but I am sure there are other films like this.
