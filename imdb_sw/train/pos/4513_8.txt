A moral child who tries to change his things. A boy who has to be a man, because of the system. A system that hides the truth, and who violates the rights of existence. The boy who, led by Martin Luther King, stands, and says the truth. The family falling, and fighting it. Movie that you can't hide. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, until the day you die you will never hope it really happened. Violence, confusion, abuse of power, parents who can do nothing, and a boy with, I beg, balls, a boy who does not agree, who can not let anything happen to him, a strong child, and a child who acts like a pro, if he has never anything else, he hinders this last movie, and anyone who wants to see how abuse found back in 60'ies.
