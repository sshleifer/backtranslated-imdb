'Presque rien' is a story of two young boys living in love during the summer stay and marine. I don't want to tell you a plot, because it's not more important about this film (but you can be sure that it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is movies. The 'Presque rien' perspective is so amazing you should remember more. It leaves you with its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for a plot, it is displayed in a different way, rather than hard. There is no chronology simple or there are no answers to all the film questions it brings. But this is what makes 'Presque rien' even more attractive. I recommend this film to all people whose artistic film is very important and will not be done.
