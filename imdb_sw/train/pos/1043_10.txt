Since I can remember and I'm just my mom 18 and I have been looking at the old movies because I get so many more for a long time (but we can't hurt it I love movies and today is not like I like movies 40 and 50) Anyway now I have to say when I started watching my film my eyes are on TV. Of course my favorite character was Mrs. played with Lucile Watson. But I liked Betty Davis and her family were shown. Children ... did not act like little children. But there is a good reason that, after hiding and running over your life, seeing the bad things children saw that days have been destroyed. So people say "oooo hated how children did ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they see things that children don't see. Paul Lukas ... Dear Paul! Now I know so many people are mad that going to Oscar and Bogie didn't have but but they both did amazing work so I think it could go any way. But Lukas's performance was very surprising at the end of the movie I was shed by tears. I loved this film and recommend it to anyone !! :-D;
