After reading many other reviews for this film on IMDb there is a clear agreement between the purists that this film is not like books that are based on. On this point I can not comment, since I have never learned any of the adventures of earlier fighters. However, what I can honestly say is that it makes me feel that most of the managers must have felt a pleasant feeling; Let's be honest here - this film is very fun! Accurate .. I must admit to the fact that the film appears not a character / s character but let's put it in clear view? .. Are the only people who tie on this film also wondering that the Batman's classic 1960 series does not remain faithful to the original comic book? Or maybe there are difficulties in the same people as the 1980's Flash Gordon version was too far from the original series? <br /> <br /> The word is, yes this film is a great camp but that's a charm! <br /> <br /> The old Tarzan, Ron Ely has a special hero in this (and bears more of similarity to Gary Busey for boot!) and is supported by the cast of great help that all seem to have ball and responsibilities them. Also look very briefly but seen very entertained by the favorite movie horror Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Many very choose from but check out the hilarious words adopted by the assistant when Savage and his men make the last faux end of importing coke, lamonade and milk at the official event! Also the most well-known area near the end of the film where Savage is facing its Nemesis Captain Mountains using various military professionals written on the screen! ?? Dead! <br /> <br /> Just set, the film doesn't take itself completely and enjoys more. Great fun from beginning to end! (and will sing John Phillip Sousa's song taken for a day after the point!)
