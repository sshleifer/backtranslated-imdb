Preston Waters, a 11-year-old boy, has trouble with his parents and brothers especially because of financial issues. He is mad to have his own house and his laws, since his brothers have always stolen his money to be saved by his parents ignoring his wishes. One bad day, Preston was riding his bicycle; It was the same day that the storyteller, Quigley, was trying to spread from the Police and accidentally crash on Preston's bike. Seeking to be away from the police, Quigley provides quick, checks to cover the damage to Preston's bike. The problem was: See empty. Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a great price on that check: 1 million dollars! All the money gives Preston things that he wished every time, like a house and pool, many sports items, and even a lot! Problems begin to start when FBI and Quigley want to know who the money is, and make Preston in a difficult situation and face many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
