I've been watching this every night at VH1 last week. This is a clear picture of the drug tragedy and how the drugs were shown in the media during the 60's and the last through 70's.Woodstock, Easy Rider, Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin all here. Vh1 has made a perfect picture of life and times during the "Drug Years". From Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this document shows the transformation and development of drug trafficking and death and new life rested in the American culture. From Marijuana to LSD and Cocaine this document shows how drugs have entered the country, hippie, conservative resistance, and how the drugs did art (music, movies etc.). Featuring tons of interesting interviews and reel videos. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: Travel Easy Rider Up In The Reefer's Smoke Spirit of Boogie Light
