Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in prison about heist. Although he is behind bars and cannot do it himself he must leave for his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). So there are five people organizing crime - five boys with very little brain skills. Bothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Collinwood (2002). It is a comedy of crime which is often very funny. You can help but laugh when everything is wrong with these guys.There are some great players playing these characters. William H.Macy has Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is a Basil.Gabrielle Union has her love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito has love pero's interest Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, a player who has photographed on the wheel. I certainly recommend.
