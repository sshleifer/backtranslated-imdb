Speaking with a trick, this is a good movie - movies, music and clothes are beautiful. In fact, this film is more beautiful than what Akira Akirawa's own. In this case, he wrote only the film as it was done several years after his death. So, until the scriptures continue, the conversation was well written and sometimes, the story was interesting. However, the story was also a result but not suitable for other ways - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in the royal house. It is interesting that although adultery has been seen as the most acceptable trade in Japan, women are struggling for a better life. This reminds me of a lot of shy films, though the Shame Character view is highly recommended and more than one. Therefore, generally gets 7 - especially from everything writing. It is so bad that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great pages.
