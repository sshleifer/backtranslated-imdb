Masayuki Suo, who led this beautiful film, is responsible. After the "concept concept" good and classic (Japan, however) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has made his own great suit and amazing achievements. <br /> <br /> Stories are shared. We all laugh many times (Naoto Takenaka is a hilarious one, as he is in two previous Suo films) and really rooted for characters. But to me a great bonus is watching this movie offers the viewer in the Japanese community - real life in Japan. Suo has a knack to show real life activity and leisure entertainment. The result is a film that will connect you, laugh at you, make you think, and embrace and give you insight into today's Japan. Also see 8 key actors from Shiko Funjatta, since they are all seen again in various roles, from helpers (Takenaka) up to a short (many) time.
