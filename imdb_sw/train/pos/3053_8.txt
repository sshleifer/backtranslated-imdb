William H. Macy is a compassionate and empathetic woman here as a loving and loving father who wants to break up the family business without annoying his powerful parents. It pushes a large area such as the "Sopranos" of TV to the side of the middle life of a criminal head (here also visits a downward) but it is still important to look at a particular direction from Brommel (I hope what this guy is pointing to next), the script The best, and around good performances. Macy is as good as always. That's perhaps his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is as good as a powerful father. Tracy Ullman gives a wonderful surprise of riveting as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is as good as Macy's bright and wise son (a lot of his line is a mat-libbed voice and it's amazing). Even Neve Campell (who often finds hate) is compelling as a young woman who is attracted to Macy's eye. All of this is considered by migration and speed that leads up to a predictable point but is still meaningful and related to results. This film deserved to be widely opened, if I think it would be connected to the audience.
