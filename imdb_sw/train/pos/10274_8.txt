SPOILERS This is an interesting movie about grifters. But who is joining? Where does the hunter turn? This film, the black movie goes slowly and cheats. It connects you in and stimulates you through the gardening directions, just to send you as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> It has a riveting script, and a good acting (at least from heads). I haven't seen the background music, but it has never been cooked, so it must be done right. I was so surprised that I liked this film, because it is not usually going to this Ghana but this caught me and continued to last.
