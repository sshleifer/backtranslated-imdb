I know many people don't like this movie, but I just think it enjoys. There is not much I can say, but the movie is a very good movie I think. The songs are beautiful, the dress is beautiful, the sound is good, and there are many funny lines in the film, especially as Briggitta learns about doing and not of society. If you like music, I would like this!
