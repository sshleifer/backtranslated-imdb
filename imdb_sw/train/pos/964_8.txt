"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film with Takashi Miike, but as you can expect, it is probably very dark and scary for the young. However, older children can eat this, that is, if you are playing in English. The story is of a young boy, who has moved with his mother in the country, to live with his grandfather, after divorce. During the village festival the boy is selected as a "Kirin" plant, a great honor, but with that respect comes the risk and many adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> At the same time, evil acts are around as a woman in a white skirt, go-go and bee-making, team and evil Yokai turn angry people and things left on them. And this evil has emerged as a flying city in the form of a monster leading to the City of Rage itself, Tokyo. One of the most amazing places has two desrelicts looking monster flying over the city ... says one, "Oh, it's just Gamera". The little boy has had a friendship with Yokai, which is a variety of species, which are many, which have separated themselves from mankind, and all of Yokai in Japan's Japanese together to fight against evil. In many ways Miike and employees have taken Yokai's early 60 / early 70s film and made them a modern movie of the children (older) who also combine the wonderful monsters of the mechanics that made me think "Transformers". The appearance and feel of the film is great, the effects are entertaining, and some humor will come out only on the heads of the child, but still, the elderly can enjoy. As for adults, there is not much here that does not like, if you are a fan of the Japanese movie of the monster you will enjoy from this. The beautiful and interesting things, during the dark but perhaps that is Mi .. and what a wild trip. 8 out of 10.
