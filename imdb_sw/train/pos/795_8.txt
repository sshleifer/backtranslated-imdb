Negative two views before me do not know the truth of this case. It depends on the actual events, the disappearance of information and killings occurring in Wilmington district, DE / Philadelphia PA from '96 to 2000. I must admit I was very worried about how Hollywood could drama real history and events and it was really a feeling of how they lived near what was reported regularly on local news and news of Philadelphia Inquirer at all. Of course I once said that the actor (who I really like Cold Case) who played Fahey looked something like him (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I must admit though Mark Harmon put a nail type of personality revealed as Capano and the character that Capano showed at this time. The details of the case were correct ... there is no shortage of great impact ... even under the carpet, gun, furniture, and cold. In conclusion, I wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times in various jobs (good man, despite being a politician) and I am so happy that he drew the conditions in the Federation's key area to solve this violent crime. Young people like Capano are true and it was good to see him finally put behind bars.
