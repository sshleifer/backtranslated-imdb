This movie is a perfect example of a film that separates people into two groups. Those who get joke and those who don't. People are attacking what they don't understand. This film has a comic style and charm that has never been different since. It's a GREAT comedy .. with great love. It's a full festival of date. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good good laugh. And if your view is too high, maybe this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It is the injustice of which Paramount has put this film on the shelf since the beginning of 80 years, has never seen the light of the day on DVD. However they feel Urban version of "Honeymooners" is a good idea. I don't think it has been that all my proposed romantic links have never been released on a DVD. Others are Gene Wilder of "The World's Most Popular" which Fox has been since 80 years too ... However, "From Justin To Kelly" is almost every video shop in the country. No Judge in the world. Perhaps those who took the time of this bash will enjoy "From Justin Kelly", I am sure that there is enough water for them to "get". Sometimes older people lose their feelings ... Or sometimes just goes and finds satisfaction in the comic in the "Full House".
