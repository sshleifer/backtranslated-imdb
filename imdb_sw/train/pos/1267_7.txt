JUST CAUSE is a notable but honorable film made with powerful performances and some innovations (even though it is very predictable) to write. Sean Connery is an anti-death crusader contract brought to save a young black man (Blair Underwood) from the final penalty. To put things in perspective, Connery emerges from a crime scene, where he should not compete with a temporary passage, but the sheriff's fight against Laurence Fishbourne. It continues to be transformed by the role and failure of the role - some surprising, others are not - if the crusader of aging tries to delete the secret. The last end is too little, but JUST CAUSE fits to look up at a slow night.
