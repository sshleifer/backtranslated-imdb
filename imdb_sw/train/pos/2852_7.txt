This movie has a simple but clever background - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenient shop, and a shop clerk takes him into action ... a thief runs with a shop doctor after him. At all times, the shop clerk is in trouble with a low level of Yakuza (gangster). Despite expelling the thief, he takes Yakuza's eye who has been looking for a simple shop clerk. The story goes on the top gear in the form of Tom & Jerry (cats and mouse), but it has been added to the dog to revive the cat. The whole job 2 of D.A.N.G.A.N. The player (can translate into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is on the expulsion, and the track goes on to the end of 2 action, bum is acceptable for what he is running, and don Yakuza. he did not remember why they ran away from him. <br /> <br /> Compatible with the future of the POSTMAN BLUES film, the majority of films are only after running and practical, and a lot of physical comedy and dark humor injected so that the audience will participate. What is lacking in the end, which was stopped when three men ran out of the steam, and in one of the Mexican extremists you will see on a film that looks almost like Sabu when he was honored Tony Scott's ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
