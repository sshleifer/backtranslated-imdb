In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild wants to take revenge. He sticks Hagen, and through a series of events, eventually makes a big step (but appropriate) the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things about watching this film today is that we can look at some displays. Attila Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is portrayed as a wonderful man from the east, perhaps to mention the Soviet Union. Obviously, it is not the fault of Fritz Lang that Hitler used "Nibelungenlied" to the German national pride in the third Kingdom, but one can see what Fuhrer liked about the story. However, this is a very great movie.
