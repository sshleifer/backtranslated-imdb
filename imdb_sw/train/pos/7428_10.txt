When I saw this film first, I cried my eyes out! STAR CREATED is a movie that lets you know the love is true despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also see what it is like losing the same love at the end of the film. Streisand and Kristofferson have a very big chemistry with music is amazing! When Streisand sing and one more look at you / Look closely now, it's just a magic! This movie made the Evergreen song one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is a song like a fun. I also like the '70s style (except afro Streisand. Besides, she's beauty.). Star is Born is my favorite favorite movie. This film is a pleasure to watch and is a heartbreaker at the end.
