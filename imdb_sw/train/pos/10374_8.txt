I just stayed for 45 minutes of ROLL's fun. Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who has a dream of being Star Star. Mat goes to the city and will be taken by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was any plan. George is responsible for gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and gives birth to him. Without saying, Mat is connected to the world of George. I thought it was good how Mat teaches George some ethics and respect when George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy a little life. Toby and Damien were thrown out and did a good job. Every character in the movie was very good, where two were better. David Ngoombujarra brought great relief for movies to the movie. The small played with a group that can remind one of my loved ones 'Pando' from Two Hands. One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it showed cities I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the sights and symbols that I had, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> These Rocks 'n' Rolls
