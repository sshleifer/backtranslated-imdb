Many people who have seen this film think it is the best movie made. I don't agree but this film is very good. Tony is a bad ass and he knows he is afraid and uses it to continue. It's about him and how he is going from a dish to wash so that he has a big house with offices and cocaine around the desk. If you want a family movie then this is not the way to go but if you want groups and revenge and things like then you will like.
