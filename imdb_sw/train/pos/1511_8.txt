Inspector Hollaway (the entire guide with John Bennett) examines the disappearance of the famous Thespian and defines the old bad history of the old creepy house. The first and most common stories, "The Way to Kill" - a successful journalist Charles Hillyer (well played by Denholm Elliott) is hated by fiend images of the murder that he writes about his recent book. Although this decision is very clear and is expected to be anything special, you are still building up for the realization of the finish. Second with the most powerful exhibitions, "Waxworks" - Lonely Philip Grayson (always famous Peter Cushing) and his best friend, Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland royal) are all beaten with the image of the beauty of the wax, but the death of murder . The third and coldest vidette, "Sweets to the Sweet" - a quiet, well-guarded widow and secretly John Reid (who is a very powerful Christopher in the role of half of compassion) employs nanny Ann Norton (nyree good Dawn Porter) caring for his seemingly beautiful and useless daughter Jane (good and ineffective and Chloe Franks web site). The dreadful period of time is given with great power to the unique actor of the female child Franks, who builds the true sense of the absence of evil evil just under the innocent and innocent veneer. The fourth and most beautiful stick, "Clothes" - The star of the movie scared to cry Paul Henderson (who tries to the hilt of pride and Jon Pertwee) buys a wonderful dress that makes it a vampire at any time wearing. This item is doing a great job of fun and more profitable due to the presence of awesomely pulchritudinous of Ingrid Pitt luscious as Carla striker. Director Peter Duffell, who works from a good writer of macabre and a good writer and author of Robert Bloch, keeps the speed fast and works on the ace to create a beautiful atmosphere. Kudos is also for Ray Parslow's cinema's crisp and shuddery logo and Michael Dress. It is highly recommended for fans of omnibus fear.
