The uncle in trouble is happy because of the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a strong cast led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. The most common silly movie of Astaire's film has its like the American drum star in Britain and Burns as its public author and its Allen. They think stories about being a love bug with women affected by her left and right. He goes to Fontaine who is confined to his fortress with aunt and father. Secret of silence. <br /> <br /> The main songs include Foggy Day, Watching Things, Nice Work If You Can Find It, and I Can Be Pain Now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes short numbers (with respect) and Astaire. Surprisingly well in a few numbers of dance with Astaire is Burns and Allen, including a revolution and fun through the amusement park. Also in the beat is Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan as a madrigal singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is the center of the trio swoony who sings Nice Work as You Can Find. His face displays are hilarious. He was also savings in the W.C. Attack of the farms, the old way of Fashion, play Pepperday of Cleopatra. Most confusion has been hit on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as described elsewhere, would have been hidden in secret. TCM administrator explains that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were taken. Yikes. Two other markets would be. Fontaine is as good as Alyce and power allows the number of music to be of Astaire, with full relief of comic and Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movies, good songs, good cast, and Jan Duggan in a rare dollar!
