It is a wonderful feeling to stay alone in the theater conducted by parents and their children of rollicking. I felt like a substitute for a movie ticket, I had to have a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> According to Thomas Rockwell's Honorary Book, How to Eat Fried Insects begin as a story of any children: moving to a new city. A new, five-year-old Billy Forrester was popular, but starts to start again. Making friends is not easy, especially when the only hope is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who is 4 and 2, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Other things to worry are Joe bully. Her vein character and sleeveless shirts are awesome. He opposes the children and the Death Ring: Crackerjack ring which is described to kill you if you are being punished by it. But not immediately. No, the death ring provides toxins that kill you in the eighth grade. Joe and his evil axis invite Billy to rush a few of the small worms in his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays well, swearing that he eats worms at all times. Then he gives them the face of Joe. Ewww! To overcome them, Billy wonders that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in hot sauce, climbs and spreads on a sandwich of peanut butter. Each meal is called a foreign name as "Slime Slide Delight," where children eventually come out of their dream of microwaving living organisms. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will know that I have a great deal of heart. I felt like a growing walk for a little child shouting that "dilly dick" it hurt. But Fried Worms are very disgusting. As a G-rated farrelly film film film, it's awesome and interesting. <br /> <br /> Author / director Bob Dolman is also a savvy journalist. Raising rocks worms should be used at 7 pm. In addition Billy has the secret of darkness: he has an ultra-red stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a good sense of view. Accordingly, it stimulates the uncertainty of children and the tendency to expand common barriers. If you would like to make this film through the children to make their sufferings, you will see that it's important about war. Independence and freedom workers use pubescent boys as sand in agent warfare, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn something or two about the conservation of world peace from worms. At the end of the film, I was comforted by the two women who followed me, looking at and embracing, "That was a great movie." Big, now I don't have to register in any valid database.
