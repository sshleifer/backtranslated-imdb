In most of his films (Citizen Kane, the Secret Report, Touch of evil) Orson Welles gave him a chance for happy people. In "Lady from Shanghai" is the only time I see him doing the role of the victim. The noble role, he gave Rita Hayworth, I think is because he loved her. Therefore, it is an interesting film. But I see a good story too. The focus is skill, as usual with Welles: two events are particularly brilliant: one in the aquarium and the last with mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
