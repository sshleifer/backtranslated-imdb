<br /> <br /> I saw once No Man Earth (1987) - IMDB Link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it right. Movies are about someone who stole only Porsches. It's gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years later and it doesn't add anything. In fact, it has many pictures that are useless. And the end is bad, very bad. <br /> <br /> Sphinx has the presence of magnetic screens which would have been used better ...
