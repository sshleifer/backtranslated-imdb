"This is not the Love Words" is a good example of the type of expulsion, which most people think has a basic meaning. Love between the two main characters can be more than a relative. I believe that Heaton likes and sauce, but Pastor is very stupid to see this. I feel that this is shown by events such as back winds and letter writing. Heaton shows great friendship with Spike. In the face of the face and how much he cares about writing the name of Spike on his letters. One thing I saw when looking at external views, is that when the film is organized, the viewer appears to be not fully aware of the film, since they have not explained the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some of the critics have not realized, when they are using words such as: "Whoaton? Who is he doing for a long time as a Captain?" This person, however, can hit the nails on their head and their opinion. Spike shows a visible sign of having A.D.D, although I don't think this person has discovered this, because it seems to be using the word "delay" as a word of contempt. I enjoyed this film. Although it is not in a desperate heart. The film is a very basic character, after the ultimate shot have not much but a conversation between two heroes to fight heroes. Unless you are used to watch these films, anger, stay away.
