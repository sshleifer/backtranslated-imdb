If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or the general action this is a must-see. Directed by the team of the Ace of the William William Witney and John English, and the Reed Hadley star like Don Diego / Zorro, this serial opens! I will not bear you with a plot (who cares so much to talk, to fight more); The important thing here is the definition of Hadley's character / s and the permanent work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. THE STUNTU FOLLOW INVESTMENTS *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence of this film was with Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro found in the original version of Star Wars trash compactor in one frame, locked in a string of a string in a temple of punishment in another, Is the horse-to-coach of the coach and even running through the tunnel when the baddies are caught on a large water tank and the pit behind it, according to the Ram for Indy in the Temple of Doom. In addition to all of this, the scourge is good if Zorro prevents criminals, emerges from security, etc. with its trustworthy trust. Many sword work is right for the lame, except for the first frame, which has a sharp sword sword in a selected cantine and a sword story / Ralph Faulkner, who makes the appearance of rare screens as bad Rodriguez. This was the first I saw, in Matin√©e in Bijou when I was young and I have encouraged them ever since. <br /> <br /> Legion of Fighting Zorro offers products "Z"!
