I felt it was important to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film because some of them were slightly correct. At first I put quotes from the original poster, but I didn't know it was appropriate because this is a "comment" index and not a message board (though we used to use it 'em that way back to IMDb added message boards of the film) so I edit this to make it necessary. Well, first of all you may not know this, but Gene Kelly was first known for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a film of Gershwin "panorama", he wanted the character of Kelly to be more sophisticated than "two good roles" which he was playing in most of his films (except "For Me and My Gal"). Alan Jay Lerner was ordered to create a new story set in Paris according to the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway though Warners had left the MGM rights to "Pal Joey." In my opinion, the WB film "Pal Joey" is falling, although Sinatra was suited for the role, but other problems caused the film (change script and bad direction. ================ ==================================================/> <br /> You complain that Kelly's photos are not well done, even citing your knowledge of art to prove it. You lack the fact that Kelly's bad art seemed to be bad, and it is important for stories / characters. The picture is bad, viewers know that Kelly is ready for even an exhibition even he knows, although Milo is involved with him to the point where he has nearly trusted. So it is important that the audience is sitting there saying "but, he is a great artist, if he had only a chance!" You want the audience to have a full understanding of his lack. <br /> Then you complain that you are not interested in his interest in the show, and you don't know the structure of the story he rejects because he doesn't want to feel like gigolo, and for grandfather knows he is not ready for the exhibition. His quest for exhibition is certainly not as "Joey's passion" of "start night club". But they serve the same work in the plot. Remember, it is important in "Pal Joey" (play) which Joey gives his club club after realizing that it is not appropriate. Same and show of art. If Kelly's painting was good, it would undermine all this. ======================================================= ========================================================================== do not have "chemistry". I think it's in the eye of the viewer. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as good as it was, but for me it was good. Compare and even more of the "love" of romance like one of Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion". ======================================================= ====================================================================================\t to do with anything else in this film, it only shows that it did not dig down the surface of the film in its image. Many elements in the series of drums are associated with stories and characters, and through the plot dance is solved through pictures and symbols. It's about getting love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks closer to his love has gone). The symphony steps are built so that each part of the dance scene shows different stages of the Parisi Art and also the different phases of their relationships. If you haven't seen it, it's not a film fault. Certainly not a "skin burden". ======================================================= ===========================================
