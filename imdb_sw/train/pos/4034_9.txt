Pinjar is a real good film, and a good acting, good info, good presentation, touch, etc.. It seems to me that the quality of films that Bollywood produces is better to improve these days, and this film is one evidence. No movie movies that I have been able to remember was very helpful - I was really thinking about the film for hours - surprised in the various emotional situations that try humanity in man. It is based on the work of Urmilla Matondkar, and also from Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla has a girl in Northern India behind the division, and all the problems seem to be sweet compared to the problems that occur in the face. <br /> <br /> The film must see. The modern voice mark, which I feel is similar to the best movies from other countries in the world.
