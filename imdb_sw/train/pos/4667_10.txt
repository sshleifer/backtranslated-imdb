I recently got this film on VHS after asking it for several years, I have not been discouraged. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov star and co-wrote the original screenplay (selected for the Academy Academy Award). Other stars you heard include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov has an accountant / pastor, who was released from Britain's Great Wormwood (he was standing at the Conservative Party headquarters, was elected because he is a calf). He starts immediately to find a new employer from them who can make it, and discover that the computer is a wave of the future. He is the social engineers his way in the London club of men and learn the identity of the best computer professionals in the city, notes one person of Caesar Smith, who has just taken the city to South America to implement his trick to collect wild moths. He speaks his way into Ta-Can-Co, the US conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper employs Smith and shows him next to the computer center, especially its security feature of the blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to win his security and the computer tells him, "Clear the blue light." Using hacking hits from 30 years later, Ustinov breaks down the system and computer programs to produce written checks for various bogus companies. The program begins to open when the assistant Klemper Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) is aware of Ta-Can-Co's business business seems to be dealing with Ustinov's scandals. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov can avoid charges and live happily at all times. To tell you how it will destroy this beautiful, romantic, intelligent, and front picture.
