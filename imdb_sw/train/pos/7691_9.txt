This view was a spectacular mark for the United States as it was the first star of the beat of Afro-America. Sadly though it has never been hit on the UK TV. The Evans family is a poor African and American family living on the tower tower. The father is named James, trying to run the house, but his wife Florida always gets better. The three children are JJ's artistic, Thelma's strong and young child mind Michael. It always comes into the house is a friend of Gonnasipy of Florida. I watched the two sessions of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and Family Evans - just two on the site). You might think why an English viewer is looking at a series that has never been shown or not in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, the first Britains of the black-black outlet called "The Fosters" The only two series were made and now it seems forgotten. But I looked at the part and was very impressed. Then I learned that scripts resembled the "Best Times". They were similar to the characters but with different names- Sam Foster was Father, his wife Pearl Foster and three children were Sonny (little Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's stupid friend was Vilma. (Read about The Fosters, I wrote a review about it). While checking the "Good Times" only two items were despicable. The first beginning was the opening theme (bad) and the second was the laughter of the audience. I like the laughter of the audience, but this person can say a good line and the audience will go mad and start clapping. Besides that was a show show funny. Let's hope more events turn on youtube and allows hope that someone will be released "Lets you" on DVD in the UK. The best period: Sex with the Evans family - Series 1 part 6. Foster's part was called Sex in the Black Community. Another time I saw, Black Jesus was the head of one part of "Promoting"
