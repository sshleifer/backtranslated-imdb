This movie has one of the cheesiest sites I saw. For me, it makes it so amazing! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they found in the previous series of Munsters. While there was a slapstick down, they still worked wonderfully together "comedically." I like Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, would have more involvement of the plot. He showed that he can make resistance in the previous series, but it was very lost in this film. This movie also has a star star Caesar Caesar, but sadly has nothing to do with Gwynne and Lewis. I think the best work would happen.
