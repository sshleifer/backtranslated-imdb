No terms attached are one of the best displays of Carlos Mencia so far. Mencia is known for hitting and exciting color issues. However, he does more of this stand-in performance in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material did not only make you laugh but also makes you think about what is so bad for society today. In this long-term performance, Mencia talks about things such as illegal migration, what women mean when they ask for workplace balance, terrorism, Easter views of Mel Gibson and the arguments that she entered with a woman about if she is influenced by Jesus, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discuss whether or not one should have the right to speak out and tell jokes. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often finds trouble with his critics. For example, he goes so far (and accepts) for joke about Pope John Paul II and what he can do in heaven right now. The main message of Mencia in all its exhibitions is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to talk about what we hear and do not be afraid to hurt. He reminds us that we have the right to speak and that we should use this right as Americans. If you like to enjoy this function, I should recommend watching Mencia's Mind, show her on Comedy Central.
