In this film we have a good opportunity to see what happened Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they do not show - which is a lot! This film comes back before the Lion and (interesting) after Kiara's birth. It is really true in the first film, "The King of Lion 1/2 (or King of Lion 3 elsewhere)" is a lively, exciting, exciting and exciting film (or array as therefore you want to call. The pastor of surprise and hilarity are coming! <br /> When Timon and Pumbaa watch movies on movies (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have a point of what "King of Lion" will begin to look, as Timon wants to go when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to return to the beginning . They have a very fair understanding of the film's own story, which is waiting ... What begins with the first house of Timon ... <br /> For anyone who has a good sense of love who loved the first-ever movie movies anytime, enjoy the "King of Lion 1/2"! : -) \ t
