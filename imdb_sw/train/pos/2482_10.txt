Actors play well, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It is good for Robin Williams to get a good job of Osiric, otherwise it would be very strange to see him in the production. It is so true that Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text, this is undoubtedly often ... Because viewers can see all, not the chosen - and the director's part. Also - thank God that the film is in the usual form; HUDA surgical performances! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was amazing however, but Hamlet's still a different story, at least that's my opinion.
