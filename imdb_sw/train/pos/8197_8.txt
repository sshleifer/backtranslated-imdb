**** Good <br /> *** Good <br /> ** Good / It * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go Before, do my day! 'The fourth picture in the series is dominated by Eastwood himself (who had a leading rumor of the Magnum Force) and brings the violence of the first two film. However, the film still does not affect and reliable. This film was released in '80s early, during Regan and Republican youth. The woman's backpack for retaliation for her offender does not appeal at this time. This program would be ideal for Enforcer, which in fact would make it a good film. What a sudden result was needed as a plot in Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
