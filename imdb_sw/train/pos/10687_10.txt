I must admit that I was shocked by this film. For one thing, I went to see it in hopes of expecting something, but from this, the most amazing thing was that this was in the American movie anywhere. This is a British comedy in the most beautiful way - dark, quirky and funny in ways that American films have never been. I must shorten, however, to suggest this wholeheartedly to anyone; I went to see it with several people, English, some Europe and some Americans and when some of us loved it (especially from the first two groups), others hated it and made it useless. If you think you're in this kind of thing then go. If not, do not. 10/10.
