Mexico this film was only revealed on PayTV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is a true example of a good German and especially, about a good man. The dialogue between Tukur's behavior and the Nazi prosecutor is very interesting. The real war of the truth: two different Germans, all of the believers there believe. Bonhoeffer was a very tough man: a man, a fighter of freedom, partner, church and great mind; Ulrich Tukur is the best as Bonhoeffer. I recommend this film very much, especially in these difficult times of the planet. In Mexico we do not know much about the life and heritage of Pastor Bonhoeffer, this is a good job of saving the forgotten hero.
