What can I say about this story like this? This magical story has followed me from my childhood, allowing warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to a lot of places that you want more than every area. For example, in the market there was a lot of hobbies. I loved foreign players who were accompanied by metal drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was very strange. I wanted very much for Landsbury to decide to put out unwanted children and to have a Mr., and to get another half of the spell so that small arms could win the war. <br /> <br /> I am still a child inside, and this film welcomes my inner child like no one else. This movie is my favorite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and dismissed, and transported to another time.
