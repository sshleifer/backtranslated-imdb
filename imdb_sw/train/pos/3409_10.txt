North Africa in the 1930s. For a small Arab town on the Sahara side comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning of her life & good Mr. Trappist fleeing from her crisis of faith. They will meet the desire will be searched, but even sandy sand knows whether they will be happy or sad, here, in GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The program is clean hokum, but the film is still fun and good to watch. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is a couple of beautiful screens. He is, just put it, good, and Boyer gives the most effective, recommended, and allow his sensitive face to do a lot of his work for it. The best help is the best: Basil Rathbone, in the role of compassion as Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly guide, the conversation (both "Arabic" he and others say in the film is a gibberish fresh); Lucile Watson as a Beautiful Woman; Alan Marshal as a respected French official; Losing Tilly as a dangerous player; Henry Brandon as a comic door; John Carradine as the sandy sandy sand; and great Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise priest. Modern Children will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a fool; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (looking on the girls' shoulder) as restaurant girls; beat Nigel De Brulier as coal actor; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as hotel clerk, all not accepted. The 1930 movie films are very fast and interesting to watch, and this movie is no different - movies look like colors like the desert itself. FOR ALLAH was the first film of Technicolor shooting place. Yuma, Arizona gave all the filmmakers of the sand that they would like, but drinking water from 135 degrees of heat recently had a rebellious company. When the daily rushes showed the face of the Boyer had burned the red tomatoes, producer David O. Selznick gave him inside. The remaining part of the film was hit on the sound of Hollywood.
