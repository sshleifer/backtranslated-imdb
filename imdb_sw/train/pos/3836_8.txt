Very interesting and interesting. Compared with David Lynch (who is actually quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the home guardian in this film is called Mrs Grubach, as in Der Prozess ...) is now clear but in this case is accompanied by a clear memory of the former colonial Belgian in Africa. The actual content of the movie cannot express clearly: this colony is an important part, such as the inability to cope with the past, but the personal memory of the main character is also a major issue, and its social effort to communicate with love. These are symbolic themes I have taken from the film, but in fact they are not more than a feeling. But even if you try to follow a line of text without these romantic backgrounds, you will continue to discover a very interesting movie full of beautiful pictures (good-to-heads, dust and other bad bugs are mixed with a great series of dreams and also The dark condition allows the style of additional film). You might say that I didn't have to 'get' the film, but I've been examining it as a sense of 1.5 hours, I was attracted to the visual quality and mysterious mystery.
