I saw the last day of death when it came out of the movie, I thought the film gave a good soldier a point of view, provided a real account, of men in war. The storyline goes at a good speed, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines, and trying to return to their lines with the enemy prisoner. The characters are well organized, and reliable. David Hemmings is a good actor and is responsible for leading the faith, such as Alan Dobie (as Germany Helmut) I was surprised, that I could fail to get this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has been a forgotten film, which is sad, as much better than many other war films I have seen.
