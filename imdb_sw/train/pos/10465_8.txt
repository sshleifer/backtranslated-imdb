Even earlier in his career, Capra was complete with his camera work and time. This is a narrative story - and it is quite possible at the time - but it gets a very good show from its cast and has a complicated camera action that involves the viewer deeply. The first part looks like the story of Cinderella, although any intelligent person can see that the bottom will come out - the rich 'great' will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, because of its good cast and speed, it is easy to get on the clich√©s. Then the movie becomes more natural, as a couple should find a way to live. The end is very optimistic but satisfying. I also want to congratulate the title of the head: a very fun and fun.
