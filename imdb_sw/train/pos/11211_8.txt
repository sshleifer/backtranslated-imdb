I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the fact that they had a strong animal among them. Gorilla looks just awesome, and the eyes were like life. It is a very frightening thing and children must have little fear of going up. Rene Russo has a wonderful role for the female. Usually these old Hollywood films have seen the need to create a villain-leaves but the only enemy is gorilla. It is looking to impress on how other animals are close to humans, how they feel the same feelings we do, and yet how we can not treat them as people because they don't. Not many films are in this area and it is important to see if you want to reflect the balance of animals and animals.
