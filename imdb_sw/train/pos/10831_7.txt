Cast the best corrosion makes this film work; The characters are all very well designed and it is clear that participants enjoyed making this film. It is not quite the comedy I expected, more than looking for a good heart attempt to restore the glory of a boy than a bady humor. For music fans there are a few non-existent references that are very strange. I hate to draw a direct comparison with other movies, but the amount of this movie reminds me of Alan Parker's films I can't help him: Imagine if ethics really made it big - and then tried to restore that glory 25 years later.
