"Hundstage" is the first fiction film of the seidl (before this inspired great document as "animal love" or "models"). seidl worked for this project for more than 3 years but it costs only about $ 2 million. The actors are very good especially non-professionals who emerged themselves. The whole film is disturbing surprising and some scenes can be very much to the “normal” viewers.the film shows a lot of sex and abuse but also that people are alone and cannot communicate with each other. I will finally tell you that this is one of the best movies and many austrian gifts in the past years. please forgive me for my bad language. <br /> <br />
