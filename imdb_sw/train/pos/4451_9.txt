The story of the story is simple: An old man living alone in the forest is injured by killing a young child, and trying to convince the police that the murder has been done. Although a very short conversation is presented in all films, the details of the knives told by the camera's eye only made the film more active. The setting of gray forest provides a sense of loneliness, which completes the stability of the characters themselves. We can also feel helpless in the lack of a person to influence the murder police, which resembles the inability of the child to talk his own story. True fear is in the sense of hopelessness, help, and deficiency. This film talks about these achievements alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and leaving some of the awesome films using when the story is not weak. <br /> <br /> Wisely, the story continues faster to create tension in a short and surprising time. The end is also unexpected and reliable. Representing tragic Japanese films, such as "Ring," and "Dirty Water," or the horrible English films, such as "Lady in Black," and "Lost," this film gives viewers a realistic experience of fear . I recommend anyone who enjoys a good shock for the terrible bone to make this film try. The way, if you haven't seen the movies I mentioned above, you can give them a try too.
