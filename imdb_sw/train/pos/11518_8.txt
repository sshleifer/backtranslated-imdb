You can do a lot with little money. Blair Witch has shown that. This film helps. Not more than sitcom in length and complexity. However, because John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes can be a hilarious master even on a budget that can not get shoestring. The view of this film is Arthur Lowe as a sincere, whisper, whispered, and his hair slowly Cleese's fast-tempered wit. If you have ever run on a film to watch laughter or two.
