The 4th center is a center that allows more inappropriate things than other ways, this show was certainly bad. The presenter of this general general interview of the adults, the Fourth Victory of the BAFTA and the Bomber Victory of England (also twice the appointment) Graham Norton was hosting the perfect gay for a good show like this. It had one or more popular celebrities in its midst. They basically had an idea of ​​an adult that would be a general, embarrassing or embarrassing visitor, but others are not desperate. They had women playing the recordings and their parts, men using their dicks to play xylophone, women sitting on the bath, men or without pants under their fingers, and many beautiful but hilarious ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy! Winning BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), has won British Comedy Awards for the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also selected), Best Comedy Show, has won Emmy for # 18 (?), And has won The National Television Gift twice to Show More Discussion Talk. It was the number 52 in the 100 Greatest Times. Very nice!
