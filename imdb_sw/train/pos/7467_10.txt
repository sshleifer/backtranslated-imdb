David Aames is a rich young man who lives in New York City. When 'sleeping partner' Julie Gianni gets envious after David falls to the beauty of Spain Sofia, he takes David into his car and tells him that he is the only one he loves and wants to be with him, but seeing if he likes Sofia, he chooses to commit suicide and David in the car with him, by driving the bridge. David lives in the accident, but he is left with an unknown face. He is accused of killing Julie. The thing is, David does not know what is true and not what he continues to have these wonderful dreams (many of which are true dreams.) And dirt, some of which will not be meaningful to him. Everything will return to him again though he begins to find the truth. Well, there are all the stars sent here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all offer a good show in the movie. In all their films they put off different things about the characters there, like happiness, sadness, anger, etc. well. There is also comeo in the movie from brilliant, Steven Spielberg. Vanilla Sky is a well-made film, different, interesting and original that will stop talking about it much after you finish. It's not just exciting, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer of the movie is very good, but the movies are different from what can be made to be. It is well-directed and there were several good events here too. All for all, a enjoyable movie that should really pay attention too. They are sure to do a lot of "Are they dead, if not movies" who will soon.
