This movie encourages anyone who has been or a severe jam, if it is financial or emotional. You will certainly laugh, which is the best medicine! :) In the worst financial situation when her husband dies, Grace should find a new way of getting money and not exactly the legal that adds to the humor. Even my lover loved so you should not think it is a chick-flic.
