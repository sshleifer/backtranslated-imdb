"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched. I liked the second time. I liked the third time. Now it is one of all my favorites at all times. <br /> <br /> Humor is a trick but very good. Film provides a lot of warm humor. The story takes place in the old Italian school neighborhood in NYC. Cher search search is enjoyable to watch. This film is, by far, the best works Nicholas Cage has done on the film. The old man is wonderful. He shines the screen without saying a word. The area with his dog waving on the moon was wonderful. But, perhaps good behavior is one played by Olympic Dukakis. The film level is the area where the main characters go through the oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. Specific focus and coverage.
