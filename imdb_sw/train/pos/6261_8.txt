Wonderful story of 1924. This 20th-century geography of Iraq was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not write notes before making his ten commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer then created Cinerama, an idea that is closed when publishing an amazing theme in this film. Werner Herzog traders will receive this film as a treasure, and the anti-fighting stories, excited by the surrounding world, have never been able to endure it. The fact that this was released when it shows not only the will of the subjects, but the filmmakers themselves.
