Sniper provides a new meaning for war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or WWII, lots of lots, everyone dies, my mom. "Sniper" takes battle to a new level or improvement. In fact the movie shows all the emotions that are focused on - Humanitarian aid in the jungle, hatred and the last trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush to the time when they are trigger. The low-budget film makes for every error and action, insist, and exciting, because when it comes, it's just one shot, one kills.
