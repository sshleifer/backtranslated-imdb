It's a disgrace this movie is hard to get your hands America. I got it through the seller of an unusual video, and it certainly was worth it. This is, of course, the best film made during pre-code, and the best film of the 1930s. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a good chemistry among them, and helps make this film a good romance. Trina's youth is sweet and hopeful, while Bill's Tracy is bright and closed. The strength of character builds one of the most difficult, but in the last interesting relationships on the film. <br /> CASTLE OF MAN is a pre-code film before considering what I saw. Borzage uses hazy and dreamy techniques to turn the village village where Bill and Trina live in the house. The difficulty of depression has never been neglected, in fact they are important to the film. But if Borzage creates the film as a fictional story, love among the characters makes the situation even worse. It makes warm and pleasant film. THE MAN is the success of the title of the pre-code era. If so many people can see it.
