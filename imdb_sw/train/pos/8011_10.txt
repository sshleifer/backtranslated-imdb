This was the best movie of Muppet I saw! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy meeting as infants was the cause of Muppet Makeup. The songs will remain in my head forever. Just say so for that reason of Nickelodeon's ignorance shows the song of Hey Dude still continues my head. Sorry, little away from the topic there. But however what I like is animals after saying "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye!" That made me laugh. My absolute love is playing at the end. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters entered the wedding. I'm just happy this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can't store a copy of the library for ever. In conclusion, I declare this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Authority in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
