First, there is no way that can be good, because the Japanese community is different from us and has a very large part in this film, as described in the opening details. Adds humor to the temperature of this movie. There is a killing of different characters / characters. Everyone does a part of making this amazing film. This film is full of comedy which is not so dirty in any way as many of "outdoor games". Yet it can still be you laughing loudly. The fact is, in real life, you have no choice that you work and go to school with ... etc. This movie emphasizes the truth and shows that good nature in people can win a small difference. Not to mention, it makes for a small plot with great humor. This is a story about a dance that has a story, and good for it. There are past stories that are not outside, but actually support the main story. Really a well-written film. Dance is good, too. I happen to be a fan of any movie and play for any kind, for that feature. However, this movie goes beyond any other and drums, in fact that, it's the first story and it just happens written about playing in the Japanese community. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
