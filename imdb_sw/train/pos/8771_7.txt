ERROL FLYNN had its duty to love as a braggart of brash from the Irish family and who continued to be a world champion champion when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) was going to claim that "he could beat anyone alive." Ward Bond provides what is probably among the best displays they have given on the screen. Raoul Walsh has described a colorful story and a stylish style, finding family life as well as events that are warm- heart and good humor. All Warner's contract builds a fine fine - including ALAN HALE always reliable as Flynn's dad's father, boasting his ability to fight with his son, and ALEXIS SMITH who works as a proud girl who enjoys taking Flynn down the rope and saucy joints stem from his self-degrading behavior. All 1880 scenarios are taken in the B&W of glorious, although bad warners do not have more trust in Flynn to make the film. He was coming into the stage of his work of the film at the same time, making a rape attempt that had emerged so much that had all the tabloids coming out. Fighting routes are among the best selected for the screen, and Flynn is open to a good form and making very little use twice for many steps. And the area where Bond returns on his award plate for Flynn in the social collection is one of the best moments of Ward in the long-term work as a character actor. <br /> <br /> Connecting: Continued interest in any way, though you are a fan of games or not.
