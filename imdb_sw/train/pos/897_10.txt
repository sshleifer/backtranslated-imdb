What can I say, I've watched Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Film is part of our life in the times of evolution Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and family together that love and great. Vivah is a journey to a couple who build a marriage that returns to plan and love marriage. Shahid has done a good job. He is a brilliant as always brilliant. Amrita Rao left the way even though I felt that the other way to me was not worth it. We have seen him in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras, and Main Ho on Na. So separate yourself from a different role that he cannot. He has been the best in Main Ho on Na and ishk vishk but can be able to put a little more in the role. Any great job to go to Barjatya. This film harmonizes the values ​​we forgot. Good film of the year. Great music and lyrics. I don't know if it's a remake story but any brilliant that is original. Soraj movies have always been brilliant all the way so we expect everything different from him. Great work with all the staff they have given to everyone. A good family film to enjoy with your parents, brothers, friends and love. I offer 10 out of 10.
