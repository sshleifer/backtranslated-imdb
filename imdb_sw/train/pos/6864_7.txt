Check out this movie for the first time during drinking at motel in Canada. When hitting the way through the way it found the easy part of the Lube. My friend went in but I told him to come back. Something about a simple name was not the same sound. Watching all the best films. Several names came from credit and came home to watch it. It turned out to be the first movie of Chevy Chase. I didn't remember in it. I did not remember much about it, so I used and paid a second tip. It's pretty funny and completely graphic. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie unless it's not as funny. Love fingers, ease, and I am part of the president's president. Skit traders are pretty cool too. I offer 6.5 or 7 out of ten
