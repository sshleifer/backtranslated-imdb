This film can be one of the history of the lowest sound record. This year's blockbuster of 1994 had a beautiful exhibition, music and direction. I remember I was in Allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in March during Holi, the people there played his song "Ooe Amma" in their high volume. If a person who likes to watch some like As a Fire and a drink on Marilyn Monroe should see this film. What? Many of you know that this film was hit in southern India and after Sholay became one of the very few blockbuter hit Silver Screen.
