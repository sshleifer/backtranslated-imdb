In colonies we do not know all of Arthur Askey, so I almost broke this film (which had a preview of TCM soon) because of the negative views here on his appearance in the "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be quite offensive. Instead I was surprised to find myself laughing loudly. The physical issues of the Comedy of Askey and its time to give a line show what you would like if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a child. There is no comparison with Bud Abbott or any of the most common comic supporters who turn into this kind of film. One can feel, moreover, the thread that connects Askey to the UK comedy 30 years later; at least it is obvious from the American view that she has more similar to the Monty Python group than with any of their peers over here. For the remaining films - more movies you saw, most likely you will think of the end, but it's still an entertainment and atmosphere and it is important to wait for its next appearance.
