I saw the Shadow of Brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and liked it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and child. The film follows Scott Cohen from a friend in Alaska behind his family in Brooklyn. He shows the above because his brother is dead, and begins his journey to form a good relationship with his brother's wife and a child who never forgot him for being a black sheep family. The story brings us into the hearts and minds of this family and lets you understand the complexity of their lives. Also, photographs of the wood and forest woods in Brooklyn set a tone for this wealthy and revealing family.
