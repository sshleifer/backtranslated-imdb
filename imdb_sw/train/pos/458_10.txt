My wife, Kate and I really liked the series and we can't wait for the second (hopefully there is good!). I would like to know what an interesting song is called by the author, perhaps because I am "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If someone has a perfect voice please send them. One of the most important reasons why my wife and I liked this series is that we are 75 years old and we retired but we still deserve it very much. It is advisable to see a show that shows a contribution to a community that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The humanitarian interest feature of the cooperation of the characters and the young people around them is an important part of the show. This series is very entertaining and very modern, and for some of our other interests, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
