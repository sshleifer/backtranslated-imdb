Before Helper knows that you are an old man starts promising, and introduces a simple example that goes to the awry, which speaks from different ways (in the style of RASHOMON). Near the clock logo, Sidney Lumet turns this film into something that is more than a whole of its parts; it eventually includes a series of different families, exploring the full sense of humanity / relationships, as the story comes to its peak of breath. <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, he can combine unique displays outside of his star cast, without any idea of ​​acting or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best responsibilities, is the most difficult, wonderful, and interesting, and often the least Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. That's not to say that Hawke is not bad; in fact he is high enough, in the role of appropriate style. Marisa Tomei is ideal for her short-term appearance (the fact that she loses her body adds to this). Albert Finney's behavior (Andy and Hank's father) is more exciting, and in my opinion, he deserved a moment of the screen. Amy Ryan also does his work enough. Before DEVIL know that you have died is not a unique film, but it proves that Lumet is still close to its game on the evening (obvious) wonderful work. Many behaviors and trademarks appear here, not those that apply to the use of its characters. Inserted by a killer script (no planned pun), a pleasant and pleasant conversation, with a good score, before being infected to know you are a must-see. The true gem hit down. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). You must only log in to my 250 top at 248. It is highly recommended.
