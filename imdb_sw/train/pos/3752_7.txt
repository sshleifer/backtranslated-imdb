This movie is odd and incredible, and it's almost odd and incredible in a very good way. I only give this 7 just because it is unique and non-wall, but a lot of time looks like it's amazing because it's amazing. If the film has been able to merge its most extraordinary moments in a particular plot, then it would be very strange. The main problem here is that it seems like the creators just emerged just a group of crap about spatulas, then firing into the whole whole crap that looks like it would sound funny from the mouth of a spatula. This is definitely worth checking out, but not the highest level for any stretch of thought of wild creators.
