This is one of the best films made. It is a typical example of rural life which was a major part of American History. The arrangement is 1906 Wyoming where life has not changed much since the last century. The film places your interests without the Hollywood stories added. The whole family can see this film and fun on how life was in America when it was especially a rural country. For this film, you will avoid now and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a favorable environment, you will see the physical hard work that was needed to live, with the constant concerns and concerns of the components and market pressure that would make a difference between success or failure. Watch this film and life experience as it was for our national history. This film fits your time to see. My only question is - why is no more film like this?
