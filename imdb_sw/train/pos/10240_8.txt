Type: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, seat. Top / top: Rex's Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb's Parasowans, Ooo Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl named Cecilia and Captain New-optical. ? Staff: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc? What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) lighted "corn grain" and are now cuddly, a friendly dinosaurs who will be good for children. Going to New York, with big plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a good animation film. Animation of dinosaurs when they are going to cuddly and friendly is a little floppy and not good, but they seem to be the same way. I love dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are beautiful, friendly and beautiful. I love (almost) all the characters mentioned, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I would like others too. In general, I love this film! :-) <br /> It has been suggested for: People who love the filming of good children, people who resemble dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses are not always visible? Enjoy! : -) \ t
