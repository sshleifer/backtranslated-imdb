Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed 'Baron' with this, a series of fantasy about three human investigators who tried 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It was my favorite when I was young, and I enjoy watching it yet. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an invisible chemistry on the screens like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Alexandra Bastedo's greedy loved his way through Sharon Macready. Player Anthony Nicholls made a very amazing Tremayne. From far the best times are those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner himself 'The Interrogation' compared to 'Dungeon'. I regret that there was no second series; The concept had many lives left in it. Would Craig and Richard be competitors for Sharron's terms? What if Tremayne has learned the strength of the Champions? Did the Champions Champions have any other abilities except what we saw? We didn't see, trouble.
