The film is so perfect in what, put one continuous mind and flashbacks for childhood and grow up with a father as wonderful, and interfere with the deaths of the wounds, only one can not go wrong. The way itself, the story and the essence of the film, is entertainment. It is a kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) can do a lot with, and in this case, he did so much with it. From the beginning to the end you are controlled more and more about what is happening and where the film goes, and the creativity behind this story is the first class. I felt like this film was made well from the beginning to the end, and one of the few unseen jewels that were not with boring things - a well-run, fast, and stable from one place to another. It shows how people can get far away: in order to do such terrible things for their loved ones, and do such evil acts, in the name of 'God' when they have lost as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in the 'twists' and takes the concept of overall values. Overall, this is a kind of film that automatically overlooks, but I would like to recommend you not to do the same with watching this film - it's very important at your time.
