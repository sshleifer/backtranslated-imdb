Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a young child alone is sent to Tibet, Charlotte Lewis is asking for his help to save this child from the evil itself. The story is a little silly, never never feels corny, despite the hilarity of comedy in the film; Charles Dance off-comedy comedy with its very bad and dark-tempered behavior that has kidnapped a child. <br /> <br /> The golden child is very funny, action packed with a really compelling way in a charming, close and magical way. Great for all generations.
