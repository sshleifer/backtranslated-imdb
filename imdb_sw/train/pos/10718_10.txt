Spacecamp is my popular movie. It is a good story and also encourages others. <br /> <br /> Acting was good and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later due to its performance in the movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident has been delayed and hurt the movie. The 20th of the Challenger Accident is coming. I knew one of the Challenger Experts away from the childhood on Carnegie Mellon College where my father went to school; I also know the close friend of the late pilot. I was a technical revision last year for the National BSA for Badge Scoutomy Badit Badge and I still get a great Spacecamp movie to recommend to Scouts to make a mutual respect of the glasses I teach. I walked again with the deceased man again and was an adult and I followed the engineering schedule we did when Challenger struck. I struggled to stay with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", going on things after Accident to the Astrotech shareholders to meet fortunately for results, so I am closer to Accidents and any similar movie. I made sure that I was a good student and finishing four years later, very strangely, in the opinion of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to leave Challenger in 1986 and who later built Endeavor.
