When the film's position is very good (Ollie is infected with "horn"), the film is beautiful and fun. It is also better than the films they continued to do after this - probably since this was the last Hal Roach-produced Laurel and Hardy film. In fact, it cannot be a bad idea to see any of their last films, as the whole chemistry is lost in these films and boys play their part with only pathos - something really Laurel and Hardy film NEVER would do. They had an edge on which all the future treasures treasure. Stan and Ollie are working on the horn factory. This looks very good, but not. Not surprisingly, Ollie is almost always a nervous breakdown and must remove the job. Doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film and team) suggests a sea trip. However, they do not like the ship and Stan has the idea of ​​renting a boat on a plot - then they can get all the sea air they want without disturbing them! Once on the boat, the dangerous board of the crime escalated the boat and all have gone to the sea. Fortunately, this part of the film really did well and its last worked very well. While it's not a great film of Laurel and Hardy, it was much better than most of them since it didn't have a desperate and misleading music number (like in BROTHER OF DEVIL or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a good amount of physical comedy - something you see around even after this film. Part of this was due to boys' health declines (and Ollie increased girth) and part of it was due to the weakness of these future films.
