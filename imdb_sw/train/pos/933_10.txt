I saw this movie in the sixth grade near Christmas Time, and I was very happy to see, and I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was very happy, because I love George C. Scott! When I and my class were watching this movie, I was in it, and when it was over, I was so impressed, I thought it was so wonderful! This is the best version of the old Charles Dickens novel that I have seen now! The performance of George C. Scott as Scrooge is something else, I thought that was the perfect choice, was Scrooge, he is Scrooge of the point! I have seen two different versions of Christmas Carol, another one with Patrick Stewart, but this is the best! What a great thing about this is acting, I thought the participants were wonderful, everyone was, spirit, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not see someone better than those who had done part! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was so good! He is Ebenezer Scrooge of sure, I don't think they could look for someone better! I don't think that they could find anyone better to replace anyone in the film! This movie is probably a clarification of the classic film by Charles Dickens, and I think you will agree, you will think that this film is amazing! I probably will have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was so amazing! I strongly recommend seeing this thirst! This is the best version of Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
