After setting up the world alight sitcom with 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan of the forgetful gem of the BBC called 'Hippies' Although it was designed by six texts written by Arthur Matthews alone. <br /> <br> Stay in London in 1969- Ray Purbs, hippy, is an editor of anarchist magazine. Her friends are her flat mate, very paste back with marijuana cigarettes Alex, 'her boyfriend' of Jill women and no even too bright Hugo. Simon Pegg was superb like Ray, but it's superb in everything that he exists. This sitcom had a sense of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was very much like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat the community, but very defeated. Finally this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can't wait to buy. If it was in 1999 and has consistently repeated on the country's dry television- my memory is not very good of sitcom, I still remember two events really clear, the first were 'opening up' Hippies' which I thought was a great start - where Ray continues The protest against the campus and other parts was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies' which I think was part 4, again completely clear on the Police. Sadly, the sitcom had a bad response from the audience (I can't think of why). The BBC sent another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against him because of the negative response. Oh well, I can't wait for the DVD <br /> <br /> Best Episode :. Hippy Dippy Hippies- Series Period 1 4.
