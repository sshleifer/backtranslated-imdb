In spite of dirty information, Johnnie To Elections feels sometimes if you were a long picture, and many characters and boundaries of a plot of abandonment or ultimately will not be eradicated. Some of these are dealt with the best and the best, Elections 2: Harmony is Beauty, but it is still a very interesting thing about the electoral triad which continues to shoot with regular explosions (though it is not violent) for the grace of interaction at times that can turn when it takes to make a phone. It is also a film where the most negative behavior is not always endangered, as a fascinating end becomes very clear: one can think of psychological advice that is important for all the pain that one causes one unfortunate client. Simon Yam, often a different actor but always with his ability under the direction of To, may never have been the best in leading, not because Tony Leung is doing his best to make his stability more powerful.
