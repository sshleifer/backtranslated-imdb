This is an amazing Aniclogy of Amicus, with three main stories, with amazing displays, just the last story of lust. All characters are amazing, and the film is very interesting and insistent, with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee is just amazing in this! It stands up with my favorite story should be of 3 "Sweet Sweets", with all the characters are very pleasing. Some of these are predictable, and the last story was frightening and instead of bland!, However the end was true! This is a fantastic story of Amicus, with 3 great stories, and amazing performances, just the last story of lust, it says it must see! First story ("Way to Kill"). This is a surprising story, a lot of doubt, and a Dominic killer is real, and also very good! This was the perfect way to start with the story, and in most unpredictable areas, with the double end of the shock, and it really causes! The bridge A <br /> <br /> Story 2. ("Waxworks"). This is a well-round story, with amazing performances, however the end can't be predictable, but it's still creepy, and it has quite a bit of doubt, Peter Cushing did a wonderful job, and I couldn't believe how young Joss Ackland was, I enjoyed this story. ! Bridge B <br /> <br /> Story 3 ("Candy for Sweet"). This is the best story here, for it is very creepy, and unpredictable everywhere, also has a good mix too !. Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks did a good job as a young daughter, with the last surprising! I don't want to destroy you, but it's one of the most horrible stories I have ever seen! A + <br /> <br /> Story 4 ("Clothing"). This is a horrible story that is very weak and unpopular Jon Pertwee heard me, however the end was a little surprise to me, and Ingrid Pitt was as good as always, though it is dull, and it has been done before many times, as well as where creativity? ? Bridge D <br /> <br /> Trend is good! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with an amazing camera function, many angles, adding some interesting atmosphere, and keeping the film at a fast pace! <br /> <br /> Working is amazing! John Bryans is good here, as the author, had other great lines, I'd like to have more time screens. John Bennett is as good as Det., And he was very sharp, very good at the end, I loved lots. Denholm Elliott is as good as Charles, he was in danger, expressed fear, was very interesting, and loved his face, descended! Joanna Dunham is very good, and did well with what she should do as a wife, she also had a great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is so incredible as Dominic, he had to look with amazement, and he got the job very well! Peter Cushing is strange as always, and it's amazing here, he is delightful, focused, charming, and as always, he had tons of class! (Cushing Code !!). Joss Ackland is as wonderful as always, and it seems to be young here, I was very familiar with him, his legacy was not too thin, and it had a different role I loved! (Ackland Act). Wolfe Morris is creepy here, and he did what he had to do well. (The law of Lee !!). Chloe Franks is as good as a daughter, she is creepy, and gave one of the best children's performances I've ever seen!, I loved her.Yree Dawn Porter is good and was better as a babysitter, I loved her lots! Jon Pertwee heard me here, and was bland, and no matter how much, he also had no chemistry and Ingrid Pitt. Ingrid Pitt is good, and makes something unusual of Vampire and does well! <br /> <br /> Some of the cast performs well. Generally it should see! **** out of 5
