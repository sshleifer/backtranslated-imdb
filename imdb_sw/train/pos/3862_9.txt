As I always look something new and unique, I watched this film online. I thought it would be just another movie of "B" but I was surprised to act with two main characters. All the characters in this film were very capable and were well-directed. The plan was wonderful and unique with the best story of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone who is looking for sex, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. This is an amazing film that shows the realities of life and human kindness and adequate humor to keep it. I would prefer this movie for many "A" movies you have seen even a large number of high-income box office. I recommend this film.
