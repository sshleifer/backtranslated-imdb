Revival of 'losing' gem! It is collaborating with effective dialogue and good acting to establish characters and involve you enough to take care of what happens to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are real heroes. Palance is its normal presence of evil. Traders would overtake the fisticuffs to fight the area, the track track down to 60 seconds and the 'logical' end, and a long motion to the foot that embarrassed overdone expulsion of modern Hollywood. You know how it will be possible to end up, but doubts and interests are managed. The end of the expulsion is one of the truths you will see. This movie seems to have slightly reduced in the middle, but with it for a satisfactory conclusion.
