My older sister was born in March 1985 and paralyzed the brain. in his 22 years of life, he did not see anything except the walls of our house and his school which also lives with other children with disabilities. I have been a joke of everyone's joke because my sister is extinguished, and I still think there is no one, or who will give her to her and her status. Then I saw this film. I knew what Christy's family went through. but they were lucky. Christy can talk, can communicate, and had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't say a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab it. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world as my sister, and ending (frankly) made me cry. I have seen SHAWSHANK !!! This film is very serious and should not be. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own life. think you can't write well? this man wrote with his foot. think you're not interesting? this man was reduced by many girls, because of his condition. not a quick runner? Christy could not even stand. <br /> <br /> My word: Parents of young children, I tell your children to watch this film with you, so they will know when they see someone on the street, they don't see if they are strangers. My sister got millions of stares, and breaks my heart to think that this still continues for many people. This film will teach people, that people who do not appear "normal" are people too. 10/10
