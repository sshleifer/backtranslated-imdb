As a fan of skills I recommend this film to be honest with the truth and well done. As a 11-year-old who lived in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about new music feelings that make girls shout. I thought hmmmm, if the girls love them, they should be kidnapped. My only memories were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Shortly after the holidays with the family at a military restaurant in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned is 'Love Me Do') and was hit by the difference between him and every song I ever heard. When I heard 'The Beatles' album of my older brother I had lived for life. After reading their first book (and Davis), I was surprised that this film was a good follow-up except for having sex outside and other drug use (it was to use methadrine / dexadrine). >
