as you add all the features from the film - to play, sing, act - the only one who stands as the best in cast is Vanessa Williams ... her commitment, energy and timeless beauty makes Rosie the perfect role for her. I have never seen someone showing Rose and such a vibrancy! Vanessa's singing talent shows well with all the songs he does as Rose and his acting skills will never stop! His play is very strange, even if some people say that the choreography was bad â€” his skill to play was shown better than ever! I would like to recommend this version on just '63 just because I see that although long acting with Vanessa is good ----- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also amazing too (with the exception of Chynna Philips ... What were they thinking in hell when they gave him?) All in all I would like to say this version is amazing and I recommend everyone to see this version!
