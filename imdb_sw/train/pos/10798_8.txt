First he saw this gem from Joe Sarno coming back, and I must say that after seeing, I never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the film was slightly smaller than I could expect for a Sarno film, but when Jennifer opened the door, I first saw it anywhere, I was sitting and remembering. His presence in this film is difficult to avoid, and perfumes on each area he was involved. I have seen more of Sarno's films, and other films that are watching or featuring Jennifer Welles, and I must say that this is all Sarno and Jennifer together. Sarno's orientation in this film of an adult inside is very good, and Jennifer demonstrated (for example and concrete) the ability to do that should see it. Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, all the stars of Mrs Welles's star, and also the regular stars of Sarno's work, turn to a reliable show as a pair of ordinary women, who are still common . This film is a classic Sarno.
