I thought this movie had done well. By the mid-1950's, everything was good for me. It was well cast and reliable. I don't usually care about this kind of film, because they don't have deep depth, but I felt this film appeared to the characters and you can feel how they felt, you should know and care about them. It made me come back to my youth and allow me to remember about innocent time. This movie can be interested in both men and boys and for all age groups. After the movie was over I wish there were two parts. I wanted to know what happened to Dan and his family. This movie should be normal. If you haven't seen it you should try to use it during TV or renting ...
