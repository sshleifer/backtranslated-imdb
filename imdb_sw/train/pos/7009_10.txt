I thought this was a good movie. It touches every human fiber. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was the best performance performance to date. It focuses on. He liked editing. Music was good. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie everyone should go to see. I hope people will get something wonderful from this. In general, the best movie. I think Hollywood should make more films and substances. Even films can have a story of caring. I love the fact that It was a very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and commitment that is not worth seeing. I would like to take a look at this alone or with someone you care about. For me, I have seen that the world is standing and my only view was on the film. The outside world has been suspended for a while. It was a good feeling and all this confusion going on in this world. And for this my generation was good to see something (man) who was worried about other people than himself.
