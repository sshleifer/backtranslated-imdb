I originally beat Sarah's show for good quality 8, but I have had a little trouble with her late and short 7 humor. I will explain. You will be like Sarah's humor, or you can't.

I was a fan of "Jesus is magic" from time to time and I'd like to think that I understand what he can. Let's get back to that.
