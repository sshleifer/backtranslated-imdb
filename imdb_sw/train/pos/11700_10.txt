I have read many comments on this film. I have seen this movie (and a series of prophecies) often with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and just made us reflect on what we already know from reading and reading the Bible about the rapture and the end times. No one was afraid or trouble as I read in some publications. The movie is based solely on biblical truth. I have seen many movies of the last "Tribulation", "Armageddon" and so forth and now this is one of the best in presenting Bible truth. It may have many positive effects like today's movies but I believe it is a good tool of testimony. This movie and its series of prophecies can be seen free on this website of juupraise.com, and judge yourself. Blessings for all.
