Before Sky Tuscan, I saw Diane's bidding performance in this movie. Traders are invited to their youth camp and learn as adults. Each of those who come back seems to be looking for something they have lost, which makes it so true. Maybe you have to be a camp to find it, but in the words of one person seeing all his clothes were raining "this is the camp!" From the joke of action and fighting on boys, for a woman who is afraid of lunch and early morning bell ... is amp. Soon exciting activities are now visible. Powerful Casting performs better works than two and makes them honest. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (perhaps the first one!) Good color, red color, beautiful music (including the differences of Hello Muddah) and turning to comic for known director Sam Raimi makes this movie you can again and again if you look on an old friend.
