Here is the first part of EVER Friends, where we are brought to the Control of the Evil Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), Newly divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), an unknown actress and women (Matt Le Blanc and Chandler) Bing (Matthew Perry) This is how the event begins until we tell it to the sixth and last friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). Many people give them loans, such as any new sitcom the first part is not always wonderful. in this section it is not good because the cast could not recognize and be absolutely sure of their new characters (except Kudrow and Perry who are looking at). Matt Le Blanc- Man, his acting was less frightening because until later, he is more confident, but I think he tries to be funny but to defeat more. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer- Why does he say every word? He can't say a bit! But he became one of the funniest characters in the b season later, but they have no courage. and I can't sympathize with Jennifer Aniston - it seems hot, and it does a good job like Rachel Green, but we see real future Rachel in the 1st season, Courtney Cox- seems quite anorexic in this part, of concern, she looks quite different now, (more health ), he works is a little sketchy but everyones are in a 20-minute experiment! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two together because their time of drama and acting quality was good, and for Lisa this was one of her first responsibilities and she is as common as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry play himself basically! The quality of periods improves later, such as Sets, dark and angry in this period and makes them as unattractive, acting as equals, characters find courage for each new area and I am proud of this is the experiment! I hope we see the Union Friends! because they will always be there for us!
