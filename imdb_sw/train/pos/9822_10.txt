I saw this film for the first time when I was in high school, and the film was connected with me for years. It's not about the voice, the movie, or even the discussion and the bad act, it's about the goal of education, and the back message is more important. It is not a sin to have a child when you are young and still in high school, and not a bad thing, either, but it's a problem. Tons of all the girls I know have children now, and I think they have never watched this great movie, and if they did, they did not receive a message after all. It's not about taking a chance when you have sex. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a story. You don't have to lose your dreams, but they need to take back to the background because you have a child to think first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind it: JUST Say NO!
