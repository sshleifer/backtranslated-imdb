This video is hilariously funny, it makes everything <br /> <br /> and Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and Nutty Professor, which might just show how this is true). To be honest, I don't think I've ever laughed something like this, including the Naked Guns and Bargearse rarely. This view is surprising, though it should be noted that a word from F is four letters long (with its extended version when it starts with M) but it does not treat me. Look, the funniest thing I have ever seen and maybe funniest has ever been.
