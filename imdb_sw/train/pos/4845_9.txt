Hello Playmates.I recently watched this film for the first time ever and also my first experience as Arthur Askey, I must admit I was attracted to this film. As a fan of black and white films in general, a passport for pimlico, a lavender hill and Tommy Trinder (who is obviously a distant relative), this film begged to have given an old British humor. I see that there are some here who have criticized the performance of Askey, however in my opinion stands a test of time as a good example of forty comic act to act and if anything adds to the image by creating characters that are more than just an exhibition that seems to be dominating the film now.If you find this film I would like to find it, these films are generally not displayed on Sunday again. I am also happy to have an opportunity to look at another piece of work with Arnold Ridley (Godfrey personally in the father's army).
