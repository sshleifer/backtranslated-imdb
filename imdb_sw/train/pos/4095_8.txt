Now my friends, the "La BÃªte" films (aka "Animal" or "O Monstro") can only be made in the old continent :), in this film we see all: dead horses, nymphomaniac gorilla, non-negotiable , etc., etc., etc. ... In the big issue now, it is his example, that sometimes people can be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (director) shows us the loss of guilt, sexual abuse, rape and cruelty. His incredible experience of movies, wonderful and full of beautiful events. For all of the horrible European exploits, I recommend this film. If you like this I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Changed Countries".
