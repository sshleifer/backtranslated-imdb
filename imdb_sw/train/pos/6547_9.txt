I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew on the weekend and was quite happy. First, it was clean, and I mean to my standards. Most children's films today are full of dirty toilets and enough jokes to attract lower laughter from a pre-teen group. Nancy Drew is much better than that, however, and humor is a cunning and clever. The role of the head is played by a breach of repetition by Emma Roberts, who is perky and noble without ever being angry. Unlike the Brady Bunch Movie, where the characters of the anronistic are amazed and shaved, the style of Nancy is treated with dignity and respect. It is a good time when the LA girls' style of dress "with their Paris Hilton dresses have been driven by the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her cotton clothes and a butterick model, is accepted. This film simply refuses - we need-shine-this-beautiful-girl tack many Hollywood movies to take. Nancy keeps true to herself and her values ​​around. <br /> <br /> Hidden is only time enough when engaging. There were several times to emphasize where my daughter had lowered my hand, but there were no fearful events. It all depends on the tension and feeling and it is a lot of fun. Handling is good, especially Marshall Bell as a creepy caretaker. There are some great experiments of Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and a lot of time that will make adults smile. This movie deserves better testing than others have provided. Not only was I happy to be brought back to another film animation where the animals spoke and gasped the gas everywhere, but I was also very happy. If I was there without a child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is one DVD that will have the name of my daughter on it under the Christmas tree.
