Carl Brashear's inspired story (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, who wants to be the first black teacher of the Navy history. We have been shown a series of struggles from a young man in the Brashear that should stop making his dream come true (and then keep it alive.) It is not a big problem to be a Sunday Master Teacher (Robert DeNiro), a major school diving school Navy sending Brashear for, who is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but who eventually becomes a friend and helper impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; quickly paced and for many steps, though not a “step” pic in the common sense of the word. There is a human story here too, with an interesting research of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is a sense of struggle that took place in the 1960s among the former and young naval officers ("navy old" vs "new navy.") The exhibition is quite good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro was probably over his appearance on Sunday (though, who knows, Sunday might be this kind of code enough) and the show of Sunday Gwen's wife (and Shakira Theron) also asked me a question if these parts were "jazzed up" "to give the value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> beautiful movie, though. I never wondered if it was worth getting in. <br /> <br /> 7/10
