I saw this film first in the 1980s and now in 2006 this film is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! I would like to recommend anyone to watch this film. You will not have mercy. It is good to work out, so it's true and never is not a bright time. Acting is good and the place makes the movie look like you there. From beginning to end, this film is a kind that makes you look. Migizaji is doing a good job to show a girl who survived the plane crash in Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in Amazon. It is impossible for anyone to live under that condition. That's why this movie is very interesting. The fact that this is a true story makes the movies more interesting and think that a little girl can survive this problem is very serious. I see this same movie that I can watch again with one that I have never been tired. This is quite sure if I have hundreds of movies! I would like to say this maybe my famous movie and the best I've ever seen!
