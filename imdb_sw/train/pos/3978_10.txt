I am delighted to read Martin Torgoff's book "Can't Find My Way Home" which includes information on the American culture culture, for 1945-2000 years. He knows his stuff! I saw him as the best speaker of this document. I was very excited to watch the films from the time of hippie, and the 70th culture. The sound was good. Anyone who included it was obviously communicating with each age songs. We hope they will keep them and sell them as a CD set. I would like to recommend it to anyone who is attracted to how the 1960s and LSD trials ever changed the American culture as we know. One thing was lost was George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who was involved with marijuana and many cocaine coming into this country in 60 and 80 years.
