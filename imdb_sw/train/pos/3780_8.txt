It was in my second view, several years later, that I realized two things about this movie: 1) I was very excited, and 2) because its implementation should be more brighter than personal basis. I cut my way through the movie before it happened to me to rearrange my original demonstrations - valleyspeak and loogies and air winds (even * good * non-air) are not just amazing, especially when you are found in the length of the feature. But while the movie's movie begins to capture the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unlikely place) show a wonderful sense of comic within even even a lot of joke script (for example Ted fail to recognize someone of hell) to work hard like those who are ignorant (eg a challenge). And the collaboration of Winter and Reeves fits well that Bill and Ted's partnership (which use only one area divided into the entire film, if they do not work well) seem to be closed. <br /> <br /> (On the side of the note: I found the first movie to be just a recreational routine - a different sense of comic there, it seems.). Wonderful good fun.
