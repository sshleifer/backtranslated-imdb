More than just a "movie" of children "," Holes "looks at how the past events affect us today, whether we know about them or not. During the time Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he has to dig throughout the day, he gets things several about the camp, and its own relationship. Through flashbacks, we learn that several things are closer than we realize (you'll hear this well when you see the movie.) LeBoeuf does a very good job, like other members sent: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt.
