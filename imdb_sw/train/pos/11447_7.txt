This film is possible for you. It had the quality of general reflection from music, with beautiful pictures, and listening many other things about life that Andy Goldsworthy could say if he worked or among shots. If you are studying with Buddhism - that's the kind I came out of this film. Impermanence of life, natural beauty, interaction of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused, and ultimately forced me to leave without end (I saw more than an hour) was a deficiency of something around. You only get pieces and pieces of why you are sent, and how they can even afford to live in this kind of work. The work of art comes alive but all of the talking without conclusion leads to the end of the dead.
