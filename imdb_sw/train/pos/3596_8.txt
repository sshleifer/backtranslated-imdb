Finally I sat and saw this film all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is perhaps one of my dear affiliates â€” not just the fact that * can * act, but chooses the best tasks for her that are more meaningful and more important than what they seem first. I have read a few comments describing their apology that this was not a fatal thing as they thought before, but certainly I disagree. Diana is a woman. He follows his dreams and believes himself against what everyone around him thinks (except his brother Tiny and his trainer and manager, Hector, who shows that he is more father than his real parent), what the word "Feminism" is about. . It is good to see such films showing the true side of the female - that is not a group of lost people - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true for herself while still falling prey to love, and she and Adrian have a real relationship, harder than something that has been addressed magically. Girlfight is a true taste of truth and puts faith again in my view of people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - The most important movie that is not possible for women, but everyone wants to go away in their lives.
