I just need to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't even count the number of times I've seen. I was very fond of John Travolta, but for the first time the camera rides his body after cleaning everything look good for his first trips to Gilley, I was scared. Debra Winger, as always, provides a perfect performance as a young wife, a widow of Bud, but with a view of a must be married to a stubborn and hard cowboy. If you are not a country musician, which I was not, this is the 1st voice that will make you sing along with every word. If you have the opportunity, please see this film - it will not be disappointed.
