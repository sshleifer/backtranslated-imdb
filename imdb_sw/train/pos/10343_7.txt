"Mr. Mr. Williams" star Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of them was Ninotchka and Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five film that year, three of which they did together! Douglas is Lt. Williams, and he and his affinity are given by the corpse, and they should know what happened. Observers are aware of their co-workers - participants (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always played positions of authority ... ceremony, bank president, police. This dunnit is happy to please - the police always give us each jabs, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting in words. Some fun - Williams takes even a man arrested with a date with his partner. There are many fun things here, to remove the slow start and wait for funnier items later. They don't want to give any damage, so you will need to take it on the Turner Classic movies. Director Alexander Hall made more comedies, and was reported to cooperate with Lucy at some point.
