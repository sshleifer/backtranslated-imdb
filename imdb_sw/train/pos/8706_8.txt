What happens when the average joe knows he has a normal power? Cluster may seem normal. Observers? Not breaking? However, the practice of Sci-fi of the Russian, the Sword of the Sword, is far from the ordinary stock. The story goes around a man named Sasha who, as a young man, was prevented from the community, his family and his family from the supernatural power he has. When he wants or his anger allows, the sword spreads from his hand to cover his own skin. Too much? Maybe ... but that's not an interesting part of this film. He restrained all his life and was driven by anger (and his anger) "our hero" returns to his home to give up his life or find a reason. The only thing he meets here is the problem when meeting the old fires of a hot flame is left to the ground. This is where revenge and anger enter. This is a person who does not want to cross and from this point mafia and police are on his tail. She meets the girl and falls in love as soon as she and this is really what the movie is approaching. The film is very interesting and bold with the color overtones printed with a short but very short. This is a gallery in the base, effectively displayed with attention and details in each area on the bad sci-fi action. It is this odd one that loves me very much in this film. The direction of this kind of directors is a rehabilitation focused on Sasha's emotional and not direct film. Don't worry though, that step is with a lot. However, most of this series shows only abuse and post-tragic images. This is not to say that the action is not shown. These events have come and are wonderful (especially at the end where we see the full Sasha's power opened by despair). The director chooses to confirm the violence of many events in order to set the goal of the emotional impact of the behavior around them. This is an interesting story of delightful and entertaining in that kind.
