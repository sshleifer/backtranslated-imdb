My love of the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped my youthful youth and her performance in 1965 of "Thunderball," has led me to unfamiliar areas. Investigation by step, this British curiosity from 1959, "Carlton-Browne's F.O.", which shows Lucianna in one of its original responsibilities. She has a princess in this, though the picture is actually a show of Terry-Thomas's talent and Peter Sellers, whose stars have increased so far. In this beautiful film, often, we learn the Madeira-like nation of Gaillardia, which was the British colony until 1916 and then forgotten it in the world. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of attention around the world and the international wind when cobalt deposits are found there, and its King sends Carlton-Browne of the Foreign Office to judge. Terry-Thomas greatly attracts this part, such as Traders in his position as Prime Minister Amphibulos of a small country. (This was the second businessman of 1959 Merchants about a small country like the cloud and the world, and another is "Mouse Given," of course.) Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the king of Gaillardia, and my girlfriend Lucianna is as attractive as it may be in his small role. The film is widely displayed in a very humorous way, although there are some abdomen laughing to have (reception at Gaillardian airport, for example, and especially the May Day of Gaillardian Power Day). And the prime minister of Sellers seeds, with his broken English and popular sweat spells, is still another characteristic note in this actor's pantheon. Despite a frequent or two not-to-do event, the British gibberish of pressure, I have seen this image as a recreational recreational, and has been presented well on the Anchor Bay DVD display with crisp.
