Love characters and story line. Very interesting and a lot of steps. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer offers good performances. I enjoyed a strong and romantic relationship with Griffith and Labor. Donald Southerland is very good, and surprisingly compassionate, punched out of the beaten man. All three employees are among my favorites and have them in this film released for special treat. A good addition to my great collection of DVDs. I strongly recommend this film. If you would like ... Mr. and Mrs Smith, Criminals, L.A. Access, The Big Night Night long, Spirituality and, Yards All of ... What you like this movie.
