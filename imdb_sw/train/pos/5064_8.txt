This film is amazing in every way that modern adventures of action are not. Take time. Relax, enjoy. Think. People who see this film are slow or plodding or very weak they need to take a week and look at it several times until their short-term thinking takes into account the possibility of being involved with the reason or even a good story in a good place for no other reason than because it is not good make the points you need effectively for a short time. At first I was worried about Brosnan playing American origin. From the story line though, I think it was fit to be thrown. Now, back to my broadcast. -Jahfre
