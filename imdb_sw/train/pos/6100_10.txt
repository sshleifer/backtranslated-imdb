This is a real (and sexy) movie - which is not just ridiculous but it has a good acting. It's a kind of movie where the characters are entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone on the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I found myself often laughing with everyone else, and also moving to other parts of the film. It is the only movie about two doctors, and I don't want to give anything but there are some powerful events with those who have attracted them - as well as a good conversation. Wood Harris's character has a unique relationship with his partner Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also interested and involved in their roles. If you have the opportunity to see it - go-you can not despair. It's important to see again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
