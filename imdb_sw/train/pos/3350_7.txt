I don't remember never seen this before tonight, maybe the most commonly seen name has passed on to me. But it is a beautiful Western b, and a fascinating story with a suggested head and perform acting from good to corny. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum's slope in the open city looking for his wife and news of their daughter, and sits for a time as a tamer-city. Usually good business people have mixed emotions - they want to pull out baddies but as the business they bring. It is still used: relaxing drink and gambling rules and encouraging industries but pretending to underestimate the effects of the seed that can have ordinary people. What is interesting about this film is a picture of Mitchum's most amazing in going to clean up the town of baddies, and the acceptance of city cities that its cruel ways were alone. Little favorite: sudden destruction of 2 of baddies in Saloon Red Dog. The run of the main saloon is planned in a bad way, but it was the best way to fight the spread of poison. Overall a very good film and its only mistake that tries to be a little hokeyness - it's not very good for those-Gooders who probably prefer a live chat with Evil instead of finishing.
