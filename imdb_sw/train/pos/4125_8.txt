I wanted to watch '' Marine '' back, I was in a grammar school and I'd like to do my homework at 4:30 and would already look at '' Hunt Sea '' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. I liked it! He took you to a place that was not very much at that time, under the great blue sea. Pre '' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became normal, there was Mike Nelson to persuade children. I will be interested in discovering that more than a few children developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of science from looking at this display. Water photography also continued, the search funding is easily emphasized by watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
