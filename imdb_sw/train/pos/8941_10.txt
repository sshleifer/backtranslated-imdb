I enjoyed seeing this film about Delany's sister. I knew about them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes for their courage and courage. What a pair. What sacrifices did they make to live for themselves? This is not just a film for African Americans, but for all Americans. It is a type of history and document that has been set to one and includes a biography of entertainment. Acting was best for all included and we actually have a shortage of these problems the two sisters have been through for many years. Both sisters are quite different from each other. They came from a very loving and powerful family, perhaps even enough levels of perfection. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to let her daughter continue to see her boyfriend due to possible misunderstandings. I highly recommend this movie and I am glad I got it on television the other day.
