I could not leave a comment after reading a very short description "Not bad". This movie is better than not bad. Acting is stellar, even from beaten children, who do not play cute or anything else but act like a child of my child. The movie is smart and expects the audience to be too. Two light stories of the past are thinking and contributing to stories rather than acting like filling time. I watched this film with my children and then I watched it again and a few days later. If you have children and are sick deaths of movies that promote diabetes and their beautiful beauty, then look at "Door." My six-year-old son was very happy as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed the same enjoyment. How many movies can you say?
