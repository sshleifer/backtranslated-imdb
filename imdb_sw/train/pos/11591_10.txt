I have also been looking for this film for a long time, and how great it would be to find it on DVD. And I was attracted to it. Showed before JUNGLE BOOK of Walt Disney! What I remember of this film is divided. I remember that the Indian boy was a friend and eagle. This thanked me very much. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (he did not know the reason for this). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time he turned into an eagle and left with his friend eagle. If the eagle was still wearing his gray necklace. CB
