I saw this film the other day when I said, and I thought this would be just another movie with a girl trying to prove the point, but Diane joined the boxing because she wanted. I thought this movie was good. I paid 8/10. That's very good. Plus the movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even she has been in just six.
