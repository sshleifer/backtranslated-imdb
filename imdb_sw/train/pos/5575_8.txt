I could not expect much from this, but I must admit that I was playing down while laughing a few times during this film. If you are very wrong in the first ten minutes, this can be a film for you. Ditto if you are a kind that would enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. Certainly not a great job of comedy, but due to indy gas under this budget is good. To set the level of play in comparison, consider all the movie studios and their budgets hit for 100 or more and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his web to see this through. I look forward to his next effort.
