I lost this film in the form of a DVD without knowing anything about it, part of the cool marathon to watch the film every night. After several horrible films of the American Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life, Zhu Warriors beat me as an original film film. The story is perfect, but I have seen the fidelity of the film, the beauty of the heart and the complete lack of enjoyment soon, and the film looks amazing. Of course, the special effects are not technologies such as Hollywood produced, but film monitors are more attracted to color, structure and movement than reality and many shots are breathing. In one shot, two superhuman characters standing on a rock rock, a huge moon rising in front of them, the picture is exactly the same as three things. On the other hand, the king's hero looks through the sky behind his glittering sword. And the colors exploded from bullets to bullets, they were expressing feelings rather than representing the reality. The characters have the same understanding and clarity of the comic characters, they do not get deep into themselves but referring to the archtypes which look more deeply. Physically, several characters are very good. They play their roles directly on, without being deceitful or false, and so reliable. The most wonderful of all, despite the destruction of shapes and thin habits, I found myself close to tears, with the best humility of the actors and the original exhibitions, the good contents of the director. <br /> <br />
