Surprise of surprise and twist more and two crosses than the doodle pad. The great deal with a mix of a fascinating plot led by the Twin Peaks-ish influence in Dahl director. Nicholas Cage is a very low actor and shows a beautiful picture of someone who has fastened to find the right thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a good actor) is always a wonderful villain, like Dennis Hopper. It is a disgrace that did not make the top explanation in biz. I'm sure he has his followers, though. For all, this is a good film that shows that you do not need a great bangs or a commercial soundtrack in order to be a entertainment film.
