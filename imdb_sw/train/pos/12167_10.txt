What happens when a person has serious social concerns that stop working? Only a person can get alone? When a typical crap we have to do to be part of the community it becomes more, what happens? Frownland examines these questions. Truly amazing start of nature from Bronstein. The tones are strange and claustrophobic when we get into the mind of a man named Keith who has been so broken he can't make the right judgment. We follow him next to him trying to communicate with people and working day by day. Most of us know people like this - people who say "very sorry" or "I accept" when there is nothing to understand. So we know there are people out like this but why does someone want to make a film about them? In fact, for an interesting and Bronstein actor and leading actor, Dore Mann, do a good job. This film is about un-commercial as the film can get. A few friends put it in a few years when they were saving money. It was shot at 16mm with a beautifully beaten film. With no distributer, this can be tough to find, I think it has been randomly inquiry for the previous year or so. We hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it at the Modern Movie Theater in LA. There were 10 people among the audience, among them Crispin Glover, if it tells you anything about how this horse is shown. It is highly recommended.
