The Dirty Harry series started with a very expensive police action, and was almost immediately the light for the "Power of Magnum". By the time "The Enforcer" around, Dirty Harry was a little more than a television show (saved only by Tyne Daly). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry has returned to his roots. Maybe he's gone too long this time. Clint Eastwood makes the first well-directed film from Don Siegel first, which helps a lot. Harry is a black character once again, not a good cot he had been. He can also say things like "Continue, make my day" and it means true. "Sudden effect" is a real dirty Harry. "Stress" should not be made. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
