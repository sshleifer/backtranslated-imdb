This movie is the center of the story of a young woman during the war, and it really happens, not like a film, but it's a good story, I was attracting it to this film, acting and story where I love this film because it is a true story Giff The feeling that I was there and I feel sorry for the ca-rector that Maruschka Detmers are playing because who wants to live here this way. I recommend that everyone see this film, special youth and ma for learning something from this film. This film can compare white film filters from orange or any true story that happened in WW2.
