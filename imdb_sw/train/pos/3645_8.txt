Good stories about following your dreams and actually taking a pole in doing something about them when you strike a chance. Nothing was so easy for Morris either-had family, work, job losses, credit, etc. - it was not as if he could stop what he had done and mix it with the greyhound for 4 months. It took guts. I am glad that he showed his breach, almost until 'even he got brilliant for the majors. I can remember seeing him blowing against the red Sox (I think ...), it was a good story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid-that's right. It is a good job to use a person, teacher, coach and 'old rookie' .... As someone who is in one age group, I'm sure I can ID and its trouble. You're not too old to do what you dreamed as a child, but it gets there. You should do more recently than the lator. It has been said honestly, it has been modified, made, done, it's good to see the latest faces of Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work around, I'm glad to see it. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who woulda thought that Tampa Satan Rays woulda have been a matter of such a good early movie?
