I looked for this film for years, apparently not available in the country and buying a Ebay copy. Four witches and their three widows go into the forest to find a dance that seems to have killed several voters. What they find is a former Vietnam net who loves things (kills some of its victims by using a long fingerprint with Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a short argument with her lover, she is killed. After one group found his body, they all hid in their tents waiting for the day. Once the sun comes, they all try and make it, but they have the same victims. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not a lot of gore, but several good killings, especially girls' deaths. Boys are killed in some ways that are not blood (beaten by a car, a stroke, a knife through the head). Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a very good film from the late 80s. 10 out of 10.
