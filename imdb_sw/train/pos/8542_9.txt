_Waterdance_ explores different aspects of the life of the wounded with skill. From a small torture of adequate lighting that provides sex, masculinity and depression, disability experience has been opened. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Different types of characters describe the complexity of the investigated material - Joel, author, Raymond, black man who passed by, and bloss, color biker. At first, these men have been connected to anything except their physical injuries, but they continue their spirit of competition. Over time, the split, good and bad experience, unites them as support partners. The greatest transparency of change is that Joel's experience, who begins distances with his patients with sun glasses, head heads and curtains. Since she comes to accept the change that the disability has made her life, Joel reduces these preparations and starts engaging in men's struggle with the district. The song is known in the title is the memory of the daily struggle of putting one's head on the water; Dropping drums is a denial of life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and dynamic film on many levels, and I don't care to recommend it.
