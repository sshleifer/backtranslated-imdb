I have often had tears in my eyes when watching movies are few. And there is only one time that I am very worried and it's when I see this film. This film has some fun but I don't care. I cry even if I write this and it was sometime since I saw it. It has been done perfectly with all the production values ​​is good, but what is important is the simple and amazing message. We all know in our hearts, but it's not easy to remember that the only thing that means in life is LOVE in every kind. It is only when we love that we live the truth. I know how I feel and promise that it is not always the same. I am quite excited. This movie has given me a great sense of sadness and joy in me than any other movies and maybe always the first movie I give others to see.
