This movie is beautiful! This movie is beautiful! Finally, the movie showing Muslims as people, there is no show here. This movie is dominated by stories, for acting and above all for its theme, of cultural confirmation and discovery. They can be seen as clich√©s but not, at least not in this film. The Great Mosque of Makkah is totally ignorant and the audience is found at the ends of the Islamic world that is not found in the West. Here people care, support, volunteer, tolerate and volunteer to each other. What is welcomed by the way to escape from the usual casual image of the Arabs. Movie best.
