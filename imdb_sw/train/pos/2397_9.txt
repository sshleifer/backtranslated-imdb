Having seen and loved the latest film of Greg Lombardo "Knots" (wrote and leading the element too), I decided to explore his original work, and this movie was worth the effort and lease. Macbeth in Manhattan is a language in cheek, best to take a favorite Shakespeare, updated and moving to NYC. I was surprised by the wit and mind of the basic script and struggling with how the story of production in the movie shows the story of playing itself - and with the very cleverness there. Experiments and torture of life in Manhattan parallel many Shakespeare play, and Central Park rarely put better use than wood near the Macbeth fortress. Mr. Lombardo has revealed a pleasant place to the story of New York and New York (Knots is a funny comedy and warm comedy about six thirty and something New Yorkers set especially in the charming Brooklyn neighborhood, and the Manhattan office and the city loft cast for good measure) and spent a lot of time near Shakespeare games. The movie is paced and the story shows a comprehensive understanding of the key drama on the basis of Macbeth. Reminds me of the "Richard Package" of Al Pacino - another wonderful Shakespeare "playing inside the film." I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
