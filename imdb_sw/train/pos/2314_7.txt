I was hearing good things about this film and it was, you had it, I was disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is as promised a beautiful, awesome confidence, while limited; all really (small) cast is quite stable, in their simple 50s American environment. The reason I saw this high film is especially that towards the end, the sadness shown by an older sister did not seem true and this drew me to a little film. Maybe we are expected to fill a plot, or maybe the film is needed to be a bit. Maureen's character is very poor. It is understandable that Dan (Reese W., younger) will have trouble and anger, but why is his sister shown more? Because he is young age? What? Last did not completely reduce the film? The enjoyment of the film causes Maureen and the Court to meet only, when it gets tractored (warning: this area is amazingly brutal, to look again looks like it would be trying a bit amazing. Well it works!). Depends on what you want - if you want the story of the happy teenage girls that looks like you're going to get, you're in surprise. A person in the Moon is old and dreamed by coming to the hard film of age? A mixture of alternative concerns? I liked the court's behavior though, I can see what girls look at this might be looking. And I liked that they had all the courage to allow a little sister (many men could, many films would not be) and be killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my negative measurement rate. For some reason I've found Jason in a funny tractor.
