I've heard people who say this film is very light. I don't think they were looking for a suitable film. This is not an exciting action, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological game about rookie and its mentor that just happens on killing people. In this way it works very well, with good performances from Berenger and Zane (who can't sleep through the movie as he has other responsibilities - actually looks like he works). I was shocked by the move towards the end - most of it did not make much sense and it was satisfactory due to being built from all films. But look at Zane's face with fear, alone, while Berenger is doing dirty work.
