The DVD of "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very unusual. That's because the films are made in French and headlines and some are called English from French. Sometimes, the characters beat between the two middle areas! I tried to get a film that JUST subtitle or just dubbed, didn't make any difference! Unusual, but still seems. <br /> <br /> The story intends to rely on Poe's story, although I can't remember one. In fact, Poe's behavior appears at the beginning and end of the film - though it didn't look exactly like him. The rich man makes a bet with someone under his fortune that he can't stay all night in a home manner. It looks like a simple bet - even if the house is very interesting. However, it can not be easy, if the rich man says that all who got this bet died - but this fool STILL wants to make a wager! At home, he meets Barbara Steele beautiful and falls for her. Later, however, he learns that he died more than ten times earlier! How can this be? I could tell you more about the plot but they don't want to destroy any doubts. See yourself to know all the story. This movie gets high scores for creating an interesting environment. Houses, black & white movies and music work together to make a scary film scary. For the plot, it is interesting - especially because there is a lot of deviation and turns - many that wonder who and who is not among the undead end of the film. The worst is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was to be killed without unnecessary. Crazy as it may seem, I felt sorry for it and it wasn't difficult to seem to be important. Also, parents may want to know that at the end there is a bit of dirt. A very beautiful woman looks good, but it's not hard for a conspiracy.
