I LOVE Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for more than a year. We went to the Doodlebops Festival last year with one festival yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach alphabet or numbers but who cares? What? you get worse? TV is not recommended to teach your children about the number or alphabet. parents should. Get more. Doodlebops actually can sing. Deedee has a good voice and at the concert you can tell 3 of them they have good voice singing and don't ask for a voice. Think, they play, jump next to WEN singing. they have talent, children love me even enjoy watching the show. This period is for the best display on TV for children. AND A rock band for children. How wonderful? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear it? Whether he is or not, He is awesome! Don't leave it alone. Its not like him or anyone else is promoting homosexuality for our children!
