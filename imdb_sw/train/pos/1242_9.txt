I love this film. It is well written and works and has great movies. The story combines the action, humor, lie, and sympathy for the big sets and good shots of the area. See, buy, show to your friends. <br /> <br /> Acting is good and Murphy actually does a good job to show the hero competent / worried. I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and highly developed and powerful interaction. I took care of what happened to these people and, when the results were very unpredictable (the beautiful girls win, the girl gets an attractive girl and the baby saves lives - who doesn't see that coming?), still makes me happy when everything gets well at the end. Thank God the honor of this film has never been destroyed by the crappy sequence. Grab some popcorn, cuddle on the bed, and watch this fun, fun and entertaining film.
