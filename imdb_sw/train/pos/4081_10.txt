I just saw about all the films of Miyazaki, and both are beautiful and beautiful. But this rises over others. This movie was completely surprised! I loved Pazu and Sheeta, and their caring, caring friends. They were what made the movie to me. Of course, the animation is also good and the music is sounding in the film perfectly. But the characters are a glittering point in this film: they are very developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now I would like to explain: I'm talking about the Japanese version of the movie (and English subs). When the English dub is good (especially), it just corresponds to the original language version. Sounds are best, conversation, everything. So I recommend seeing (and hearing) the film as it was before.
