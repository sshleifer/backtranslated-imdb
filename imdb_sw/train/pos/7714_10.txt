There were 50 movies of physics. They were great drawing on the movies of the park. Many of them had even loved back. This film and 'World Day of the World' has stood, and both have been in their own way. From the beginning with its original music logo (which still looks amazing since then it has never been used) The World Planet takes you to where no one has gone before. Speaking on Star Trek there are many material in this film that has entered the Star Trek TOS as a series of attempts; from the interaction captain / first woman / doctor, mad scientist, alien creature, child of short skirt, computer intelligence; it's rageur now but this is the first of its kind. Besides, it has a good and well-made exhibition that even today fears some pictures. Consider how Krell's big machine has been done successfully with deep depth. I saw this as a child (in a car-in: 0) when it was a new movie and feared me. Of course every movie which was not even scary at the same time but I remember having real concerns about the invisible monster. A non-prevented planet is a sci-fi fan can look several times and find something new by looking at each other.
