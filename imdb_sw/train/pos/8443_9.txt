My favorite police watch is always on TV. What? It works? Yes. Gee runs the mayor and is shot. "The popularity" of the murder is turning out. Pembleton and almost all fighters who have ever played in this series. Many obstacles help those who have never seen a television series but also encourage fans too. The last five minutes are solving the other killings and the end of the dead dead. And a short appearance from my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good film.
