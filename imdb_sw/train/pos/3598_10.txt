To be a person who rarely enjoy boxing movies, the feeling is just about boxing and not the characters themselves, this film moved to reality. I wanted to be able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) through many items in a very short time, it was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did a very good job to play Diana especially since this was her first experience of acting, expressed real feelings and showed Diana with wonder. All characters had chemistry on the screen and made this film more amazing. I strongly recommend this film even for those who do not normally watch boxing movies. 10/10
