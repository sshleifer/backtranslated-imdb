One does not enjoy this gem, 1936 Invisible Ray, many times. But no one can forget it. Stories are elegant. Karloff, the most motivated by the headquarters of the Carpathian Mountains, is Janos Rukh, scientific science who reads the ancient rock rocks to ensure events in a large geological period mainly particularly the fall of powerful radio meteorites in Africa. Join him is Lugosi's prestigious (like a rare hero), who reads "astro-chemistry." Frances Drake is a good, non-working wife; Frank Lawton a romantic temptation; and Violet of God Kemble Cooper is Mama Rukh, in the performance that requires Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> Story goes faster in bold, and special effects that are still relevant. It also has good lines. One Rukh returns to his mother's eyes, asks, "Mama, you see, you see?" "Yes, I can see more than at any time. And what I see is afraid of me." Even better when Rukh's mother says, "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone among my friends amazing for many years exactly what this first science law. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely the island's facilities.
