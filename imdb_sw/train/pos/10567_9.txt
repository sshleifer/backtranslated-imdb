Wonderful. One of the best music ever. The three numbers of Busby Berkely completing the film are amazing, but what makes this film is amazing is a wonderful non-stop patter and acting natural Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also good, although it can't be a good actor). There is a freshness in the movie that you don't see in today's flicks, much less in the usual film of stilted 30s, although the plot, including the introduction of the movie prologues, is quite a date.
