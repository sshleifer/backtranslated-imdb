It is very amazing English film for many reasons. First is a rare look Laurence Olivier in the light comedy. While its performance is not over the level that he could set as one of the most 20th century executives, he is completely loyal as a hoodwinked barrister. For historic this film has great interest because of where and when you were shooting. That English did not have a big budget of Hollywood films of the same era and often shows, but more interesting is the fact that this film was made just before the war and shows the UK which has recently gone. When we look at it today we are thinking of modern values ​​and more to look at the fact that this film and the closest part of America's 'One Night' was in their day as risqué as the 'Death Kills' was our time. But after watching and enjoying this film for the first time I can't help but feel sad when I look at it today. For half of the film shot before the 1950s, save the remaining film means a tough choice, and the unfortunate film as this often pass on to save movies we all consider important. Changing color, lack of variation, and usually poor quality of newspapers often appear to be a heart attitude. This film with 'One Night Night' is perfect to lose and love one under the blanket on a cold winter evening and look, or better yet why not a double feature.
