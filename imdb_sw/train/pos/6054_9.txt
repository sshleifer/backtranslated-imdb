I saw the Freebird preview on the Isle of Man TT as I heard about it in a couple of motorcycles. Although I was more for racing, the sound of seeing Phil Daniels in a movie of the motorcycle (yes i love Quadrophenia like everyone else) to prove enough to me away from beer and split. Finally! we have done it! we UK have made a great film of motorcycles (and no not like Torque) this is up there with the best of the British comedy. Write my words, this is the best work of Phil Daniels, and up to Geoff Bell is involved, there is a new British story that makes his name feel. I loved Gary Stretch in the Great Mansions of Shane Meadows and here he gives a silent performance to touch that he can add pride to his growing film reputation. This is a film not only for us Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my partner loved it). I hope she gets the same brilliant answer on the continent as it found the Isle of Man. I can't go to the details of some of the basket events that this movie has, (see the shop), if it could damage the fun, but I would say, go, rejoice, and have one of the best night at the movie you had on time. In fact I think this might be a group of worship. As they said in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
