After all the strings that Hollywood (and Indies) have been removed, we finally get a movie that provides some time of horror. There is a certain time of cliched, but I don't know possible these days to make the original film completely. No more here ... done well. Make sure and pay attention, as the "trick" season comes regularly and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. There is a single red-print ceremony that is well written on this film and, unfortunately, is one of the most common roles. Christian Cheri does not make Julie good (wife / mother). For one thing, he can never fail. I know, I know ... he has experienced a tragic event. But the observer has not known him as he "usually" is the relationship between him and her husband is rather uncomfortable (in an unusual way). I think the director had meant us to be sympathetic for him, but I've never done. <br /> <br /> Finally, the finger for the last, which is exciting and satisfying. It might be easier to have a reasonable time at the beginning of the last features, but the director refused to the wise. <br /> <br /> This is not a jewel in any way, but it's good, old movie scary ... something that is rather a very few today.
