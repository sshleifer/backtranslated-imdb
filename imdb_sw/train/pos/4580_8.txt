Princess Tam Tam has no racist events, in the way we think about racism in the United States, but there is more subtlety (for American viewer) about ethnic identity at that time. Beware of the alpha (Baker) alignment in the shots, how he is described by other characters, its close proximity to all that shows that it is "safar" of Africa, and ask if Alwina has anything that has been hit in the organization. I do not want to destroy anything but at the end pay attention very much, dichotomy between "East" and "Western" culture are saying the least bad, such a diction is thanks presented these days. The French have gone through as a royal power in all areas shown (see Les Repeat of Chris Marker Meurent Aussi-1953), and look at where European migrants visit them in Africa, and what it shows about their attitude towards "other". I give this film 7 because I am a sucker for Baker, a lot of what he did in his professional career, like Princes Tam Tam, which is regressive truly on the shadow and his efforts for cooperation, his work as spaking spy (I am gushing, sorry.) However my film for me impresses it because of its performance, rather than being a direction to worry.
