Sidney Franklin's "Good World" has been grateful for the most common nature for a non-timeless story and acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won Oscar for the O-Lan show. The rainfall is complete, he is almost unaware. Having a very short conversation in the entire film (and it is long), Rainer relies on instead of the facial and body language. He looks and makes Chinese sure that anyone who doesn't know his work can easily offend him. <br /> <br /> The film still remains today because it examines bags for the rich story and all the themes that come with it. When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they have a full life of wealth but they have no meaning. It is only when they return to the earth after fighting with locust swarms (special effects of repair is still amazing and good looking) that again get to fulfill. The most common form described by the Chinese family (especially in 1937) makes the film more common. Money is not worth anything without friends and family, something that the film runs at home in the last 10 minutes and the emotional conclusion.
