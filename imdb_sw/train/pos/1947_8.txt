SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a sudden. I would like to see workers changing life on earth after returning. I think the authors expected this problem for "loading forward" some of the traders in the world system at the beginning of that section. (Of course, the time line has been removed, so it's all root.) I did how Admiral Janeway died to the workers of Voyager. As fans, we can have our cake and eat, for both Janeway and the whole make a final sacrifice and live. I agree that the events of Janeway and her old man to have a conversation are wonderful and they could easily cross the line at the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) smoked.
