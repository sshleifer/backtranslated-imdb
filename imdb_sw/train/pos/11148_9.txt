'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X and released earlier in 1969. There are some instances where you can understand that, just a little bit. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) from Texas to New York City being a hustler is sometimes a little disruptive. Wearing like a cowboy tries to live like a hustler, make money for the act of love. It doesn't work as planned. After a man named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first gave him a trick and stole money into friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe tries to get money. <br /> <br /> With the movie tested X for the main subject but the way we see amazing things. The editor in this film is good. We see a series of dreams from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a beautiful and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and support administrators provide good performances. Especially Hoffman offers good popular lines. The mark is made by John Barry and it looks good. All this makes this great film won the best Oscar image for good reason.
