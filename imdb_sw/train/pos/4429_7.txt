I myself thought the movie was very good, very good to act for Tadanobu Asano of the Killer Killer Killer. In fact I can't say much about the story, but there were parts that were very confused, and in general I thought the movie was too long. Other than that, however, the movie had a very good fight and many places were shot very well, with serious consequences, and with many swords. Another effort was established by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I can't say again about the film, but if you're just looking at the Asian movie is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or the House of Flying Daggers, I would like to give you a try to try a tax, but if you're dying- a movie of Asia's hard movies I would say this should be in your collection of a very good Japanese film.
