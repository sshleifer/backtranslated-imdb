My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I've never forgotten. I have never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (He had twenty-two when he made a elephant trip) Remember, I am nine years old, so feeling not sex, I couldn't see anything on the screen. I wanted to sit on his feet as a puppy and watched him. He has begun to show his age, (he is about seventy-four) but I still believe that one of the most beautiful and beautiful women has ever lived. <br /> <br /> I have seen the film several times since, and is the melodrama of sappy. What saves, beauty, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the great beauty, the fascinating beauty of the elephants, and the proper assurance of human pride in the natural face. All of them, well for several hours of hours looking at a film or planned video.
