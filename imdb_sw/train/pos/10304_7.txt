"Bruce Force" looks and looks very stupid, especially from trailers. However, I've got into it a deep message that really made me like this more film. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and has been given divine authority to be God for a week to see if he can do the best work. Morgan Freeman shows a person who represents here as God, and although it is not his usual kind of film or one of his best responsibilities, he does well with what he is given to work with. Although often, the film has fewer soups, from Bruce to divide his soup to half as the Red Sea and the customer's response to him, as well as the image of the rear of the back and the wisdom of God. It is more than a widespread time, and there is an unusual humor, but generally it may be more funny. There is good support for use, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film shows that it is romantic love and tears, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "be a miracle." The film is far from perfect, but it still enjoys it, and it is much better than me and many people we might have expected, especially if we see a comprehensive film message. <br /> <br /> *** out of ** **
