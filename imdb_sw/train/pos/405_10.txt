I've been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best movie of fantasy in years. I don't know "action" is kind of right, though there's a lot of action and KongFu looks. Waiting, did I say this is a wonderful girl of fantasy? Please keep in mind that you do not use the hollywood form to test this film. And for a boy who "poo" around, I don't blame you, because you're still young and need to know more about "culture".
