Walking through the weekly Sci Fi Weekly Video Shop I had lost hope of finding the most beautiful movies I have never seen. The Cypher hiring was like a punt on a very rough horse. My son is full of the current "B" Science Science Science which he had no trouble seeing this yet. It should understand I don't see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I missed it. This was a very good surprise! This is also no movie B. It is not a "blockbuster" of the various epic forms and does not try to be - more than a static film that needs to be seen several times for that fully preserved plot. Specific effects are of power presented when used - my only complaint is a super helo is a clear open CGI at first glance, but they get the right of it is seen 2, & that aside everything else is on notch . In any case it is affected by secondary. <br /> <br /> We will not give anything about the plot. The plot structure has a feature of the Russian Doll's small reminder of the Basic Foundation (although with very different content). I'll just tell you that choosing Jeremy Northam to lead was the stroke. The helicopters were born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his emphasis on this film is as sensitive to New England's most pressed language, tad off key. See the end of the plot and you will see why that is such a brilliant option! And Lucy Liu is also the same as "he will kiss me - he will beat me." I rarely watch movies several times a day - this is one of them.
