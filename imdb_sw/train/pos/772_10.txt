Love is amazing ... In all exhibitions ... Very good, very good ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one wonderful story about love in all shapes, stories about the wrong ways of a few hearts, about The life and the loss of all the crimes led by Tudor Giurgiu's knowledge. With a loud voice involving Faultline & Chris Martin and Veche Vama is a surprise for every way left behind a delicious taste of incomprehensible love ... What a wonderful truth ... Is it a movie or movie cinema in slow but actually develop and get respect? This is a brilliant film ... Two to every person involved.
