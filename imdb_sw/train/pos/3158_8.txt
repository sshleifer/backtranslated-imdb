There are so many styles of sitcom but the one who works best is the old way with viewers and put in. The 70's Show is a good example. When the show was over, nobody felt about Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp under the young performers well with Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leave to show this year to follow other interests) I would like Topher to stay around because the show started on his character, Eric, with a close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough, consider Ashton and Demi Moore. The release of executives was not known to us which is good because a man who has been beaten by a celebrity may destroy it. I loved Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend. I have lost Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, instead it couldn't be compared with her and I'm sorry about it. I loved being thrown by Tommy Chong as a lost man but a dear father of Steven Hyde. I liked watching Tanya Roberts instead of the Angel of Charlie. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. He showed good talent before going to Broadway. This view has been fun and many surprises. I hope that this show takes a long time even though 2 of their cast members come out but I hope they don't stay too far. I would like the designers of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my favorite show, the Third Rock from the Sun, is more successful for Fox than they were on NBC which lost their show. Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this later.
