This is one of those western which, well, stands almost alone in the infinite quality of his conversation. Very few can hold on it for a long time. That said, the rest is very bad. However I have given eight because there are no other western talks with very good talks and maybe except the Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps a few more. It is full of weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore was the most brutal. However it has a single realistic place. Nothing like that. His right after Kid Wichita killed the sheriff, and goes to Jack Elams place trying to whistle in battle. Wonderful things. And then the best in any west.
