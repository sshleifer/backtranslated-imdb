This documentary follows the life of Big and Little Edie Beale, mother and daughter, who lived in their family home in East Hampton, NY from 50s to 70 years. , 78 and another 56, share the squalid room. Elder Edie Beale is aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the youngest is her first cousin. Women were being evicted from their home because of their reduced circumstances, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could survive. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie may seem to be effective, as a woman does not look at the best of mental health, but sometimes, movies are hard to look away. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current status, and her mother adds fire that Edie will not have the success she thought she was. "Little" Edie is often seen as standing in the past, taking into account the choices he made decades ago, and likes to show pictures from his youth, where he was exposed to good debutante. Her mother seems more resigning with her fate, living out of her whole life in a bad situation. There is a definite description of the beautiful life that women once led, from pictures showing a happy family, with a great picture of Edie's next to her bed. From what we see in the house, many inside rooms are empty, the walls are cracked and fall, and "Little" Edie causes food in the lounge for the racoons to eat. And of course there are many cats around it. In his heart, this document is very sad. When a woman or a woman is very sad for their life, the pastor living inside is very bad. It is not very clear if there is water running into the house, and you feel that they have been abandoned by their families. However, as a document, the film is wonderful to see, and it is highly recommended.
