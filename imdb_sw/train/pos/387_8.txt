This movie is good. Not the best CG giant kung fu flicks but it's very good. First thing, the story is very good. The whole idea of ​​gods vs fallen gods of dealing with super powers is pretty cool. My problem is so many characters! It was very controversial when they voted scenes! Special effects were added! The events of the fighting were very fast and difficult. This movie practically all computers are produced. Acting is good, as expected from those top players. Ekin Cheng makes the main character, the unique character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this film. I thought he would have a great place but he made one place to fight with a lot of yapping. The bad person, the whole skull and the whole thing of the blood cloud is very scared. Music is also excellent. For me this story deserves at least a mini series and not just one movie. Too many stories to complete two hours. Maybe if there is a book or something, I could continue with all the characters and notes. This story of offering a perfect film for action. I appreciate the Storm Riders on this day any day.
