Yes, Keaton looks like he enjoyed doing this film. By jumping in his step in his round suits, he reminds Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a hood of a young man who just does pay bills on his mother and send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to a law school. No one knows Johnny Kelly is Johnny Hazard until later on the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does not like little Johnny (and I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a good singing / play when Johnny goes through it. I love the place when they are in the getaway car in progress! Caller who "calls all the cars" is a Skipper from the Island of Gilligan! Look at this gangster's 1930 gang explodes! Gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you miss them! Look back at each location.
