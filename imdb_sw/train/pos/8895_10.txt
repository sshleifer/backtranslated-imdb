I felt free to this film on television, and I could not leave it .... It's the best movie that makes people learn about the history of America and the Vietnam war, during the power of the flower, the war of racism ... The political opinion, the race that took place in the 60th century .... I was born in 1980 so I do not know all the things before ... In France, the history of the United States is not a priority and the movie learned many truths! By the way, I think all participants are the best; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this film more time 1 every day !! It's so great .... it's just a shy look on the television not in the cinema ... <br /> <br />
