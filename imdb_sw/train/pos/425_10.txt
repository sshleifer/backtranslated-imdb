I would like to comment on the Love of April's film. It is one of all my stars because my father, Nelson Malone plays a horse trainer. I remember clearly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we took part in the Love of April. My father was in a lot of games and he had an experienced man. I told him to go for a small part, and look and see came home w / script. How exciting is that! Also, my fellow colleagues were in people's events - especially those shown in the amusement garden. It is quite amazing every month when I see the movie being shown again, and the Love of April and Pat Boone is still played on the radio. It is not available to remember the past when you see the movies they are doing today w / gender, bad language and violence. It would be fun to see more movies like April's love to return to view ...
