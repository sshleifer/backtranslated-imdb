Tony Scott can make a good and bad film, I think I can have a little flashy and trashy and his work seems to be facing a comparison with that of his most famous brother, but this is likely his best film. What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (with a strict form, better than Training Day) and a revelation who is Dakota Fanning when developing a warm relationship with compassion. Introducing is not being boring, although it takes time - it involves, and it takes us on a little journey into characters - including a great role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. These all serve to make the most effective more effective, as we are invested so much with the characters, for all their obvious weaknesses. This film has an edge in its entirety, and is not available at the end or. The video will certainly be something without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many responsibilities, when he is clear as anyone leading out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has the most powerful screens these days). This film should be great, due to its dynamic and dynamic performance, and film quality. It just comes to show you that if the label does not back the film for the hilt, it ends up going directly to the video. I wish I had a chance to see this on the big screen.
