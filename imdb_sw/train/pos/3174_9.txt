Very rarely one gets an indie comedy that leaves a permanent feeling. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The author of the writer is not only coping with the challenge of leading his own work, but it provides a hilarious performance as a bad fool. The script takes an amazing look at not only the problem of the struggling writer, but it is very confusing to play in a world of a writer who cannot help but dedicated to Ernie as a character. Very interesting things. Despite the small budget Adam Jones can give the film a look at the strict. We can't stagger when it comes to making a good film. I can't wait to see what comes and next. This person can laugh at people and think; that's special.
