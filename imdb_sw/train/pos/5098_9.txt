Even the long-term Shirley fans can be surprised by "Now and Forever." Movie was done with the Paramount studio? not with the parent company of Shirley's twentieth century Fox? in 1934, before the Fox producer Darryl Zanuck achieved the success of Shirley formula (good songs, cool hearts for melt, young teenagers for playing cup for, end up happy). So "Now and Forever" comes in the Shirley car field without Shirley's story. It is an inappropriate position for any movie, but this amazing, talented work. Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as fun, non-accountable for Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing that this dedicated duo is still not able to hate is more than being together is far away. When suddenly they had the protection of Jerry Penny's daughter (Shirley Temple), is Toni? and not Penny, many believe? who persuades Jerry to stop his crime work. But Jerry screams at his desk work, and desperate to prove that he can give his new family, soon returning to thieving and honesty. In a typical Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of the curmudgeon who lost Felix Evans, who was affected by a jerry jerry, but his attempt failed, because Evans was revealed to be an artist himself, and beat Jerry to help him steal the jewels. The motifs, gunfight, death, and the following sadness make this film unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no exciting end, no rhythm, and just one sequence of the song (good number "The World of Me Me Hai") But this does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever." Instead, it's different from the common story of Shirley make it more attractive and memorable than most of his other films. But beware: You should avoid the color version of this film, and see it in black and white colors if you can. Colors are bright, fragrant, and odd, and in many cases, the popular curls of Shirley are actually red rather than blonde. Yikes!
