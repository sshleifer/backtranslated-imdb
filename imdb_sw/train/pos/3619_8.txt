Despite the best Disney efforts, this is a very exciting movie about your dream. I was surprised that you didn't beat me like more than a feeling; This movie played the balance. Dennis Quaid was good, very good in the role, which says something for filming games. I can't remember how many sports films had little things that bother me; here, everybody looks at that part. This film is so amazing, and I predict that it will make an amazing business like a G-tested movie that doesn't require a viewer to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this film is successful.
