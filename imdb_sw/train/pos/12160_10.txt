The black comedy down, the best in the series of great guignol films follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of murderers (nod to 'Compulsion') who run to hide in Hollywood. They run the school with the fingers of the film, which is a group of brave children who have attended and very bad moms. Debbie, in its blonde base ('I'm Harlow, you're Marion Davies' more tells Winters) leads your fingers to their concert and win a rich father, Weaver. He also makes a happy cucumber and, above all, provides excellent performance, unlike anything he did before. The atmosphere is a good mix of comic and eerie. It looks amazing in detail over the period (30). Plenty of delightful flowers on Hollywood and the movie's very frightening. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a sports coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he is stirring, 'r two but prophecy however'. See and love it.
