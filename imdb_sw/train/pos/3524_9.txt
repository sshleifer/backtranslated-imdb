For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when I was still not jazz. There are ongoing exhibitions until the end of June in the new Paris of MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, its name LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, not to lose, and like NINE special entries from jazz films, including the famous PHANTOM LADY . I have seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - next to all their films, and I can confirm the following: 1.Flash Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. That was some development, since in his other exhibitions was KILLED (especially in Howard Hawks of BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa was probably called Cook in PL. I was able to recognize his style, for he was qualified from tom tom used (and abuse) at the beginning of his career - ie in 1937 Hollywood HOTEL SING, SING, SING sequence - and finally got everything possible from what we call to French "la caisse claire ". 3. The sequence of the PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not available.harry carasso, Paris, France
