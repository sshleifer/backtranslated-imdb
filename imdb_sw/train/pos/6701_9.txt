I loved the first season 2. because many good characters were lost later. as it shows more is kinda slow first and get better in the future season, but this is completely reverse. jenny from the first season with Valarie from the second season were friends of Sabrina, I didn't care about others, jenny and Valarie were his most cool friends. I think for some reason, manufacturers wanted us not to love his college friends for some reason, they were harsh to Sabrina. but my favorite part from the 1st season is a cat showdown and my favorite part from season 2 is a witch wizard, that's the funniest part. I thought it was also funny how Libby was popular but was always jealous of Sabrina, and never seemed to be a real partner but always wanted to have Harvey. I just liked they would do better. I also loved how the first 2 seasons, during the cuts of Sabrina while wearing clothing, as in the experimental part where she is in magic dress, I loved how she said "this is not me" and later on she kept trying to pretend to be something another is what I think, but this is a real show. is kinda like show andri griffith show in a good way for the first time but once turned the color and barney fife left, it was the most beautiful. but I still like to look at it, but the only reason I look at in the future is because of sabrina. what I meant about the opening sequence is: the opening names of the 1-3 seasons shows Sabrina in front of the mirror with different clothing and different clothing as the names of the cast members hit the bottom of the screen. At the end, Sabrina says some kind of clothes related to the clothing she is wearing, then disappears. The sequence of the opening of the fourth season connects the characters in bubbles. The opening opening of 5-7 seasons has Sabrina in various places near Boston
