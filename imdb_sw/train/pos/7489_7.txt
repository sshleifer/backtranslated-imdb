This film has many strong points. It has one of the best fears outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney cycle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye, as well as lead leader Melvyn Douglas. It has all the best buttons: bats, fortresses of rock, mad scientist, people of flames and hunting seats, characteristic of "Igor", a beautiful girl, even angry Burgomeister. Work-camera function of the past is moody and imaginative. There is even a good aid comic published in all script. But it is not really a movie of the monster because nothing unusual is going on in "Kleinschloss" ("small fortress"). This program surrounds a natural scientist (nicely played by Atwill) who has the value of his work more than human life. It is not advanced equipment, because of the resolution of the conspiracy with some of the bad Dwight Frye talks. But it's worth checking if you like awesome b / w pictures.
