For a film that describes sex and skin, it doesn't have the right to be as odd as sweet. Bettie's story, a beautiful Christian girl from the South who momma did not allow her until she got married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful of her age, driven by the best performance from Gretchen Moll. His page can't completely reconcile images that take (no one accepting touch, it's fun and respectful) and attempts to photograph and the effects that its claims have around the world. > Page has been an inspiration for every burlesque artist since, not only because he had a dead figure, but because he invested every image with an innocent feeling of fun which was unique to the sexy and easy at the same time. Rather like this film, in fact. Filmde in black and white technicolor and white technicolor, is a good way to spend several hours.
