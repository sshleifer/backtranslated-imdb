Hey people, what it is. I am a man, Mike one and only "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ you can't write a review on the Sakura script, because there we didn't have one. As far as I knew, the story was only made when we were going. I had a good time of my life and made the film, and I had so much that I came out of Jism ...... I am so glad that you all enjoyed the film. In fact I didn't get to the fight I had seen. Every time I start a step, the battle director continued to change them. However, I had an explosion and met some very real people. Especially the lady of purple Ninja who has seen the collapse of the scene of film making.
