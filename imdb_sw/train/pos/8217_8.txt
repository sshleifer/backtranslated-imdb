With this movie being the only film of Wafi Harry which Clint Eastwood is not just a star, but it produces and leads also, you know it must be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best of the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, except Dirty Harry of nature, Impact suddenly and Power of Magnum are just two deserving to be in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good film and good practice, it does not get the effects and dirt that the other three films are doing. This film takes all the excitement that makes the film Clint Eastwood good, and has the films that make the film beautiful Harry. At the wedding of Harry is ".. What is it, punk?"; in the Power of Magnum "A person should know his limitations"; and in this is "Go ahead. Make my day." Also in this film is good to see climate change, since you get too tired to see the old San Fransisco streets in another film in the series. By doing good work with Clint Eastwood and star partner Sandra Locke, with good leadership and Clint, this is in my best Dirty Harry good ever.
