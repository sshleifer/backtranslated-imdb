They went to Wal-Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea if I made a bad or good purchase. It is the future result of watching the entire film from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05', gave good performance and her looks is beautiful, sexy, and at the same time real research in the art of how it actually works. Diana did not like her life at home and especially her own father for abuse gave her mother. He decides to get boxing training in Brooklyn's inner gym and is unacceptable in fact with male masters. In his secondary school there is a friction between female students and boys. There are many steps in women's bathroom and references as private parts of boys. If you like the box, and see the fire of a good fire makes wonders in the ring and knock the boys on them you know Is this a film for you.
