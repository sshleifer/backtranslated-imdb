Robert Taylor as a dog dog madness Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film. At first I was thinking that Charlie could free himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart at The Naked Spur. But if the film goes along Gilson continues to do more evil until you realize there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because she knows that buffalo will be gone and will be hated by the act of murder. Gilson is a natural killer who makes a distinction between animals or humans. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is an amazing character based on self-placed control of the time. He sleeps with Gilson for general resignation though he hates. The last part of Gilson is stored, unknown.
