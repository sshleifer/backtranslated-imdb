I loved the way of the world. His photography is impossible, editing must be an interesting challenge and the voice of Patrick Stewart on the PERFECT. By adding his music and voice editing, the EARTH experience an unknown experience that you don't want to miss. You are actually on a journey that you may never have ended alone. And though, for the first time, I was so surprised by the laughter of the audience when we saw animals in their daily battle for survival, I couldn't help laugh at another time. The situation just looks very interesting to understand. But, instead of needing to laugh, I left the movie with a deep question: "Jinsicome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt bitter and incapable after seeing EARTH. I felt the urgent need to change the world, to help all the animals in their fight, to erase the changes we have made in the last century to stop once-off (all non-NGO activists at all) ... explained at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our wonderful planet (and polar bell) from its desperate destiny. (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find the direct answers to my questions there. However it was very interesting to know more about the film and the struggle his crew went. <br /> <br /> I hope that you refuse to use my energy to do. I do not know how to reduce the polar stroke distance should swim to reach the ground before sinking or attacking animals that cannot beat in their proper condition ... very happy.
