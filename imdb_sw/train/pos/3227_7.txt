Kurt Russell is strong and (especially) calmly in this future thriller from Paul Anderson (Radiation Event, Bad Worst.) Put on a waste planet, soldiers play like a cross between Rambo and Shane, and Russell he can say as a character of the title, "obsolete" genetic soldier left to die. Colonial assistant, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and Michael Chiklis who can win. They use many films to be afraid of Russell, and all others are running their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best. With almost no words to say, he produces feelings, emotions and sense and looks and eyes. It is almost the performance of mime. When a series of steps will enter the gear, it drives the ass - and it does so with power, silence, the real thing. There are errors. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "moral" soldier. Jason Isaacs feels a great feeling for Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a leader of the weaselly leader, and Gary Busey uses the stomach (and around his bed) as a Todd adviser. This is a flick, with the best flick, and recommended for anyone who wants to visit a second for Blade Runner's world - David Webb Peoples wrote both photos.
