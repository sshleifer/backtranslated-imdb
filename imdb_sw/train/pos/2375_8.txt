I honestly think that that's the best version of world war I have seen every. it was funny but it is also a learning I learned a lot of movie and if I would like that movie. My favorite part when soldiers were killed on a robot and another came right from behind it. in the final battle of the world film I think that would like more than the first and would have been better. but any way I give this movie 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> and like where to make another film like this I will look at. Thank you
