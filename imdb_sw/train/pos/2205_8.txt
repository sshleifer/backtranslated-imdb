Your typical psychological physiological field (easily caused by a weak player by Stephen Sachs) prohibits the “young” young people (using the word very freely) at the Dayton Hall University, which is closed for destruction. Together with the horrible and casting acts (Daphne Zuniga makes his film ignore and surprising here like Debbie, a bimbo whose head is broken by a car!), A very good 10th, similar to f / x and Matthew Mungle, a few killings blood (baseball bat bludgeoning, cutting chicken wires, your normal rate through a little head, that kind of awesome thing), an amazing surprise surprise that has been published later in "Intruder," an amazing score by Christopher ("Hellraiser") Youth, a little smidgen of free female scarcity, and the improper attitude of Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with the "Power" and "The Kindred"), this very interesting piece of humority high as a good dopey program and drecky low-grade fun.
