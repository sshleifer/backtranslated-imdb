This will be a different kind of inspection. I have seen this film twice on television and would like to have a copy because it talks about the city of Panama and the beach during the winter which is my time to be there. It was the first film I saw with Ashley Judd and she was good and I enjoyed everything else I saw inside. Sundance's response has made me feel also, as well as director, Victor Nunez, who was directed by several movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I haven't seen anything that I can compare with. The program speaks less than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of inspection.
