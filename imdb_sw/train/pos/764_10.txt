Of course Beat Street is the best film about the breaking scene. Everything about it is a spot on, clothes (puma), music and very important to play! Story story is basic, but what tells the story about? The whole part of the film is to show what the children of that time at the time they were doing, what was important to them. It shows that young people are generally good, all mentioned by these everyday children was music, play and friendship. Having seen the DVD soon I was surprised by how surprised it was to test the time! Clothes were not found dated (perhaps because Puma now has to return to return), the music still looks fresh, and play still captivating look. The movie 10-25 year old person should see as part of their youth culture.
