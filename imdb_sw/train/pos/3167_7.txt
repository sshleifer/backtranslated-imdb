This is one of the films that explore the complexity of the culture of Eastern people in Western cultures. The love of Tokyo is a sad film about the inability to resist impressive due to cultural differences. Ken, the rock is a powerful teacher, married Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so that she could stay in the United States when her visa is over. The marriage is expected to be short-lived, that is, until Kyoto gets legal status again. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, is happy Kyoto and tries to make things possible. This, despite his friend's urging to throw Kyoto and denying all the promises to girls is bad for the rock rock unless they encourage the writing of a song about broken hearts and all that. <br /> But Kyoto comes from the traditional Japanese traditional age, and he did not expect to be married to Ken all the time. Not only, he is injured at home and wants to return to Japan. It is sad that this person finally Ken thinks he can love him and be with all of that, but when one thinks he has found someone that way, the girl did not expect to stay long. It's not that he does not like Ken, it's just that he uses a whole way of life. He says, "I can't tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me how he feels in Japanese." It is a sad story of love and story of killing the techno-nintendo of 80s. It took Love in Tokyo time because it reminds me of one of my favorite 80s films, Tokyo Pop. And, for those who enjoyed the love of Tokyo, look at Tokyo Pop (New York singer goes to Japan and joins the Japanese port of the United States), but it is a movie that has fun. <br /> <br />
