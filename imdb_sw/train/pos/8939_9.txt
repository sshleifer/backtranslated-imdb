Changing the best selling book and Broadway play about Bessie's life and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters who lived over 100 years old. , they tell their stories through the play of Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a New York Times white journalist. The flashback and the present day scenes do not have the value of leadership in them as in the book, but actually it's powerful.
