Jack Frost is about a common killer sentenced to death. The death of the death of a prison car that he runs to and is captured by a chemical-filled tanker that turns his mass and snow into the ground turns into a snow striker. Be a murderer who will turn to a snow striker. Jack now wants to take revenge for the sheriff who took him. Jack now begins his rampage again to kill people in a small town. I don't think Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic horror but his entertaining entertainment. Just put your brain to hold on and enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously.
