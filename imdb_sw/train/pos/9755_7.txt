Last time I saw a movie I was about seven years old, so my opinion might be long. At that time I enjoyed photography which changed between cartoon and live action. At that time I felt sad for the blue camel and her sad life. I also felt a sense after the Captain Assistant to kidnap the heroine (princess or the pastor of the toy) table turned over it. Unfortunately producers never decided to transfer this film to VHS, so everything I have for twenty years. I am sure that if I see a movie again I would like to see corny and sappy, but I really enjoyed the movies then.
