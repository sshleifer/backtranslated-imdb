I took my time to appreciate the John Carpenter Music of Halloween. As a child, I remember I enjoyed very much, especially to return to Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first was slow and took too much time to reach the point. I looked at it several times recently and I know now I am missing. Today I really understand this film, it means, the whole feeling of this masterpiece. It's not about blood and cutting. It is not on the naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. That is the night that his brother is bound to return home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie means awesome and I think it is very successful. It is also one of the first slasher movies, a small kind of fear that I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, an impressive music and talented young actors, such as Jamie Lee Curtis in its first role. I need to say more? Anyone who has never seen, a fanatic or not, should do homework right now. It was highly recommended!
