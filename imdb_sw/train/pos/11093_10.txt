This is a small "small" film. I say "small" because it doesn't have one hundred gun to run or twelve explosions, like in John Woo's film. Major exhibitions by Roy Scheider and three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to be more fortunate with less productive these days. The movie is very easy to watch, the story is more than yarn than the washing machine - instead of everything around and around, it looks like things are getting worse when the plot spreads. Last wonderful, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can't be very different from the film because it looks like I'm watching Elmore Leonard's film.
