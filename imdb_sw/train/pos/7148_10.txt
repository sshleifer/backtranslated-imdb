This movie is one that I highly recommend. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) who is guilty of a crime and being sent to Camp Green Lake, detention of boys. There, he has to dig holes 5 feet deep with 5 feet to diamit. While there, it meets other boys of the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and ZigZag). They are all roaming, not 'building brilliant', but getting Kate Barlow's illegal treasure. In the movie (and book) Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. I am giving you this 9.5 film, because, I'm very happy when it comes to movie books, (I want the movie to follow the book. But, it was still very good.
