Jack Frost is Movie Movie. I Mean .... Of His Love. His Violence. and very enjoyable. Many people say it is B tested, but that could not be far from the truth. It has a Positive Effect and Doing Good. The only secret is Kozi, The Snowman Killer. I think this Movie was actually one of the best movies over the nineties. Most of these films These days do not exist for Clive Barker Master Plans. That is, Be the First and Give the Viewer They don't expect. Jack Frost is very Good. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. Ed Also suggests Movie Uncle Sam for Jack Frost fans.
