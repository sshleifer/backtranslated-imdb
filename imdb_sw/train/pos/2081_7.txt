1 looked on 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): He told farmers' accounts in China and increased skill and struggling with what Mama's nature gives us. This movie depends on the novel of winning awards and writing the family starting with marriage of the child who was married to a slave girl. The movie has a good job to put your interests together with some hammy performance and shot played by Paul Muni. It is a story, Wong Long (character played by Muni) and how he does land, buys more land, eventually becomes rich but then returns to the ground where he started. The relationship with his wife, beaten by Luise Rainer, is a great part of the story (instead of the land itself) and despite non-Chinese actors doing the best work to show the country and people. It is clear that MGM spent money to create a very good epic with this in a time when they could pay. The event with the locust has been done very well and all the movies are well seen to give them the best of Cinematography in Oscars that year. Definition of the epic point is what this story is and is given very well.
