Of course the best of John Le Carre's novels, have changed into a classic film. Peter Egan Exhibitions (Magnus Pym, Spy Perfect), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus 'Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus Advisor) , the Believer and the British controller, together with other characters, are perfect and common, the person responsible for giving them should be awarded. Even the smallest parts, such as the General Messenger, are carried out in full. It says a lot of the power of the exhibition, and the power of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than the Brotherhood Brother and Slimy Grant Lederer of the American Intelligence. I have read the book at least several times, and I watch the film almost often, and continue to be mesmerized by both. If I had one book to take a desert island, the Spy for Perfect would be a choice on all others.
