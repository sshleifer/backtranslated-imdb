I would just say that this may be biased, if I am a producer of the film. However, I will have a sense of respect. The film star, Oscar Ovies, offers stellar performance as Jeff Grinderlin, hypochondriac nbb who uses more time to worry than live. He brings a certain touch to his character that allows viewers to join him, by mentioning his thoughts often and with a sense of strong comedy. Her mother, played by Christine Haber, is a regular beam of help, that without, she would fall on her own. His friends also give credit to Jeff's life, often making a choice for him instead of allowing him to use his free will ... which often ignores it. This text is good, and the conversation goes like events from the movie Kevin Kevin, and half as Ben Affleck boo-hoo fests. <br /> <br /> The camera function is a little attractive for certain points, and the voice can also use power, however the outdoor displays highlight small details. It is also supported by sound voice and local talent and unique composer. For all, this was treated. A rare gem, among many instruments.
