Hardcastle and McCormick are the best TV show. Yes, it is very predictable as Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just a clean clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing. They often take each jabs to several parts, which adds great humor to the show. It has several cars running almost everywhere, but who does not enjoy the good car to revive? Especially with Coyote! I just want to make a good television like this today I recommend this very!
