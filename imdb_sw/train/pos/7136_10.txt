I saw the movie before reading the book of Michelle Magorian and I enjoyed both. The movie, most of the book, made me close to tears several times. This film touches the depths of the human soul and cannot allow it to go. I encourage many people to watch this masterpiece and as soon as possible. I give ten stars.
