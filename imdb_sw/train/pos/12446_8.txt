After hearing of Mod gentleman before, but I have never read a novel or comic art, my wife and I loved the film very much. It has been presented, in an interesting way, a good introduction to its character and history. Though it has other things to click on, it's playing more close, well written. Sadly, this too, where the biggest drawback of the movie has been revealed. Playing almost lives on the capabilities of its administrators and unfortunately only half of the cast. While Alexandra Staden did a good job as Drummer Blaise, a colleague of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as Miklos hosted - did not. Exciting his way through the plot as it expanded the dental business, fails to create a state of concern that would make the movie a jewel. Support support is somehow, from bandits and graves that differ from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan like Irina.
