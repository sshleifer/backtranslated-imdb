This is the best movie. Sent is a great mix of characters and stories are beautiful. The movie is essentially about a doctor who has been properly trained to steal the bodies of dead girls and take them to his home. Immediately after the body in her home, she removes things (I hate using such a word, but I forget what she had been removed) and put it into her wife to develop her youth. Then the journalist, Patricia Hunter, examines the situation and begins to get answers to why girls die. He takes a trip to doctors' homes and interesting things begin to happen. Certainly look at this oldie, but goodie if you can.
