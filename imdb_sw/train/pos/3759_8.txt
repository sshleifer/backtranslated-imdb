Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are having near the rock stars in the future but still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in a popular public history but then a bad man (Joss Ackland) is put to kill Bill & Ted by sending a cyborg view to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent to the current and actually kill Bill & Ted real. Now, both are spirit and they must travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Guided by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, Borrowers) made a clever sequel for serious visual effects. More more fun and entertainment than the original. William Sadler (Shawshank's release) steals the show as Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a huge amorphic (1.85: 1) file with a good sound of Dolby Digital 5.1. The DVD has an exhibition trailer and exciting behind the image element. This end had an Office Office such as the original but also (Believers or not,) one of the best sequels made (based on your view). George Carlin repeats his role from briefly. Pam Grier also appears in a little role. It's a pleasure pleasure of fantasy. (**** / *****).
