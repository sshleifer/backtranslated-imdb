This movie struck him at home. Being 29, I remember '80' and my father works at the factory. I thought, if I was working hard too, if I was proud and never stopped I could also have a dream of America, a house, a few children, all the car calling yourself. I have noted yet, without a degree in something (unlike my father who left the ninth grade) with a great sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if someone has this movie on DVD or VHS. is made for TV, and I've seen an hour ago. Ic not find anywhere! I would like to show my friends, my pseudo friends, relatives and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once again, Americans would work for a sense of respect and that we were proud of what we had accomplished! I think the feeling is still there, but for a significant increase in the decline of many things done abroad ...
