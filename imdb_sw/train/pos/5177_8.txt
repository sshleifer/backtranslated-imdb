I watched the last night after being seen for several years. In fact it is a small, fun film, and a group of faces that you didn't know were in it. Arkin shines as always. See; you can't be deleted. By the way, it was only released on the DVD and contrary to its installation, it is Widecreen. Transfer is rather poor, but at least the entire movie appears. ; -) \ t
