China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock star in the United States. The Golden Harvet production was assisted by former director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately he was either lucky to enter the dragon or lost his touch because he is not the head of the director. The only reason to watch this film is to see the skills of combating Mrs Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was led by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it would be a classic action instead of a single fester action action flick. China O'Brien returns home to help her father. He has trouble with the local group and needs his help. So he returns home and restores the command (with the help of two impossible people). But will they have enough to stimulate Big Mister and kill her evil? If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock then this movie has found you. I was just delighted with the events of fighting, everything else is rubbish. Why did Raymond Chow not have a few shekel and hired the director of the highest point? It is recommended.
