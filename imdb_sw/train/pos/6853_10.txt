Wearing a Kill (1980) is a secret awesome film from Brian De Palma and it works really well. It is there. In a situation that makes you nervous. And it's not that an awesome film should do. is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, declining a little secret.Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a mature woman of sex is bright.Keith Gordon as her son Peter is a brilliant. This Detective Marino is one of the most colors in this movie.There are a lot of screepy scenes in this movie.The elevator is one of them. There are other models between these two movies.Both of these movies can cause sleepless nights.
