I don't care how beautiful rain-colored views get, this film begins! Beautiful movies, it has all, music stacks (Prince of coarse!), Romance, and game. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad, moving movie. I don't want to say FOR more, I; not in giving away a plot, but I will say this film is really true, there is a lot of sexual relationships that pass through these problems, many families are similar to those shown in the film. I see this to be very realistic and realistic, it makes the movie more moving. My favorite generation and this film is growing, most of us loved Prince and there is a lot of contact with any boy who has experienced similar problems. He said, it is obviously not just the film for young people, Id assures them of all age groups. And it's not too black, the movie has a lot of music, band performance, and fun and fun screens.
