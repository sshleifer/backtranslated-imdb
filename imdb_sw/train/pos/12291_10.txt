Classic realistic. It was done well and you did it. It reveals part of Paris which is alive and full of comedy and catastrophe. Although the 'Hotel du Nord' and the Hotel itself is still there, not homosexual (in the original sense of the word) and enjoy as it was once. The film makes a person lust for the past, which is lost, by relaxing and pleasing.
