No, this is not the fairy tale of Alice my friends! This story 'Wonderland' depends on the true story of the mysterious murder of Wonderland of blood that occurred back in California's 80. In the midst of this blood disease was none other than 'Johnny Wad' himself. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other weapons more than its milk milk-inch machine. In addition to being a famous adult actress, Holmes was also a drug addict who was a friend of various mobile junkies. Val Kilmer was often popular as Holmes, but once this behavior of Holmes did not make the milk quite. The movie has 'who' to help players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as women in the life of Holmes, and Eric Bogosian as a surprise tinsletown shock. These actors play an important part, directly or indirectly, in the murder of 'Wonderland'. Among this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was so fierce and awesome as a powerful Ron Launius. Lucas gradually increases with a great Hollywood player and returns to a scandal in 'Good Mind' and 'Sweet Home Alabama'. Director James Cox has sometimes appeared to be a small player to show a huge amount of overextended scenes, such as the famous Holmes instrument. Holmes was finally released at 'Wonderland' murder. She died from complications from the HIV virus. `Wonderland 'will allow you to wonder what happened on that night of blood, and if Holmes laid his arms. Oops! The bad movie of Holmes! Okay! That's enough before you get 'inheritance' I mean to be punished. Bye Holmies! *** Average
