Now this is like that! The first movie had a iffy dialogue with weak workmen, but it seems like this back team has found its items together in a series and put a strong, fun, creative and creative comedy that will put everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through . Great, this is full of many, creative and creative things, and is under a spoof on 80 movies at the same time. Hell's events are great, and so are Heaven. Certainly there is no deficiency in the loss of mad-cap that promises one, and you will never see another film like this. Even the last hammy of the movie is not as bad as the first, generally with a heart and fun in its very happy repertoire of family happiness. And even Keanu Reeves, despite looking up to 30, is not bad here. It looks like a good deal for me.
