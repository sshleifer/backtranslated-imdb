If the baseball is done hard, this film goes against what I expect in the sports film: the action of the real visible games, faithful characters, and the original story line. When the "Angel in Outfield" is very defeated in the first category, it succeeds in beauty in the last two. "Angels" says the story of Roger and J.P., two children of Anaheim's children with love and baseball but they are looking for a family, as well as that of the foolish spirit angels, struggling to draw fans and win games. He was inspired by his father's death promise that they would only be a family when the Angel won a pennant, Roger asks for help in heaven, and finds it in the form of a coal-fired diamond. And, while the temporary manager George Knox (shown by Danny Glover) begins to believe what Roger is seeing, the team hopes to turn their season around - and Roger and JP find something to believe. performance, and Tony Danza, playing a wet pitcher, also does well, despite having ZERO's view of how to get out of the windup!
