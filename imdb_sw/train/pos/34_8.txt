What a enjoyable movie! If you are a fan of Giallo, the Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. At the beginning, it is difficult to go against Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in Giallo alike. They are both wonderful - especially the innocent bouchet as a guilty woman who feared her life. Scenes kill in Red Queen Kill 7 Times is very good and reflects enough blood to make many fans happy. One of the first murders comes unexpectedly and actually finds a movie away from a good start. The murderer, the Red Queen, is one of the highest and most murderous killers I have seen in the Italian movie. 70s sets and fashions are amazing. In fact, all the pictures are interesting and the Red Queen laughs while riding at night as one of my favorite time in the movie. The helped way made all my purpose. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score may be better than I have heard from the composer. The main theme is memorable I could not remove my head for two days. The only two issues I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times comes in the finale of the film. First, the person responsible for murder is very easy to see. If you have seen more than a couple Gialli, you will not have any problem to decide who is behind the murder. Second, the end you hear a little too run and, as a result, is a little confusing. I am not definitely not the one who needs every step of the plot written to me, but I will agree to have a disadvantage to describe it all. Looking for a second can only delete this.
