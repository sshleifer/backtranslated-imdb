Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best films of the film. I think we can feel for "Gypo" because we have done everything that is right and that is not and is wrong. This was one of the first pictures of the art gallery offered by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> The movie of Joseph H. August is very good here. However, the wonderful part of August was overlooked; did not receive Oscar's appointment deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological game, with ideas, philosophy, sadness, all made in words as much as possible.
