This is the biggest film I saw in 2002, when I was in the movie. It is rich and makes a good artistic act from 11 short films. From the technical information (chosen directors), I was afraid it would have a basis for fighting the US, but ... it's kind of (11 times) personal taxes. What the weakest comes from Y Chahine: he cannot manage his "pride" and focus on this event as a deserved punishment ... It is a very weak part of the film, but this proves freedom of speech to the whole piece . Wonders come from the Mexican art film next to the concept ... I still don't know what A. Gonzalez Inarritu means. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost completely (C. Lelouch) and make me happy, or cry or even stop me surprised. I still do not know if S. Imamura's story relates to the truth or not the tragedy of September 11, but it is so good that its end puts it deeply 'makes'.
