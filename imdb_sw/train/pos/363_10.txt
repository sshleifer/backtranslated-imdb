This movie is about development. People who grow up with people are dying, people are wondering and people are desperate. It has all and more. There is hope, confusion, injustice, justice, love and hatred. In fact it is a typical drama that has amazing displays from each cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in its first place. <br /> <br /> This movie has made me feel very much and boasting, and I suggest that this film should be every Saturday in all prisons around the world - it touches your mercy. Testing: 10 out of 10. <br /> PS: I agree: I have broken tears during the last area.
