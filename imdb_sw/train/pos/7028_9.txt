We saw this as an original viewer for an accident, I have looked at it twice now. I was very excited, there was no thought of cheating that only triggered a good entertainment fun, good songs, good characters and just a good feel of the film. I did not know Rosie Alvarez plays with Vanessa Williams, she is the best and very happy. Songs like One Boy and One Kiss is the most enjoyable to listen to and hit your feet for Jason Alexander is quite different from his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley still joins my mind from Cagney and Lacey and her voice and hearing still had that reminder in it. I just liked it and I will look at it if available
