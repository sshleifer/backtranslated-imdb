One of the best (if not better) Stephen King's screenings. Dark as the darkness may be, surprisingly non-hollywood abolition, a state of fear, amazing book counter, better cast, education (not playing with afterlife), in short - everything good fear should be ... <br /> <br /> My awesome movie of privacy, the same 10+.
