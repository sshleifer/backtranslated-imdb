This is the first review I wrote to IMD so it hasn't been with me, but I've discovered this flick on HBO and I was happy to enjoy it. Richard Gere is good at this film as a passionate / detective agent who hides the law to get a job. I think this story is good, and there is no evil place that slows down the movie down. Some parts of the movie related to the sexual carers are made very surprising, but if you have ever seen a criminal film like Se7en, you will only be able to stomach. So, for all, if you are looking for a good screening / insistence, do not overlook this movie found on IMDb and certainly look at it.
