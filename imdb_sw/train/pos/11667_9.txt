Kells's secret is the film I was waiting for years after seeing the pictures on the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you now it's worth waiting. These cartoons are designed very much but not anger as I would like to be afraid. The whole film is a beautiful thing and a good idea, I love the most brightly illuminated book where small figures live on the page. Character is very good, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as a sharp Abbot and I especially liked the voice of Aisling sprite. The forest is a victory, a very good place. Stories are well recognized, a combination of facts and fantasy. and it actually draws a viewer to enjoy Brendan in his quest for Good Book tools. I am a lover of calligraphy and light however the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and not the fans of the trick to agree that it is a beautiful small film. I will be able to buy a DVD when it is opened, and you would like to say, well Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. Maybe there's a lot more. :) Come back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and give it at Christmas time, everyone likes! And I wish all the luck in the world in Oscars, happy as you see this appointment.
