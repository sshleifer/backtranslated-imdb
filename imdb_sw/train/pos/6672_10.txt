I have seen the People of the Hidden People stick to the media and to the general public (to take an imdb vote for example), but my general opinion is that Men's secrets are more fun than many films, more obvious than many so-called comedy films. very 'clever'. <br /> <br /> Sent is very good; Greg Kinnear is the best, such as Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear and Ricky Jay's part is a 'star-star' star and imbues his character and the correct balance of the comic book quality and the originality of the maker will work. <br /> <br /> I will agree to move at a slow pace in places, and the images seem very flash, perhaps with the effects of more features, but at the end of the day, this is the top decision of the film - it's about a short time "Is it? Up Tiger Lily? - and there is so much in this film to make it worth looking at.
