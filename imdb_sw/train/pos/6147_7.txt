Well, this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it is one of the most beautiful, beautiful movies you see as a child. It is an unpopular film about two adults and two children of spunky on a fun adventure. It may be a little refusal to look, but try, I neither mother did think that it was bad, I was very worried by the film and animation, both were very good. It is an awesome comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even children. 7 years and more will enjoy this amazing comedy, music with you and your family especially animation. Animation structures and settings are very good and deserve to thumbs up. What is the best music for the whole family then what are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent IDs with Broomsticks now.
