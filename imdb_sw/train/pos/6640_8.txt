This one-minute film is certainly the first movie made. Other observers had done earlier works - such as Edison's photography-stretching image - but Lumiere's brothers made the most advanced materials in the middle. At that time, of course, their 'cinematograph' must be concerned their colleagues, including their studies. In this first case, the brothers record the workers from their factory, some of whom are struggling to hide their knowledge of the camera. Lumieres's attempt to make this film more entertaining by introducing animals and bicycles, but 'La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' is not suitable for their future movie skills. The most interesting feature of this short film is the selection of the members of the ordinary work of the work as their subject. Their choice is the first evidence of their curiosity about all the people of the world, the quality that makes their experiments more fun and more surprising for today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
