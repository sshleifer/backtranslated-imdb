To be honest, I had to go to this film back, didn't expect to be a lot, but hey, I had no deception, I had a good time. I would say this film is a strong wind, despite some of the fact that they tried to strengthen Nancy Drew, but this made me remember these 60-70s youth videos from Europe and Quebec, where they can have children when they communicate and adults. In this case, a 16-year-old boy tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actor who died 25 years ago. However, if his father had a business in Hollywood, why not lose a house and a secret behind doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Kinda as a chubby child, who for the first time was naively brought to help her sister's sister Nancy, but finally, discovered Nancy completely enough to catch her, even for her issues ... <br /> <br /> Others cast it The best, and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook for a different role at this time: one mother (did it in the Family Rescue, but this time, plays a mature woman ...) However, don 't give us this, it's fun!
