The film is absolutely fantastic! If you look at your friends can be a very good day ... You obviously know that the film is stupid and very badly directed to act (Tomba / Unziker what a couple), and that maybe it's the worst movie world, but you can enjoy it very much. We looked at it in 19 and it was a very good evening. The best events are first, when criminals kill Alex's friend, and tries to act like a desire, and the result is the comic area of ​​the first category ... And then when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what name) "Palassio di giusstissia", and then The crash of Leva, which immediately goes to his car out of the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What magic!
