One of the most cruel and brutal films I have ever seen, but it is also one of the most painful and exciting. This is a melodrama of action if the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the conspiracy got me close to tears, during the next minute giving a shocking revelation as a bone-crunching blow for guts. Chilling and Edison Chen. The story of HK-Cop and hunting of Cambodian killers each, while little to lose their humanity, is a force. Featuring very few conversations for haunting pictures and function of the camera, "Dog Dog Dog" is a clean HK-Bloodshed without Service.
