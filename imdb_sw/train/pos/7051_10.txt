Let me begin by saying that "War, Inc" is not a cup of everyone's tea. It is, however, very enjoyable (and makes you think - "Oh, crap"). Comedy to share the film is not quite obvious - it is quite a trick (Tamerlane tanks, dry-cleaning services etc.), and changes with twists & turns in a plot. <br /> <br /> I could be just one, but I can't compare this with "Grosse Point Blank", because, it's different. John Cusack - I can't say he was "strange" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, her sister (Joan Cusack) was extraordinary in the delivery of lines & time of comedic - though she was difficult in the film (I'd say the same about Ben Kingsley). Marisa Tomei has a convincing author, and can remove it. Hilary Duff is highly recommended for his role as the star of Asia Asia Asiaan Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actor is very visible in the film, and he does a very good job (although his emphasis is tad unreal). Overall, the film is what I will call "entertainment". It has no history, and it is a time of ignorance sometimes, but it doesn't have a cunning message. I'd like to say it's an hour value.
