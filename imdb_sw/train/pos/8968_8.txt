This film was like a movie of Jimmy Stewart, of the beauty, the most beautiful and most enjoyable. Gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character, she left us hanging on every word. s seem to stop using magic even when legitimate. Sexual experiences between Stewart and Novak are well done by the chemistry among them is good, but again when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading woman is evil!
