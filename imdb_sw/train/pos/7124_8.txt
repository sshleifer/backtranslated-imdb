It's a small film of heart and not just for kids. John Thaw is as brilliant as always (without any feeling of Morse Inspector on it). The boy who played William did a good job and although I did not see him with influence in every area. I liked to feel quite a small village with a small pace of life in those times. I also heard the events in London where the historical accuracy, as I was able to tell. It reminds me of the Scandinavian film that I have seen a few years ago called Mother of Mine. The film showed the boy being taken from Finland to Sweden during WW II. The wife of the family took her to the girl because (as shown) she lost her daughter. Finding a boy instead he totally rejects him. The fact that the boy is talking about Finnish problems even more. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, has the same feeling.
