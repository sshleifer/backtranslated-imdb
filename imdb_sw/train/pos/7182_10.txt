I thought that for the first part of the first series you did very well. It was very fun and I thought the participants were brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone to say that it's bad because it looks good time. I find it irritating when people say that it was not historically accurate because it should be a Saturday night's leisure show is not a history of boring history so I think clothing and settings were the same. Start a brilliant and I will love what will follow! I've told many people at school and they love to show! we all think it is good entertainment and has good stories to go with.
