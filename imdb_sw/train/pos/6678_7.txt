I didn't expect him very much from this film, but it wasn't bad; in fact it was quite good. This movie had a bit of funniest text that I have ever seen from the motion picture. Now I don't say this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed at a certain place. "The police sentenced the death of my father to death, they said they fell under the ditch." Now this film is not for everyone, because more ignorant like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hate these movies I would like to recommend you open. It was generally a fun movie, about a superhero wannabes, who live to be real heroes at the end. It is a very great comedy which many people may not have seen yet, because if I before checking it expect to be garbage. After watching this film, I finally understand why this film was able to collect stars like Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even the baby from Good Burger. It is because Hidden Man is full of a comedic writing period of 10 best.
