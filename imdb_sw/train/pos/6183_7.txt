The cash flow rate out of all stages of '34 stage 'stages, a large budget, large-scale depreciation, attractive production and Mitch Leisen is named as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for the outdoor rock to look at and the script of the genocide that deserved to be in that trash such as Charlie Chan's worst off the road. I believe that cutting was out of Leisen's hands since a large number of Duke Ellington has been severely damaged, but that does not mean that it is inappropriate to look at: The 'Sweet Marihuana' number with chorus girls is a brilliant blow, based on principles produced and has Toby Wing (which unfortunately fed horrible lines and dancing blumb pattern) as a hot chorion for another Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's work is bland as Melba's repentance but he is a powerful singer. MacLaglen reaches a new dish as dumb detective. And try to see Lucy in chorus. These standards 7.0 as curiosity. February 2010 re-think: Recently I have given the film again to look and now I feel causing a rejection of the lack of a number of production of Busby Berkeley. I can understand Leisen's argument for more productive terms in the plot. I still have great issues and editing yet. To a large extent, the largest city center in the city, faced major issues with the most possible Production Code in its history, speaking financially, and smuggling all items on this (also see the 1934 Beauty Search). You must see for the lungs before the code.
