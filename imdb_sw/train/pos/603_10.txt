Albeniz's music around this film. Once and time is played by the original instrumentation (e.g. piano, but it is not full of orchestra), but it often happens again with different modern buttons (e.g.guitar) and treatment (e.g. jazz piano). Often the music is the only aim of the film: most of the music is placed in different rhythms, often the flamenco, but not always. I would think that there are 12 cases? 14, which is not connected to the plot. Not all events will reach the height of the individual viewer. In my case nearly half reached the peak, though all others were in their own very good way. Those who worked for me moved my heart to the flesh; in fact, the last place left me happy and happy. And some magical way brings you into the Spanish culture. If you do not like the subtitles, don't worry. The film is almost without a word, although every area holds the head of the Albeniz piece. Seeing this very fine film focuses on my complaint that almost no Saura movies are available on DVD in the United States. I think here especially on his flamenco version of "Carmen," a wonderful work of art that is available in Europe but not here (European DVD can't play on DVD players of the United States). This is a scandal.
