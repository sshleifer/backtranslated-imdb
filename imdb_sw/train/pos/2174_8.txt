I think I love this film. "Prix de Beaute" was the beginning of a silent film but later called French in 1930. Despite having someone else's voice emerged on it, this is still a wonderful journey to Louis Brooks. The fact that his voice of singing is called Edith Piaf's story helps us to reduce the purity of dubbing fraud. This is the story of Lulu and we first saw her at the break with her lover's eyes, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the shape as two feet: we see him in the car changing his clothes. Lulu is very free to show his body and this does not live well with Andre. Lulu seeing the name of 'Miss Europe' we know that the end of happiness will not be the end of Easy Street. The movie seems to take a lot of attention on men who use beautiful women. We see the great beauty of bathing and the effect of men looking at them. But in the middle of it all is magnificent Louise Brooks. If you don't watch watching movies from eras, then consider exploring this. Louise Brooks is not a name that most of the typical film pipeline can easily get to you but once you see it you will be counted and you need to know more. Also look at the 'Pandora Box' if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the release of Kino DVD DVD. I don't know if their approximate speed is correct. Most displays appear to be displayed very quickly. This may be the way they were beaten. I don't know. But since it is the only way to see this film, it is important to swallow a single pill of pain.
