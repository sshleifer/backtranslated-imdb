Lost is the best series of TV there. For the first time, it has GREAT executives and an amazing leadership. Why are polar crops on this island what is mold? How is the island lost by Richard Alpert? Many people think that the authors are lost and that they have given many questions and secrets that they cannot explain. I believe these people are right. I have faith in the authors. I think that if secrets have been disclosed from now all the charms of the series have gone.
