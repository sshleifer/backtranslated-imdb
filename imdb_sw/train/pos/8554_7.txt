Wow, this was the most beautiful of the natural pie of America, not as good as the band camp, but definitely better than the miles of honey. Dwight and Erik stifler leads comedy in this, but in fact I preferred the conversation in this one for miles of honey. The script is very well written and the comedy went smoothly, however, the most comedy came out of sex, but that's the same because that's why we watch these movies yet? The midget rock was also very good come out, based on the strong effort given by him in the naked mile, its area was tough and was laughing at my ass when I saw it. <br> The movie was a steady improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile, if you liked any original Pie film, you should be like a beta house, unless you see every American pie refuses to damage money.
