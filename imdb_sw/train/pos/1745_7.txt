What? The truth is friendly, charming and prudent is an ancient past indifference; I was glad to see Lugosi the old man. It is disarmingly friendly and alive. It is a long-term business document. (The best television series today cannot compete with these good old trials.) CHANDU is deep, deep hope and hedonistic. Restores the mind. It's not stupid; The ignorant are those who have not received the terms that the papers are working. CHARACTER has a feeling of ineffective, easy and friendly. <br /> <br /> Don't give away too much ?? Chandu is an Occidental sorcerer who also goes to this Eastern name and who also loves to protect his nephew against the religion of murderers. Chandu makes his unusual gifts in a wise and common way. <br /> <br /> About the best baby, Nadji, has been kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: Vindhyan of evil. Little girl girl is actually growing trophies ?? in sarcophagus after being asleep asleep with flowers; almost caught kidnapping from the boat; and the fraud police; The temple of Lemuria and its wonderful, exciting celebrations resemble the pictures of King KONG? and it is a serious shock of the ceremony and RCC tradition. Can you protect the girl with courage as Chandu does? Lugosi looks like an old and impatient old man, drunk, and this only contributed to his exhibition. He is a good messenger to drink, stupid and subtle and oblique. That would seem like a very degrading honor to Lugosi? The biopic of Wood's Wood has left me this feeling about Lugosi and support it with a strong compassion for an actress. I enjoy Lugosi's theater. This serial is locked for abuse.
