Kim Novak is a wizard on the attractiveness of a human partner, and his choice James Stewart. Attractive to the character, from the Broadway point; was shot by James Wong Howe at the Witch of the Witch, and was held with a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as a permanent writer who lost Redlitch. I like this film, though a few others seem. Kim alone makes it a winner in My Book. Ha! My Film # 5 of 1958.
