I was 11 years old and saw I lived 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. The uncle's house is on Westway Dr, a desert garden, TX. they have increased the house since the movie was made. I don't know the number of the house but you can go look. I am now 21 and I enjoy watching this film. The bar on Spencer is not their anymore. Pasadena ISD wants to build their school. I drove him to the house last week the house still seems to be good. My father and uncle would go to the street where the house is looking and the actors come in and out of the house trying to make a film. where John cross on rail cracks have done 225 above. when I find out about John to love his son when I start thinking about when he made a town cowboy had 26 or 25 at that time.
