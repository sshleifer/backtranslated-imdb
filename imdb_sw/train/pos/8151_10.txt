I saw it in the posh movie theater where the audience is white, educated, and urban. To show what I attended was an American-American spraying, and it made a difference between the audience-response between the two categories of social clarity about the state of the competition in the country. In fact, the white people were AFRAID laughing or laughing with anxiety in funny bits - and there are many! - because they would be "beating for Blacks", while Europeans were sitting quietly because many could not laugh themselves before the whites. I, on the other hand, in Asia (and therefore not of the group), had a good time to look at this sape culture culture and its example / events / values ​​/ philosophy. Sent are talented and performs a good job to be shown. These songs are very funny. This movie is one of the best pseudo records to come together, including "Big Wind"
