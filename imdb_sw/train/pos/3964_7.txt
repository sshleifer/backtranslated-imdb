I found FBI's story with fun and enjoyable for my New Day's holiday. His drawings and events full of action were exciting. The attitude of courage was beautiful and beautiful. In general photography, script and patterns were of credit. Instead of making the film a piece of propaganda, such as certain abilities, I enjoyed being a good example of the importance of the mind's mind and the brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the sign of the family involved even under the difficulty of giving to the husband for his work (of course) is important, I did not find that twelve representation but it is better and one model.
