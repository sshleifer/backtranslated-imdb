Gube Kibbee gives a lot of viewer to laugh. As many candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, very, under a tested player, is good to give orders to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean a public vote. An unsuspecting campaign, "I will take under counseling," and "Maybe yes, but again, maybe no," is the best way to win the election. Effectively, the dumber candidate, has a great chance to win. After all, the public can identify with such a person. With respect to the film, it makes for a lot of comedy.
