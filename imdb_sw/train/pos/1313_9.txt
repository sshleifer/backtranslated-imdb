More TV movies should be made like this. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both violent, very gentle and realistic performances. Weber was very good, turning into unique and non-emerging performance as a molester / killer child. This film has increased my respect for hunting as an actor. The director also described "Hoosiers," which somehow was of formula and exciting. But the direction in both these works has the same, simple realism that is pleasant. If you like television and non-saturated television movies, see if you can. The side story of Hunt and Fahey's story also appeals without distorting the main story.
