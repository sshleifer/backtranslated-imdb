I saw this film first when it was released in U.S. in 1984. I have seen it many times, many times since. What makes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of practice in the lives of the characters and visa versa. In these two movies and sometimes not sure if someone looks at the lives of the characters or the scene from the gym. This continues until the peak of the film. Years later later, my friends and I still like to discuss if "Carmen" or "true" has been destroyed. From the effect of other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to the debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art, and the beauty of all performances combine to create a very good film, which once again, combines and eliminates the line between life and art.
