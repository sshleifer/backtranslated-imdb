The first-time director (Bromell) has collected a small but powerful cast look at the world of middle age, middle class, man strike hit and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film less than 90 minutes offers a spectacular difference in human nature. David Dorfman as 6-year-old William H. Macy is the youngest actor I have seen for a short time. Macy is a brilliant in the area that appears almost written to him as the only one who strives to strive to break his father's blows and business. It's always good to see Donald Sutherland and here it is wonderful as a bad father of Macy. Radio stations are very good to hear the director explains how he chose, the place, and made the film. The primary sound of dolby 2 channel is enough for this film and is well preserved. The movie creates a feeling with the music of the most subtle music. Any movie buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this especially if you are a fan of protest.
