Although Cher and Cage are important elements of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good friends to them - this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still loving. The whole mission is a good job from Aiello until John Mahoney - shows a real piece of life. Although I have seen this long-lasting excitement finally capture Cage where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to the screen on the opera for the kitchen table - this is a very entertaining movie.
