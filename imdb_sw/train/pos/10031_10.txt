Previously, I wrote that I love "Titanic", I cried at the time (many times over), and I am a 60-year-old boy. I also wondered about what this great film, won many awards and scratched by many critics, was released only 7.0 rating and imdb.com users <br /> <br /> Well, I watched the breakdown of user standards. While 29.0% of all votes paid 10 points, 10.7% gave 1 mark. My previous comments, I was required to model this common voting (a sudden increase in ratings 1, with a maximum of 10, just stop step by step and then suddenly turn the course and jump into level 1 rating) for just one thing: hate for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've got enough chat rooms to see the booth and young (young, especially), who despise the left and right. They hate anyone, and they will have no part to give him any credit in the "Titanic". (To answer another user: SIKI talk about someone who does not like the movie very much, and gave 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has, and has the right to, their own taste. But no one can insist that the imdb rate of 7.0 total for "Titanic", released at the same rate for the odd number of ignorance 1, shows the total picture of the motion of the motion.) <br /> <br /> Let me show my point by comparing the user's voting pattern. Titanic "office box 5 selected randomly with" critical "bombs (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "The Gate of Heaven" (1980) had been removed from the exhibition soon after the very poor box office shows, and the imdb voters' rate was: 23.2% of 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (total 6.1 total). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received an average of 4.3% and 9.9% 1 ratings (total of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) earned 6.1% and 2.6% 1% (total 5.8 total). "Blind Date" (1987) received an average of 3.0 percent and 2.8% 1% (total of 5.3 total). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received ratings of 4.4% and 3.7% 1 ratings (total sum of 5.2). Are all FILMS FILMS TO BE WITH "TITANIC"? ALL OF PERCENTAGES OF HIS 1 EDUCATION! TAN "TITANIC", AND HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE SINGLE EXAMPLE. Again, "Titanic" received 10.7% 1%! Compare it with 5 other movies I mentioned. <br /> <br /> What! Can there be any information except the hatred of Leo's cause? <br /> <br />
