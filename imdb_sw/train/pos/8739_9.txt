This is a FUNNY film. It has all the features of Disney's most common (music, multi-characters, stories, referrals), associated with the best animation and the best sound of the few actors known as "Antz" and "Egyptian Price". /> <br /> The characters work well, and they have a strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a huge scale that overcomes the barriers of the generation. The film has also been presented in the most popular movies, which increases the experience of movies. <br /> <br /> Make me a phone call, but I've seen the film three times, and intend to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many worries have seen this film on my recommendations and have not been discouraged. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one has ever walked out of this film without feeling satisfied. Look at it, and don't get it because it's animated. You are sure to enjoy this film, and make sure you stay in the last features! Clear and out-takes at the end is the funniest part of the film, full of laughter.
