This is a film about the 17th-century Italian artists and one particular artist, Artemisia, is not heard by the profession of women at the time, and tried to draw a male nude that shows her special muscles. <br /> <br /> The camera function is inside the house because it is where the artists worked. There are some great shots. Keeping close to the lighting lights reflects the good work of classical monitors and it is interesting to watch photographers and students they helped with a detailed recycling solution for the details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (clothing, faces, decisions) are so true because the Italian churches have kept all these details in frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by his father to learn under the great artist of Florentine, Tassi, who has become an expert in the art of the view and environment (something very new) but an unprecedented Artemisia has been created with more new techniques in painting. After asking him, Tassi accuses him. His father is angry. Court to follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic game has a very simple story and an endless ending. The best feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Events such as women riding the field and the wind that produces their strong clothes adds extraordinary effects. Artemisia says she builds herself; his father shows some fun. As for this film, please more, I think.
