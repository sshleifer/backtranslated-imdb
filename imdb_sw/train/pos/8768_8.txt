I saw this film in the shop at a cheap price. I am actually remembered to see ads and trailer for years ago. I thought "What hey" and bought, primarily because the conspiracy proved interesting by Claire Danes has always been a talented person in my eyes (this was also before I became a big fan Kate Beckinsale). So it's about two girls who are going on vacation in Bangkok, they get a gun (which is not guilty) and is then taken to Thailand prison. The film follows what happens to them and sometimes is responsible for their innocence. Both the Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale offer good performances, and the plot of this film joins in an unforgettable way, and brings good questions of ethical discussion. I think this is a pretty good film, but there may be some improvements. It may be a long time ... it would have helped to strengthen these characters and more insight into the politics of the Thai justice system would help. However, more than that, it is a good film with good performances. All the pop-culture Junkies have a two-minute response by Paul Walker. I didn't even remember the first time I saw the film.
