The movie just enter the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after the official release, and after many illegal DVDs have found its way to the public. It seems that the popularity of a valid DVD creates the release of movies, and people still come to watch. <br /> <br /> Movie is a great epic, bringing the Japanese culture into your home through the way. In another humorist way, the story is news about the author of the exhibition who writes a story for his venue, to be regular games Kabuki play is something he finds boring. At first, the audience may be a little confused about the story we follow, but when the story is opened, we see that love between a male and a male leads to a good story for a new piece of Kabuki games. The audience is left in the dark if this is a story that has to have happened in Japanese traditions and stories, but it does not matter. The story of the story is sold by the love of the theater, expression, plain color, humor and tragedy, makes this journey on the Japanese movie with the theater. Allow to go completely when you watch this film, try to see it in movies instead of on your TV at home. One thing important though: the sound of the voice sometimes becomes a little angry. Although most of them are good music, there is a short time in the movie that I think they should choose the most wonderful player. But perhaps the fact that the story has a time of humor that made the director choose a short time in music too.
