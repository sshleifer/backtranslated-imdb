they are movies like these that make you want to have never decided on the nerd to grow in school. If you liked this film, then I would like to watch Valentine. I just saw that today a boy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide after a film that was embarrassed since he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the place he played on the film. It comes when Carol tries to get her into the girls' room to do as they are about to do. While changing in the rain, famous famous friends entered the bathroom and were ready for everything, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opened the seat of naked clothes, she realized that she was confused. She is trying to cover the shower but the children open, take Marty and start to mean it when the camera continues. They took him, and raised his head in the toliet when they were crossed, and they took him (less). When children are locked up, they are given by the coach, 2 boys give them a coalition that will make him lose. Skip the rest of the glass windows in the gym using bricks to give the teacher a charging. Although Marty is puking in the bathroom Skip sneaks in Science Lab and combines other things that look like cocaine but not sure what it is. The laboratories hit and hurt her. Five years later the children who had tortured him that day had received an invitation to a 5-year-old school school that was burning that day. Directly people are killed. I don't understand how a girl who tried to sink. he could get back after Marty left. He approached the first time.
