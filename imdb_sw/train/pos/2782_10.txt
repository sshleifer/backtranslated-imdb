"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that had very little exposure here in the United States. It is possible from the fact that the cinema was very British in discussion with modern words and dealt with a lot of football, (soccer here), which others might have in the same trouble also in America. and it deserves more coverage here. I think the basis of the story, (follows the dream), is something that most people can relate to and finally, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves that a highly sensible film is a source of inspiration and a very good acting. I wasn't more excited about seeing this film at the beginning but now I feel I don't see it soon. I highly recommend this film!
