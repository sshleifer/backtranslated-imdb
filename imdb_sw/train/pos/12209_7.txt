I was attracted to this small, self-portrait. Stories, about social girls who meet, be friends, and provide support to all the support system seemed to have no children, sometimes attracted, sometimes sad, but always convincing them. Music, especially with an underground band, was used for great impact, as was the experiment with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast techniques. Exhibitions (documented by the authors and filmmakers) are some of the best I've seen in the last few years. If you ever feel like a square bag when you are forced to get into a round round, I really believe you will enjoy "With Hook or Crook".
