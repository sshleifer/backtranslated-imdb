I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was very good ... The story of bad love! In fact I accepted the fact that the man with the story of the story had lost his feet in an accident. It is rare to see a story of love involving a person with physical disabilities. The love that developed between this character and the woman who comes into her life is shown how I would like to think love can heal a person's heart. Laura Leighton ... all of 27 when he made this film ... it was good if a full-grown woman could revive the heart of this young man. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and not, "problems" continue. <br /> <br /> Playing on HBO more times this month.
