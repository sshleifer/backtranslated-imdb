This is the second video I saw of Ida Lupino as a post-53 director. I think this was the best film then that. This girl has a girl who has almost married and she is then sexually assaulted and does not like everyone looking and talking about it so she runs away and is taken by the family. I think the views of Leonard Maltin are just the same as giving 2 and 1/2 stars.
