The events of September 11 2001 do not require additional human interest in the form of following the training of the rookie trader or the development of two French brothers. In my view it would be better to leave this out. I think the directors tried so much, perhaps they felt that the events of that day should be a story. Comments of one of the police - "this is the *** of Disneyworld" fit. <br /> <br /> Yet it is compelling to watch for the display of events. Traders were in all the right places at the right time, no other footage from daylight to the same as what they beat.
