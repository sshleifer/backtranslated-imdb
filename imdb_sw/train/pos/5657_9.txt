I remember the Gothic look of the United States when it first happened, it came into my mind recently, all I could remember is the man who appeared in the Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I don't watch many television, but I looked at the American Gothic, I bought the full Series on DVD this week , and it's still as good as it ever was, This is one of the best TV series ever, because I don't see so many TVs because it's just the garbage on top, except for Derren Brown, it's all TV or Soup, like Grease, Big Brother etc., I am bound with that, I've got a full series of American Gothic for Â£ 16.97 a website of Asda, that's the cheapest I can get.
