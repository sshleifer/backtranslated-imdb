I will not deal very much on this movie program as other critics are covered on the same ground. I wanted to say that I was very happy with this film. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film. <br /> <br /> The small movie 'trips' journey with Falk & Paul Reiser in north NY in the fall is set for many action in the film ............ true and some well-played game gives the film that feeling that it can be your own family. Really does not say enough about this film but it is a wonderful disgrace that a good movie like this is not more available when another junk junk out there makes it. <br /> <br /> It is good to see Falk and the great responsibility of leading someone again and doing more. It proves that his best friend & author / director John Casavettes was correct in giving Falk in many films of breaking 60s and 70s.
