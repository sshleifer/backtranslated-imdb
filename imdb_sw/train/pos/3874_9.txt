And I totally love Isabelle Blais !!! He was very good in this film, and very different from his role in "Quebec-Montreal" where he was more like a person eating it. I think he should be appointed to Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was the greatest, IMO. Pelletier has worked well for his first time out, and I saw his two friends from Rock and Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage & Andre Ducharme. It was a pleasure to see them in this, I did not know they would appear. I don't think I have seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this is as good as I was happy to see. And if you're in states and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca sent me to me under a week.
