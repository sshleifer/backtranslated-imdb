ScareCrow was on the funniest killers who I have ever seen in action! Plus she's really bouncy the moment when she jumped around, which was amazing! He also had a good voice I meant that it was perfect for him. The story lines were also good. I love how spirit children were transferred to the ScareCrow which was cool! Plus he had reason for all the murder I meant after what those people did to him ..... I would be angry too! ScareCrows watch was very good! his look gives that person "OMG!" the reaction they see! Which was wonderful stares he had been funny! Those people were ignorant, who could look for a long time! They should shout and run for their lives ... even though that didn't make a difference!
