"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Lost Housewifes" ... The list continues and continues. This, and a high-quality group, shows that we are in the middle of the golden age in television history. "Lost" is a clean professional. Good personal, psychological and psychological fragments, stories, mentioned by small movies (wonderful to use this word, during a show-TV show), a mark of killings, good performances and editing. Anyone who has not been used on this, is not one of the most important of the most creative ideas on television ever. It may have its problems, while watching only one part per week, but the format of the DVD is really a wonderful way to look at this. Hope they put it (if I'm sure they do).
