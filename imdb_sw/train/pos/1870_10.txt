This movie is Great! It touched my heart of cold stones. I could not describe the racist discrimination that Anton found because I live in my country. I think it's very difficult to be excluded. We looked at this film in our university university at Era University, and I did not know that it was a true story, I thought it was designed only by a professional who wants to bring fresh air to the industry. It's very good. The scene that was shocked was when Nadine used Antons (who was only six years old) sex. If I was on his shoes, I could fly the top ten stories. I plead with him that he is so powerful! The situation that touched me here is when Anton saw her mother Eva face to face. He did not hate him or anything, instead he told him about the successes he had experienced over the years that they had been separating. (I think I will do it when I have the opportunity to track my roots.)
