I agree to make great expectations before looking for some reason some friends mentioned (and do not pervs!). And you must see! Don't expect to see something running. Freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there is too much damage and is not worth end. Some of the best things are the analysis of Blue Kieslowski, many of David Lynch, some Hitchcock and maybe a few more I missed (just remember ... Dogville), and often miss the items unless they are very obvious or free in the air. In addition to repeating, which makes too long, the document is interesting for the recognition of some misconceptions caused by our knowledge, so the commercial efficiency of many attractions learned and applied as a basis for this theory . I was very pleased with the strong voice of the notes and efforts of Mr. Zikhali to revive the Freud theory, which has been locked for so long, especially in North America. Again, it is a high way and I do not believe that it is a waste of time because I believe many people have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
