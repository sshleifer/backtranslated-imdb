There's really not much to say about this film .... it's bad, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Make an external description (from IMDB) / / <br />. playing basketball, using baseball rules. While the game becomes a great success, they, along with billiniire support, form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. The Coop & Remer Team, Beers of Milwaukee are the only team that has stood through a major change of governance which the owner of Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to establish. It is good, because there are so many stars in this film. Although it's not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone performs a good job in their first real movie. There is a very good time of feeling in this film I can't come around and call them all. It has never stopped, and it doesn't try to play a good game to make it so bad. <br /> <br /> With my favorite feature of this film: Soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take me" and "Beer" with a big fish reel. Standing up. <br /> <br /> Overall, the most unusual, but very interesting movie. 10/10 James "Black Wolf" Johnston
