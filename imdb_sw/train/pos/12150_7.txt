This movie is one of many films of "Kung Fu" which is held in Asia at the end of the 70s - early 80s, with sound effects cheap, talk of dubbed and quick electronic martial arts action. But unlike most films of this type also has a good plot and lots of comedy. When the textile workers are forced out of their work with Manchu's people, they hire a group artist (Gordon Liu) to try to frighten them. When his attempt fails, he enters the Shaolin temple to learn to fight the truth. But instead of making a Kung-Fu pupil, the Lord instead tells him to build a roof covering all 36 rooms. Fu! It is kind of Karate Kid when Mr. Mggi teaches Daniel the basics of martial arts by making him a regular household household - "Wax up, wax off" and cetera. There is a very great comedy from the beginning to the end, and many steps at the end when Gordon Liu is sometimes faced with Manchu's torturers. "At this time not only tricks - it's a real thing!" Liu says, proudly hitting his chest. If you like the popular Kung Fu movies do not like to miss this!
