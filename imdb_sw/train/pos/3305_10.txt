Of course, this film should be one of ........ in the history of the movie. I have watched many times to remember, and every time it's like I see the film for the first time. Where does one start? Meena Kumari's performance is undoubtedly one of the best works, followed by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and dirt of its performance, makes any other sound of the hero became important. His great explanation of Kathak and his grace, the danger of horror and the issuance of Urdhu's poems, is like anything seen on the bollywood screen. Pakeezah is probably a stylized translation of humanity; photography, amazing pictures and implementing, are often charged for example and meaning, that the viewer is left without breathing. Naushads' music, can not be reduced, its historical musical art is amazing. , and the way in which he clarifies the clarity of dark weather and romantic songs is really fantastic. My only advice to anyone who enjoys a great movie concert, should watch this epic entry on life and art.
