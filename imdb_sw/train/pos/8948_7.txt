This is a kind of film that, if it would take place today, maybe star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; in fact, now that I think about it, this must be completely adjusted one day. It's beautiful, but without detail. Faced with the nearby miscasting of James Stewart in the role he is 20 years old, and therefore there is no chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small space of a favorite writer, is the only actor in the film that the performance is approaching what can be called "wit". (** 1/2)
