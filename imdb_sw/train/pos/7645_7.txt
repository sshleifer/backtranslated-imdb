Belushi in its exhibition and Courtney Cox before Friends have a small role. I often think Belushi uses less than Hollywood and this film's role is one of the best. For those who watch his TV, this is a very different and interesting character. The movie itself is not the spread of the earth, nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and beautiful. A well-known surveillance and anonymous name is a perfect balance although Lovitz's applause can be surprising, and spiritual spiritual guidance of Michael Caine has little effect if it is not for meaningful purposes. Hamilton, as the wife of Belushi for two-dimensional unfortunate and man wondering why he married. In addition, Renee Russo disappears and is not very persuasive in the "queen kings" leaving. However, the best way to spend two hours.
