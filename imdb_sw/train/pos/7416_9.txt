This film is moving without having a sense - meaning without having to worry. It describes a simple story of the family in the danger of falling apart as the intervention of technology and the community that continues to do the business of a family that becomes increasingly impossible. Acting is amazing - although none of us in the west may have felt about these actors, we should have a long time ago - they play their characters with honesty and respect - these are bad characters, everyone with A great weakness, but for such humanity and kindness that it is impossible to share the story. We need more films like this - we need more western films to create a film like this.
