I, too, loved this series when I was a child. In 1952 I had 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was one that was played by Marion Lorne as a very interesting, loved and loved person with a "aunt". still I can remember "boba bubba um um" comments kind if he tried and said something important. And then when he returned and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched it was a great casting! It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau whose work I followed as a fan for many years. I have a question if anyone can prove: was the name or end confirming music "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it standing at my classical radio station in Southern California it brings to mind the pictures of Mr. Peepers going away from behind it on the camera. I don't even know if this picture in my eye is right.
