This movie is great to strengthen the spirit. Every time I look at it, I see & hear small things that I have lost before. <br /> <br /> Sound voice is not recommended. Mick Jones (Exotic) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote songs, and made wonderful Fruit is the best thing that has hit the music of today. Unfortunately, the wonderful fruit is a string of '60 to 70 'bands that are not good starting, due to the use of drugs and internal conflicts. Someone is wondering what might be, when listening to their fanatstic sound. The Fruit gets inspiration from Stones Rolling, Deep Purple, David Bowie, and Who. Every Fruit Messenger is never remembered. Star Stephen Rea like a decreased and deadly Costello Tony, who is asked by the concert advocate to reunite with his band on a reconciliation journey, and hope to earn money. Costello haply travels to former Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him turn back to the fire of old dreams. Juliet collects on Jimmy nail pain (Les Wickes), disgusting Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot), and very glamourous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Including another former roadie, Hughie's hippy-jokester (Billy Connolly), who never stops fire alive. Like Juliet looking for the last members of their port, worried the author of the guitarist Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), members reunited, as in the past, are fighting on a repentant talent. <br /> <br /> The band is given an opportunity to make a small trip to the Netherlands, preparing for the festival. And Hendrix's young people like Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) take Lovell's position, workers are hitting the road. Sparks fly as their fire records continue, and threaten to burn their unintended targets ... <br /> <br /> Ready to laugh, sing, rejoice, and cry, if those characters do not remember they get into your hearts.
