Guys and Dolls are provoking the film for remake. It took forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead or Â£ 389. Although the remake, and the great star now, would have achieved the box-office, it cannot catch the magic entered into this version. His unlimited energy is no longer available, nor can you be happy if you look at something like this: large, large, great movie entertainment. Marlon Brando (who finally scored at 409 lbs. The last time I heard it) has King Masterson, one of the biggest gambling games in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, who as-often-as-can-find-speakeasy-to-it crap game is popular in the world. However, when one went to hold it a $ 1,000 payment, Detroit requires a quick cash. He says Masterson $ 1,000 that he cannot take Sarah Brown's successor (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls are basically the most inappropriate kind of singing and dancing, which usually, as it does here, add up to fun. It is clear how this was the music of Broadway: did not have many sets, and events were long. If I had to complain about one thing, how the songs were not right. Sometimes, there were two songs in the area; once, thirty minutes went without one. Guys and Dolls are not interesting, just a good time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 / / <br /> Not counted.
