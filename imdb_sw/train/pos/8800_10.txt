First of all, I don't understand why some people get this anti-American film. Indeed, there are times when U.S. are directly accused, as in Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and some extent, Mira Nair. But coming, it's not a false charge; Instead, it depends on the facts and records, and all the documents that CIA issued about Chile confirms this, for example. But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most is the different kinds of emotions we get. We get children to be educated for the respect of all people who died in the event; we see unhappy couples who will be replaced by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their senses decreased in the shadows of September 11 and are different from this, with respect or confusion; we even get someone in the movie for who fall for towers because for real time. All this vision and others - like this power or even more - make a concrete mix and help the player have a picture of how different people spread around the world did the September 11 events. The panorama which is more difficult than white and black, and this can make some people offensive; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no room for manicheistic culture, no matter what the president or priests can tell us. Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even a date for the release of this film in the United States. It is a shame because many Americans ask why this tragedy has happened, and this movie can give them some symptoms. This film makes it very clear - unlike what other people on this platform think - that everything we do today will say our future, and that past mistakes will affect how we live today.
