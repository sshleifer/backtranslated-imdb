Mardi Gras: Made in china is a good movie that shows how two cultures are identical, but do not recognize the influence of each society. David Redmon opens your eyes and enables you to see how workers in China make beads that are cheaper and sold in the US for $ 20. When you reduce the questions of Americans about where the beads come out there was no clue and it seemed to be dumb. When he told them that they had been made in China with nothing and no charge for the shocking and unacceptable working conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little sad but they were not found to stop purchasing beads after finding the truth. When Redmon asked workers in China they did not know that Americans were wearing them on their neck and paid much for these beads. Workers laughed what was behind the beads and did not believe. This movie is a good film that gives us something to think about in other countries instead of our own. Pitts
