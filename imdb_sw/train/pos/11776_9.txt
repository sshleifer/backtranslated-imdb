The 'Hare' College of Chuck Jones is the fastest, most often of cartoons. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a storey store manager of a wonderful, yellow color who wants to bind, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its purpose. The expulsion takes bugs and its supporters through various departments, leading to a inspired gag that emerges quickly from various departments as wearing any clothing related to the shop. This great gag has been hit, however, with a true sequence involving the scope that bugs, hiding as an elevator, builds a shop manager to keep getting or leaving the star at the wrong time. It is a good piece of slice that unfortunately gives way to the ultimate gag end. At the same time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great filing films, and bursting with wild energy. If the germs were more effective in other cartoons from this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that it can still be as much as anarchic character.
