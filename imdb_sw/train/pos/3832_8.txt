One night on a damaged road, in the saloon empty Martin Sheen takes a stick to Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends to follow a herd of cattle killers, who have killed a few people and robbed a Cassidy girl. <br /> <Author / director Christopher Coppola May has been angry with William Boyd who is trying to make a contemporary low-budget film that includes their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did! No character should be closed to an actor that no one will be allowed to play with him again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good pleasure to update the exciting characters of the classic thirties and forty years. Despite the guilt of doing evil, this is enough and irresponsible, and making it difficult for me to love him. All production is amazing however, but I was very pleased with the events between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we look at stories in the story makes a distinction and spread more interesting.
