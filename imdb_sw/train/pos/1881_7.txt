As a drug player named Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult who has been beaten in childhood. As it changed, the role took Moore in full, it was closed as an actor. Many recent tracks (including this video guide), but that does not reduce the charm or appeal of this image, carefully written and directed. Some of the drunken cases of Moore are obliged, the parts of the film have emerged, but the beat makes it very fun is a hard movie to resist. It has a great heart and gives the winner of Oscar John Gielgud a gentle, exciting role like Arthur's valet, Hobson; His relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have reports of miracles. Liza Minnelli (if the love of blue color) is sassy in the bottom key and Moore is bright, but it has life; he never drew a shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this work document on the certainty of respect. *** from ****
