In fact, I must admit that I have never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two "The Show Tyler Moore Show." Although I don't know anything about this comedic talent duo, I still liked this movie a lot. Mary is returning to work. Rose tries her luck to become a player. Rhoda is faced with photography work. And Meredith ... what exactly does he do again? These three stories that we follow more than two hours are both exciting and entertaining in their own way. When two long friends connect them, it makes only the best film. I was wondering how the text was appropriate. Little jokes beaten by Mary and Rhoda were funny. The script itself was installed properly. I saw Moore and Harper in other movies over the past few years and I think they were very good. But I did not know that they worked well as a team. While all vendors do their part to fulfill the title of this film, they don't seem to allow me. (During the flight of this film.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan do the same work but nothing is good. Some of the cast like Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone also works together. Since this is a reconciliation, you would like to expect a fan to show or enjoy this. From non-fan I was still enjoying gathering little. A good story line for each character and two main characters is what makes this film very good. (The new version of MTM's theme is no longer valid.)
