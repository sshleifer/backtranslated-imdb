I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and accept his love for the American people and the world. On the River Flowing Through Kwao, Redford shows the romanticism of the ceremony and the beauty of the highest hills of Rocky as if it was a 19th-century architect of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to visual and word for literature by author Norman Maclean, and works on the amazing camera of Phillippe Rousselot (Kiss of Snake, Reigne Margot). Tom Skerritt is Pastor MacLean, a man whose education methods include fishing fishing with the Bible, Brenda Blythen, mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt form a family that interacts with the same problems encountering newborns, and later , young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are quite convinced as brothers who love fishing fishing and everyone will unite them forever. It is a relationship between men, fathers and sons, brothers, and their women in the outside world that causes the River to use through a vein of the story that is not in many Hollywood films produced in recent years. What makes these special relationships, however, is Redford's alert language as discussed in the discussion. This is a script for reading and writing, good hearing and irregular when you meet the wonderful rivers of Montana and mountains. Words and settings are similar to the healing of their material. While the idea of ​​flying fishing may seem an unusual device to explain the story, it is not implausible in the hands of Redford's directorial. Due to the material, Redford ode for a simple time and life is worth reflecting again and again.
