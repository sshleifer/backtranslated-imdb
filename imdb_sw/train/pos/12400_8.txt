This is the second short of the Animatrix, and the first of them being what can be called 'artistic'. It has many variables, specimens and symbols in large quantities of material, especially in the run of 9 minutes. I don't think that's true; it only uses robots to show us, that as human beings, we do not accept exactly or open the mind to anyone different from ourselves. I would like to say it's a great job of that. The plan is good ... you act as a historical document, describing what caused one of the major conflicts in trilogy. So it holds the video from false news reports and so on. Sound work is very good, if there is not much of it. Animation is beautiful, and the use of colors, despite the typical style of drawing, makes it more transparent to make soft changes and other surreal pictures. This has several bits of violent violence and distracting attractions, with little dirt. Disc holds views, not in English but with head, and value of listening / reading. There are also well-developed achievements, according to both parts, so I would advise you to enjoy after seeing the next, too. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the world of Matrix, and / or false science in general. 8/10
