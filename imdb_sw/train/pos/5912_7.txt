and Dane Youssef "Coonskin" is a film, and one by Ralph Bakshi alone, is reported to be charged with films of contemporary films and black racism, as well as looking at black life in modern America (modern day, I mean - 1975 ). The item has dropped as hot potatoes that have exploded. But this is a Bakshi, controversial film, and it must look closer to the definition itself. It's not just another "shock-jock" film that tries to shock him because of the shock. It's for Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a film, he has a great thing to say ... <br /> <br /> Although the roots are the basis of low cost, "Coonskin" is not just another film-off campy. white white or any kind of flick blowing. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It focuses on a lot of top and bigger fish. <br /> <br /> Movie is not only available for that type. Nor is it just to blame black people, but it really seems to show love, beauty and heart in the most wonderful places. The "buttons" describe stories from other suspects waiting for jail in jail. The fact that even possible imprisonment in the world of "Coonskin" alone makes it old. One of the detainees tells a story about three brothers of a black brother in Harlem called Brother Put, Brother Rabbit, a Fox preacher who wants to honor and a piece of action and a desire to find it in any important way. The Itallian group is running the actual action. <br /> <br /> The great star of star musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, with Charles Gordone, the first black player to take home Pulitzer. Something big happening here clearly. <br /> <br /> Movie looks like nature in this world, this side of the coloring. From an angry, hip, deep, black black man with a hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. Bakshi movies do not recognize the meaning of the word "deficit." This seems to have never even heard a word. But perhaps this lesson requires crime. Satire real sledgehammer. Other subjects can not be prone to mildness. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is the degradation of godless mercy. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem area has been found to be inconvenient. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animals" and "real" all according to the situation and situation. The animation characters and all mankind share the realities and are meant to be considered real. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never only shows bad caricatures for the value of shock. He always has something to say. Neither the black face is free. Here, in contrast to the "Bamboozled" of Spike Lee, he seems to use it to try and say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi films, this includes animation and live. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just being ill here. All these methods are connected, connecting together when saying something. Somehow, this feels feeling. Most of these types of films (Bakshi are included) are very high, very interesting at this time. They reflect a certain trend for the day, but look back behind them several years later, there is a surprising feeling of emotions (with timeless facts) The images that are in the capsule of time, attitude, spirit and heart remain the same regardless of what f - the king hears. Anyone who looks at the movie, the situation and has been with people know what I'm talking about. <br /> Even some of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a great blow of ol and fox. One of the color characters of the bad and bad racist is the followers of Harlem cop who is hot on the way of "dirty n ----- s" after the death of the soldier. But for him, not just business. And not for other brothers who wear shields. It is the pleasure of a pure racist pleasure to hurt whites. <br /> <br /> The sequence involving the godfather and his wife is one of the most moving pieces in the entire film, which there are many. Looks like opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promo line: Color: "This movie is offensive to everyone!" This is not just. Continue with caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warning ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
