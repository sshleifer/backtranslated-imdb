Unfortunately the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made the "Alti Hitchcock" center of Alfred Hitchcock, also performed this comedy. Perhaps the two actors needed to do this after the shock of Hitchcock film. At any rate this is a very good piece of "Vertigo" as it looks again at the unlikely but powerful romance. In fact the film can be seen as part of the flip of "Vertigo" and ends with fun. Here again Novak gets a change, in Vertigo she includes two women and here she 'converts' from witch to death. Stewart is allowed again and for a short time is disappointed by his love for him. Unlike the two vertigo comes along in the "Bell Book and Candle", the perfect medicine for Hitcock movie. Again the power of love and attractiveness are investigated but with a completely different line. Sent is strict. Lemmon confident as a brother of Novak's war with Elsa Lancaster to provide a normal performance as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as a writer of alcohol worship and undoubtedly Hermoine Gingold play a competitor of Novak is very good. The area with Stewart drinking potion is the comedy for the best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you should not see this interesting.
