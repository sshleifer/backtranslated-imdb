This is a good film that deals with an issue that can attack and a great understanding. Anne Reid, formerly in the UK for its TV roles including 'Dinnerladies' (a series of Victorian Wood for the company's catering staff, if you are wondering), provides effective performance checks as May, late-60 mother the lost of two classmates speaking in the inner London area. Her husband Toots (Peter Vaughan) dies during their visit to the latter (Bobby), and we see that pair was handled by Bobby and his family. Paula's teacher (Cathryn Bradshaw) lives near, however, and the relationship between May and Paula seems close. So when in May he decides that he cannot live in his home and return to London, he can stay at Paula's home and make a child's desire to accept more than Paula. It is on May's visit to Bobby's house that includes a relationship with Darren, a friend of 30s Bobby who works in the extension of the house. In what could be the first film of the UK to show it, it is May and not Darren (Daniel Craig *) who starts to meet, at least start, it seems that the relationship is based on respect. There is no explicit sexual content (at least on the DVD I saw: the difference in the planned IMDb list reflects the existence of other versions), and the physical basis of the matter is dealt with directly but not effective. More is shown to be a relationship between May and daughter Paula, a recent change with 'personalized treatment and diagnosis', who declares that mummy has never defended her. Paula is also a partner of Darren, and when she gets an explanation of May clear but instead of poor Darren and May studies together, things are dropping down in a big but dominant way. Only in the English film, perhaps, the daughter can announce that she will ask her mother, for confidentiality to ask her to stand up, and tell her for sure. At the right time, May is approaching a close relationship with an honorable member but a senior (of his generation) of Paula's writing group. The difference between unwanted sex and the matter with Darren is clear; it is at that time May begins to get Paula, and the Darren worm begins to turn (revealing on cocaine that can be after his money, if not all, but for some trips). Therefore, May finds himself suitable for all his children's needs, and ultimately returns home (but eventually comes a bird flight for new feed). The power of the film is that it depicts the wrong but tender nature of the relationship of the parents of the previous generation, where pain can leave a parent living alone than if they had no one to take care of them. This is not new, but the transparency of the sexual needs in more than 60 years may be. The temperature of the film content, from the screenplay to Hanif Kureishi, differs from the way that is closed (it seems to be always summer), and the general condition tightens - it can be easy to be another piece put in England's rain and rain. The latter is perhaps not written, since we do not know where it goes or for how long - maybe she is Valentine's Valentine and pension, certainly does not have Picasso. Anne Reid, however, has been revealed as a good actor whose academic life will change completely. As Julie Andrews in Torn Curtain (said by Paul Newman), "There goes your Maria Poppins {read Dinnerladies} pictures for good." <br /> <br /> * Yes, he: announced October 2005 as the new James Bond.
