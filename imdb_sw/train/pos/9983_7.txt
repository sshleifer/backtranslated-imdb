This movie is about basic human relationships, and relationships between them. The main character is an old woman who in the evening of her life starts a long journey, making a analysis of how she lived her life. This trip is due to the economic crisis of children and his intention to put him in the nursing home. It is looking for honesty on issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas discussed in this film as family inheritance, real love, marriage or fate. although this type of melodramas of the film is not new, this may be useful to watch it with family members to discuss certain ideas. There is good performance with actors and characters are very honest, but because of the time some characters are probably not fully developed. I highly recommend this movie for Saturday Saturday's quiet.
