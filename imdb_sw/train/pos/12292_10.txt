I love this film, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... almost everything has already been prepared about the film, but there are more details that I would like to give light on: no real picture, still standing, Hotel du Nord (it still got me heard it was has been demolished ...) used for film - the whole area has been rebuilt when setting, the main reason is that they couldn't stop traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks.
