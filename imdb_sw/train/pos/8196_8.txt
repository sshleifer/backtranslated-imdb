I don't know why people think this is a very bad movie. It had a good plot, a good step, and a change for the area for Harry does not provide either. Certainly some of the offensive and free but this is not just such a movie. Eastwood is in good shape like Dirty Harry, and I loved Pat Hingle in this movie as a small town squad. If you would like DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, it is better than the PIDDO. 4/5
