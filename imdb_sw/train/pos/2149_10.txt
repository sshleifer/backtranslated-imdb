Every person who was beaten, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were normal, and the Sugiyama change is very reliable. The mark is so moving, it brought me tears. Choreography was good without the appearance of athletes. Dancing the grace of the mother and gave me gave me goosebumps. Tamako is a very strange character. You can almost see a school girl who wrestled with her face reminding you to see "King and me". Aoki's attitude is proud and sad. Masako is very common as a surprise wife, wanting to close her to assure him that everything will be all right. <br /> <br /> This film is a protector.
