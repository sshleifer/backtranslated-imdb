I got this late film this morning / Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the best stuck films I have seen. From a 'luxury' spoon in fact that the shade of 'journey,' woke up, fully with all the iron stuff on the doors and adhesive stickers saying workers, then see the same door being used for something else in another area - film this becomes !! Promotions are poor you are helped but look, heal your face and holes. In the last area he jumps from the boat to life and ferry away. Cut to his son and new partner (the PR director of the PR who knows kung-fu and had been a policeman but was expelled for doing his things - actually) on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ...... Then the father hugs them. How ???? He deserves, his magic. There is no single feature of redemption on this film. Casino is the size of a large closet with a single casino table. during the expulsion and offenders there is only one part of hiding, you have changed it. Enter criminals who, instead of looking at the bottom of the same table, continue to beat four fruits of a bar with a little corner of the corner (corner corner in the casino - amazing). They walk straight in front of the only place to hide so allowing our Casper around them to 'take them out'. Get a partner, get a little water, make this film and mourn.
