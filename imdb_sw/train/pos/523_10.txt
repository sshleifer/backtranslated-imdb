Why is this film not better than 250? This movie still looks fresh 56 years after its production but it could only be made after W.W.II because of the perception of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected time. And what after life? I loved the area and the judgment and all the people of the nations gathered. Fhlegmatic judge (Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey), defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - this is why America is). Michael Powell wrote, inspired and produced this amazing film which is a "tour-de-force" concert. The message of the movie is clear: in the world the law is more important but in the world there is nothing beyond human love. This beautiful story is told is more interesting than any Hollywood movie that can do.
