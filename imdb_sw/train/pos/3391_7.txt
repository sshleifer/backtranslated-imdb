Like all films that know the environment from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a more interesting view of what was affected by the environment. The widespread widespread means there are so many people eating? I was under the impression that hunger was caused by war or economic policies failed. Stalin's policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions of people who died as a result of hunger and to this day the greatest man made a tragedy was a rural water policy in China which led more than 30 million deaths in the 1950s And we forgot the great hunger in the Horn of Africa in the late 1980s and 90s which included not over-collisions. You can also consider that two areas of the world, Hong Kong and Macau, have never suffered famine in modern times. Also the urbanization of cities around the cities as shown here is not too low to increase significantly - it is under economic circumstances where people are growing cities to get better paid jobs than in the country (it is a sign of industrial development - not of many parents) so a picture of the streets of New York City if it is full of crowded walking and having sleeping people in stairwells is a huge amount of attraction <br /> <br /> But don`t be fooled in thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a stick of The korny tree is stunned because I think this is the best film of the nature of <br /> <br /> 70s. It drives the knowledge of the modern view of the world where Sol and Thorn are enjoying fun, getting copper and fresh meat. Thorn is surprised to have ice in his whiskey, gives us a cigarette and offers a classic line "If I could afford two smoke, maybe three of these days". But it is the shape of the euthanasia room that is not as memorable as the Moon looking at the pictures of wild animals, flowers, water and snow cover, the Thorn generation of the world is unknown. This is a very haunting area that makes SOYLENT GREEN a very unpredictable film, with the truth showing the final appearance of Edward G Robinson's screen as a wise Jew Sol Roth
