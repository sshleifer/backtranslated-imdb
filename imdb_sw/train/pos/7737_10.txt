If you are a great fan of the author if I belong to Jim Thompson, it may be pretty dodgy when their work is being changed to the film. This is not for Scott Foley's exhibition IN THE NAME OF MY SWEET. The following concerns about the gender issues that follow next and are doing good in the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward provide excellent displays of their work. And Bruce Dern has often been involved in this. As this book of Thompson this movie creates a dark and surreal world where desire overcomes logic and cross twice has never been around. You must see for all fans of a great film film. **** !!!
