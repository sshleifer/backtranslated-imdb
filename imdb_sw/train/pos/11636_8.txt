It has been made to the beauty, it has done well, has played a listening movie. It was with me on the edge of my seat. I loved the leading actor, and I think the villain had done well. Not much to chew here by the head, but if you enter your seat, speak your brain, look at the work of the conventional camera, and enjoy the plot, you will have a good time. The program is well-filled, and the most popular girls will know more or less what to expect for ten minutes. But that doesn't hurt me, as I enjoyed watching it. In the old days, they may not have been very sensitive to the two characters, and there were sometimes horrible moments when I had the prospect of enabling others to have a few lines. But these people probably had the right to put the film so hard. The plan gave me a throat early, and never let it go. It's not a good idea to think too much when or after the movie. if I don't know it does a good job. Just sit back and enjoy.
