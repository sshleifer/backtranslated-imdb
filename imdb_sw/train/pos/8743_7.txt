A powerful film with a powerful exhibition (especially two guides). The film refers to two American girls who are faced with heroin 6 kg on the airport in Thailand. Both are in prison and one of them signifies confession. Bill Pullman has a lawyer who tries to evict them. All they should do is get Nick Parks who put narcotics in the package of one of the two girls. So far for the story that is not original (has many variations and better Return to Paradise). The beautiful picture of Newton Thomas Sigel makes this film worthy to watch. 7 out of 10.
