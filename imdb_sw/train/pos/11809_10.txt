Dick Tracy was not ideal for most of the comic book, because they wanted something with blood as Batman. Dick Tracy is guilty of being just a comic book with criminals who have a serious problem of appearance and having fun. Warren Beatty leads with stars as the main character that fights crime without using too much force. I have loved Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main color: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is a perfect film for anyone looking at their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice and zest. Madonna as a child who is the second woman in this film does not know the toy boy that represents. As I said, there is no blood, dirt, sexual offense or anything that is wrong with anyone.
