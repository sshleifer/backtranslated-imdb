This is an entertaining film that follows the production process of NY's Macbeth production. Although it has much to say about the power, envy and ambition (Macbeth theme) in our modern world, the film works best if it doesn't take itself too much. Well-known actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury are doing a great job in the great roles, but my exhibition is a hilarious area where "Banquo" (John Elsen) is described. Perhaps the most entertaining film for those involved in the theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film.
