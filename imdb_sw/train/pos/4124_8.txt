Bridges Lloyd like Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series. What was so good when I saw it was a real feeling of going under the water. The show exhibits energy youth youth for underwater exploration that is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational and also show the viewer things on scuba diving from someone who appeared to be pro consummate, Mike Nelson. There were excellent performances, and the program has been shown to be well fed. In fact, the festival in the text sometimes finds the same details in more than 1 part but each show holds itself with any other show produced at this time, the American television series.
