The film begins very slowly, and the life of Wallace Napalm, serves at a photo-service center. His wife has been banned in his home with a leg bracelet as a result of the sentence for burning. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department, and it takes fire to weight. When we see the life of Wallace's life, suddenly there is something new and jarring: the carnival of travel comes to town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, a brother of Wallace. She is a clown, but she has a special talent. <br /> <br /> So Wallace. They are all pyrokineticists or "pyrotics," people who are able to start fire for mental energy. Wallace puts its secret power; Wilder enables his friends to know what he can do. Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to the childhood experience where they did not inform the death of the youth. Wallace refrains from using his power; Wilder wants to go to the public on the national TV. <br /> <br /> To give this, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, both of whom were years ago. He becomes a skeptic, and becomes one of the reasons that the brother finally has a real fire. <br /> <br /> Movies are entertainment, but not laughing loudly. I think it's enough to be a copy in my library. It's a good film.
