This is one of my favorite films of all time, and when it can encourage slower for some, it's good to watch. The lawyer of the company (Richard Chamberlain) is arrested in the case involving the "city", and this is not usually the case. Well, man is dead but not a casual murder. It has also been the largest number of recent rainfall, and many film trends are claustrophobic & oppressive. Aborigines hidden secretly and refuse to cancel the beans. This has a lot to do with white people thinking about the "City" against the Aborigines "of the tribe", and of course no Abo in the capital will make ethnic ways. Uh hu. Chamberlain has fantastic dreams and somehow it is important for what happens, although no matter how many times I've got this I can't understand the real relationship. This is a very good and angry film, and is a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension without anything. Ultimately it is a trivial matter but I used the real, the most simple and frightening way. 10 out of 10 and was highly recommended.
