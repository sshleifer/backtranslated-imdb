This is a very exciting and romantic film. I have seen it several times and never never experienced it. Everything is true and it's a good plot. Actors are the best Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I really love this film for Braveheart like Braveheart has many historical barriers. There are many exciting events - attention to the Scen Bridge and the final location of the fence. This is good and amazing. <br /> <br /> Music is good ... fit for the movie. The layout is awesome.
