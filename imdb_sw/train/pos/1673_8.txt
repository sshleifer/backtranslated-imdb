Freezing Martino, this is enjoyable and enjoyable performances and beautiful performances from good cast and especially two leading, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me the jig-saw puzzle of the plot is so judged and combine you just sit back and enjoy instead of trying to expect. Only at all seems to be resolved we again taken on a series of twists, delightful twists, it should be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy and a lot of gory kills this movie well paced by London, Athens and Greek coastal areas. The great end of the Aegean rocks overshadows the objects and many joys were all.
