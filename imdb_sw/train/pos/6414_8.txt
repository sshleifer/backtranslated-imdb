I was curious about how the analysts responded to this stirring film, and so I went to Rotten Tomato and I was afraid to see that the modern nuts peanut butter that were critics of our national film has given 43% (or "Rotten" film). ) rating. All I can say is if this film did not inspire you, you don't have a heart. (It is amazing to realize that the same film on the same site received an average of 74% from viewers.) It is not that the opinion of critics is what is important to me.

But these salts have a way to fill if their views are somewhat more important more than yours, and even more, they like to hate them. /> <br /> I will give you that this film is old (well, except for f) bombs, syrupy, and slightly predictable ... after all, you really know since The beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., depicting the hero of the real navy of Carl Brashear, will conquer (eventually) every time only by the way it comes: determine and seize; power-willed and hope. and that of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, many of the people The real life is very powerful, very stimulating, that you will be on your feet enjoying the filming, especially the peak of the court. You should be a real stick in the mud that should not be transferred to these events. As critics of the national nation. Michael Rappaport is the best with a good student, diving to dive to a good friend of Gooding. If someone has seen the "Top Training", this behavior saves them completely. However, this proves what I have always felt: listen to critics. Check out this movie and be guided.
