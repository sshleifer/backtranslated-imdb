I tell you that sometimes "seems" is all the important things, such as Jeremy Clarkson from the BBC said (not about our world though, but he is right). And when it comes to looks, this film is a wonderful amazing wonder you will love what your eyes see. Then there is a movie of the movie too, interesting, and voiceless with the storyteller of interesting stories that will handle your soul as you look at these pictures. <br /> <br /> The movie probably doesn't affect your life, destroying this beauty, but it will surely remember how our precious planet we really live. This movie deserves to be 10 stars as one of the lowest stlislistic worlds I enjoyed.
