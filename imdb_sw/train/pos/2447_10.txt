George Lopez was never interested in his position and still does not. But this show is a work of art. It has never shown where jokes will always show you every time you remember (and jokes that are remembered at that time). This shows only the appearance of the disappearance and the extent of the characters from an old man, a young drunk and a young man. I don't know who writes this show but that person is doing a good job. If they were to continue to show me I am sure that they will get a good response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good comedy, traditionally, then George Lopez is a show for you! Something wrong is the head. George Lopez? True? Imagine the Prince of Bel-Air that "Will Smith". Yes man! But otherwise, this display is thought! 10/10
