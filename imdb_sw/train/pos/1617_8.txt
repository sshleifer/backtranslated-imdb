'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is no single romance, there are at least three, but all relate to one family. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is almost married Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He doesn't like him, but he's a good and nice person. When she comes to visit her dead mother in Italy Loretta meets the brother of Johnny Ronny (Nicolas Cage). She and Johnny have not met in five years and Loretta wants to invite her to the wedding. Of course it falls constantly for each other. How this story and love story of the parents of Loretta and uncle and aunt develop is something you have just seen for yourself. Each appearance is fun looking, and Cher as a bright star in the middle of everything. He won and actually deserved Oscar that year. Cage is very good, and also, with Olympia Dukakis as the mother of Loretta and Vincent Gardenia as her father is bright. This movie is interesting, charming and very interesting.
