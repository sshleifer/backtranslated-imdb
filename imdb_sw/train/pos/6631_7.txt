I do not know how to explain this film, and I would also like to give others the same opportunity that I have - seeing it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I was very happy but I can also say I did not understand what was going on, if there really was anything to understand the first place. David Lynch Fans (tangentially) or particularly Guy Maddin's film should enjoy this particular, and any fans of the EIGHTBALL book might have joined the fun and wonderful (it was like close to any film I've got a voice and mood Dan Clowes creates efficiently). Just one reminder to warn anyone who is angry - this film, if tested, will be NC-17 indeed. Fans of the perfect boyfriend, however ... hmm, well ... yes. This is amazing wild things.
