When a Relationship Relationship, in my opinion, is a very touching matter of the heart type of heart on the result of anorexic or bulimic. At any time Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) went up, I wanted to vomit. It's kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should be more involved in matters. However, I was glad to see them doing things together and getting directions from their parents. Before you close this, I would like to say, "If you ask me, WHAT DOES THE PACKAGING PACKAGING show you how anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this film to everyone who has not seen it. You go in tears and a good time, so next time on TV, kick up with a friend and watch.
