I want to warn you that there is a very good quality for these comments. Also, these comments will be more useful to you after watching the film. It is sadly sad to say, the movie resembles my life that is so amazing that it is really scary. Others who never know how the movie shows how people have been in such a situation as an act and respond to their future. This was not a false work; it had to be based on personal experience. My agreement on how the movie was so good is shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best movies I ever seen, watching my life displayed on a silver screen was a very painless experience that I could never see again. But I wholeheartedly agree to all others as an opportunity to look at someone else's soul to the extent that you have probably never experienced before or ever will. I know it really, because that's my soul you will look at.
