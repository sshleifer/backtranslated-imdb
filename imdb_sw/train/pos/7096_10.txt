I had the opportunity to see this film in the preview of the preview, and out of the theater I met the camera staff from the local television station looking for a comment on the film. At that time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "amazing. Just amazing." I like to think I can express myself better than that, but then I was able to do that. The story is exciting and stimulating, and acting is the first level from all the principals. This film was the first that Terry Gilliam explained that he did not have a hand in the loan. Returning to Universal after his long battle, hard with them on "Brazil", Terry had succeeded what he wanted more; "cutting end". Terry is a good professional, and every shot is like a beautiful painting that has been built with care and determination and faith. It is just right that such a person should be poor in his attempts to convey the concept. Unfortunately, restrictions are still available in these settings. The Universal DVD Collection version of this film is amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed in the box. It is among other things, the definition of the director / producer of sound and good recordings of 90 minutes on the effectiveness of the film called "Factory Hamster and Other Morning Stories". It mentions some of the creative initiatives in film formulation, including a mettle test when the preliminary observation was badly tested, placing the team with a sense of confidence and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and unlock it with great success. <br /> <br />
