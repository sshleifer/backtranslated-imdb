I saw a special preliminary investigation of this today. I must notify you, not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I didn't have any prospects for this. I finished a little fun. The Real Life is a story of a widow with a 3-year-old daughter who goes to spend on weekends with her family. While in a bookstore, she meets a woman of her dreams, just knowing that she happens to be a brother to her brother. <br /> <br /> This game has been made well-sound, movies, and acting are all over-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was that there seemed to be a lack of character development, especially with the behavior of Dane Cook. We cannot look at the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt it would help a little bit to show what Dan's internal conflict about having love with Dane's partner was. Other than this though, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid film, sweet - definitely breaking good from all the movies and fears that we have been gaining this year.
