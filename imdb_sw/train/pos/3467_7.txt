I am still wondering why I watched this film. In fact, before watching this film, I didn't know anything about batles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had tons of fans, they had albums that some people say is ever more, they broke, John married Yoko Ono, and John was killed. Also, VH1 is not my favorite music channel, MTV is. However, for some reason or another I decided to look at it, not expecting a lot. Surprised, I was so happy! The discussion was written and dealt with well with the occasion of the slightest push. This is very important, because John and Paul are talking about the best film, even though it is taken out to explore more possibilities, and keep you looking. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn provide a good place, in general. The last was also very intelligent. I enjoyed how the film makes you excited about the summa sNL, and then it gets on the head and lets you realize that it will be better if we leave it, and finish it properly. My favorite time is probably a touching area. Overall, I recommend this movie almost everyone. It is a great way to deal with your curiosity about what might happen about 6 years after Paul broke out only on the door of John. Which is the main reason for watching this film, solving my mind about who hit it well and what happened to them after the break.
