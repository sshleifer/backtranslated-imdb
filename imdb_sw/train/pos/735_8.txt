An incredible film of 1979 in which students of Vince Lombardi High School faced a new, dictator named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a disgusting music and blames the music of the students for their mistakes. Leading the charges against him is to love Riff Randell (PJ Soles), fan # 1 of Ramones who, more than anything, wants a rock team to record his songs. Now * this is an impossible movie to resist. First of all, the sound of the voice is wonderful, and the songs of artists like Alice Cooper and Underel Velvet as well as the incomparable infections of Ramones. "Lobotomy of Youth", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" is just a few. Then, cast actually gives all, and Soles is the best choice for Riff's role; he is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as zealous as Tom and Kate, Woronov is cured against kind like Togno snooty and shy, Clint Howard has one of its best parts as an Eaglebauer entrepreneur, and New World regularly as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially happy as a music teacher Mr. McGree) and Real Don Steele are happy as always. And, in fact, it's treating Ramones to play themselves. The video has a real spirit. The energy level is high, and journalist-story and director Allan Arkush bring a lot of flair to the case. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper's gag car is a good example of this. This continues through the "delete" style change mode. There are even mice with pride that are designed with the future effects of the famous flower Rob Bottin, in one of its first gigs. <br /> <br /> Well as well as to challenge the authority, a single-one-party-party film can get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is, quite, a wonderful event of worship. <br /> <br /> 8/10
