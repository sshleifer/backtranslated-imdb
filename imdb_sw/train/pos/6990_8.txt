Bela Lugosi appeared in some of these low-budget chillers for the Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. White has a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts water from their bodies so that he can take care of his old wife looking at the young. After a journalist and doctor stayed at his home and found that he was responsible for the death of the grandmother, the next morning they reported this murder to the police and the scientist shot dead and drops died shortly thereafter. <br /> <br> You have almost everything in this movie: the helpers of the scientist include the old Hag, the sandwich and the slick (his children), the thunderstorms and the tiny in the house of Bela. Bela and his wife find sleep well in the lids instead of beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> The dead bodies of Vanishes are worth looking at, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Enjoy it very much. <br /> <br /> Testing: 3 out of 5 stars.
