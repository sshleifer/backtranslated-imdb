*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "Divers", is very interesting. All I knew about it was that it would have a history of Nazi, underwater pictures and everyone would be speaking in Denmark. But I decided to investigate for one reason, the fact that the story circles you around the German WWII submarine mentioned. I have had a fetus for the German championship, especially the destruction that can be beaten. So I was worried about the part of Denmark, but I thought that small could measure that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always good and non-sure of the size of the budget I was, to say a little, very worried <br /> <br /> After seeing I was ... surprised. <br /> I was thinking about the participants being miserable, seeing how some are very young, two main actors. This was not a matter, they both do very well. Like other actors, which mainly include people in their 50s and more. This makes interesting interactions between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not only in any way, but not very few. And it's all good. <br /> <br /> In Danish language, it is impossible to understand. But this was not a problem, it had lower heads. Another thing was the submarine itself, I thought it would be inside shots with shots out of the submarine waters. After deciding their budget was small, I thought this could turn enough for better and less fairly bad when it was worse. Again I was surprised, the external events of the fall are good and the interior events are very realistic. With a fetus for German contributions, I knew what it looked like, especially inside, and did not stop. The team has done extensive research. It's all good. I think more people than I will watch this film so we can see some of the fall events so I don't feel it should give "warning". The submarine in the movie is not a real example at the time of war. It is a specific purpose of purpose. But to give you a sense of what to expect, is to cross between the types of VII, the IX type and the Japanese small transport equivalent to I-52. It is a beautiful god and makes it withered well. <br /> <br /> The layout is on the Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. It is during summer and two brothers travel to their grandparents to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. Grandpa is a kind walker. The art of the cinema is very good, a lot of summer summer summer events, the love of the new youth, good weather diving and the overall sense of "perfect". Once again, it's all good. <br /> <br /> The island of wise island finds some visitors of the type of suspect, a collection of men hiring one of the boats, minesweeper of the past and staff. One of the guests, a 50-year-old man, has a German eagle and swastika tattooed behind him. The main citizens of the whole island remember when the German tape ended toward the end of the second World War II and since then there was a rumor of Nazi gold in detail. Grandpa was one of the young men who searched for a sunny boat shortly after the German bodies began southward in 1945. No submarine was found. What matters are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrets, competition, boy's love, conspiracy, and ... surprises. <br /> <br /> *** MESSAGE - MISSION *** <br /> <br /> I had no expectations of some of the most common features of this film and took me away. It is not to be a great fan of normal events, however it is well closed in the story and does not give trouble. It's not like "From morning to morning" where everyone returns to vampires towards the end. This is more subtle. It is a very good movie, I gave 8. Some due to the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later I learned that it had a fair budget and that some actors were old veterans of Denmark. But even if this was a Hollywood production, I would give it 7 or 8. For your time value. Yes, the story of the child through, but again the story of maturity. It has a lot of doubt and a great adventure, which I have found so much. And, again, the movie is very interesting. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
