In a few times the film comes that has the power to expand the mind, warm fire and very touching the soul. "LOU" is a film. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business. He looked at me for the second time. We were recommended both. He like for the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical feature set to send back when all your games started. It does this when you are enjoying it. The work of Bret Carr and pacing as a director does not allow you to look away from the screen. He creates a characteristic that is damaged by gun guns like, blaming, but is offered to heat and trust as if you forget the film. When epiphany played during the brilliant peak, I saw my wife crying for the second time. Like a life coach, I enable individual growth and change, and this film is "must see" for life coaches and anyone who finds personal growth and change. It's a brilliant, creative hub and power to change life!
