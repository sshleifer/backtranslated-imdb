This movie gets right. Like the old USAF Cadet, I can tell you this film has all. Maturity of the application process. Wait for the word. Happy acceptance. Worried about making it through the course. The look of the friends of the person (perhaps their best) wash. The pain of paying the final price - the death of airmen of students. Glory of graduation. Always jump, jump, jump. Many are called but few are chosen. We did by paying what we would like to pay for doing.
