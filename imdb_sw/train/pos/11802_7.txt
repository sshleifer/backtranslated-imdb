This is not the best Bigfoot done, but with recent Nature's rates they had left the awry films, especially showing on the Sci-Fi station, this is the best thing. It has steps, humor, F / X good and Bigfoot. CG is used, but it is also some F / X actions, which I like. <br /> <br /> Overall this film has a look at whether you are a fan of B horror / sci-fi and you need to fix it. It's better than the Sasquatch of the film and not the direction of it, don't do it. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you can expect to get in the film like this and lead it more than enough. He expects a bit of thala as the characters have "progress", but know that things will take. If you watch a DVD you would like to fly a frame or two.
