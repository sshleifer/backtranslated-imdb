Cinéaste Teacher Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see members of the family of Resnais as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant are involved in such topics as death, religion, suicide, love and their general consequences in our daily lives. The realities of the split relationship with these people seem like friends, however, are officially unofficial. In 1984, when doing L'amour à mort, Resnais was concerned with time, memory and opportunity to unlock the secrets of the basic question of existence human: What! love is stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a similar film. The film is great and clear: true and deep love can even put science in disgrace if the dead loved ones find their lost lives again leaving doctors to keep their reputation.Lamour à mort is like a game that is not all working. It is a film that a music logo is on the full hub with its photos. This is one of the reasons why this film can be closed easily.
