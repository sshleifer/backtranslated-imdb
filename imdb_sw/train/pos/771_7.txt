I watched the movie with a friend of pride, my wife and her girlfriend. So I had a suggestion from all types of orders. Specifically, the film made me laugh, sexual tension was not there and only the visible actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think he played his role well, even if the script was not correct. There were good Romanian actors near, they had no difficult responsibilities. I praise Puya to enter the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he is pretty good, I hope he will be good performers. <br /> <br /> Wife loved the movie, however, and I think there may be strokes being played by which I had no ear for. If the film attempted to give you an abnormal habit of sex and their effects in Romania today, then it has failed miserably. There were no results. Imagine that girls are really a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a horrible plot, not interesting. I don't know why it got all the BAFTA awards. In my book, it would receive the "Good luck" future. (lucky = good luck in Romanian).
