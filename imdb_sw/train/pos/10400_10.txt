Probably the best ever ever made film. Color color, interesting, amazing, spot-spot color of Miklos Rosza which is perfect for each area and mood. Working is very good in what can be hard and arrogant in a few hands, but here the poetry talks come out, they say firmly (humor is both wise and enjoyable). like this. With the “four fur” (1939), one of the two best photographs offered by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the most beautiful photos found. <br /> <br /> classic!
