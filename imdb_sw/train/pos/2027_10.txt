What could say about the compulsory performance of Tara Fitzgerald? He is widely believed as the injured Graham, who has suffered from experience, sharp and powerful, but is not immune to the effects of Mr Markham's passion. Through every negative attitude and fury, every sharpness of his sight and telling the face of the face, Toby Stephens is the master of his character. He is the power of passion and hope that will refresh Helen's heart. Huntingdon's cemetery is the perfect function of hard-to-use. However, in spite of all that he did, there is a human glory which is unacceptable for rejecting faithful at the end; he at least knows his own mistakes and how they have brought his destruction. Helen's attempt to save her - after leaving and taking her child when this was not heard - is the victory of hope, hope and trust in the value of every life and human soul, however, by mistake, however one can be. The end of Markham can be seen as his reward for his faith and behavior without moral behavior. Although the views of the moral values ​​presented widely in the Representative seem to be long-term and the standards today, the story is associated with integrity, enthusiasm, and belief that still affects. The tenant is more faithful than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is a change that makes the right to novel. I highly recommend seeing it!
