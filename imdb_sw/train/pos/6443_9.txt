Yesterday I watched this film for the third time. It was recommended for me to cook a couple of weeks ago. I have never watched or even seen it before, because it falls (usually) in the "Swedish Swedish" group and those who came out (like me) and Hollywood production are concerned about any foreign movies. Hell what changes the view! The film touches me, because it keeps my hope, that mankind can change the best way. Swedish village is the only example in all parts of the world where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstanding, lack of courage, prediction, hiding violence, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It takes a trigger from outside to eliminate masks for everyone (who keeps one) and empowers them to feel that we are only human and desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing such stories, because, they continue with my hope as described above. Five minutes of the story of Gabriella's song as well as its performance are one of my films ever! Thank you Kay Pollak for just 5 minutes, which made me happy!
