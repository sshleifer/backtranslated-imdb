He grew up on me. I love R.D music. Burman and in spite of the information that I have seen a lot of relocation and I have continued to see the film. Brother-sister plot line is strong, I thought; there is also probably unnecessary things, like the bar of the bar, the story of the loony crime, etc. which just surprise them. (Although it is not unfunny from a particular perspective.) Also the English translation is obvious to someone who was a bit of stretch, and as loony as I am grateful to him for doing so. Like many movies that I have seen, this is both spiritual and opera, including here especially the first song and the little boy to thank his sister who was abused and happy, and then that song he sang 12 or many years later and someone who had walked to Kathmandu wanting to be reunited with this girl, who was worried (had been told by her brother and her mother had died), beating her pain and drugs. <br /> <br> The main thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement, which brought India's search groups, from the Indian perspective, which sees them as the people used in India for spiritual hunger caused by the failure of society their own, but nevertheless, in India, they just live comfortably at this time. Hippie-play-drugging secrets are amazing, and they are right for their voice (I am old enough to remember), and I feel that most of the children of white children have been found more, if I remember hearing about children in the caravan to the East to get This kind of work in sound. (It is not about the actual movement of Hare Krishna, although film hippies sing Krishna / Rama song, like making a real Indian group, unrelated to hippies, in the opening of the film.) Virginia
