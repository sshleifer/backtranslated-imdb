As far as I know a real person whose great actors play sees his performance and said it was a beautiful picture, I would agree with him. This is a wonderful film about a boy / man with a completely talented body and a special part of the body to help him. Oscar and BAFTA win, and Golden Globe who chose Daniel Day-Lewis plays with Christy Browna injured with brain disease that uses his entire life on the floor, in the wheel and placed by his family. He has a left leg special though, he can write with it, drawing and placing it with objects. He learns to talk later on the film, it's very good for someone like him. Also home to Oscar 2's Oscar win, and Golden Globe chose Brenda Fricker as Mrs Brown and BAFTA win Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. Selected Oscars for the Best Director of Jim Sheridan, Writing Ideal, Screenplay Based on Photos from Central Photos and Best, was selected BAFTA for Best Film, Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was the number 85 on the Top 100 Movie Movie, was the number 20 on the Greatest British Artists, was the number 9 of the Best British actors, and was the 15th number on the World Physician, and the film was the number 28 on the Greatest UK movies. Better!
