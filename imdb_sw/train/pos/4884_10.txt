For people of a certain age, W.W. I was at the time to define their life, and anything that was followed did not compare. When the film opens, a widow who is still happy (Judi Dench) listens to a street musician trying to play a classic song, "Stardust." Remembering his memory when he played almost all the girl's band that stopped between the bomb invasion during War. The player, Patrick (Ian Holm), enjoyed avoiding drafts and enjoying women. Patrick and Dench's behavior meets and decides to re-integrate the band, which takes them to a series of mini adventures. With ups and down, the band connects again and makes the achievement achieved. <br /> <br /> Movie is well-written and standing, with good performances from all involved. The characters are well organized by all people who have not stopped living, despite their age. And there is all the old music of the former glory! This is not a confirmation of Steven Spielberg, but a great movie however. The war is affected by everyone and the lesson is not included in a non-interesting film as it teaches.
