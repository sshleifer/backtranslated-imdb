When I saw this film first, it was old for VHS-Video. I loved this film, because it was exciting and exciting. A few years ago I saw another film, called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * In this film it was part of the * Ministries of the lost kingdom used. They called this movie "KOR winner". I started looking for "KOR" - Enjoying many years, because I wanted to see the full film, not just parts that were used in * * Andy Colby * -Movie. No shop had a Kor-Movie to rent and no shop knew this film. Many years I looked at my old VHS tapes I have at home, and it's amazing ... I had this film since many years at home, but the film had a different title, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 names. this tapes at home and this time I had a lot of time to watch * KOR Winner again. Music is great during the movie hole, but a good place to imitate the image for the mix and music is this time, while KOR goes to drink through the green torest. The previous music had some kind of magic. I would like Bo Svenson, and also a boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their best work. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
