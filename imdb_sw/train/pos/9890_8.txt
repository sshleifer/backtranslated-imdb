Unfortunately, this film has not made it a DVD. I saw it when it was first released in the movie in 1983, and again when VHS was released in 1992. When I saw a VHS copy on the fiber market, I immediately bought it. I had no desire. First, obviously: Claudia Ohana is good and happy to behold. But, the film brings you into an uncertain world where you should reflect on your values ​​and the decisions that are important to you. The movie is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations use and serve the developing countries and their capitalist plans to bind them in debt that they cannot pay. It is about how our economic system uses us to redeem us from debt and credit cards, credit and car payments. It is about trying to save the guilt that we probably did not have the truth and perhaps we cannot save the truth. It's about good and evil and about how hard sometimes you tell someone from another. It brings many questions but does not provide answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this is a film worth saving and seeing.
