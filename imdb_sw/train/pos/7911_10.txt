As a child, I loved computer animation though it was small and tools were not available. This movie, when I was scared and looking at the amazing pictures and the closest music, focused on my desire in me to create moving things on the computer. This is a package of the whole package, between music and video, which takes the horn directly. If you know any child who wants to get involved in computer animation, this is TRAINING. Still, about 20 years later, this film is one of my top 3 likes. Realistically, I think, it's still not interfered with most of the McMovies today which Hollywood provides out. Now I need to see if I can make it myself; if imitation is an abrupt form of degrading then this movie is eligible for TON imitation =)
