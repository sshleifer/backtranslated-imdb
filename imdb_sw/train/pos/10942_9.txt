I would like to give this ten out of ten if it was not a joke fart. You are too big! As soon as possible "racism" of the show and joke, but it is also quick to say radiculously sex, crap-head head like "well, duh, some of the other shows do make these better jokes because at least they have hot women." . Pregnancy joke is good because, in fact, who is pregnant with weight anyways? At least I am not a * born child. I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are joining to make movies about sisters who travel along the road together. Talk about the movie of the year!
