In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the necessary recognition. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, in Sundance. I enjoy its work more, and this is what I liked. Sorry that most people do not appreciate it. My grandmother was a bright reader and read the book years before coming to the big screen. He gave me reading after we saw the movie together. The movie and book hit the spot spot into my heart, and I was crying for several days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to love our loved ones. We see this in our family relationships, but our love with our families and their stories endures in the ages of time. The film was perfect and breathing - I had been portrayed by its beauty and how well described the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, "But when I alone half of the canyon, the existence of everything seems to spread to my soul, and the memory and the sound of the Great River of the Black, and the four degrees of calculation, and the hope that the fish will rise. The floor of the time.In some rocks are raindrops of timeless time. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are their. Norman Maclean), basically is a scripture, in my opinion. Any possible possible obstacles to the movie can be shaded by beauty and grace of stories and movies. It was beautiful!
