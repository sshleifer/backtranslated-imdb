Doctor Herman Jos√© is a soccer player's soccer player who gets two African players and tries to sell them for a little money for Benfica's club (his heart club), FC Porto, so these players did not play well, and required that the port of FC was dealt with this. But what happens is that the two players after all are good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money for a foreign club, making a good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without a great fight in a good film, is a very good and interesting comedy, showing all competitions between North / Southern Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). It is highly recommended
