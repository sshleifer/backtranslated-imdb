This movie was so bad the last movie of Vipul Shah was good this was very bad though it is a good story and it is dealt with in a good way Aatish Kapadia who changed this film from another to play Gujarati "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" made a good but slow pianful 2 hours and half to see there are many errors in this film but it is still an entertaining music and not working well but it's always good not a movie you would like to watch while it is still an interactive story and it's good if you are a kind of good relationship with a cargo of error and humor that is not even recommended
