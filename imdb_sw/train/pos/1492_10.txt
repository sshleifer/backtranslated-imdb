Mukhsin is a good movie about the first story of love. Everyone can have one, and this is the author of the story of Yasmin Ahmad, with a young man named Mukhsin. We know that its movies have been a semi-autobiography of the kind, having events from their personal experience, and actually being dividing this and interpreting these feelings on a large screen, which has its films always providing trust and honesty. Mukhsin is not different, and perhaps it is the most bold job of advertising so far (although I must add, as personal, that Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Our favorite family is back - Pak Atan, Mak Inom, Installed by Kak Yam, although at this time, we are coming back when you are regulated at age 10. All characters are limited to the movies we have gone with, from Rabun to Gubra, and here, Sharifah Sisters Amani Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya are involved in the duties of Orked and Mak Inom respectively, who probably practiced their best chemistry on the screen, not accepting that they do not have the work of their brothers. It seems often is Kak Yam, played by Adibah Noor, and even Pak Atan has hair on his head! Through the Mukshin movie, we come to the full circle with the characters, and the world that Yasmin has initiated us. We come to learn and understand the family a little more, put in a day where they still live in their campus (revisited back in Rabun), where Orked attends Chinese school, with a great mix of punches (and marvels at that power force in Gubra, well , he had in it since the youth!). The permanent child and family man, prefer to play with the boys in sports, instead of the unwise “masak-masak” and the girls, and love meetings include going with family in soccer matches. The arrival of a boy named Mukhsin (Mohd Syafie Naswip) goes to the village provides a good peer for setting out and doing things on-cycling through villages, planting trees, flying kites. And if what is proposed to be examined, cross the line between friendship and love, all good feelings. Mukhsin has an exciting time that has made a story, and laughs, because some of the events, we could find ourselves, and sometimes serve as a reminder of our childhood memories. In short, these events cried "happy"! We look at life in an ordinary campung, where other neighbors are very good, while others, parky nosy and words of rumors, spread bad rumors from envy. There are 2 months of family, one from neighboring neighborhood, and another from Mukhsin himself, all of which are used as sufficient items, and differ from His own. As usual, Yasmin's movies are full of the best music, and with Mukhsin, it has something special, the song "Hujan" written by his father, with "Ne Me Quitte Pas", using a good film Since Yasmin's films have today taken into account the same characters, its beauty is that you can look at them as standing alone, or when watching and copying together, making a drama for compelling the family concerned with different themes and world issues like romantic love, love, and forgiveness. In fact, Fans will see many of the Mukhsin links behind the original movies, when new audiences will be interested in the reasons and the importance of ordinary characters or events, such as the stupid boy who plays on the sound. <br /> </ </ </> <> </ <</ <</> </ </ </ </> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> </ <> \ t I thought that as a story about childhood, memorable from memory, then there is an explanation that will be blurred for sure. And with deceit, I felt that Mukhsin showed this perfectly, without a detailed explanation, and to look at what could be remembered in two important intervals. Another highly recommended image, and one of the most rare that I feel is good for all ages - bring it with your brother or sister!
