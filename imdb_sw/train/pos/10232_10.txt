After seeing many Ringo Lam movies, I can say that this is his best film so far, and more unusual. It is an ancient Chinese period full of brutal art, where the underground area is full of traps and prisons has a great place as characters. The action is wonderful, the story is time and entertainment, and the set design is difficult to be remembered. Sadly, the Burning Paradise has never been found on DVD and vhs is almost-impossible to find your top mitts, even if you close to the second largest city of China in North America (as I do). If you can find it, don't go through it.
