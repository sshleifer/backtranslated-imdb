Drifter looking for work is wrong for someone to hit in a small town Wyoming, causing all kinds of problems. Cage is fully cast as a hopeless pastor hoping to make buck quickly and get out of town but looking for him can not escape the city name. Hopper does what he does well, playing psychology known as "Lyle from Dallas," a real man who was beaten. Walsh as a sherifier and Boyle as a woman fatale all rounded well. The brother's script by John and Rick Dahl has a pleasant and turns effort, and John's direction creates a "neo noir" scenario. Witch and very entertaining, persuades the viewer from the beginning and never does.
