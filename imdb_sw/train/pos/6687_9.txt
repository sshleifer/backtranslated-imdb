Although I cannot claim to be a comic modern book, I have read my part, so I think I am part of the audience of this film, and I'm not discouraged. It does not run to the steam close to the end, approaching increasingly thought, and it looks like Lena Olin, one of my favorite partners, remained on the floor of the cutting room. Also, a little bit of Blue Raja of Hank Azaria could go for a long time. Still, it is easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have a film that is very fun. All employees seem to have an explosion and their roles, especially William H. Macy as a direct-arrow, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike others, I've got the structure of the city to make joke even funnier. I also loved how the disco was the music of the bad choice; somehow, it was appropriate.
