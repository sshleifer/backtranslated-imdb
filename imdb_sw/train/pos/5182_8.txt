Movie quiet, sweet and beautiful how to deal with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all the memories and current distress and sadness with you. Movie that makes you feel good. All links here: old jelousy, rival, friendship and trust. Unfortunately, the fridge-night raids and other fun activities that we all remember from our summer camp. All actors have a weekly opportunity to get this experience again as a former camp leader now retired and wants to meet children from the golden age of the camp. They are all now in their thirty-middle years of their work.
