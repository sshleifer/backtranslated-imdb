The best manifestation of one of the wrongs of the time. I liked the picture - very suitable for the story connecting to the picture novel. I thought Tom Hanks was very good at this, he got very good as a man who was hard at his job (which he did not choose to himself personally) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. He does the best he can see that happen. You don't want to destroy the plot - but you see this film if you're a person who wants more from a movie than usual to shoot 'em up format / gangster format. (It's violent though.)
