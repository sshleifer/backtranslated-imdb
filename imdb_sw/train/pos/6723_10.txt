Giant Riding is an amazing movie. It shows how these people lived just by surf. Their lives were primarily to use, live, breathe, and have fun. They didn't care about money, work, girls or anything. For them the waves were their girls. I have never been on the surf board, and it seems very hard, I don't understand how it can stay on them, it doesn't mean anything. This is an amazing movie and if you like to use it regularly you should see this film. If you are a surfer and want to know who started to erase, how it entered into life, which is very popular or what it is, then you should see it real. It can be a document, but it's very good.
