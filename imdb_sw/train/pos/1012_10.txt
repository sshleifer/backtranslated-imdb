Stargate SG-1 is a spin off type from the 1994 movie "Stargate." I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. The show is rolling from the very first place, Jack O'Neill's army should go through the door once again to meet his former colleague, Dr Daniel Jackson. Through the first two events, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow a man to walk on it, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, sympathetic hero who mocks his false god and joins the team. Evil people are called Gouald, it is a parasite that can be inserted into the human brain, thus controlling them and doing evil acts. Anyone who has a large amount of power is often seen as "the Master System." Gouald's retired workers are called Jaffa, who carries the bacteria of bacteria into their bodies until Gouald can be inserted into the human brain. Through these events, we can see SG-1, a research team included with Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, passes through the soil that takes them to another planet (this called Stargate) and meets new cultures or bad ones. Some parts are in the world, meaning that they do not pass the Stargate once in that period and instead of dealing with the top issues in the world. Over the years, you begin to see the decline of SG Teams 1 locked around, and more lines of character building stories. This, in turn, has even more meaning in the worlds, which is quite understandable. My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although many of these show good, there are some cases of story lines not always getting lids and under stress on travel a few years changed. But still, it's not about science fiction!
