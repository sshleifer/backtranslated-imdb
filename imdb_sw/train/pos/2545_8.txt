The Invisible Ray is showing the best of all Boris Karloff's talents and Bela Lugosi. Karloff removes unnecessary performance as a distracting scientist and a collision who seems to have made his scientific achievements before his relationship with others, even his wife. His man is already missing as he becomes a paranoid. Lugosi has a surprise expert, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain a good relationship with everyone, but it still seems to have no real friends. This was one of his few responsibilities as a good man and plays very well. It's hard, yet to hear her feelings and believe she is French. The biggest problem with the movie was that all that depends on the "science of junk" but, by the way, even the junk science works well. Since the ideas and theories are quite idiotic, they are like "important" today as they were when the movie was made. And they are also the front-reach and will always be. This is a very interesting movie to watch again and again. I saw it maybe 5 times at the weekend and I could easily sit five times more. Acting is amazing and science is amusing. I strongly recommend.
