What this great gem is. It's an odd story that is fun to watch. Yes, it is singing, but it is very good in the story and it is a sound hearing hearing. It was very good to see; I enjoyed it from beginning to end! Movie takes place in England during World War II. It's about a pupil of a student who wants a missing part of a spell that he needs. He uses the evil "magic" of transporting his children and three children under his care to different places of access. They join their teacher, who is surprised to know that lessons from her school really work! Even though special effects may seem to be a little dated first time, once you try them they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the film won Oscar for these effects! The video is both innocent and fun - and it is difficult to love interesting songs. Anime is awesome interesting. I think anyone at any age can find something to love about this film.
