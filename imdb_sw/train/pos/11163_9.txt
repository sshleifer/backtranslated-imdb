I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the film form, his film has been sometimes in my opinion, ignored. But this film is a favorite of mine because it gives you a feel during the film. All the wonderful characters that were present, life, way of dress, the way they said, Well they can be salty, but it is good to know that there was an occasion when two men tried to overcome fraud. I just felt it was the same history that should be absorbed by many people and respected for the truth. Can I find somewhere on the DVD? I just saw on TV. But for anyone who wants a piece of live life about the same time period is perfect.
