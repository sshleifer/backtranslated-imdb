Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not intended to be a demon-like Lamberto Bava even talking about it in the Sheirk Show DVD interview, but it was called Dheons III to be part of a series of demons. Music in Demons and Demons 2 was the rock music of 80 this time is an interesting music and the first two had a sense of horror Demons III: The Ogre is afraid of such architecture that's how David III is wrong with demons but I still like the film this. The music is interesting and enhances the sound for the film which the film is installed, The Ogre is something else I like the film. There are two other films that are counted as the Sacrifice III and that is the beast (Demoni 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demoni III: The Ogre is a good film as long as you can't compare with Demoni and Demons 2.
