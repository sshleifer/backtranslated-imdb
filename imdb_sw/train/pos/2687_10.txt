No other movie has made me feel like this before… and I don't feel it. If, I don't want my money or when I wait to watch this film (9 months) or I don't feel about spending two hours of the summer sun to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is because it doesn't matter how hard I finish my brain I can't just seem to come up with a word in all seven languages ​​that the movie was available to make. I don't know what's going on all the time and half way through the movie I needed to miss. No movie ever done this before. Never in my life I wanted cauliflower, milk, and baguettes this amount. Thank you. - Ed. * Cancel throat * No words. No ideas. I don't know. I don't know the truth. - Chait
