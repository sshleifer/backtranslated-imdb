I lived at that time and I think the program got the heart of that era. I think it should be dealt with more than Afro America but I think it needs a lot in the app. It was scary to sit and watch the protests on TV hoping they were not going away from your family and that you would not be burnt. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a good job showing the vet back from war. I went to school with boys who returned. Some had changed more than others and others were not so much. I am worried when someone says that the issue is not covered enough or did not attract entertainment. Live through and then comment. I thought the movie was good and that everyone in it did a wonderful job. Thank you for the journey (sad and good) under the memory line.
