Similar story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick relative who lives in the state government. He decides to make a trip on his lawnmower if he can not drive and wants to make his own rip. The film shows his journey and life he touches on the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth returns for good performance like doing all the others, especially Sissy Spacek in good performance like his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but very serious role. <br /> <br /> At first I heard that the story of the old geezer trip around the country would be light but soon I found that Lynch and all the knowledge in human life makes this movie I recommend to anyone.
