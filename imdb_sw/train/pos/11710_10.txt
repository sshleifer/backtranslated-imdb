Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins could shake the world of the Christian subject (and make millions in the process) and the books of LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Photo, the Christian film distribution company of Billy Graham's preaching, gave us this good job. What I love so much about this kind is the extraordinary attention to detail, sitting in the bedroom. Instead of taking us to the great events of this "after the rapture", we sit in the bedroom, hearing about the news because the filmmakers cannot show it. The cluster of the film stands at Pre-Millenial, before the eschatalogy repression, believing that Christ comes immediately to take the secret of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What was so disturbing on the top now makes me laugh. The exciting adventures of Patty and his trips in all the stress (and two of the three sequels of three films) describe his amazing story of unbelief and subsequent destruction. I did not agree, but I still enjoy watching this. It even has the SAME EXACT logo of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I am the only person in the history of doing the investigation.
