I've found this film very good in all areas. Acting was a talent from all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's behavior gets smarter and more psychologically developed by minutes. The program is interesting though, this film is more to play with the mind among the main characters and how Catherine continues to write to her in a new way and lose to her novels. The layout was also extraordinary and the whole state of the movie was wonderful, exciting as a jewel. Go see this movie now, it should be better than what it got from the audience, which was lost by the worst reviews about the movie (Before it started) ..... You can't regret it, if you're going to see it ...
