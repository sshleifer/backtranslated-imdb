As I watched this first, we borrowed from our nearest library about a year ago and looked at it three times. We have looked at it and I loved it more than I did at the end I could look at! :) :() This film is about two dogs named Charlie and Itchy (used by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half of the gangster and half of goodie, which I love. Itchy is its sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and taken to heaven. Charlie comes back, it's the start of an amazing adventure. The main five reasons why I know all about this film: One: I love characters (except Carface). My famous three are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I like the history of the period in which this film is installed. Installed during block in the United States. Third: Animation Don Bluth (as usual) is good. The situation is also good. Fourth: There is a great excitement in this film that puts me on the edge of my seat. Five: Songs in this are beautiful. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, throat, happy" .......... So, look at this beautiful movie when you can, you can't despair! :); ()
