I didn't have much hope, and, being honest, I didn't like this film for the first time but I look again and I realized it was cool. Indeed, it's a single joke film but it's a funny gag. The person who says that it could be better and could be. I think this film was likely to be my Pastor Vinny on. But to host a panic instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately it is an opportunity to be lost. For a little more writing can be classic. Children do not work because there is no reason to consider Elvira. In addition to clear reasons. It would be good to see their relationship growing. I know it's comedy but it is a little different that distinguishes a good film from a brilliant. Elvira himself is always happy and engaging. Don't mention flirty. Every time she wonders you too. It's hard to knock the film when the main character is charming. And in fact it's its charm, don't let the woman be stupid to you in thinking that she is a type of tart. Well he is. But he is good. The type of person you would like to watch your children. He cannot allow them to cook them, though ... <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend giving them. <br /> <br /> Just not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She's more than a very big seob of boobs. He is also a wonderful pair of feet.
