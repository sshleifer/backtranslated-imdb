I think most viewers missed the fact that this is obvious to the western film. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film - it's a wise language in the cheek to take west. I do not believe this film will find itself in a short time. What makes this film very unique is the fact that the 4 strong, beautiful women, two black, one Asian, and Mexican character / Puerto Rico. These are not your ordinary western women - they are tough - they can draw fast and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They are very difficult even the bartender trembles when he is whiskey of them. The plan that causes this story together is common in the west - in the vein of "you hit my brother - so I'm gonna get you!" revenge for the group that did so. It goes and around its old cronies from its bank to steal the day. One of them, Maria, is not all who want to take revenge on Rachel's sister, but she is attracted to the truth there are gold and decoration that is hidden in the city where they may go. There are several instances that are not quite meaningful, not too much interfering, can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So the film could be a little enhancement, but above all, this is a well-designed film that failed to find the audience who realized what it was. My only exercise is that alone in the film is the villain - the "heroines", one is definitely direct, the other sexual orientation will never be revealed. Stars / Stars 7 Stars
