Leonard Maltin must be watching another film. (Although I have found his Guide to be a useful resource, please do not suggest his opinion on this.) He says "starts well then fizzles" when actually is reverse - "begins tepid then gets hot". The program is about as simple as you get. Happy Mother, Happy Father and Son Happy to take a vacation on the beach alone, Father was injured in an accident, Mother runs for help, meets a runaway case. Mother tries to deceive the guilt in helping while Dad is waiting and depends on the life of the partners. Beautiful white-knuckler was given jolt lightning by Ralph Meeker, a sudden appearance (director, John Sturges, film in a way of wisdom that will make you open) almost half by crime, despair of despair. Meeker is an ordinary actress, ignorant (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and he happy snatches the keys of the film details and speed away from the top down. His character has a tendency to eliminate children and say "Pretty neat, huh?" when he is particularly interested in his mistakes. There is a funny break in action when they get a flat tire and he largely teaches his captives, Barbara Stanwyck, "Don't go". He burns back "Where will I go?" (they are in the middle of anywhere) and knows sitcom-ishly "Yeah, that's okay". The clash between them is hoot. <br /> <br /> There are errors, some ignorance. There is one area that the police, who have evicted Meeker for some time, have stopped Stanwyck's car and avoided detection Meeker puts his head on his shoulder as a man who likes to say, and pretends to be asleep when asked. A. He is obviously not a husband in this regard and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to sleep while meeting the law enforcement will undoubtedly doubt. It is still a strong excitement that builds an exciting and interesting conclusion. <br /> <br />
