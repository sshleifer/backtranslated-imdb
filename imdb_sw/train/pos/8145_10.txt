I saw this film first about 4 years ago and I expected something unusual, like CB4. I was hit. I was under a laughing butt off my movie this very great. Better way than CB4, characters, songs, conspiracy, everything. The most up-to-date image that was given "Thumbs two UP" and Siskel and Egbert (and if two white white people can understand humor in this flick, you know it's good).
