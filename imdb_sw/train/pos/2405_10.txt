Wow, I can't believe I am the first and only one to write comments on this great film. Even though the movie itself seemed to be interesting enough something real interesting to me and this is Matt lillard, he gave many people probably thinking he is also caffeine fun or just sucks open but we're both the same age and from The same generation have seen this guy often that he is one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he is a big shot and a great star like on SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. <br /> <br /> Baiscally this is a story of your usual heist story but with more twist than anything, which begins to get worse. It is also very important in this film is another famous actress named vincent D'onofrio, the lowest person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a stranger and not very bad though you know they employed her especially for her talent and nude area =) <br /> <br /> It is a game of jack vs jill vs bob if you want to harvest a reward but share with anyone. They all try to find eachother killing another and are saabb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true ability as JAck planned who initially begins all the deal. Vincent and woman plays artists who need money from lack of business. Vince's behavior is a bit of shock and skitz in all the film but it only increases the size of the film. The left and right surprises are welcomed well and the end is invincible and makes you happy, maybe it depends on the type of end you like. This movie has been my favorite rather than Matt was in it, it's a good movie and I would strongly recommend to anyone who loves movies. Critic does not like this film, but they don't watch movies that cause the movie anytime.
