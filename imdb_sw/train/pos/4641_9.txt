Eytan Fox made again: move the heart of the viewer in a common story to be done with a great mess. The film also succeeds in fully describing the state of the wonderful city which is Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there last month with all openings: life, relationships, heart- blowing the city, aggressive, chock of mindsets delivery of heart in the heart more heart, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> Recommend the most: it is a journey of heart and mind, and an interesting view to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: There is a great gay field in the movie. If you don't think you're also gay-friendly, be ready to be challenged and eventually see as "just love". (and don't worry: chick is hot too!)
