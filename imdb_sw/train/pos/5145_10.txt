An older man works as a caretaker at a mental hospital to be near his sick wife there and try to take him out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of silent and unusual era in the history of Japanese movies. The long-term concept has been lost, the publication was found in the 70 years and the sound music was added to them, suitable for the image. It may have been caused by the cabinet minister Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed he did not see the German film). However it is increasingly in style and in its persuasive (and interesting) trend that depicts the intellectual state of the detainees. In order to achieve this, the film uses all the existing films of the existing film: the release of the most out-of-the-way view of view, the cameras protection of the cameras, quickly and slow motion, expression of lighting and good quality among others. It is also a very complicated film to follow, since it has not been heads. The movie opens with a rainy rainy summit to strike the windows of hospitals, wind turbines and thunderstorms. The unstable weather situation describes the state of the patient's mind and prepares one of them: the former player. A mixture of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as music that encourages dancer to find hard, close to dance. In another sequence involving the patient involved in another complicated dance, he is seen by other prisoners. Most of the player's comments represent the views of the patients and their perception of a confused world. These are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent patients' understanding and the "Sane" world view. 3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3/3 words
