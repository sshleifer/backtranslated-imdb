I almost did not lease this because of all the wrong views but made anyways.I thought it was similar to the dark falls which I also liked. The only part I hated about the tooth of the tooth was the red brother's neck at the gas station. They were funny and talks made me laugh but this was not comedy. It destroyed a little movie for me because it was not necessary. Some of the movie was a way of fear or a film to be supposed to be. Decisions were good and I found the worst ways of movies then this. It was a simple story and acting reliable. In the DVD there were some movies that were all good looking and I would look at them.
