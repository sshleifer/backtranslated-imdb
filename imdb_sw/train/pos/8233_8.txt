Fido is a story about skilled zombies who have been taught to serve the human race. They all fall off, although Timmy's little Fido's Fido is eating a neighbor's family. Since then, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but somehow, disorder) occurs. Many of the people treat their zombies equally, with the same character that sleeps with his zombie (a very funny part of the movie, if not too disturbing). And we find Fido's love whatever he can do. This is a very wonderful and unique film, especially for a variety of zombie. Also probably one of the most violent zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I strongly recommend people who are looking for something interesting and different. I exceeds this 8/10. Rated R for violence associated with a zombie
