My rating means the first 4 season of Stargate SG-1 which is wonderful, creative and interesting. When cast through the gate, you did not know what was on the other side! Starting around the 5th season, the show took a different direction - it is still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of the human team (and one visitor) who regularly enters the plane of the planet called "Stargate". The back row of the series is attributed to the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" which the device is discovered during the archaeological digging in Egypt. <br /> <br /> Events are light (innocent and easy to look) and very creative. Many of the myths of innovation can be easily made in the beautiful sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next did not predict every time. The characters that the show are resting are also well defined and are transparent. Their voice is bad, but the discussion is described with wonder and humor. They are just happy to watch. Starting from somewhere near the 5th season, the series began to turn into a continuous story focusing on fighting one enemy (Goa'uld, then Ori). The plots are becoming more difficult (more political / strategic oriented) and interaction. The characters were still older than at all but the show was different from nature. One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the events that were recounting 100 and 200 events. They can never be shown. They show the creation of creativity and wonder that you performed consistently through the 10th season. If you would like to change the story lines between the opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of expectation.
