I must admit that at first, I was kind of watching this film. I thought it was this stupid, small, romantic film about a French woman who meets a car in the United States and decides to visit Vienna with her. I wasn't very happy about this kind of script, as it kept making me believe it was just a movie. However, I watched it! And I was surprised ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that you want to talk through philosophy, asking themselves about the fact that during our birth, we are sentenced to die, or that the idea of ​​middling that the fact that couples should rest together forever , or that, we, human beings, we can afford to sometimes live in story stories. The last choice was amazing (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six, at Vienna station) - with our expectation, we sincerely hope. The actors did very well, so, that, I began to believe that I, could live a love story like this.
