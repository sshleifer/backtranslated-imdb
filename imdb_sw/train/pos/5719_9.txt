If I have seen a lot of IMD comments, some viewers seem to want that every movie they see has good mental fields that enter into their cunning. I'm not one of those people. If I watch the action film, I want to see explosions, guns and heroes. If I look at the comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You get an idea. So watch the awesome movie, I especially want to be afraid. Raw is a very frightening film, in both well-painted pictures, and it's exciting pictures. I have been a fan of awesome films for many years, and I am talking about masters like Dario Argento, instead of some directors of some of the stunning small printed publications published these days. If you want to be scared, look at this film. The worst way than the original 'Tap' (which I think is also a good film).
