Well this film is as good as I said but you really need to look at it if it's worth the hour. It's about two boys Mac and Sam who are good friends and they work as fashion photographers and when you start laughing when Mac (Akshay Kumar) begins to collaborate with 3 air servants at the same time leaving his wife. Sam gets lucky and almost forget his friend but not quite. But Mac thinks so and so begins dating with the air hostess. there are garam masala at every stage of the movie, rock songs but somethth missing. Comedy is not on the score and deserves the prize. It's good but not all of the best. Some people laughed until their pain was struck but they didn't deserve many to laugh. But in fact everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie you are welcome to do so.
