This film has a special place in my heart, as I got the first time, I was teaching adults to read and write. It was very real to me and even the best student I had at the time. There are instances that make you feel instant, and those who put a smile on your face through a copper identification and characters and their status. Good performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro who have their best work, a great return to Martha Plimpton's little, interesting story line, and a haunting music mark makes fun and fun experience.
