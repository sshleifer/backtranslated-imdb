I just hit this film on TV one day. It was in the middle of the day at the less-known center for a good film. This, however, had nothing less and good. Oct / Sky October tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a young man led by the launch of Sputnick to be a rocket scientist. She and her friends start building shells. His father should not be happy about his new children found by hobby and instead to see him as a coal farmer as he or go to a football scholarship as his brother. <br /> <br /> Story is well written. Little also can be predictable, but that's the same because it doesn't focus on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but this is definitely the inner step, the action between the characters takes into account. Stories are good. It has clichés, but that's the same. It depends on the fact of the fact that it kind of can not stop only these clichés. The characters are very beautiful. Where the story is about descending characters are brought out and manage to set the stage and high quality of the film. You know these characters and find compassion for them. Well written and reliable. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. Set and 50 style is complete and the images are well composed well. This all places a great film. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal offers good performance like Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is as good as John Hickam. For others lost they are also good. Together they make a very powerful cast. All in all I am glad I got this movie. It was the first time I saw that I learned that it was the basis of real events. If I knew that when you saw it, it would probably be more interesting. October Sky is a beautiful and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's a kind of movie that feels good. Not so bad!
