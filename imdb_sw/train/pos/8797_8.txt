The main thing: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talking about the stranger (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman is doing a very good job, while Burkina Faso's film was a good surprise. However, the Israeli film was so bad, and the Mexican boy, well, should stop leading and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
