Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael's Bay for 40 years and years before. And I mean that in a good way, for I am definitely not Bay-hater. His movies are just a high-quality entertainment, such as Raoul Walsh movies were in his day. <br /> <br /> "Goodbye Jim" is a very good entertainment. In addition to the first class director, it also has a first-class, and Raoul Walsh who regularly leads Errol Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What a surprise is how matches match matches on the screen. They used a very powerful camera function, which also made promotional and exciting games to watch, and to fight the final championship against John L. Sullivan as the last thing. <br /> <br /> Biopics's '40 and earlier on the clear were still very different from biographies that made this day. Modern text often magnifies his main subject and shows his life from the birth to the death until everything, especially emotionally, in the middle. The former 'biopics' took place just like the movies that were not available and real people of life, which also means that filmmakers will often use the freedom of creativity and personality of the main character and events that happened in his / her life. This film is also not just a biography on the story of pigs but it also creates a beautiful picture from the time when illegal illegal strikes entered the modern boxing. Errol Flynn is doing a great job to show the real life striker James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not so many people are known but Flynn did a real job acting in 40 years, which this movie is one. Fysicaly also appears in the top frame. It also looks very different from the way without a small mustache mark on this film. The film also has some good participants and a good agent. <br /> <br /> A great and enjoyable movie that still lives very well today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
