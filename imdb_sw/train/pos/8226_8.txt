We are talking about a small budget film, and it is understandable that there are certain weaknesses (no demolition: one expert suddenly and one worthless expert); but in general the story lets you be interested, most of the characters are proposed and there are some original conditions. I like the movies that surprise you and other people who don't want you to believe and then mislead and return to the plot ... I enjoy this one for that. If you know what I'm saying, try also to see "Nueve Reinas" (What Queens) films from Argentina.
