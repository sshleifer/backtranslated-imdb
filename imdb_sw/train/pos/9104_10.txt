Well I disagree with other sent comments. Piedras are better for Magnolia or other films mentioned. especially about non-real characters, I think someone has written that just because he never lived in the Spanish community as I did (and not Spanish), it's a very real film with real, well-made actors and one of the actress The best of Spain Antonia San Juan. It is a European film against America's films, well we different societies, private I do not like the most modern American films (I love the old films and some of the American Andy movies but very few). What? The film on the ongoing Constitution of man, loved or not we all make mistakes but others can learn about mistakes.
