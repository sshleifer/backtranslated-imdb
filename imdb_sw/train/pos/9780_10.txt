I saw this film on the BIFFF festival in Brussel, spring 2004. What a wonderful thing! This German production, a stylish and thoughtful shock, is one of the worst things I have seen. Warning: this is not a joke! This Terrorizer has a huge scope of good actors (for example, Peter Martell as the head of Europe has a great presence), a good direction, a good production pattern, a very good sound and a lot of heavy burns as a film of Italian fear in eight years. The meat descended on the bone ... and the blood comes red ... this savage Heart Heart will find you ... and give you a black dream dream ... you must see-!
