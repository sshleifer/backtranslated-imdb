This movie looks amazing. He cares if he can act or not. Each area is a work of art included and brought by John Derek. Places, setting structures, and clothing work best to describe what is found in the story of love, beauty and wealth. In other ways I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this definition cannot be completed without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as a father, counselor, partner, and exhibition of man, man, lost during the time men were men. There are some of us who are valued in the strength and direction bound for the courage that contributes to a sense of confidence, content, and security. Yes, they don't do people like that again! But, how many times do you get women like Bo Derek.
