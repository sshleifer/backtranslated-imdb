"Independence Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historic account, a story of a hero, and an insight into the cultural history of a major event in history. It is not just Denzel Washington doing a very tough work of a brave, inspiring, well-known, Steve Biko, but gives a message to the public on the fears of discrimination of South African racism. Biko's story, the most influential leader, and his great "influence", Donald Woods, is one of the heart's heart. But, the ultimate success of his life can exceed the evil that has been done in South Africa. "Liberty" can communicate with his audience a positive aspect of a conspicuous plot. It is because of such a beautiful film, that the public can be educated on horrible events in history, the great leaders who wanted to complete it, and how we can never allow it to happen later. Because of this importance, "Freedom of Presence" is a wonderful film that should be seen by all.
