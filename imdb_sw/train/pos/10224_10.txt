... and I do mean it. If it is not true (after all, I haven't seen any film ever done!), At least, clear, among those, many that I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The fingerprint and IMDb is this: other movies are very tested (for example, the Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korea-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be very serious. But rarely the film worth watching is actually rated under 6. This movie, very valuable to watch, is. It's a shame. True, I give 10 in the demonstration. The movie is not perfect. His true rating should be 8 or 9. You have other restrictions (Belafonte exactly), the script circles, sometimes. However, we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, Czech Jan Kadar, leading two full-time administrators, loved ones, much older than Zero Mostel and Ida Kaminska good in acting / poetry / poetry. Pair made in Heaven! It is true that this film, a little wrong, is not recommended for ordinary viewers, but those who want to look better (when, again, no more than the opposition) movie of an unknown director who gave us "Shop on the highway" (the best movie on the Holocaust) should not lose this because only the IMDb rating system determines that "American Beauty" is better than "Angel Levine". It is not.
