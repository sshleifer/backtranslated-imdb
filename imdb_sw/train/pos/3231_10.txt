The soldiers are not a great movie, and everyone hates it has many good reasons. But I loved the soldiers, because because my expectations were so low that what I saw was amazing. <br /> First, the direction of the art is bright and sharp. Apart from returning to science science, the soldier was doing things with more design then 90% of the kind. The sets, clothing and preparation were consistent and effective; I didn't like their future military style, but I was impressed by the effort. For me, this has caused the movie when you should watch. <br /> <br /> Second, I am a fan of Kurt Russell. I was looking at this young man in some of the most unfamiliar movies of my youth ... Barefoot CEO and his film John Carpenter. Soldiers are basically a movie action, and the role of Sergeant Todd is a key hero action. It is not the responsibility of winning the prize, but Kurt is concerned with a positive influence and very good conversation. Third, the fight against the war is good. This is not a metal monkey, or even a stomach, but again, it is more than the average level of quality in the genre. If you haven't seen it, and you love the sci-fi movie action, take it if you are going through your selection area. Do not expect the next Bladerunner.
