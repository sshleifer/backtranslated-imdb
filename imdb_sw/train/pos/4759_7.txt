A small piece of Nifty played especially for laughing, but for a clever dollop of doubt. Somehow Martian has gone into a broken bus through the way, but where is the passenger, (talk about your illegal migrants!). All stars supporting the cast, from Jack Elam (wild shamelessly), to Jean Willes (if he is Martian, then I say we open the limits!), With the face of the violence John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), with known as John Archer and Barney Phillips (with good changes from Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It makes half an hour of entertainment even if the action is closed with one set.
