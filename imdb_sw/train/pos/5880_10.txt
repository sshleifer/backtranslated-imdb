in contrast to the person listed above I felt that this film was really true in events there was a lot of mixing. I do not want to conspire with stories of stories to people who have not looked at yet but I will say that Paresh Rawal has no great role as old Priyadarshan movies, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal is doing a wonderful part in the little role given to him, John Abraham is doing well, Akshay Kumar has proved that he is not down in this film as he was with Waqt and near all his movies after Andaaz. Although all three heroes in this movie were in the beginning they did a good job of acting particularly Nargis who is very good and warm. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie you must look at.
