My innovation of the film Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to the entire Czech animation culture, which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. Skip it is one of the best, most interesting movies I have ever seen. Potter rises up with its water. Then it goes around to make a pot. But it comes with a big hand breaking the pot and asking that the composer make the image itself. He gives his hand, but soon he returns and puts him in prison on a plane where he is forced to strike a stone. He puts it on him, losing his fatigue, but finally fills the job. In the mysterious metacinema chain, the composer uses the lights to burn his visible puppet rows, which keep him going, and running away from home. He restrains and is killed by an accident and his beloved partner falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hide the truth is a clean animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be true (why?). Hand, for example, is clearly a man's hand in gloves. Everything else is soil. Power is seen and is part of the description, making it a forerunner of the Movie Power. The atmosphere is normal: the hand that followed after a little gold could bring more fear into me than many awesome movies collected. <br /> <br /> Movie is obvious but avoids being completely manipulative for its simplicity. is a story about artistic freedom and injustice that cannot help win the heart and mind of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
