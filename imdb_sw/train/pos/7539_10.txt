I am glad to see this film. like many people who watched it. I didn't know I was getting it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very good actor and has made many funny movies; that is, sister does. But this was not interesting. is a drama and a comedic time. so if you are looking for a shock shock then keep looking. This movie is about a black family migrating from a neighboring area in the city to the middle class neighborhood. I would say more but it think it would damage the movie. This movie does not only deal with the competition between whites and whites, but also about relations with the black community. I think that is worth the space. if it is not your intention to see other films about the race relations then this film is not for you
