"Protocol" is a hit-miss-missed picture with Goldie Hawn as a cocktail cocktail cocktail who one night saves Arab life to visit from an attempt to kill. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job for the U.S. Government. What? Strong cities in our national capital will ever be the same? Hawn is as good as though the "Protocol" is not recommended as its best film "Benjamin Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I am very laughing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
