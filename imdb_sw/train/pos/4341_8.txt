Who do not have unintentional issues with parents? And are parents who have no problems to solve? <br /> <br /> I know, that seems to be heavy. But this is played by laughing in the movie, making the best comedy and best drama. I have been like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and though I was very worried that their star features could be too big for a small movie, I had magic from the first place. The most important of entertainment was to discover that the son makes about his father as a man. With Peter Falk's view of having a hard job, the father and the husband of the sacrifice was the perfect step of balancing. Without a well-functioning place, the film would have been very little, and the character is not very good. It has done well, Paul and Peter!
