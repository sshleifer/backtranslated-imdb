I saw this movie when I was a child. It struck me off. That was before the television days, so the movie of this size, could send a little child into orbit. I was so impressed, that I went to see this film for twelve days of the series. Special effects used during this time were far before 'its time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as was Rex Ingram like Genie. I found myself singing "I want to be a ship" for months after the movie left the city. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was like ethnicity if you would like to meet. Also, June Duprez did not love more than he was in this picture. Color was beautiful. Make this AAA film!
