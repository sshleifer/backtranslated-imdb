Seeing as Keifer Sutherland has my popular character in the history of TV, it was the original conclusion I was going to the cinema and using $ 15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans. The movie explores around that the secret service agent plans to kill the President. As the investigation opens, the only candidate is the most decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). To convict, Pete goes to a fun, refugee style, seeking truth. <br /> <br /> It is solid, but certainly not worth it. Cast in honor, a good story but helped me to hear a little, but you can certainly do very bad.
