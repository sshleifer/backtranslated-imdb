Surprisingly, I watched this film for the first time, 13 years after being released. It is a story that any father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a little 'wild,' another brother is a common old child. Craig Sheffer is too small as a big brother, but Pitt is wonderful, and Skerritt is fully beaten as a father. The incidence of fishing in Montana is quite amazingâ€¦ I did not know that flying fishing can be very interesting. The movie follows you close to the book, and only a few adjustments to make it more appropriate for the film format. Unlike the big book for film stories, this stands. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a night of stability and a powerful and emotional film.
