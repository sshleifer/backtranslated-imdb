Long ago, I watched this film from the center of the cable. I had been reduced to Mary Moronov. I saw him again in eating Raoul. I believed that she was the most hot woman on the screen. Maybe maybe I had an opinion on this film. 9 out of 10. <br /> This is the only movie I have on the original tape.
