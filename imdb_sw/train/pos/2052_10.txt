I don't have much to add to my summary, this film is coming up with Top Gun as one of the funniest films made when it doesn't try to be. I do not think it should be taken seriously when you seem to be very happy. I don't think it brings up Christopher Walken's reputation or if his reputation was gone anytime. . It has taken Pulp Fiction to revive from sleep he had entered. Like Michael Ironside, he has been in some very funny when he doesn't try to be a great film. Note Total, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget of this movie. The events and executives and explosions etc. are quite strange and obviously someone loved so much and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or I was like them because I love this film! If anyone who reads this look at the McBain (and I doubt it will be more) just know it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!
