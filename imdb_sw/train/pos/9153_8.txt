Finally I went around to see this after hearing great things about it. In fact it exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved was an amazing and well-designed film. The lack of money actually helped this film in several ways, mainly due to the plot. Like the Blair Wizard Project, this film was best to be beaten on the video instead of the film. Another Bonus: Although most of the most frightening budget films (even better) are struggling to do extraordinary work, this film actually had a good talent (except one or two characters), especially two guidelines. The only thing lost on the film was the original story. The most popular films known as "Rescue" and "Turning Bad" but if you are like me, these original films do not stop. Further, the director places interesting things around. I would like to be more interested in what the director will do with the big budget and I feel it will be a matter of time before we know ...
