Many fans of fear may have missed thinking this was a typical prison film and those who did not find it not like they did not want to see. The reasons mentioned above are the reasons given below but just ignore it and give it whirl if you're a fan of type. <br /> <br /> It has a good suit in all departments from the script and the sky to do with the prison itself. <br /> <br /> Diamond full, the film still have video until this day.
