Sexual romantic work from director Martin Ritt is not possible to come, but there is a time of happiness from the charisma of star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both). She is a widow who cannot move forward, she can not read and write and the closet of the closet - you can probably guess others. The advice of Pat Barker "Union Street" (the best head!) Is very high on bland, and the film editing is a mess, but it's still good; fantasy-colored blue-color. There is no series of major issues (even the reading and reading scope is a plot of plot for the story of the next love) and no real fireworks, though the characters are deliberately without color and heads are pinned under an interesting degree. Finale is pure fluff - and the worries will find it difficult to swallow - although these two characters deserve to be happy with the picture can not be satisfactory any other way. *** from ****
