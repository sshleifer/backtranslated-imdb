I had a uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the mental problems he had suffered after returning. So when I saw part of this film one night at the pay-to-watch station I was surprised. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt like he was ready for Vietnam. I went and rented this movie and told me it was the most heartwarming film I saw. I bought a DVD after the lease. The path that attracts you to many emotional directions is something I have never seen with any film. Apart from Vietnam's moving movies, I think it's better, although Platoon runs the second second. In addition to all of this, I think it is also the best performance of Colin Farrell as an actor. I love him in his many movies but in this he was wonderful. I paid this 10 rating because it was one of my five favorite movies.
