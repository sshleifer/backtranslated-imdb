This is a long lost and spectacular star by Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) by Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy but cheesy at the same time. It seems that three journalists (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) are traveling to Solvang, California to celebrate the festival when a mixture occurs with a hotel room and runs home to Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his wonderful wife Virginia. Vickie sits back, hearing the sick, like the other 2 like to open their story. He was recently murdered at home, in a very good and powerful way to hide in the ventilation system (he is decapitated by the closing of the vent if it comes to losing on it when he is being tugged and into the bottom). Quickly Karen returns and has been killed in a more brutal manner for having her face closed through a vent lid. Jennifer is fighting with her boyfriend (ex?) A partner in a small plot and when she comes home, her troops (which we have now discovered are brothers and sisters and that anything in the apartment is their child) planning to try to kill her too. Virgina did not agree with the Great Plan for killing Jennifer but has been going to the floor where she meets Junior. Here the film turns around the comic as Junior (shown hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a mental deficiency, mentally, man whose actions and motion causes a few chuckles even though it should be scary. This is where the speed of the film grows and the end is good. Employees / workers are doing a lot of work with the material especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach and although it is not a very interesting film that has made it very fun!
