Since I am a true brand of hip-hop and electronic music, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, though not "real" in some way as Wild Wild, is a film that is guaranteed to touch the heart condition of anyone boasting in the culture of the urban / musical music of DJ and the club-electro club. br>> <br /> Although I will admit that sometimes the discussion is cheesy, you can't help but feel for the characters, and finally "you want you were there" to the beginning of hip-hop culture in New York City in the last eight years. B-boy boy scene in the nightclub of Roxy (real life, real-time competition between Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just important for the fan's hip-hop documents as any modern album. See some of the attackers' actions in slow motion if it is possible to know the skill of the games and the style of B-girl / B girl. All statements from the Nation of Zulu!
