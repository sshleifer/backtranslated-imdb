Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been the best friends ever since and after their graduation they decide to take a trip to Thailand. As a result, they meet with a wonderful visitor who invited them to go with him to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene have missed the heroine of drug addiction and are sent to prison. Now is the time of the last life and true friendship. This was a very good movie, I have seen it several times and after a while you see it is a few holes on the compound but the movie is still accepted. Claire Danes did a good job, she is a good actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
