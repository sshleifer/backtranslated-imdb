Man, I love the new DVD that Universal has been given. I have never seen SENTINEL this beautiful appearance since I had to focus on VHS leather, parasites for years. Unfortunately no extra over the trailer which appears to be worse for wear. And avoid DVD's Goodtime at all costs. It takes. However, the style of worried style Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) goes into the smell of NYC brownstone, only is more than haunted. It is also a port of hell and the Vatican puts the blind leader of the blind (John Carradine) to look at it and ensure that the demon and the angel of the sky did not escape. This has all the full star full of old actors like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer etc ... with the next 80s star comingos including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (sound of who was more locked by Tom Berenger. And you can't recognize Jerry Orbach from Councils & CALL. I had to do twice to take when I was not quite a place where I'd like to see him before. <br /> <br /> Nice scenes of Alison's slicing eye and nose away from the dead body of his father that has become a property with the devil. And there is an appropriate end where the lost people try to accuse Alison of suicide so he cannot be second to protect the harbor. It seems that former Alison was worried that he makes the Vatican's candidate a second servant. <br /> <br /> Luxury 70, a wonderful classic from director Michael Winner which should not be lost. I also suggested for those who want something little more of the most common stupid ideas of young slasher and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> -
