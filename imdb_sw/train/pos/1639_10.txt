Good workers, a good environment, a real reality. I won't explain the views of all other consultants because you get a picture! However, the film is not squeamish. It is really the pigs to kill and other animals to survive. I also have a home book of Elinore Randall Stewart. I read it a few years ago, I must go back again, as I watched a recently released DVD, a movie. I tried to buy a video for several years, finally bought from a video store that has left the business. But Yippee! The DVD is now sold, I bought it on amazon.com. It's not cheap, but it's worth it to me. This is the film I will look at until the end of my days!
