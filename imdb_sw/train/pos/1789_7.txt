With his death, Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name "Harris" and remembers the 50th day when he was a favorite singer and traveled from New York to become a dignified maid of his wealthy friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) in Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) is welcomed by Lila's brother's alcoholic and stupid buddy (Hugh Dancy) on the island of Wittenborn in the sea and tells her that her sister is actually a friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), who fought in the war he is qualified in medicine. Later grandmother-to-acknowledge her true feelings about Harris to Ann. However, when Ann met with Harris, she has to crush on it and have a short time during one night stand when a disaster occurs with Buddy. At the same time, the daughters of Ann, safe and secure. The "evening" has one of the best women I have ever seen in the film, and the best performances. Like Mamie Gummer's amazing mother and Meryl Streep's mother is amazing and has a performance that honors her mother's name. Location, clothing, decoration, movies and sound sounds are also amazing. Unfortunately the plot was confused and I did not understand the message of this film. Why is reproduction very important in the story? Did Constance take place at Ann's night and Harris's position and would be his father? Why did Ann and Harris not stay together, if that person loved her so much when she agreed to meet them regularly in New York? What issues did Ann Ann solve after Lila Ross's visit? Was Buddy born with romantic sex or his love for Harris was brother's love? Why did Mars have changed his mind about the mother in the end? It seems that the authors of the screens or director failed since they could not feel and fulfill the beautiful story of love. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" ("In Eventide")
