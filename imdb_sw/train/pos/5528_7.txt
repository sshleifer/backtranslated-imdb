This is a very good film and almost reflecting - there is hardly any conversation in it, away from the details; with a brilliant sound and music. I didn't have to first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until I was told by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost a former kind of children's film, saying that children today prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc - but I feel that young people should brought more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does not. Perhaps it is not the best film of its kind but it is certainly the best and fun way for all ages - not just children.
