This is very well known so I can't get too much into it. The basic story is about two young people who know about the alien alien blob goo that arrives through the meteor. Communicating with humans and this pitch ball is burning through the body as acid. It also takes human bodies to grow. No one who believes the youth (Steeve McQueen and his partner) and when they finally do so it seems that the blob can't be stopped. It has been done well for its age and different and many other 50 drives faster speed. The story is very unique to do and it must be seen by any fan of old sci-fi movies and movies. If you can dig the gooey's cat's fear of 80s make sure you check the remake from '88 too.
