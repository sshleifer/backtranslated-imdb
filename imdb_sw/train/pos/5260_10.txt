Yes it can be fun and it can not be seen as funny as many budget comedies out, but this movie is hilarious if you really look at it. Tim Meadows always hit me like being funny off Saturday Night Live show. Whenever he would like to make this character on the show I would like to laugh. So after seeing that this would be playing in the Comedy Community one night I decided to explore. All in all I was very impressed with this film, because it didn't mean to win any Oscars or be a comedy of the year, but it was fun of Saturday's Night fans that love character Ladies Man. This film is also full of highly recommended verses that can read for years to come.
