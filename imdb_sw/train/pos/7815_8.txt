'The Voice of Freedom' is a movie about how people will go to find the truth. The first half is a fascinating picture of the impossibility of friendship between Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods. When the second half deals with Woods looking for answers on the death of Biko. Although most people prefer the first half of the movie that focuses on the potential relationship between Biko and Woods'. I got a second half of Don's fight with the story of Biko to be heard all over the world very interesting.
