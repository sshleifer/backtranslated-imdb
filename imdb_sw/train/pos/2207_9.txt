It is not a bad word to say about this true film. I've never been surprised at it but it grew up on me quickly. I love it very much and I think its shame that many people cannot see the fact that it was banned in some places, mine being one of them. The film released in the department of shock, gore and sky. The mark is a good piece of emphasis on providing materials. It seems just right that Chris Young continued to be one of the best writers in business. Acting in this film is a high level, if it is a small wood in a certain place, and the effects are real and true. All this is a great reputation for a good film of slasher in my book. I have noted in some reviews that the film has found a great flack with a shot of P.O.V's famous killer. And I ask: WHAT IS WRONG AND THAT? It is a classic shot that brings fear into any good fan type and it is good to keep the identity of a secret killer. The only thing that leaves this film to get the highest score in my book is that waiting for surprise (revealed murderer) is not being used for more services, it means that it just happens quickly, though good performances only make up the most reliable. Apart from PRANKS it is a good movie (though I like the original title) and its embarrassment which most people remove as a piece of cheap price. Its more than that, but only a few know that if it seems to be lost in the early haze of the 80s slasher. It's a shame .... Its very good movie people! Believe me!
