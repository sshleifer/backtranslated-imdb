This Documentary (Now available free of charge on Video.Google.Com) is an amazing display of the power of ordinary people to conquer evil. Everyone must see this. Chavez was chosen by a lot of land in 1998. Its platform was to turn the extraordinary wealth of oil from the mid-20% to poor 80%. He forbade foreign fishing fishing in Venezuela's waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to treat patients for free. He canceled it without reading and writing and introducing free universities. But it was his 30% tax on the benefit of the oil company that had troubled the Bush administration. In 2002, when Irish film actors, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain interviewed Chavez within the Presidential Palace about his social plans, the CIA clashes defended. For cameras around, Chavez was arrested and displaced. It was announced on a national TV that he had 'resigned'. But the poor of Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to the Palace in their millions and demanded Chavez to return. In the face of a very large number, military forces turned leaders and tenants to the United States. Chavez was saved by a military helicopter and returned to the fun.
