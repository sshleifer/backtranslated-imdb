This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's first films and only one of the traditional military movies that he caused. You can see its influence from working under Chang Cheh in this film. Work is good, fighting lots are conducted by Fong Hak On who looks like one of the worst people in the movie. It is a Wei Pei star of the popularity of "Five Venoms" and all faces of the faces are known for fans of the Golden Harvest crop and Shaw Brothers. The story line is amazing, there are a few of the emerging conspiracy to create characters and their relationship to each other is effectively done. This film has just released by VHS in the UK. The Asian media has released the DVD region and there are its versions on DVD available from the United States. The movie is good looking at either a native language or in English version dubbed. I strongly recommend this film.
