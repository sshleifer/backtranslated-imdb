This is one of the few views. Good writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone who did because they nailed the nails. Freebird has made me fun and laugh at my young people. The head was a great choice. Great movies, set, stories, sounds and characters. It flick the bike but it will be shy to the pit of the pigeon that way. Love for the bone, kinda like the Trailer Park in U.K. If you have never seen TPB, show if you like this film. You will love me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Assistant? It can be done. There is more to the world I would like to see through their eyes.
