The young woman comes to her husband's home after she died in an accident. He goes to sit down in this little town, but soon afterwards, loses his little son in kidnapping and all his hopes ... This can cause all the following types of plots in a common movie: find a new partner and have fun finally; or the grief of fighting and ultimately suicide ... He tries to take his own life, but not after a series of fierce battles, with God. He trusts in God, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even a murderer. Yes, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean anything to God. Ways in which movies are talking about it are quite interesting: not a woman's perspective or God's view (in this way, there will be so many grasses, flying clouds, I think). Instead, it is from the third party's eye, the film allows us to understand and it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The movie cannot be very interesting there is only a woman. There is this man everywhere around the woman and certainly likes him, but in his own way. He is a good man, as the clown I should say, who shamelessly depend on our heroine. The combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and throwing every day, and that man, screaming and talking in foolishness, ends up in a good sense of feeling: nothing wrong or very bad. Very much.
