In general, I fully agree with the audit of Ebert. For, I feel I should not comment because it is a very vet movie and I am not vet (I was an opponent). The advantage is that Martha is very poor and does not work regularly. I think it's that Stephen Metcalfe is a pastor himself and spent very little time planning on his behavior.
