Simon's carefully written talks are actually electric and Matthau and Burns. You can hear the script to lose. There are a few movies out there that can develop that relationship between administrators and script. For example, the most popular union area can be a lot of duller with less characters involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in the Odd Couple), and with all of the little idiosyncracies and his uniqueness that Matthau crams in character (line where he says that he is with it since he lives in the city where Lewis lives in the country which Lewis is "out of touch" is the quintessential model of this) to make this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any position, whether it is funny or a drama or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work well together; The difference they show accentuates Simon the superb knack for creating funny conflicts. This film is only one last "must-sees" and does not demand the prestigious right position in the pages of the film history.
