We have great expectations with this. . . because his 3 Application is a good official for Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . however. . . His co-led by Bruno Mattei (from the night of the zombies) and was not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and his shot at Phillimines as the Night of the Zombies and resembles the Night of the Zombies (Hell of Dead Living) a lot. The result is like a Hell friend of the Dead who are alive than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis produced Zombi 2 and his editor Thomas (?) And efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 his magic. . . Zombi 3 is not magical. . . it is like peanut butter and sandwich of jelly without peanut butter. But over the years, I have grown to accept Zombi 3. I can swear I saw a version where the soldier was hit by hand and went to the hotel room. . . there was Fulci-cut useless and Mattei / Fulci-cut is one on DVD.
