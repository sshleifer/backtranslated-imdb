I was also the first side in Toronto. This film was a kind of comfort when I thought I couldn't get in to see my first choice. Yes, I had been beaten up. When I got to the theater I could remember a little more than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I remembered who was in it.) A terrible show from the whole cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was the chief in leaving the truth from her days as the Trinity. For Billy Connolly, I think it's not since Chaplin has played performances carefully without any lines â€” even forever. Children also were great. No doubt check this one if you have a chance. And, on the way, I got to see my first choice however - and this was the best way.
