So, Fox dragged the mid-game tablets / festivals ... <br /> <br /> Do you? They expect us to invest our time in their new exhibitions when there is a real risk of never knowing what happens? Why not the rest, which was already shown in the United States? They were declaring elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! What? Listen? This was a good show, but it let us hang. If you come to play a new / secret game, at least the conclusion before you finish the theme of a sudden middle. Every time something like this happens (and it seems to happen with you - that is, Fox), there are more of those who "will wait and see" before investing their time. This means you will see part of the low interest, and it is possible to end the series. See? It is a bright rotation. Don't leave us again ...
