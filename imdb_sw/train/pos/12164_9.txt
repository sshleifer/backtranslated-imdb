In the year of the muck of pride as "Synecdoche, New York" film born out of own fun with Charlie Kaufman, comes a film that is difficult to watch but three times important. "Frownland" is a work of love with staff, executives and filmmaker, were beaten with friends. It shows someone who cannot speak through his real world of REAL, Brooklyn. The people you see are the highest even stylish movements of the "mumblecore movement". They are real people, bitterly beaten in their own neuroses, which cannot change. The real world of them is their set of fraud and because this is a film about people who don't know very much, it's very hard to see. It is a 16mm film without a good light, money or any other factor that could make the film "solved", but its credibility cannot be reduced, which would result in a room filled with people to finish and with Richard Linklater to award as he did in SXSW. This reminds the film as "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a film that is not for everyone, but one that plays you to watch and grow again and think about it.
