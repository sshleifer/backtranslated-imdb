'The great city' fans are happy! This first season of this series is now available from the DVD and I have recently received my copy! Although the piece of the piece of the core of the maverick 'CAPITAL CITY' gives us a different time for its first and second season when each team member has an important part in a peripheral or peripheral line. Combination of culture (English, Irish, America, German, Polish) of General Wendy Foley Traders (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) a group of employees are similar to their distinctive characteristics, interests and behaviors that help make unknown and, to many people , a typical business course of business is involved through a volunteer show. In fact, this young team of visible executives is strong against the staid rather than the former management of Shane Longman's management as represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Hawthorne Denys). I think that this unusual way of working as employed by the Wendy team was not true if it was not of the 'independent spirit' of emerging young Peter Longman had acquired his thirty share of the company from his father and allowed to have more trends, relaxed with modern business ways to become a reality. At some point Wendy's (led me to believe) the immediate administrator Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) follows the establishment of a traditional way of running the company even pleasing to Wendy rather than seeing him living in the 'middle' many times. The main focus in the series, I believe, comes from a romantic attraction between Declan's Douglas Hodge and a cool blue-fashioned German businessman Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell) which had a audience always wondered if the situation between these two colleagues it would have developed more than a close friendship / profile that they don't know to have. They expect to browse through this headline, and hopefully the second thirteenth season will not be too far!
