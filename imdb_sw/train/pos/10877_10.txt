I saw this movie with a group of friends and although only two of us left the movie as we thought about how cold it was, others laughed and commented on how foolish it was. Well it is because it should not be taken seriously, it is essentially a movie that laughs horrible fricks and works very well. It seems to have another film coming out like that too, um ... Awesome movie ?? Well this is Aussie, and original !!! Jessica Napier works best with Sarah Kants has a bright future in action! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good argument, and Kylie was the most beautiful argument. Impossible Princess was the Queen of the screen! I recommend seeing this flick, as you will think until the end of the relationship with Raffy, Hilary and The movie that has never been finished 20 years ago.
