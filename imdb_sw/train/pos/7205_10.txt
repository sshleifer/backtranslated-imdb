Death is not anyone. Who will do it first. It is difficult to describe this film without giving anything so I can't mention anything more about the plot. In addition to acting it is Cris Reeves a major role as Clifford, playwrite of the young. You see the great parameters in its ability to act in this film from "exhaling cheeseburgers" for fear. Clifford is responsible for playing and in the production of this step I have never seen Clifford played well at the end of the spectrum. Acting actor like a little puppy or homicidal maniac. Reeves is the only person I have seen who has the same character. For Michael Caine he ..... well he is Michael Caine. One of the best administrators of 50 years ago and in this beautiful film as she has ever been.
