I should start by apologizing because I thought that 75-80% of the first film was highly hilarious. It is because of Brad Pitt's performance. Keep up. <br /> <br /> Acting with all participants was very good but Brad stole the movie. The sky was perfect in all things. I'm not a big fan of Pitt but this should be one of its best responsibilities ever. <br /> <br /> Cruel, Honest, Validity. All the best words to describe this film. I was reading the preliminary review and someone said that the reason for the initial abuse is not clear. It is explained but thanks to it is not appropriate to go to a detailed description to get their point. Overall I gave this 9 because each area bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half or so is perfect for this film. Despicable.
