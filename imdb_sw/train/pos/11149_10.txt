Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides that he will leave his life in Texas and make it a bigger city. Women are there to ask and men are particularly "tutti-fruttis." With many eyes, he comes to New York City, preparing a series of misadventures of shame that finds, worse than the other. In the midst of the chaos, he meets with Rico Rico's "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless person living in a convicted building. <br /> There are not many stories like COWBOY of the Night of the Day are a series of vignettes that not only produced Joe Buck's plights in the City, but also reduces his time and shows us in the cuts of shock and semi-psychedelic dreams of his past: relationship his wife failed Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was imprisoned, rejected by her mother, and her apparent violence by her grandmother, who also had the habit of trampling people with money. The spirit of desperation leads the film close to the first time as Nilsson plays all the time of the opening of his illusion of "Everybody speaking"; we feel that even when we want Joe to finally make his mark in the City, the worst situation is high he can not end up working for pennies in the last-displayed job with a good shot from his outward looking point in the film as he looks at someone doing works as a dishwasher in the kitchen of soup through the window and sees it. We know from the perspective of his eyes he does not want to end up like this. The dark story of hopeless lost hope, John Schlesinger creates images of lost souls in the late 60's, and in the middle, the relationship between the two men when they struggle to make some kind of meaning to their lives while an extraordinary comfort of honorable life. There is a known idea that maybe they were loved - Ratso tries to hug Joe at the party's location and the end they embrace at the end suggests for this - but this is mainly a buddy film, one that will survive, in fact, to death, and bring some sort of hope for Joe who at the end of Florida looks very, modified, wise.
