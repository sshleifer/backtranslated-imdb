This animation has a good and straightforward plan and good and is on stage. What separates from another animation is how human movements live. It was very good to see a woman running around on the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were done well. Why don't they use this rotoscopic method more these days? Very good. Fire and ice, in the original form with women who were very dressed, volunteered to show a beautiful girl in trouble with various sexy ways, her powerful body that serves as a pure eyecandy. Others may hate this and see it as yet another male fantasy male sex, others (including many women) will adore the quality of the hatches. I certainly didn't mind! Bakshi just loves to love lushious, infants, as well as it can also appear in Cool World, and I don't think he should apologize for being a good animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and I have never forgotten. This was just a unique, unlike the Disney level or the original characters, and for that reason alone has a look at since it's most likely to be Bakshi. For those who make drawings with women of gravity: Try the Cobra Adventure Place too. I / I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
