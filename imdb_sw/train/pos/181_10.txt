UC 0079, One Year War is almost end. The non-side colonial colon is set aside by Cyclops, the Zeon task team. Their goal, the new Gundam was built exclusively for Newtypes (known as Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When the little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, meets Zaku after the breaks out of the colony, he becomes friends of Newbie MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. Two are good friends, Al is treated as a member of the team of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie works as the father of Al (whose real father works all the time) and seems to be taken by the trial of the Christina McKenzie Federation, but eventually they should meet .... in battle. Recently you learn that the war is not playing for children and Bernie must make the final sacrifice to complete his work. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a good show. Phone suits are well designed, and animation can look at dated but expresses feelings for characters. If you liked 0083 then look at this, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look at the show for the size and development of the character, this is one for you, focuses on that then the phone's suit of war. I would like to simulate the game level more than the action. <br /> <br /> Suit Suit Gundam 0080, War in Pocket. Sometimes you should lose win.
