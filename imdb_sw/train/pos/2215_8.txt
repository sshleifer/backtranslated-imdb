I have bought, "The Feast of All Saints," and not really bad movie, but many things can be much better. It had a great historical value, played by many talented actors / actors, and not a daily event that administrators can play that role and have some faith. There were some parts that were so humorous, but I can't say that the whole movie was awesome. Once you think about it, catch the New Orleans of 1800, and do something out of it, it's very difficult, and very difficult to find actors who can prove very much of those parts. But the only problem I have with the film was that many of the participants who have played free people of color, were many of the red Africans, not all in the world to throw out others who had no lighter skin; one of the old Portuguese weaknesses that still exist. Anyone who made casting can be picked up a wide range of hue, despite many creoles are colored conscious. For picking characters who seem almost white for, it may be more thought out. I saw the exhibition was widely believed.
