I saw a movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was good. In the movie theater surrounded by children who were on the spring break, there was a voice so I know all the children liked. There parents also seemed to participate. Death and definitely the death of the perpetrators brings the lids and the correct views. We hope people realize this film was made for children. So, it was successful though I loved it too. I myself loved Scrat!
