I gave this film 10 not because it is a very effective movie, but with its ability to stimulate sensitivity to its listeners. The fight against each other-woman-is very similar to now, but very small films have taken away from the heat and much honesty as The Color Purple. It also showed a distinctive side of African and American experience - indicating that after the slaves were given many freedom they fell in the "white" man who was hated and were scourging their own people. I see this important as it contradicts the black-and-black-and-winning trend-Oscar <br /> <br /> Also the work show is amazing - especially the Oprah who I now have a new respect for. You should watch - but keep some tissue.
