I used this film in the religion I had taught. Gold fish are swimming with joy in his bowl in the apartment top apartment. The little boy and his mother are away from home. The boy has been given money to buy milk. When he was at home, he left the hour of the game play. Next to him stands a man in black suit looking a little scary. The boy gives us a bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This place is changing and happening at home. Black cat climbs the fire and into the apartment. He (?) Gets a bowl of fish and looks at it. Fish swim with power and comes out of the bowl. At present, a group of young people in my class and I have fallen in love with fish. Cat catches fish in his mouth and we all hold a breath. Cat catches fish into a bowl. The two-story line includes a skeptical person in black and black cat cat. They all encourage discrimination. They are both innocent. It was the beginning of a good discussion in my class.
