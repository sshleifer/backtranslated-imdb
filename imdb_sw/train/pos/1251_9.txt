This document examines the story covered in the recent "Pillow" Pillow, published in 2006. It shows an amazing expulsion of Diego Garcia's inhabitants, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The inhabitants of the island are a British citizen, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, such as Mauritius, an island next to where the locals were relocated, were. But the British government has rejected their requests to return to their country, since the island is now a military base for the US army, who have used it as a base for Iraq and Afghanistan bombs. As usual, the Pilger vaccine is surprising, especially if he writes the treatment and poor living conditions of the people living on the island. All his interviews are best, and his parliamentary representative where he uses the Government's own information to charge him, becomes like one of the best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a wonderful construction to erase a series of recently published documents aimed at the United Kingdom's expulsion. Putting this photo and interview, and the island's music, adds film effects. It is not easy to watch, but the "Stealing National" is John Pilger's best. Recommended.
