I saw a two-year trip on the internet - now I have seen the film! What a trip! And it's a journey that you finally know Darius Weems! The way to courage, wisdom, wonderful and talented! And what a way! Listening to Darius laughing to be in the waters of the City of Panama, seeing his bravery to be very close to the fighters in Louisiana, strange in his eyes when he was riding on a hot balloon, the excitement of rafting through rapids, bet eating spoonful of wasabi and call home at home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are an example of power and courage. And members of Crew are a document for the heart of young generations. They got Darius wheelchair; wrote problems of access; they took Darius on his life journey; and they touched many lives, many. In addition to DMD's awareness and promotion of research funds, this film will help complete the final goal of Darius Goes West - DMD therapy.
