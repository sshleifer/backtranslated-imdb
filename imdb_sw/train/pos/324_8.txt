I didn't expect you to love this film as I did. I only got it because I saw it on the top 25 Films. It didn't look exactly. I was shocked to see that it was one of the most sophisticated films of recent records. It's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. He places everything of the information he gathers in a large memory. He tries to have sexual experiences, political activism, and human relationships. At the same time, film workers are shown to make films and we see their views on the story with each other. Fraud, open sex, and controversial politics made the film show in the United States when his victory for Customs was appealed. The film is a description but it is still a document that shows us the world behind the scenes of film authors during the description, the fourth wall is broken. This film is a direct way to make the film I saw. The movie works as a capsule during the 1960s psychedelic go, on freedom-fighting freedom of sex. I would like to think of that more than that. I don't think I would waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I actually do it. This film is a hidden treasure. Try.
