I saw this series when the world was released at the Toronto film festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two people met and told the director from each country to direct about 911 film. WARNING: SPOILERS HEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong, and some were controversial. If you are American, then you may not like this as some of the possible anti-america pieces. However, I know a few Americans who enjoyed this series. The piece I found best is from India. It was how the Muslim family, who lived in the Gentiles, had two sons, and one was not. Americans gave them a cold shoulder and directly thought that she was connected with terrorist bombs. It takes moments of despair and humiliation for these charges well, because it brought tears to my eyes. Finally we see that her son is dead while trying to save many victims from the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that's what made it real. There were many emotional and strong pieces, and a piece of Africa was one of the best. It was exciting but still has some power as others. It must look at everyone, and hopefully the United States will solve this, and play it in their country.
