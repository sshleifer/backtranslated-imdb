I am over 10 out of 10. Why? It provides insight into something that is not quite clear - surf surfers because they all want to do; Nothing else seems to be an important thing for them as to open; This is a short time - it's the life of these people. I've never surfed, but I love playing movies, and I've seen many. No one taught me what this film did * The movie was very good. It came well. Interviews were wonderful * It is interesting from beginning to end So 10/10
