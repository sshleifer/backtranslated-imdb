As the TALK RADIO, BORA is actually recognized (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened, THE BOOTH for - suppose - it's kind and laid the foundation). That's not a bad thing, in this case. It means, in fact, that film artists do not get at the end of the way they could have, they say, the American version of this story. GIVING goes to a decision towards its end, but it is very good for each level that one can enjoy a journey in a way that one can go on a routine trip through a journey. It reminds me of a short story of Harlan Ellison, FOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is, sometimes, close and attractive. Good value look good.
