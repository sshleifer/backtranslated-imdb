I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight. I must see the characters all around, because they left the impression in my mind which continued long after the end of the film. And lastly, now it is sad, well ... for a child of 7-8 years old. <br /> <br /> I got the opportunity to see this film again soon, and I saw that the plot was very simple, character, two-dimensional ... I think it's a kind of movie that you can just be guilty of a little child ... mercy ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this to all your parents ... (I saw it in the previous French version, so I can't tell you whether the translation is good or not.)
