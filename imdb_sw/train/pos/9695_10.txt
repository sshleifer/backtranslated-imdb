Some people can be called "Paulie" children's movie, but I would think it is more than that. Perhaps more than anything else, this film effectively goes to a long distance to show the problem of immigrants in the US - topiki given a recent discussion. Showing the pastor telling the Russian immigrator (Tony Shalhoub) of how he sought America for its original owners, the movie describes several stories. There is an old woman (Gena Rowlands) who is friends, then Mexican immigrants (Cheech Marin), and others. <br /> <br /> For all, it's a very good movie. I don't usually expect much from these types of movies, but this is treated. I certainly recommend it. It also plays with Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
