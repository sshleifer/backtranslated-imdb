I enjoyed this flick. I am confident that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are modern skills of our time. They are able to develop this level of ignorance for pop culture and make it bold but in reality ... if it makes any sense. This mainly makes South Park soooo funny. Once you pass the fact that maybe it's the worst and irregular cartoon ever, you can see in every message sent message. That's obvious in BASEketball. Although it is dominated by David Zucker and it is quite rediculous, it has a real message on America's corporate and embarrassing which is a great sports league. I am also a fan of games so I find this movie for time because it is true in this wonderful way that people hate to love. The opening program is brilliant ... tears from the form of laughter every time I see soccer players start Riverdance! Some may not like this film because it is not a cup of tea tea ... but, like South Park, when you look behind ignorance ... it has a real true message that is done through the real comic. I gave this 8 film out of 10 stars.
