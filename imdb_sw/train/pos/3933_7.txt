The problem of displaying one's real life is that performance can be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe the actor is showing that person. That's the main issue and "Mr. Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a sharp performance, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was like soft-saying if Fonda shows. <br /> <br /> This is an important drama court and little child Abraham Licoln forward. If this is not true, I don't know, but if not, why should I tell you to use Lincoln as the main character? Never worry. In the film, Lincoln defends two young people accused of murder. It is not very true on the film, and as a result, it seems to be empty. I wanted more development of stories and habits. Film is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like that. There are some minor cases representing Lincoln and the relationship that emerges with Mary Todd, but they seem to be higher. The role is good around, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just don't believe that Lincoln actually was that talked soft. True, he has a great voice when he needs, as he influences the weak lynch people to be prosecuted, but Fonda also shows Lincoln gently. Other exhibitions are strong though, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a beautiful woman who we can really feel. Simple and inexperienced, still very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. John Ford looks to think of this film as an epic, and during his release, perhaps it was. But, however, there is insufficient material to present it. <br /> <br /> It looks nice, but it's not classic.
