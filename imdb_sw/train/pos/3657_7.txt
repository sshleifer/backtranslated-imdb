This film is like the 1950s of Ettore Scola of Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Under sex with a minority origin, but a great story of humanity and heat. I will not call you this neo-true image. It is very interesting and more like a story story, and it should be a comedy, though it deals with major issues (as little as Chaplin or 1930-comedy). Italian Italian though, very emotional, and difficult to resist except for a man of cold stones. Love is losing, though this picture did not mean that it is a real game. It's not a jewel like Umberto D or a Thief. But it is a favorite and highly hilarious comedy, and good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
