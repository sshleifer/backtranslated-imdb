Intelligent, wry, and exciting, "The invisible person" appeared in 2000 between the usual line of Sci-Fi, including the art of "Farscape" and sometimes the melodramatic script and presentations, stupid plans and chat modern night. The show sat between "Laws and Procedures" and "Doctor Who" on a reliable meter, but there was no denying the fact that the "I-Man" characters went beyond the caricature. Even the characters who said about predictions like the Actor, Official, and Eberi were given keys from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that was altered by turning elegantly, made even more by project groups and directors. The side effects have never been allowed to overcome the plot, and science only has fallen completely. The bottom of the show is still entertainment, and I have never seen experimental periods such as taut. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised, and fans have the right to require a comprehensive version of the DVD show. Every time I encounter the "Hercules" marathon, the way to Sci-Fi, I cut my eyes and wail, wailing excitement and the possibility of science science that "Invisible Man" and its ilk represents.
