"One shot, one kill, no difference." You must see if you are within a navigation or snipers. Two big thumbs! A large headline, a great job of camera, good game, action, description, and more. Before next to something real. But this is not a breakdown film and take editorial error. this is sitting back and having good 99 mins. The plan is detailed but this film is not really about making you think. its about enjoying the life of the sniper and action. The sniper 2 and 3 are good track ups but first is still the best movie. Tom Berenger does a good job playing his character and showing the secret side of the sniper life. clear of dealing with all death. You must see for sniper fans.
