well "Wayne's world" has gone a long time and has since been difficult for shooting movies. from the movie theater as "It Pat" on a recent 80-minute yawn, "Night in Roxbury," many, of course, have lost faith that everyone who can make a skit will make a successful change on the financial screens. do not be afraid because Tim Meadows comes through the walk. The well-written plot holds the interest of the audience until the end and while it is still true for the character of Leon Phelps released in a skit of five minutes, the storyline allows character to develop. humor (a large amount of sexual joke) is clean and interesting and makes it more difficult to be than any film in recent memory. just as good as you feel like taking too much. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen's "Saved by Bell" popularity, makes it appear in the film and looks amazing. finally Billy Dee Williams, sponsoring his 45-day day, gives the film a touch class. and for those outside who are the publishers of non-prudent films like myself, you will find this film being able to be used, "Ooh, it's a woman!"
