I was amazed at how I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was dangerous. At the same time, MacDowell's director of films did not make his other character the best in the film. Love between Kate and her boyfriend is good to see and looks very good. His relationship with his friends is a thorn and balm in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been a MVP in many British films, does a great job in this. There is another epidemic in this but I think the film has been saved at the end with a brilliant guide, clean leadership, and magic writing. The quality of the film is the best and the music is good, too, although it is not available on the sound track.
