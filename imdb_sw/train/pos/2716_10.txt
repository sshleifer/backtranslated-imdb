Everything I remember about it was the best ... and dumped by Sam Waterston & George Innes (before learning more to the American audience) .... beautiful scripts like English can only do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Secrets of the Campion species, but for Jules Verne is giving away. Kinds like MacGyver would have been in England 80 years earlier ... right at the beginning of the revolutionary science / technology of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> I've been wondering if the creators of MacGyver saw these displays. MacGyver started first about 3 years later. I / I still have 1 part on a very damaged tape.
