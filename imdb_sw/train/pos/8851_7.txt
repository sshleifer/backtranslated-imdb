When the head "Before the Devil Knows You Are Dead" comes from the Irish style of the film that looks like a Greek catastrophe. It all starts with the incoming burglary and continues to rise without control if the two brothers are trying to escape the intruder. Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke play those brothers mentioned earlier. The most popular help includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and another partner. Most of these acting actors are not successful. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is told to a certain level of effort. The story of the story goes on interesting things by giving a different perspective and regular change. It is said, the lack of forecasts of the film can speak as it becomes obvious in advance that this story is a tragedy, through and through. For all, a very interesting start for the author of the first screen Kelly Masterson screen. Sidney Lumet's focus is being handled well but I am very interested in the fact that it is still leading to over thirty years old. I was very impressed with Carter Burwell's score but not a big problem. <br /> <br /> At the end, the film shows that it is necessary to compel and when the story and presentation can be identical to this other film is still a unique experience.
