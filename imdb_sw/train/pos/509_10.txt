"Bow Bow" sends us where it all started. Put 150 years in the future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This "Star Trek" franchise, is my first series series since "TOS" to restore a sense of wonder, danger and excitement to "Go where No One Has Goed Before". Scott Bakula is thrown down as Jonathan Archer, the first Captain of the "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole cast actually shows true respect for the legacy of Star Trek. John Billingsley is brilliant as a visitor Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is quite luscious as the science of the Vulcan trial of Tul. Bow Bows is my opinion the best Prime Minister of Treks, and I believe Gene Roddenberry will undoubtedly be proud.
