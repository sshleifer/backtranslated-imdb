I have listened to the commentary of this film, and I think one of the great things I have received from them that I agree with is that this film, like Mann's The Insider, is completely independent. It's from POV's Howard. Therefore, any review or attempt to reflect a set of comments about it, as Ebert did, is true about Nolte's behavior in fact. If you hear, as he did, that the film "does not work", then you say, I think, that Howard doesn't work. And, being clear, you can be right. Howard's attitude and behavior will not stand for professional treatment and analysis. But, hey, that's human nature. Andrew / Andrew.
