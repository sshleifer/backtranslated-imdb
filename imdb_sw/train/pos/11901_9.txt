As far as I can remember, the Balanchine change for Tchaikovsky's score is as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grossvatertanz (traditional tune played at the end of the party) is repeated several times to give the children last dance their location is gone. <br /> 2) solo solo, written by but removed from Tchaikovsky's logo for The Beautying Sleep, understandable at the end of the party's location and the beginning of the change area. Balanchine chose this music because of its music and music relationship with the growing Christmas tree that occurs recently. <br /> <br /> 3) The lesson for the Fairy Plum Fairy fighter is removed. It seems to me the charges that Balanchine has done to the worst of Tchaikovsky's great score has been lost.
