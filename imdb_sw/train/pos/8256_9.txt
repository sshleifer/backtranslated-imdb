You saw this film on the Vancouver Film Festival and I think it was a powerful, delicate, and FUNNY death. <br /> <br /> Posted by ROCK SOLID. Great work with Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up and coming, Alexia Fast. Iirdly, I found myself thinking about the film the day after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> Journalists, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie were lost in a major political lesson - but they did not want you on the head with it. <br /> <br /> The world they made was deep, and it means. There is a spirit of pride of this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is confirmed to treat salt. <br /> <br /> Love it !!!
