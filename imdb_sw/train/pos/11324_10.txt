I have to agree with everyone who has sent. I looked at the last time but I will tell you, whenever I hear some music from this anime I am reminded of the news, good animation, characters and feelings that I found when watching it, and it makes me cry (feeling happy but sad). However, I found that the story of love in it felt uncomfortable and did not describe things well but did not destroy any part of the experience of watching. I was in this very anime that after last I just needed to do the research (and see the end of several more times) and I've got all my answers and much more. I like how they put the historical stories into this anime, it was amazing and made us do more research. (I've been fascinated by some historical data associated with this anime) <br /> I think it must be a long series but if this is all they had to work and then they took it off. I would like to recommend this to anyone who likes the emotional and fantastic anime, well-constructed characters (some wonderful) and a little fantastic step. Also, although this was the basis of H's game has nothing in it and I really love it this way. (I have no problem with anime mature, often I would like)
