In general the film is the same. I think it's better than Sepet and it is better than Gubra in his story, its precious value. <br /> <br /> There are a few events that make me touch. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his best work. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' and Nina Simone really '' menaikkan 'my' bulu '' roma ''. <br /> I love song. All the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded a song. Good. <br /> <br /> And greetings for Yasmin. The last credit of the movie makes you touch again. We can see how Yasmin loved her parents in a special way. I think the movie deserves to be the Grand Prix International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.
