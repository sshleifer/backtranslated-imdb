I first saw the Ice Age in the Cinemas of Subiaco when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at that time, but yet I loved it. It had a kind of heat. We've had it on video for several years now and no matter how many times you look at it, it's never available. This is because of one feature that makes it different from all 3D animations made at the time - Anime don't have a 'house' that leaves. They are names, and that's enjoyable and strengthening look. Also, every individual character on the face, seems to be just considering, but they're all good friends. Similarly, all parties have their own knowledge (even bad people). Sid sloth is delightful in its way of provoking, more of love and stiffness. Manny is attracted to her breathing behavior, self-reliance, and so on and so on. Another great thing about the film is the beauty of the animation. All the shapes and characters were pre-placed with the soil, and gave an artistic film. Another feature that adds to the feel of the film, is that sex means very little. It is very difficult for female characters, but you do not know that until you look at it a few times and yet it has little effect on your favorite movie. From this, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would actually be concerned in the environment as an ice age. For all, Ice Age is a good movie and it is a proof of how much effort was put into 3D drawings before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
