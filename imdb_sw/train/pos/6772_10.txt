Unlike another user who said this movie was hit (and that Olivia Hussey was bad), it was unacceptable. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is wonderful in everything that she does! Yes he can be an old man now, because many remember from Romeo and Juliet, but he is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story line can be used frequently, but it's the only movie and I will fight with anyone who disagree! I enjoyed this film just like I'm another movie of Olivia Hussey. Olivia is "my girl" and I love her work. I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and we liked it. Not only because it is the movie of Olivia, but because of the line of unique stories and wonderful patterns.
