Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is an extensive game manager for New York's built-in, and needs $ 1000 to get a new location. Convinced of his status, he is more dedicated to the City of Sky City, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he cannot strengthen Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' are very good music because it combines different styles of film and action. During the opening of an amazing opening, a crowd of pedestrians go to the rhythm, stopping and starting as responding to backstage cues. Even the movement of walking themselves is stylized and angular, half between walking and dance. New York City of Mankiewicz is a fascinating mess of color and movement, the world of fantastic has been completely removed by the fact that even the underground gambling business and criminal thuggery seems to be normal. When I write these reviews, I have received a word that Jean Simmons has passed, 80 years old. This, of course, was the first time I saw him in the film, but he surprised me from the beginning. His coins and Sarah suffering from sex come out of his shell after drinking in Havana, leaving him free to play the play "If I Were Bell." Although Simmons and Brando were not singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided to disclose their voice, saying "maybe he feels very sad, but it is you." In spite of Goldwyn's courage, both are doing well to carry all the numbers of music themselves. Simmons shows the same proportion of a child that Audrey Hepburn may have brought in the role, and Brando removes self-assurance and charisma that does not matter whether his voice is not singing.
