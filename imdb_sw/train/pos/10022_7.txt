Aro Tolbukhin burnt seven people in the Guatemala Message in 70 years. He also announced that he had killed 16 others (he killed pregnant women, and then put them on fire) A number of interviews with people who knew him and reviewed certain events made by administrators based on real facts. "Aro Tolbukhin" is a great job, so analysis, not so bad. Such horrible evidence about how childhood desires can turn humanity into a monster. My rate: 7/10
