The first two-thirds of this biopic model of the Betty Page is very interesting. Betty, as shown by the great loyalty and Gretchen Mol, comes as a delightful, second-hand, who did not see anything wrong with what she did (and certainly was nothing "bad" to her). Director Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", includes America's Betty by combining old pictures of black and white pictures with new, damaged, black and white pictures. Once Betty land in Florida and started working with Bunny Yeager, the color is brought. Betty was notorious for his work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, for good performance, and Chris Bauer), with John Willie (Jared Harris). Events where Harron is offering Betty photography sessions is amazing and implemented easily. Early Purveyors of fetish material are not shown significantly and we get the feeling that these people were part of a strong "community". Betty did not have a big problem with its transparency, although we get the feeling that his reputation hindered him from obtaining legitimacy in the direct world. Because the third act of the film is almost nonexistent, we are entitled to the impression that we have been looking at the document length of the feature on Betty Page instead of the game structure. Lost away, it is a highly valued film and represents another beautiful feather in producer hatchet Christine Vachon.
