Emma is a real romance. If you like soppy stuff, charged with magic and folly, you will love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, and it happens a few with fun. Gwen is not one of my fave knowledge but he does justice for the role that needs everything that he had to give in spades. He shines in the role I think no other actor could do the right right for. Jeremy Northam, as a hero. how shocked? I have never looked at him as very beautiful but dancing! What the right to do for you! He looks good as Mr. K wise, superior, that I look at him in a new light. He makes and causes the best romantic. The beauty and character that brings to his role is wonderful! Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings others. good cast. Good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, look at this film, with Glory and Hatred - AND IMPORTANT IMPORTANT, buy books. Increases the film to the top that is amazing
