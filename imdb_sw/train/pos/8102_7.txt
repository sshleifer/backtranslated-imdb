Things to come are a historical film. With the Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first major science attractions. It is also one of the first movies of doomsday. It is amazing how filmmakers predict the start of World War II during the year, and even through subtlety, the year will live in the real world. But the film comes from reality, showing the world that was devastated by war (only a substantial source of gas to nuclear weapons that was undoubtedly not in 1936). The last half of the amazing film is amazing to see, making great use of models and matte painting - later becoming the mainstream of science fiction. Unfortunately, after the Coming Things, Sci-fi would be known for b-movies, which were not broken up to 2001: Space Odyssey over 30 years later. If they continued to have the quality of effects in this film, things would be very different in Hollywood. Raymond Massey and some of his collaborative stars are doing a lot of work in this film, with good effect. Massey is doing a good "Doctor Who" as a role as a pilot from advanced development (in 1970) that tries to conquer the population of a ruined country led by a simple battle (excellent performance with Ralph Richardson). Finally, the storyline covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this film - in fact it's not a story of cooperation. Maybe in this episodic film - somehow reminds them of the discomfort, really - it is difficult to have a common plot, but I felt more could be made of the material, and though the last photos in the third picture The images are amazing and they have the value to enter ... The trick doesn't exist and the film itself is just as close as it is interesting. Perhaps the producers were thinking of another future discoveries of innovation: good? <br /> <br /> Things to come is every science sci-fi buff great should see at least once. Unlike the Metropolis, however, it may have regular views.
