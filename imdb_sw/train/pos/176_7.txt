BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was the same. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were two of the best in it. Okay, so a foreign boy who this (SPOILER HERE) does business with a biker for his clothes was funny. The boy's boss was good, too. But the movie was true of Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have more time on the screen together. They are chemistry was good. WOW-WOW area! Romantic, sweet, study. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up in a whitehouse in the middle of a plot because of politicians' desires. Talking about Sarandon will give a lot away. SPOILERS This is the opposite of romantic / political interest, and it supports both the political-side is much more than romantic. It touches on political issues, and only appears on romantic sites. <br /> <br />
