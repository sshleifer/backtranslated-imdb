I know that you have already entered the festive film (or at least I think you have, I would just do that) but I think this should get a "small animation" each. Bravo. I can't wait a full film. I realize that you can't hear so often because of the amazing nature of your drawings, but listen now and accept it as real. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm trying to find ten lines of text ... Although I still mean it. And here comes another -SHOE! - and I can't stop here yet. This is very upset and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I probably look at all your movies in another modern "Jason Steele Marathon." I have a lot of those. <br /> <br /> -R
