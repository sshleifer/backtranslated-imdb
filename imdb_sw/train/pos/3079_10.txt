During listening to the voice book, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was very happy to hear his voice and which had shocked me to be "Degrees six" deleted. They don't seem to put good performances on long air enough to catch viewers who can connect to the story of the exhibition. It is embarrassing, and embarrassing on the network to give up this full season. This was the best show of looking and great cast. The Web gave the "Men in Trees" the second position of the wizard is also a great show, but they took the "invasion" and it was also something quite different to look, not the same theme of the past. Why networks can not find the right.
