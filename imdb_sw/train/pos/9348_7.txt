What we have here is the situation. Someone seems to be in trouble and people want to help - in different ways. At the end they are forced to allow. You can't fix people. And though in various fields Leadership on me is usually Hollywood, the message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in 9/11 Birds who have gone to the psychological state of PTSS since. It is about a meeting that Charlie does for Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was a sexual partner in dental schools and, knowing about his tragedy, is looking for him in the street and connecting. Charlie has gone next to a little toy toy - a pleasant barrier to Manhattan traffic chat - with huge headlines on the quantity of inappropriate hair. Hair is the head of the Sandler to show. And the use of music as an escape should go home to the lowest iPod riders. Charlie is a catastrophe, but largely Alan, has gone with a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to hate her. Charlie lives like a boy of a nutty boy with a great trust fund (money cover from tragedy), and starts dismissing Alan "walking," "eating Chinese," check out the record, or look at the marathon of Mel Brooks on the return home. Charlie lives in a beautiful big storehouse with a nice host, returning to the kitchen regularly, collecting vinyl past of Springsteen, Who, etc., and playing video game is called the Collosus Shadow on the big screen in empty empty room to rest. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Alan has a new patient who proposes. Charlie's despair makes us see Alan. Trying to help Charlie another place allows Alan to escape from its own pull but only one part makes it more informative. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler makes a few odd, but that doesn't matter, because it is convincing that they may all need each other. Charlie craves the friendship of a friend who has never known his family, because of losing his loss, he pretends not to have one. And why did Charlie sleep with him and slept in bed and had a bad taste of music (no Motown)? Alan wants to escape from his beautiful, beautiful life. He is under the finger not just of his wife but of his dental partners, who is the master of him though he has initiated the practice. They are white, by the way, and he is black. There is also a ignorant patient from hell, who seriously destroys things in the dentist's office, but begins to look different when Charlie comes and realizes it is a child. His libido appears to be ready to revive for any minute. It is also attracted to Liv Tyler's breast, a psychologist in the building as dentists who start trying to treat Charlie when she acknowledges she needs help. Sandler's madness scenes are also very few exhibitions, as it is many plot devices (in fact this film feels like playing for more than one step), but has several monologues where she expresses her grief through which deal in detail. Charlie's is not just a deceitful and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him start. The movie is admirable in such a way that it shows the feeling that people cannot be made right. This is an interesting movie - sometimes touch - and the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering. But there is a feature of the comedy that appears to be constant, many people are very attractive, and inside the Hollywood interior they have horrible things; The Manhattan road just looks real. There is a genetic area that is emerging, and Donald Sutherland is a very good judge. The Alan family problem is easily solved by phone. And yet this is worth looking for acting - control and trickery of Cheadle, and Sandler in a great almost good role as he was in P.T. The love of Punch-Drunk of Anderson's 2002, though obviously the best movie, is really better.
