Anyone who does not think the Bill and Ted Garden of Bogus is one of the biggest movies of all time requiring their head. It may somehow be affiliated with no-brainer completely, but also horrible to know and clever at the same time. One of the films that have never been reinforced earlier, Bogus Journey can enjoy again and again. The most important issues mentioned are duel and Death and the end, which are "very emotional". Keanu wants to forget all of Matrix's trash and drop to do what he does well, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
