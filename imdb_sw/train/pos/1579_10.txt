I saw this film on the Toronto film, which received an ovation standing! The film describes the story that with my knowledge you have never been told before - ie Rosenstrasse (on Berlin) to wake up to German women who had married to Jews at the end of World War II. So, it is a unique story, and more, it is the only film about the Holocaust that I have seen which shows that there were ONE Germans (family to help "Anne Frank" for instance it was Dutch) who did not help Nazi, and in fact, were and the courage to stand up against the wickedness of their country and the violence during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their lives. Acting is good on the board, the story of making a new and exciting New York, a trend from Von Trotta's knowledgeable in every area, and productive values, including good, excellent movies. Of course the family in New York may have a German language. Most migrants in this country choose to speak in their native language and their families - a common event. So criticism is legitimate. To say more would damage the experience. The film is long, but I didn't look at me right away. I hope this film gets the distribution is North America, because this film is not just a lot, but it can help heal any people of prejudice against the Germans because of their Hitler support. If this film is playing in your area, I URGE UFUE IT! You will be glad you did!
