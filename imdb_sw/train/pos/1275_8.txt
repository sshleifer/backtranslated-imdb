I've found this film to be alive. I thought the characters were found since I watched, I found myself caring for these people. This is a piece of time that I believe happened during depression. One mother, who is known as the city of return (has a reason to be), puts ads in the paper for "Husband". Christopher Reeve has an old player who happens in the city looking for work. He sees the announcement and is going to see him. He uses him. In fact I had a hatred as their relationship continued because I found it easy to put on their shoes. Everything went on with the real thing. He needs work so he does not want to oppress him. And she needs her help, but she doesn't want her to get a hand. They walk around the fact that they start really need each other. Things start to swim up to ...... a big blow. I will not destroy you by telling you what is happening. But the resolution of the resolution is quite amazing. I saw the story being trustworthy at the time it was done. I think this is one of the best stories "relationships" out there. Maybe the younger generation can't "get" but if you're over 40 I think you will love it. And if you have loved Christopher Reeve in "somewhere in time" you will also desire in this.
