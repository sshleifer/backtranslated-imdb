In "Girl Brave Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, singing "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in the local competition, and gets a famous university of Philadelphia. From there the movie grows to be a story of friendship and trust. I loved this movie. It was full of singing and acting with the characters they put it at a very good speed. Acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were the best, with Nick Roth The camera function was made well and I was very happy with the end (It seems to be good you could be in doing). Kudos to the director and all others involved in this production. Gem completely in film records.
