Ayone who says about how this movie made or that he had no plot must necessarily seek "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! The film was made a random act of comedy and in any way it involves a plot in any form or form. I would like to remind these whiners that if you're going to erase the crap out of this film which they seem to be uncertain. This film is open for people who do not appreciate what is known as "American humor" which seems to me just a bunch of smutty crap. The point is everyone has a comment and you should be a little appreciative that some people feeling a sense of humor can be similar to your own before hitting your mouth off.
