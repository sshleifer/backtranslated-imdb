I did not know the actual events when I stayed looking at this, just the fact that this was based on a true story. After the death of the baby's father, Rhonda is trying to help her daughter Desiree (... I didn't know anyone called their children that) to cope with losing. This is true for children, as is the case with the "family" flicks (and that said, continue to connect everyone to watch, although I would like to keep young people from them, unless you are sure they are going to buy the concept), but it does not eliminate the disease that the death of the parent is, and they do not talk to anyone. The plan is enough, and goes along well. The work varies, and the best Burstyn voting more than his colleagues, Mathis after being very good, and Ferland and their colleagues (with a few few) being limited to the group's influence (and in fact, irritating, then again, I'm not true in the audience of this purpose). Editing and movies are normal, and certainly not under it. When humor is limited to a few exciting lines or so, the voice is not bad. There is a large or two area in this. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
