It is not just a recreational film, with a good comedic statement, but also a political attraction. It took place at the end of the Soviet Union, but says Soviet ideas through and through. The story is kept at the beginning of the Soviet Union, and asks questions behind the revolution in a cultural and practical manner.

Happy, this detailed description of philosophy is locked in a delightful and enjoyable package! Jur
