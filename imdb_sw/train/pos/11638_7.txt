I enjoyed watching the red eyes. It's not a jewel, but it's well-designed and designed. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it is an old story with a different scenario but Wes Craven gave a good speed. Of course not another Scream and a typical college killer. It is good when you see a fresh, consistent moment even when the originality is not seen as its main character. Particularly from a film manufacturer like Craven which has brought many creative ideas to an amazing and awesome variety in the past and that now gives us only to bring a house that can be a good movie TV if it has not been removed for displays. Good work!
