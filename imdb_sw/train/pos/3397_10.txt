Soylent Green IS ... A very good movie, really. I never thought of it. Certainly not like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He is one of those executives who, like Superman, can reach all the sneery and unacceptable many times. I love the most vulnerable heroes. And in fact, he laughs his way through a lot of Green Green, too, but if he thinks he is very grateful I am not mind. I can understand why other people will turn their wounds wide into this film. Green Green has no effort to create future images (you know what - looks just like 1973), and is missing. But I was fascinated by the vision of a community-based film, corruption, and very powerful, and I was very happy to see that Edward G. Robinson had an exciting, ultimate task. Good beautiful character time - like when he share a valuable meal with Heston - actually make a movie. <br /> <br /> The Soylent Green message is pretty relevant these days, when no one seems to know what hell government or organizations are reaching. Funny, not, see Heston in the example of Michael Moore movie ...
