The 40-year-old woman is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electric shop and has no social life and is very difficult for women. Some of his shopkeepers invite him out at night and find that Andy is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in Andy's shop, she meets a woman named Trish, who gives her her phone number and eventually Andy, is brave enough to go on a date with her and they start to love one another Andy, it's still very awkward when it comes to sex and she will have tell this to Trish, so much of his shame if he can get enough courage to tell him before the objects are cut. The 40-year-old girl, has a good direction, beautiful script, beautiful comedic performances and a whole cast, beautiful movies and editing of beautiful film. The star stars are written by Steve Carell, who is doing a very good performance and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very surprised by this film. It is interesting, fun, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, beautiful and beautiful. This film is very good as the Crashers of this year's wedding, and all films are two of the best comedies I have seen for a short time. A 40-year-old girl displays many talents and is used well and works as a comedy and romance and is a lot of fun and fun. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best competitions of the year.
