Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) succeeds in the label contract and goes to Hollywood. Resides Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time the biggest star of the Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a hard and refusal to attend a new photo reporter. For fear studio appearance lookalike Virginia (Rosemary Lane) emitting and having Bowers send him to premiere NOT tell him not Marshall. It usually falls in love. You can think a lot of your own plot. The plan is old (doing it well) but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a nice pair and have a good singing voice. The results are good (shown by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows his unique performances in the real fun way of music (with Edgar Kennedy doing his slow smell). Also Glenda Farrell has very few bits like Monas sister of Jonna. Still movies are not good. Some of the mugs thrown with fraud and many humor is not just funny. Lola Lane is particularly lousy just trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also tribal discrimination - a beautiful black-colored girl is laughing for laughing and there are some racist discrimination at the same time. That's probably what keeps the TV off. I realize it was accepted at that time but it comes as it was to protest today. All in the same movie with some of the biggest problems supported by good songs and other great songs. I offer 7.
