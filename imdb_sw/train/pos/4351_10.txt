Peter Falk is a different and perfect actor. The movie is well written and acting as real life. For all Columbo lovers this is a good piece of work. Because it shows what Peter Falk talent is. He does not play a detective who seeks a trader of a string. By the time the credit begins to have a role you already want to look at again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will be used for everyone looking at it; The depth of its importance is the only thing that differs. It is embarrassing that the Indians in Hollywood quotes smut and skin because this is a kind of movie that people in business should boast. This will be a great movie to turn on the play of live action.
