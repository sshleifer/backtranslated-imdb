I bought this game for purchasing inspiration from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics are the best I've ever seen on the film / game. The bonus rates were very difficult! One sniper I think was very hard, it made me so confused to play the game for a week and a half. There were so many people shooting at you without anything to hide behind or life to handle. The only thing I could change is the upgrade system. I have not seen any difference from upgraded devices to improve, such as buying upgrade weapons was not found to make a powerful weapon or more to fill up the meters of my life. I liked the Q. copy. I think developers did a good job.
