Somehow, this film reminded "Fly Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg on a lost machine? Whoopi laid out tranquilizers? Who has a lemon and follows Mick Jagger? The best time captured on the film for sure but the movie is still kind of sucks, right? That's what I feel about "Rich In Love". Someone hears his wife singing for the first time. Young people after talking are talking about love. Albert Finney eats ice cream out of the bucket and, in another area, has a good time to tell his lost wife. Alfre Woodard adds another characteristic of the wardrobe. But there is only a whisper of the plot here and you can't wait for Get Moving. Only when the former Go-Gos' Charlotte Cafey's The Graces returns a great song of pop has an image will wake up ... and then it is up! <br /> <br /> This picture is similar to the day of the shadow of summer in Latin America.
