At first, this film looks so bad I almost fell into the first thought I saw it. It was a bad dream. Cosmic weight. But I gave a second chance, then another and another, etc ... Finally I had the burden of this film , because of such a fascinating speed of dreams, amazing natural sets, are full of light shining and especially music symbols, which are made by the continuous rock 70 and many folk songs and singer / singer Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should see a song about hazel wood, financial trouble with a woman who loses air ..., hear in the middle and close to the end of the film. There are physical images of the beginning, wich We allow us to understand the natural talents of Elizabeth Suzuki.For the film was made by other directors of "repertoire" like Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have climbed the apartment, locking on the movie as it was the cosmic hub. I personally think this film is one million times better than any of Fellini movies # Â¤ @ t! Of course not to worry.
