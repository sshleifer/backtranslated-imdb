The beginning of the film Greta Garbo of America is an example of how our lives can be erased by our mistake and actions, as in the torrent, and make us lose our own part along the way. Greta plays Leonora, a beautiful girl with love and character of Ricardo Cortez Don Rafael, a landlord. Ricardo also loves him, but he is strongly influenced by his powerful mother. Leonora grows without shelter and goes to Paris, where she is a famous opera singer and promotes the reputation of being a free woman. In fact, part of her perspective is bitterness of the rejection of Rafael. She returns to her home to visit her family and finally faces Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is a famous La Brunna, and Garbo does her job as a diva she really had to re value and boast such a cold in her pictures later. Ricardo Cortez reminds one of a lot of Valentino in looks in this section, and had been invited to be a Valentino and MGM line, though he never thought he could be true and was right. He is faithful in the unfriendly place as a young man missed by Mother, and he is actually a real age but usually at the end of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when he returns home, and after he has followed him, his courage has been reduced. This video is shot well, with a series of good storms and depicting Spain at the time it's real look. There are also good secondary performances by former Lucien Littlefield writers, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and lost spaces, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, since he needed a more traditional wife and was a very active woman, and I don't think she would be happy in a small village. The end is true for life and it produces no punch. See this as the beginning of the Garbo movie of America and the forerunner of things to come
