This period is a bit of frustration. Some people say that you have to start from the beginning but I must say I was confused from the beginning! Clark closes his head and rises to the floor of Fairview Mental Institute and is worried that he is superhero. Clark has been told that the life he knew was in his head. Destruction. It also finds unusual things: Martha married Lionel; Lex is closed to the wheel and his legs cut off after his crash on the bridge; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But they get one knowledge; another person who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also considers that mental illness is also from the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is an escape from the Phantom area. This time reminds me back to the Buffy section called "Normal" where Buffy begins to have clear minutes about mind storage. The doctor tried to convince him that everything he knew was his mind and that he was, in fact, mad. His parents were still married, still lived in LA, his friends were not there, Angel was never his boyfriend and had no sister called Dawn. Demons and vampires were not available. All these events are sad because doctors are not only telling the characters that they are thinking of his thoughts but it tells us what is true: lies, and brings us to the truth. It is good, however, to have a sense of truth every time, but we look at these exhibitions to escape from reality. It is no longer good because the characters should win new challenges.
