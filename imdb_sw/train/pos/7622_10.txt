I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first session was experiencing terrible ... so it was part 2 of the trial ... I certainly will be eligible to enter this show! This is the real Savior! I have looked at a few views and I see that already after just one or two events, here is already crying the wolves ... Sorry if not another truth, kiddies! There was once there was ... now keep yourself! Shows real TV! And this is a very good contrast to most of the crappy sitcoms today or a copy of the eleventh carbon law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series they are defending out ... boneheads here!
