The incredible joy, of physics and all the movies are locked on one, Stardust describes the story of a young man who lived out of the fantasy world he enters into it to get a little fallen star just to get a living, young and beautiful star. The kingdom that the king will die has said the king has made a competition for his sons to see who can get the first ruby ​​to be the king when the third of the witches want the stars to make it and use them to keep young people. The three sticks of the conspiracy are combined together in the whole picture mixed with good acting, interesting impressions, and some strong feeling and humor too. Stardust is an enjoyable film and has an exciting show from Claire Danes like stars (I could look at him for a long time) and Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at him with all his magical powers even longer) playing a horrible witch by Robert Deniro playing pirate The air of the nancy boy for perfection. Charlie Cox as Tristan's leading can be trusted and reliable and we get a very good job from a group of boys who are playing the children who are always and trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett are doing their best in life and death (liked this thread too). Peter O'Toole has a boy who was killed and looked at a good man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the whole film in his five minutes (good feet). But the real power in the film is a novel with Neil Gaiman and a script made from its creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
