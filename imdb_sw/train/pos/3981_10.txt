This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes that I have seen and up to now one funniest. In this case, Joe is taking voice lessons from a record of Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, unfortunately), asks Jack Carson for instructions that finds all confused. He then meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in his usual voice that is not too far from Geroge Jetson's future and gets put where he eliminates the director. I will stand there and say just how pleasant I got the whole thing and I was attracted to the watos of the movie stars offered near the end. The last part was particularly hoot so on the note, go to YouTube if you want to look So You want to be in Picutres!
