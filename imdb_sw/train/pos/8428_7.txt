If this was done earlier in Zatoichi series it would be one of the best. It's good enough, as many of them are, but the plot and characters seem to be very hard for success at this point. The situation is surprisingly unusual: farmers in the province have two champions, a good boss (at once) and a philosopher-samurai who begins the Grange; all run to local local groups, who want crop failures because they increase their gambling income and their chances of removing the land; their main or powerful partner is a puritan that appears as death on drinking and gambling but secretly includes his desire to pervert. (He also resembles Dracula, as criminals in Zatoichi movies later are doing more.) These characters have enough sense to turn against Zatoichi as he had previously before, but now he has lost many of them, and some of the characters have changed, such as A good boss and an angry sister Zatoichi has been killed, they need a lot of time when the film should give, so that the story seems to be bad, as certain events would be lost. Other than that, the film shows the characteristics of many of the others in the series: a good acting, sometimes photographing sound, creation of open, reliable, and unique identifiers (a lack of which is obvious in the regular part where the director is lost, and the technical quality of its nature hides itself: the use of different types of small sets so that their boundaries appear to be missing. And of course there is a protagonist, whose presence, as his performance, does all the work. This should be one of the best in the history of the film.
