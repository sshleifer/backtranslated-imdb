I enjoyed this film and it was very difficult to do this when your brother made a stupid comment in it within 30 seconds. But I liked this film, especially because I have used the most popular HK movies. Many films like this do not fit in the line of the story, look for an unreasonable action. And pointless is the same. You can find Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make the fly impossible and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film was given to the general audience after Li was in Lethal's weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why this film has fallen. Many people are expecting to see a film that has been beaten as an American movie. But you need to remember many HK films are not as close to the film of North America, and the style in the HK film is usually very different that is required to operate the wire in a lot of them. If you want to see a good film action you should see this just try to ignore dubbing. My rating was 8.
