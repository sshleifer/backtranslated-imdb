While I think 'women in prison', my thoughts often go to Italian / Spanish production from directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and when these films often say too much, they are very similar and once you see one; you can also see them all. I must admit that these types of films are generally not my favorites; but in fact the idea of ​​women behind bars has been well done out of Italy and Spain; and New World Photo of Roger Corman is responsible for some of the best. Caged temperature is the first of the director of Oscar Jonathan Demme, and it flick very well with the value of many entertainment! Typically, the movie stations on the story of a girl who are found to commit crimes and be sent to a women's prison where she is brought to the detention army. This prison is governed by the things that have been bound by the Administrator McQueen; and is proud to play with girls; guide them to arrange a plot of escape. This video is very lighter on the sleaze than I had in the prison women; but this is more than compensate for some of the major action scenes and conversations with ones who make sure Caged heat inserts into. It should be said that the plot is not original or arrogant and it follows a pattern similar to many other female films that were before it; but not such a big problem. The film is not available and is experiencing static events; including an attempt to avoid when working on the farm and bank robbery. The film is supported with a definite direction from a person who would continue to help the Sheep of the Sheep and to be thrown with a lot of power; as well as the best of all the stories Barbara Steele in the role of the chief prison officer. In general, Caged temperature cannot leave the viewer with a lot to think about the end; but it is a very fun little grill and anyone who enjoys this kind of film will certainly want to track.
