Just because it takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lamb and mixes together to come up with a good thriller of the film. Sean Connery is a professor of independent law, married to District Assistant Attorney, Kate Capshaw and he is a clash of the death penalty. Mrs Blair Underwood Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at the meeting and persuaded her to address her grandson's appeal. Sitting on the death line for the murder of the girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural ward of Florida he is against the sheriff tough played by Laurence Fishburne who is about fertility in his crime solving as Orson Welles was in touch of Evil. After the Connery get a decision to set aside the evidence she is clear, she feels good about herself. At that time the film takes a turn from the Touch of Evil to the Cape Horror! Uniformity returns to good performances. The specialist should be done by Ed Harris who plays Hannibal Lecter as a fighter killer on the death line with Underwood. He will make your skin spread and he begins to make Connery rethinking some of these modern autonomous buildings he has been putting his faith on. Many confirmed the independence that I have already come to think differently when they have become a victim of crime. <br /> <br /> The reverse course is really the same. Many laws and conservative practices if they are involved in the end of the criminal justice system wants to ensure that all of its rights are sure. <br /> <br /> Criminal Law is not the end, but the process never ends with it for the whole community. I think if only because it has values ​​that might be.
