We often see movies about bad things happening in politics, but I still recommend "City of the City". In the role of playing, star Al Pacino as the mayor of New York who needs to deal with the boy's beat. But it turns out that nothing he does will have any effect. In this film, the actors are like the fairness we expect of anyone involved in the political scandal. Regardless of how much you believe a given politician, you may be concerned after watching this film. I understand that I can't name any image of something like what this film shows, but that's not sure. If we had a high opinion of those on top, this film gives us these ideas below. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also star John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
