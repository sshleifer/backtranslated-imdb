Sunshine Boys are one of my favorite movies. I saw the first time as a Christmas attraction at Radio Music Music Hall when it first happened and loved since then. I finished six times on the movie, and if it were to be playing today I would like to go see it again. <br /> <br /> Now many comments here have highlighted the best displays of headings. Matthau was wise, but he was unfortunate to be elected against Oscar's Jack Nicholson's Randall P. MacMurphy's performance in "One Flew on the Cuckoo nest." Burns won, although Richard Benjaminiman was eligible to be appointed as well. The responsibilities were carried out in full, as Fritz Feld inspected the commercial crop of potato products. It brings me to my reason to explore this film, the direction of Herbert Ross who was under the lie. the person who plays, "Owl and Pussycat" on the screen and makes it a perfect film from them, does it again. It opens games without making it look like a photo game. He offers stories and characters. Here we have 20 minutes on the film before it gets to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about a special comedy. Although there are discussions from play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is quite new. A few years ago I saw on the revival of the play by Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think that Ross and the author of the picture, the player of Simon's games improved on it. It's just a wonderful film.
