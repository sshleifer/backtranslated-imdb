This is a good film - esp compared to sometimes the stability of today's film. Films that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art are rarity these days. While the bouyant hope of the 1960s cannot be restored, I think we can learn a lesson from the energy and charm of the film. I don't know what those who write the "interesting" film were watching - there is a lot full of it that has never been the same film as over 15 minutes at a time.
