I knew about this as a similar software like Jackass, and I saw one or two events on the Freeview, and it's ok, just over extreme. Basically the Welsh boys, with a large shadow of the United Kingdom gathered together with the love of skateboarding, and a completely reluctant / happy eyes to harm themselves and their health and safety. They have been puking, eating pizza covered with pubes, jumping on grassy grasses, hitting a honeycomb honey, joke on a little boy while sleeping too much, bathing, working at work, e.g. The army, cowboys, and many more caused by muscle, terraces, blood and breast, perhaps not themselves. In the star Matthew Pritchard, who does anything much, Lee Dainton also says anything, Dan Joyce (one of the UK) who makes a lot of physical things and laughs OTT, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular with be short, fat and lazy. It was a great thing in the 100 Greatest Times. Very nice!
