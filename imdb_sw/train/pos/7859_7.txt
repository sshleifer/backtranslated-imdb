If this was a preliminary version of the 1914 TESS of the STORM country (it also appears to Mary Pickford), perhaps it would have been very high, if this kind of severe melodrama and feeling were very good for young people. However, in 1922, this film was ready to show its age. And, compared to many of Pickford's films (such as LONGLEGS DADDY, SPARROWS, MY BEST GIRL and SUDS), TESS comes in a short time - and not every Pickford film should be 10 (even if "American Girl" "). Now this is not to say that it is a bad film - certainly not. But, I can't just see how many films this film was. The old rich cistern builds a house on a hill near the river.The bottom of the hill is dirty dirty but he is not able to evict it, so he tries to come up with different ways of removing the country. The suspect of the murder is the old father of Mary, although he is innocent. To make things worse, the only witness to the actual murder will not speak AND the dead man had become pregnant! guilty ge A woman waiting to be killed and a pregnant woman is afraid to tell her holy father who has "through the family". There are more tones on the film, such as the baby hobby likes Mary, but it is better to see the film itself. <br /> <br /> The movie is increasingly in other ways. The program, when very difficult, is also an interesting part and the movies are high. The last part is also very good. However, there are many more feelings you can get with a knife. Mary is very good and SO sweet and so plucky, sometimes the viewer can find all very difficult to take. When it was a great job in 1922 (making him a great star in the world), today is a very date. This is not true for all his films, but this is true. The Way, DVD's Entertainment video is a good quality, although few events are very bad - something that is not too wonderful to consider the age of the film. Also, the only bonus includes a short film.
