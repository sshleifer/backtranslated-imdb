David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a couple of journalists who want to go to California, but can't afford it, so they 'get involved' with other young couples (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save costs. so that they can stop different places of murder, on the way where secret criminals did their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. And they don't know that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are a young killer and girl he just goes with anything he says. I don't care Pitt as a law but he does justice for psychological responsibilities. as he before, no, not the killers, but with very good intentions. However, if the road trip goes, Carrie feels that others are about money, but Earley seems to always come up with money somehow .. .. come to mind that he leaves the person who has died here and there to do that though Lewis is doing his job we ll, one that adds more, a not very bright waif that has a good heart but does not know that it is not right to hold a hit by Earley when he does something he doesn't like. As things start to get more Carrie is unacceptable he insists that some couples can be abolished at the gas station, and unfortunately it is when he is in that he sees the news of the news that tells him exactly who has been riding with them, after things that are decreasing to them on a quick piece. This is not the biggest flicker in the world, but it is not bad ... I looked at what was supposed to be 'uninvited' version but I wonder how much it was cut for the tested version, because it seemed to be the same as me, in fact ... not that this it causes the family or anything, except perhaps the Manson family. 7 out of 10.
