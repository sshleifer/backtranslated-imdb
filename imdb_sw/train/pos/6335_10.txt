Well, I'm coming from Bulgaria where it is impossible to have a tornado but my mind tells me that "very, very scared" This boy (Devon Sawa) has done a good job with this movie! We know how old he was but he did not act like a child (WELL DONE)! Now about a hurricane - it was not true but it fears you! If you want to have a good time in front of telly - this is a film!
