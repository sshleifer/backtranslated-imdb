David Webb People meets Paul Anderson ... if you already seem to be weird to you, then you're right, because it's. People are known for his writings and the moral sense of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc ... He revealed these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and much more in all his screen there is something else of those lines. The first goal of Paul Anderson's success was hard. No wonder it's all its movies! And here there is a sharp excitement and ethical results! <br /> <br /> People's script is evident in the first half of the movie. Soldiers taught from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. They are replaced by the best, green engineers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, left on the planet and left to the dead. There he must preach with a refugee group, others want to stay and hate others and there is an interesting game here. But even ... <br /> <br /> ... shoot begins to fly as new soldiers enter the planet for military exercise and try to kill all the people. Great, violent, great action happens with the People's script converts to Anderson's thinking. It is hard to believe that the script was written previously in such a way, but the final product is better then I expect. Entertainment, somehow, even though it is very unacceptable, influences ideas, and exciting just when the action begins. 7/10 <br /> Rated R: A lot of violence
