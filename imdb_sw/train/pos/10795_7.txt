Ooverall, the movie was very good, a good plot of action for a large amount of explosions and fighting events, but Chuck Norris had nothing, except for weapons of arms and hitting a few characters. The movie was similar to the events of the 11th September, and the terrorist-like terrorist sending the video to the president (Urich) and threatening its detonate. Judson Mills had good job responsibilities, taking Rashid's field and various kick-butt responsibilities, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took many steps, allowing Joshua (chuck) and Que on his computer. But, in general, it was true and there was no action, but it was only for Mr. Norris's part. I gave the film 7/10.
