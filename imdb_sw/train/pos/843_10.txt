Do not easily explain the excellent performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course Greg Kinnear is always good. True, when has he been bad? I think this film has been hit down! The use of colors in this film is very different in today's world film where every other movie has a blue filter of Payback. I also love the way they used the Asian song. Prove that even what once thought as a cheesy kinda can be really cool to be placed correctly. I did my first thing when this came out. Being that my film was a man-hit movie, I needed to look at anything in the form presented. After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was very good when my film was smoked IMDb that would suggest this film if you liked me. How any of the other related I do not know, and make even worse luck. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
