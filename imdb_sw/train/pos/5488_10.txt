The case of being in a good place for a good time. What a fascinating film. It's easy to see why Chavez is popular with its people. He does things done. He is found. It is also easy to see why the western is very hateful. He has control over his country's resources and gives benefits to people. Many poor. And it is easy to see how the television stations can show the wrong image to put it there. Like the Iraq war, or the war on terrorism. Or those WMD missing. Or how about the evil axis. People need to wake up. And get different views. Keep the freedom of the neo world administration. Keep watching this film with an open mind. And make your own mind. Then I advise to see the beauty of Aaron Russo: America: Freedom for Fascism. It is not the American people who are a problem. It's government.
