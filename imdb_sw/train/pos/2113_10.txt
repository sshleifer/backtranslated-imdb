The shop area around the corner is said to be precisely at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it can be anywhere. A small number of sets indicate the center of Europe but can be a shop around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or retail trade of leather products but on the ups and less love, mentioned in the most prominent characters. Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are working with partners but they are not known to each other and are filled with hope and expectations and romance, and the story forbids bringing these two things together for beauty. Hugo Matuschek, the shop owner, has trouble with his wife, he just sounds at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret thing. Ilona Novodny has a good friend who buys her fur clothes. Mr Pirovich's life considers his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' for the Christmas girl. You see that Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with the dream of her mother. It goes without power from location to location. It is one of these stylish films that again look again and again, but it has not yet happened. The discussion shows the tendency to speak abnormally today. All action is very good. Even small characters as a hostess in the cafe and the police on the road are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are fully confronted. He was coming into his action as an actor and gives good performance and brightness. Margaret Sullavan was a sharp and low-acting actor these days. Some of his other films should be infected. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is wonderful. The time of truth is moving very fast. Gold stars round for artists. It is very dirty words that they don't get as they used (Regeneration of 'Got Mail Mail' was bad) but in this case it is true. Director Lubitschicho in the farce state of thanks but gave a classic film of spirit, charm and humanity of the heat.
