Since the day that I saw this film in 1981, it has become one of my top 3. The record I wrote to Amazon is down, and I am so happy that it will eventually come out of the DVD on 10/17/06 - 25 years of film. The last loan in this film describes an appeal - "Thank you to the Manhattan people who this island was published." Comedy of love and wonder, is a love story written by New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a natural) who can recognize everywhere (West 12th Street, Ansonia, former FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City boundaries was a country with a western club. One gets the impression that the whole set has been sent to click on as they do, and this friendship is communicating openly. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not just ode for Dorothy Stratten, it was also the last element of Audrey Hepburn (had comeo following this film) and its inner beauty comes from screens. Buy, make a big popcorn, and avoid someone you love.
