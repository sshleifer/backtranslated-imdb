This film often puts it as the worst production ever. Forever. But in my opinion it is likely to funniest. Horror orientation and screens make this film possible. I bought a movie when I chose a DVD on my pound business. We and other friends looked at it, agreeing at the time. Recently happened that this was not an ordinary film. Rather relic worth of what can be the last film of James Cahill. At first we were confused and we were screaming for a DVD player to be opened but thanks to our unusual circumstances no one could have trouble. Instead we watched the film through. We finally realized that we had a dream of a wasters, something you could laugh for hours, laughing for all the wrong reasons. Recently we showed all our other friends and they also agreed, this was not an inappropriate film work. This was a film that you can actually spray yourself while laughing. This was a film that anyone can enjoy. This was a skill.
