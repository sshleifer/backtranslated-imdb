I think this movie was more powerful when it started in 1943, though today it seems to be also preaching and stable to magnify it. The movie has been installed in 1940 - before entering the United States. Paul Lukas has a very respectful and dignified head of his family. He is a German who has spent seven years fighting Nazi and avoiding arrest. Bette Davis is an expert and a patient wife who has been able to educate and raise children without him at all times. As the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the United States and for the first time for years, they will go to rest and stop running. The problem is that the family was also perfect and highly respected - making them look like a positive propaganda rather than a real family suffering through real problems. Although this had a good reputation at the time, it just seems to be bad today. Specifically, the most unusual and written text used by the children were not true. It seemed more like Fascism's speech than the voice of true children. They were as a result of very upset - especially a player who emerged, sometimes, as a brat. About the only ones who seemed real were Bette Davis and his extended American family as well as Romanian living with them (although he had no sense of disappearance). It is very difficult to believe that ultra- Dashiel popular Hammett wrote this discussion, because it does not feel true for life. The story was the basis of playing with her lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic idea of ​​the story and the plot is good, but the conversation is always bad. In general, an interesting curio and film with a good time, ... but that's true above all.
