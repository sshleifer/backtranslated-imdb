India's directors have a problem, They should compete with movies like "Laggan" where 11 men led, Castrated men protect their village and half of them are certification tips. "Devdas", it is not recommended, fedar- has caused a return to foreign drink enough, and the riding characters in the endless mountains do not know the feelings of a person or his feelings-pressed living in a beautiful tapestry red and page. But in order to make a good film, you have to walk by the rope to convince the retirees who are the villagers who have emerged with Split's skirts and the Dishum-Dishum battles are well connected with the "Bollywood" that leads the actor who is very good. So you can connect with the director who wants to tell the head of the village of Leonine who in his own words "protect his village" is considered to be a shade of a movie or masculine also for a male audience. There are few executives who can show anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you in her courtyard and look at the beret and laugh at the politician when her loyal admirers came out of laughter and every word of the satire that was hit her, at the same time her daughter shares her grandfather. Nana Patekar is an important actor who is an old school act that is reproducing in Indian films. The violence displayed is the hard part of the story and Song and Dance healed by gawkers without who the movies are not selling, sad but realistic. Quickly these changes are suitable for "Sounds". All have said and they have done this is a beautiful one.
