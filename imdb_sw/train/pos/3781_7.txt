I can't tell this film is better than natural, but it's very good for its right. Comedy in this film is just as good as natural though, there are many scenes that I get laughing just to think about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this film is more wonderful than the original, but that's what makes it so big. Peter Hewitt does a great job of leading this film by cast. The origin of the original film comes back to their characters in this film and they all do wonderful work and their roles. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a good actor! I really enjoyed his Ted photo in these two films as I did Bill Bill Bill. I was so happy to see George Carlin returning to Rufus's place, very cold! Hal London Jr, who plays the role of Ted Logan's father is doing a very good job. The area where Ted has the body of his father and Hal London Jr begins to work as Ted is a big area, and he takes it very well. I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he made me totally film. Some of the cast are also very good. If you liked the first phase of Bill and Ted series, then I would like to also like this film. But, don't expect to be the same as nature. In fact I hope you enjoy the film, thanks to reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
