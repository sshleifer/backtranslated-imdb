For a long time in my life, I also did not like this film, or I loved this film but not as many more. I watched it soon (for sleepover, funnily enough) and I loved it more than I did since I was under 6 or something. Now I am more excited, as I do with a few of the Disney people who have recently watched me (including "The Beauty of Sleep" and "Pinnochio" or yet you beat it). Now I am very pleased with the animation, a clever "Disney" plot turns, humor from mice, emotions expressed by the plot. Animation is very good, often seems you are anywhere other characters, watching them. Animation also performs well to show original styles, including the city (which is twice shown briefly). Disney alters this from a natural fairy story in a wonderful way, allows a clever conspiracy, like a mouse makes clothes and an important part (usually I don't like Disney films very much if not the original story, but for this not caused I think they made a significant change to make a beautiful Disney film often I don't think Disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films. <br /> <br /> You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl who works for a mother and a terrible mother. She goes to the ball with the help of her godmother of fairy and losing a glass slipper ... This is a very film of watching and other people. The immediate family is not enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you to watch with friends (and immediate family, if you like: :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney at least, people who love story stories and for people who love the mouse. Enjoy! : -) \ t
