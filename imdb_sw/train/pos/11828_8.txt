"Dick Tracy" is one of our family suggestions - executives are the best - the art of art is unique - music is magic. It should not be "Kill the Bridegroom" - it is an enjoyable experience. Stephen Sondhemim songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is strong, "Short or later" is the same, "Can you lose" is haunting - even tunes like "Live alone and like "add stories <br /> <br /> You love top performances on Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Head, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, support criminals ... List is long very much. And, yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are amazing. Written for a minute smile (how many times we have looked at each other and said, “Try a minute - I think - gone!”?). However, one of the many things to tell in this film is that everyone involved is seen to have a good time - and above all it adds fun to the viewer. So, if you are not ready, why not take the opportunity to "Dick Tracy" - to accept why it is - a comic piece of Comic Sunday that brought life - and in a good way!
