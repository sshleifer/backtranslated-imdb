This Film-Film-Film-Film film is definitely very likely to see. Although it takes great influence from the Manchurian candidate and does not provide new or natural wisdom; it is dealt with with great knowledge that comes as being clean and innovative, despite being basically a renewal of the original film. It is good to know that such films are still being done (even if they are not broader), and the Cypher is comforting for that reason. The plot of the plot turns, which provides the paranoia feature and also keeps the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to understand the secret of the Cypher. The plan follows Morgan Sullivan; an exhausted city who decides to take a job with Digicorp which involves listening to a conversation from several rival companies and writing because, to him, it is unknown. However, his work is interrupted when he meets a young woman who is known as Rita ... This gives a rare look of the film that puts away from many such films, and is just a close relationship of Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. The program is also a positive development for forest development for more delicate - and more exciting. You don't know exactly where you have a plot, which serves in making it all more exciting. The actor is very good for the mass cast of the star team; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam looks very much part of a quiet and broken person in the middle of the story, and does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actor who has a resume that does not really have her talent, but she has to look up to it that just fits this movie. <br /> <br /> Cypher is far from perfect as some manual is unknown and sometimes it may be the opposite; but in general, if you want a recent Sci-Fi film; Cypher is the way to go.
