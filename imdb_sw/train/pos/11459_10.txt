On one level, this film can bring a child into us that wants just to create sandcastles and throw things in the air just for seeing it fall again. At a lower level though, it explores the great desire to reunite with the ground. I was so impressed by the artist when he said, "when I am not here (alone) for any time, I don't feel that it is not cheap." I thought Andy Goldsworthy one of the modern artists. I know his work especially through the coffee-table books and its own art centers. But seeing his work in motion, he was fully captured through the lens of Riedelsheimer, was a revelation. Unlocked at a time, Goldsworthy creatures come alive, beat, coming out, broken, broken, blowing. <br /> <br /> And that's the way he does: Time. Creation and destruction. The emergence and disappearance. Come from experience and become a world, and come back again. There is a quality of shamanic on it, it appears on madness. You feel feeling, looking at the job, that his art is powerful for him, that if he didn't, he would go and get lost. Our luck, Goldsworthy can share his vision through the center of photographic communication. Otherwise, except the cairns and a few walls, they could have only one person.
