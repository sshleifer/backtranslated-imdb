Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2) but still a good fear of the Japanese comes flick however. I wish the manufacturers of America's fears will take the page out of the template of Japanese fears and put more 'demolition' and less low-price cheap in their flicks. Good events in this one screen, where the white face is the scene looking at the back of the little actor, the picture on the wall is suddenly hit, second, and more. Value check if you love genre.
