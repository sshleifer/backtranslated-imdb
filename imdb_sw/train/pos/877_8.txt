Jean-Jacques's work started with his answer to the question of the award: the civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. For this it repeats the common theme for French films: the community is real, identity is construction, freedom is criminals. Here the idea is literally treated. Both characters find themselves, and each other, just when breaking the law. This discovery can hold the truth in France; at any rate, it is totally romantic.
