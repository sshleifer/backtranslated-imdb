I remember first to see this back behind the 70s when it was shown on the night television. He made a lie out of me. But then, I was a young man back those days, not like jaded on the film as I now. CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of 60 kinds of Italian fear, with the BLACK meeting of Mario Bava (1960), CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY) KILL) (1966) and NIGHTMARE CASTLE Mario Caiano (1965). If you want a destructive situation with good writing, then check out. I also exceed this level with the original Poe films that Roger Corman was doing at the same time. I saw a new Sipapse DVD derived from the French edition and it is a great improvement on that old -and-scan magazine that was making the television series over the years. It adds a few minutes of conversation (in French) that does not add much to the entire film, but it's good to see it full, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not give more extra from the film. One Flub saw it in the opening area, seeing the smoke of a person around the camera visible on the front door of the visitors. I think the editors didn't find that time, or maybe they didn't care, but it's something I didn't see for the first time. That's the DVDs. You see all the flu, mistakes and details that were not obvious at first glance. But no matter what. <br /> <br /> But no matter what, it still gets 7 meters of imdb <br />
