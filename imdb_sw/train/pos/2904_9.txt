This movie is the second immersion of Damian Szifrón on the movie after learning the best behavior in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates very effective characters, apart from prototypes and abnormal chemistry among them. I have seen the talent of Szifron to present each character in a simple but just enough way to involve us emotionally with them. Its control over them is huge, so it repeats to the film a positive direction with a very interesting script, the characters laugh and cry for real feelings and invite the viewer to join them in their feelings and their evolution on the screen. <Br /> <br /> Spanish takes English, the urban area of ​​Buenos Aires at night puts Hollywood position and Cluster is as interesting as any other, so we have a contested competition to compete on Mobile Games. But I want you to see movies especially because I've never dealt with all the interesting characters, all. It seems the script fits perfectly for executives and vice versa. I believe to make a film like this Argentina is really up to the competition.
