Below the bottom - the best romantic comedy ever. This film is a great achievement of all the fine movies that are struggling: the creation of the world and the time we want to visit and make us happy to be part of the human race. When I am blue, this film lifts my spirits and makes me laugh (and that's still true after many comments - it's always clean). <br /> <br /> All characters are in the top form. These dead bodies and characters are well together even if you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). Assistant support is a priority: Fry ("ag", "pack of pygmy sum"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (artists of three physics as "Greek chorus" - "but when it doesn't exist"), Durning ("something which we can launch from NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (master of Robbins and fellow worker at the service center), and Curits (Eisenhower - many other Eisenhower?). 'miss this treasure is not neglected.
