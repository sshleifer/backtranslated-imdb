Interesting in every way, this film is perfect if you have a comfortable feeling. If you like Jazz music, you must see. If you like to enjoy the loving characters who make a smile, you can bring tears to your eye and swing if no tomorrow this film is for you. If you are looking for a piece of art, deep, heavy art split and analyzed maybe you would like to stick to something with Darren Aronofsky (in other words - viewer djjohn lift, don't know the best time when you see one!) My only complaint is that the movie had a short time . I think I will just need to look at it several times so I can fill it up.
