I first heard this film after purchasing "Snuff" in 1976. I was told that the Devil's attempt was better than usual I continued and ordered the Guinea Pig box was placed. I was keen to hear that Charlie Sheen has come to try to ban either this movie or the second, so my mind had reached. The devil's attempt is a short story without a story, no character development. Only three men treat the woman for 45 minutes. , cast the guts at her, and finally hit the sharp needle through her eye. I must say that many of these films were fake, like blowing events. But some of these were done well to stimulate you. The events that the woman circles in circles make me look at dizzy. Or the area where he is obliged to listen to the loud noise for 24 hours is painful to consider. Worse is the eye. I didn't fast when I looked at it but just thought "Damn, which looks very good on a small budget movie". I enjoyed the flick but I don't know if I could suggest this fact unless you have seen more than what kind of fear is appropriate. 7/10
