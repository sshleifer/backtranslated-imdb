One of my favorite things about this film is the way the characters and their associated history are made on the fly. I think the authors want us to get interest to the characters for not forcing the feeding of their characters. The use of art and craft design furniture and construction was a special theme and / or example of what the family / brothers are experiencing in life. The difficulty of having twins serves as the father of the generation and even the husband added a great tension to make this film interesting emotion. Also, although the story was not one that citizens can directly relate (ie, Jews / twins / family business) the theme is the same everywhere as every family has a black sheep in it. That made them more involved.
