This is a southwestern player and I have looked at it many times and puts each level. However, after the fact of the truth about myths such as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane then look elsewhere, like John Ford suggested this is west when reality becomes a story of publish stories. The story goes faster to fight, and there is a good discussion between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two stars that can be translated which helps make this film. Look at the speed between you can see only Gabby Hayes as the Indian Scout, also a little younger Anthony Quinn. doing the beginning as a Cayenne fighter, actually married a brother of Demilles in real life. Looking at his quinns character which tells Cooper's murder Custer told in a flash back, finale is well done and when the roll credits has fuses to the north and history To please make time watch this western classic.
