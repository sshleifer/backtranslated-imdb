Someone has already said "be in good time at the right place" It was true for this document that I had doubts about the fact of the events and I think it is probably some of the acting but not. It's all real. Stories are not new for people in developing countries and / or poor. It gives light on the illusion of people in corporate media, inappropriate information, fake mobilization by making deliberate tension on the street, sometimes up to the army, the intelligence agency or even the government (many believe, led by the US) using agents they attack "any" side of stimulating civilians in violence and thus justify their blows. The marine officer in the film says this too. They liked to see people facing the streets. All these events have been held in Turkey (the US veterinarian in the middle of the east) in its history that has had 3 harvest and recently, the secret plans made by the Turkish army are described, surprisingly through religious media / Conservative government protesting the military doctrine of the army, where the most important mosque is attacked by an army agent to stimulate people etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they were films from inside, perhaps by chance, when events took place . It is clear that directors are Chavez. If this did not cause the directors to filter and run events and news, I don't know. And if Chavez will protect the Venezuelans against the US dictatorship and the global economy without undermining any arguments of force and power and ultimately become a defender of defense, history will say it will At least Chavez is optimistic and I believe it is important to take place.
