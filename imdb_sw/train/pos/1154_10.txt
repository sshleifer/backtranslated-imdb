I think this is likely to be the funniest movie I saw. Robert Harling's secret is near, see the "quotes" section; for a second thought, just rent a DVD, since it is a delivery that makes singing lines. Sally Field offers a comic, high-top performance as if you have never seen him from anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is making a lot of effort. Robert Downey, Jr. is very common, and in a very small space, Kathy Najimy is a clash as expensive cost. I had never been a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but he is great here as a real * person * surrounded by bevy of cartoon characters on a set of "Sun Also Sets" - which pull you feel down to you is Hemingway rolling over his grave. Maybe that, or laughs too hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
