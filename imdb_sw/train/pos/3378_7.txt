This movie came to me proposed by Matt Groening. Well I really looked at all the Simpsons and Futurama and it gets to mention it all so I found "what heck". The movie brings a few home "like" that lets you realize how we were on this day and age when we take things easy like soap and water for space. It is surprising though in 2022 men are still wearing a beard of one blade! Good that those responsible were not more than uploading film with special effects, guns, etc.. Some 'watch' furniture once you understand what it means. Remember, "Wednesday is a powerful green day"
