I wonder we see him even one text-man blaming this old film. We can't find the best opera movies, and here is the true opera translation. In fact, those pictures are not good. It's written. But if the opera cannot be blamed; and I am talking of opera. I can't even explore one-balancing mouth; if we did not know that Tebaldi in the voice nothing could make me feel not Sophia Loren. He does everything with anger! His dark eye is good; and he brought a chance for a good life! Some of the cast are wonderful, such as a wonderful ballet. Most actors are better; Load really amazing. His opponent Amneris is also bright. Anyone who does not care for this 1953 job is to erase the shame. Verdi would enjoy it! Typically, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind events. I love this old movie!
