Interestingly, this version of your OPEN EYES is more mature and more. Assisted and overturned, the image of Crowe is more abundant and looks more than the origin of Amenabar. Spanish film manufacturer should get credit to think the first story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved on it - just a little bit. Note that you do not know what leadership you have done in your EDUCATION, but you know almost everything about leadership in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by "more fleshed out."
