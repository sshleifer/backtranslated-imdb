Vivah no sense of classic. However in the difficult stage of the day, destroying a specific path of the effects and complicated plots (no even the sound that the sound has found yet), is quite enjoyable to see a simple film like Vivah. Stories as we all know is a journey from the first couple meeting to their last wedding after a short time and in testing times. No more, nothing less. Music is not the same as a league like MPK or HAHK but it does not give your feelings either. Two songs stand - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. When Milan was at a time and the degree of biography was interesting. Shahid does with honesty & shows great potential. It's nice to see him playing something else but "dude cool" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of the little girl of the small town to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are a great help and all others are doing good work. Suraj direction is simple but effective. The first film of the film is a small speed that can measure the patience of many young audiences. But all in a beautiful, clean, honorable family.
