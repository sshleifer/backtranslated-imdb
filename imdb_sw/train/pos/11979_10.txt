I try to watch it every day over time, and I even have watched it for a period of 4 years, I haven't seen every part. <br /> <br /> Show is on Danny Tanner who is a teenager who plays news for sports. His wife is killed by a car accident and drunk driver and asks Jesse, Elvis maniac and motorcycle and has a obsession of his hair. Joey, an older child who makes comedy and cartoons all the time to take care of her three girls, Donna Joe, call her DJ, Stephinie who is second and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> All live under one roof and no one to help them out. <br /> <br /> later in the show, Jesse gets a girl friend and future married to her and have twins, Nicki and Alex. (This starts to happen in the new seasons) This awesome show, if you like the suite life of Zack and Cody, That is so Raven, Boy Meets World, and Woman's design, you will love this. (It starts getting better in the summer ending) Look at it, you will love it!
