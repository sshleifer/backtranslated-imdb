I've been looking at "Kalifornia" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw in July 2001. You may think that for the latest wave of killings, that "Kalifornia" will be among some of the original films worth mentioning but they don't. Maybe if this film was released sometime between 1996-1999, perhaps it would have been more successful. In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is very different from most of the killings released during the 1990s. It has at least a very different difference from many modern films of "Seven" or "Bones Collection". Most of the killings have shown the killer but the man is back behind the mask or we cannot see them enough to learn anything about them. "Kalifornia" is a film that really tries to break through that barrier and really understand the crime of crime. It tries to answer questions like "Why are they doing what they do? Is it because of something that happened in the past? Does it make them feel strong or strong? Or do they do it because they like the joy of killing?" The things that "Kalifornia" try to answer but also leave us room for us to try and do things for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal feeling like the original Grayce. When we first meet early in the beginning of the film, we see that it is obviously one distressed person. When we see him first, it's late at night. Earlier it is likely to drink. Then we see him taking a rock, throwing a bridge, and then climbing into a car. Pitt is sharp in this film. It is good to see him when he plays psychological or very bad people. It is interesting that this could lead him to play a real player like in "12 Monarch" and that he would be at the other end of the "Seven" of David Fincher.
