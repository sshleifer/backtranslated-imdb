A warm, sweet and interesting film about two opposing shoppers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are doing romance through a mail board without either knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch places any sense of hearing away and calls its executives to achieve low achievements, improper displays. As a result, you like to close to all. <br /> <br /> There is a less disgusting force through this film that I appreciated. Empowerment is the main thing, which is well-known in the behavior of the shop owner and manager, played well with Frank Morgan. He knows he is away from his wife, and he knows that the success he has made is not enough to make him feel uncomfortable. This makes the worst festivals between Stewart and Sullavan each more poignant, because both are reaching out to another invisible one, who each thinks to be soulmate before they even encounter. Of course we know everything will happen to the end at the end, but the film did not help to forget the bad feelings if any of them could feel like they found out that the reality does not exist until fantasy. <br /> <br> Lubitsch fills his movie and thrown to the crackerjack which has a boat of chemistry. A small group of shop staff express themselves in the film as a small family, and that's how we feel too. <br /> <br /> This is wonderful, unpleasant of romance. <br /> <br /> Bridge: A +
