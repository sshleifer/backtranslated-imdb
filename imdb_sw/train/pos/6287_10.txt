gone in 60 seconds is a very good film comedy film that has made more than 100 million dollars but has been broken by many critics. I myself thought this was a great film. The story was reliable and more given to this type of movie including the award winners of the award-winning awards, robert duvall and much more anjolina. The other except the final disability in this end is a perfect combination of action and drama. My logo is **** (out of ****)
