This is a great end to show. The fact that Adm Janeway was able to make a double change in Borg was good. The fact that he was allowed to be infected, so infecting Queen and "poison" which, cell, ended Borg was good. The way they left it also left some, not much, for the movie to reload. However, they brought "home" and how they did it was wonderful! It was sad to say good bye to my family's part. Finish with Tom and B'Lanna having their child as they enter the Alpha quad. it was a good way to show a new start. It would be nice to have a corporate movie of some kind - just see where their characters will be today.
