This movie was as good as some other western made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film starts as a run by a western mill but it becomes more difficult if it continues. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan when they arrive in Seattle and Stewart is charged with murder. He is found innocent but the bull is stolen by the guilty judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something but I forget what it but Stewart just cares about getting his cow back. If the movie goes like Stewart is concerned with himself only as his character in Sped Naked. It gets better on halfway after it gets to Alaska. This is one of the best west of Stewart.
