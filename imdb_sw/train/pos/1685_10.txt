First he saw this film in the 1990s, and died completely laughing. It was a favorite ritual and my circle of friends, and we say quote from a drop of hats ("I'm going home to the bag!"). Needless to say, humor still there, 15 years later. It has become a custom during Halloween to reveal many new friends on this film (the good thing you can still pay Ebay!) I've found that Halloween sweets love better and your tongue was grown on your cheek ... and this movie provides pathos, doubts, an unqualified love, skill and list continues. Royal Dano provides amazing performance from the heart as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in the "7 eyes of Dr Lao" as a bad man who met with a bad end. Here, you feel really the old guy from the beginning. If you are not careful, you will find some humor levels in this film. The creators have a realistic approach in many ways and the negative views of the subtle, subtle subtle tricks in some sci-fi movies, and even the area has been broken off from Wile E. Coyote! Do not use too many thinking techniques to try to analyze the movie, people - this is a cheap bill without the need of nitpicking, and should not be angry with anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but don't know what they deserve. ) .- Now if you forgive me, I'm going to find a 'Zag-nut' bar / <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, DJ DJ / composer
