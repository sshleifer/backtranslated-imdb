Why are good retailers like Elizabeth Berkley's star in this ordinary movie? !!! Release provides a good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a girl of Barbie, Ele Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, a young man reduced to her trouble), but the trend is very limited and the story is very poor and original. I can't believe that a film like this was produced by a big screen! Julie Corman (producer): Did you know !!! !!!
