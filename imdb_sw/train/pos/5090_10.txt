I loved this movie. Great stories and actors and good sets of films. It told the story in a way that I can easily understand and sleep without sleep. I would like to know where I could find a sound voice. I can't find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I can find a sound voice. More than not being able to get the sound of the voice I thought the movie was interesting. Swayze did a great job. I think this is some of its best works. His previous movies were the same, but he really told the story to change. This will decline in history as one of the best TV shows. Congratats and producers and authors of a piece of work like that.
