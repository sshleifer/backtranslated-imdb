This movie was good. It was full of memorable pictures, acting good, and touching the issue. It would be much easier to write as if too much, but that's the kind of this kind of movie trying to reach. I was fully involved in the story and the presentation of stories. There were a few of the cheesy shots, but also they must be expected on a religious propaganda film. The only complaints that I can separate were no tons of information. However, this film was not created to describe every aspect of Joseph Smith's life, service, victory, competition, failure etc.; It was created with a quick look at a few of the religious and historical religious figures of the time.
