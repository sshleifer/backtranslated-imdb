This is the best series. You will laugh, cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way that this family cares and helps through the crisis they set a good example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do, and a bad choice, but they have never been back to their families, they use problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is a desperate thing I have seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from the baby's difficulty and with the help of everyone in the family is better. DJ, the older daughter, increases if her father wants to happen or not. One thing they all share is missing their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey, and Uncle Jesse love these children very much, and it looks at every part.
