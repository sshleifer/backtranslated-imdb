The legend of Zu, as I saw, was a very interesting story. I think many people who did not like didn't see mythology based on the film. They were expecting something similar to Star Wars, and not so. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would like this film. There were a number of examples and hidden meanings that an average viewer could ignore. We all have a mountain of swords in us. We all have to enter our blood cave sometimes in our lives. We all have to deal with our sleep one day. Certainly some of these notes were confusing, and some of the steps got a little hokey sometimes, but I think some of the other film features appear easily. I'd like to look at it again. I don't know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw Mandarin and English titles) and Zu Warriors (called American version.) It may have fallen to the American audience, who would actually have prevented it from This film.
