It seems that there are only two types of review of this film on the net. Those who hate and insult the name of Ralph Bakshis and those who love it and call it the work of courage. I liked to be in the middle. I have to agree with many of the claims of this film (e.g. the refusal of stories, the best fighters, on the action etc ...) But this contest still I like this film. Rotoscoping (time well done) enhances the direction of life like the fighters and the final war zone at the end of the film is amazing. Surveillance of surgery while supporters dismissing the Frodo are stylish and well-marked by the music mark ... magic. Unfortunately, the worst scenario of film but if you can bring yourself to ignore it is a good film. (Of course I will be lynched with angry people who hate this film after writing this evaluation, ah too, such is life)
