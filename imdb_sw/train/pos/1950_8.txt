Diane Keaton has played several "heavy" parts in her many years on big screens but she is more familiar with "light and fluffy" items by Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. He deserves the Oscar for the best actor in this drama and this does not mean what the competition was the first year. Try and find an area that doesn't appear. And it was a great dance, stirring its speed and repeating, action, at full speed. The decision made him less than possible and suitable for a 30-year-old community at a very close time, but he was playing half an early and fast pace. The movie, in general was well, made and shot well and helped the cast but Keaton carry a load.
