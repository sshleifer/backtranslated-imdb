This is a short and bright series of animation by David Lynch (as it says at the beginning), and follows the misadventures of backwoods, generally-wearing an adult, and a wife who has trouble with a child with an angry child. Both elements are repeatedly beaten in short periods, with no concrete plot. It is easy if you consider this as odd, odd Looney Tunes - with more violence, dirt, bloodshed, and sometimes hilarity. I bought a DVD with Eraserhead, and it was previously seen Eraserhead. Don't look at this series if you want the art hub - this is just something. In fact, it seems almost to be a statement about such things, if its bad style chooses in the face of any type of animation that you can see. As Lynch says, "If this is amazing, it's just amazing because we see the shortage of all."
