I love this film. As a child, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me. Indeed, it is slow now, but back in the day, it was amazing. Dentists are one thing most people are afraid of, why don't you make a film about the dentist? It's fun, it's fun, sometimes it's terrible, but it's amazing. And I've always been in love for the fear of treatment. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr Feinstone perfectly, no one can do well. And for a small movie awesome budget, the effects are very good. And I also love the music of the theme, succeeds with the film. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also the one who plays the nosy, and does a good job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some cases of torture / death. Check out this one out!
