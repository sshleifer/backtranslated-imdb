Attorney general Walter Pidgeon takes the case of pro bono, the success of the trial and found that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but the part of the extortion ring reached the top of the city's top. He is misled by his selfishness, he is investigating, reminding himself of the identity of an “unknown person” who leads the party, and murders him. The anger is involved when Braselle is allegedly responsible for the second murder and Pidgeon must protect him by indicating the presence of another "unknown" person - himself. Although it is a small amount of urban cities and long-term rhetoric, an unknown person is a little lower circle in style or structure than by recognizing the widespread destruction of US politics that has been seen in the post-war years.
