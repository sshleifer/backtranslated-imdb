Although it is too small to remember the first of the series (being just a child) later I found myself going back to the television at the end of the 80's, just when I got to the battle with all its things. It was my grandfather who showed me the first succession and also gave me my first interest, referring to the stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then I have eaten many books and seen a series of television series on World War II, with mixed comments. British TV stations are generally very good at producing these, as the World War can easily guarantee, and many jewelery made by BBC companies and independent companies. I recommend titles as well as "Nazis - Warning From History", "Blitz" and a BBC series about Dunkirk. "The UK At War In Color", with its series of "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of a very high standard. The world at War is the best and, despite his age, can never give. There will be new revelations about the war that will continue to interfere with the fact that they are not included in the series and of course World War I would have been done on such a large chain to produce series and ALL details will take more time and more money then any other, even if the plan was possible. What I feel I must say to those who specify that it does not include everything that the World War can not do physically as a series but surely as a heck can make you do more research - and make it enjoyable. That actually has worked for me: Now I have a comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Suggest any interest person. The series was so well done that they could find it difficult to disagree that it is the best and most effective software.
