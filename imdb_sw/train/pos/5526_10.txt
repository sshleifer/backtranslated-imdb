I love the cinema so what I am about to acknowledge my shame in detail. I had given thumbs down "Che, Part 1 and 2" without seeing the film. I'm afraid I know. But I felt a trap done by ... who? I don't know the truth but there has been a bad word of mouth that spread like wildfire and, no matter how I think I think, I fell into it. But, thanks, I found the director of Argenine movies, Martin Donovan, someone I love and praise. When I told him I didn't want to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me right with the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how he loved the film and why. I went to see both places once and, "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best film I saw in 2008. It is a cleaner that will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. The understanding of his audience is something that we are no longer using. I don't know if we were. Riveting, moving, without agreement with Benicio del Toro is just amazing. We can see his spirit, we can see the truth. Humanity is too great. So thank Martin Donovan again for teaching me so faithfully. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this amazing film. Do not make the mistake I was doing. Go see it, now, on the big screen
