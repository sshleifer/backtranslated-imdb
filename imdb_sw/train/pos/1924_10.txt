This edition was great, not just for kids who I thought for the first time, is for the whole family. The first season was about a father looking at him as two daughters and a son, he sadly passed during the 2nd season, I could believe when I heard it. I care I have continued to show if the truth will happen in real life and I need to mention a part of the product. I am a 24-year-old man and this part made me cry to me if I know how they felt like my father died when I was 13 years old like Roy. The 2nd and 3rd Season had a good comedy there as well as the 3rd season had some of my preferences as Friday's Freaky, Siri. I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was desperate that it was over, it was the best one. was the best show comedy show since Home Improvement and can be the next friends. <br /> <br /> should not be finished but still love to look back each day.
