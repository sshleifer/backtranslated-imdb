I was 15 years old when this movie was scheduled on television. Raised in Texas, I understood the weight and monotony of the young life there. This movie touched my impressive young man and I remembered with joy for the past 12 years. Recently I have seen it at 2, 3 and 4 times thanks to the LOVE center. I still cry because the movie is approaching & touches my confused young man.
