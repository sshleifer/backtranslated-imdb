Voice sound, baby, safe, program and child. Add them all and get the best comedy that I've never heard of. Even with some of the star power of the list (at least-of-the-same, b-plus?) this film got very little broadcast. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't slow down its thinking. Wrap bad writing, solid support with a trusted group of characters. Some of the true classic lines, and exciting exciting at the end. <br /> This is not the lowest player of the "Nutty Professor". These are low-living people. They say the bad language of a young man and makes things less of people's lives. But it does so for amusement and entertainment, and they do well. One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
