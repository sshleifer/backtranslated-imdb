This was a very good movie and it is absolutely right to judge without considering when it was given. There are some movies that are not available but this is quite clear. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for more than twenty years all the pictures as my story was not revealed to me and many of my friends, even when we enjoy it again on the DVD. In fact, I remember this movie as a topic of several discussions and meetings where old boys were talking about the things we have. So there was little feeling of despair and even sadness when we finally had a DVD. First, there was a theory about how naives our generation was. Second, I think there's nothing more. I would be glad that this film has something that should be interesting for all modern creators, especially those who focus on the type of fear of decay. This is mutilation, an idea that gives a balance to the film; The reality of a man is more fearful than death and suffering. I remember how the disease was sick, when the hippo hitting the hand of Kurt out. And last; when the creature blows the neck of the doctor to take a piece of his veins. Another strange thing is that a bad situation that fails without decaying through all the events, regardless of whether the action is in a private laboratory, the road alone where a person in the car wants a female body, a dressing room, Nakadhalika. It may be a reason why not a good movie again is just technical things. For example, in the area of ​​accident and someone saves the head of his girlfriend the most appropriate work, made by another director of the second unit may be interesting. Something similar to all practical events, including one of Kurt's hand. Additionally, something that can be done by the creature is available. Some remake have been good; I think in this case the experiment is timely. However, black and white tons should be stored.
