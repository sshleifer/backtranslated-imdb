I must say I was fascinated by the movie was amazing, close and complete files and how he built a tension on a subject that looks like a terrible birth there is more than that. <br /> <br /> Movies are about two narrators, one appearing, one clear. Both of them are trying to explain the importance of a series of sculptures that led to a scandal for a long time. The film is about the theory and opinion opinion but the conclusion is quite surprising I must say. Certainly the most suitable movie 171. <br /> <br /> For just 66 minutes playing outside the film plot still looks like full work. Wonderful direction! I must say much better than the Poor Blood which for some strange reason reminds me of it. <br /> <br /> I think you can call it with a word "slide". It is a very good academic conversation on various theories and the effects of the amazing sight but the crew and Ruiz wiped out. At least for me. Amazing film.
