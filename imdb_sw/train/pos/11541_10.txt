Matthau and Lemmon are very good in this - everyone else in the movie is also good. The discussion is better and more courageous - and the area where Lemmon's behavior tries to erase its sins in the restaurant and beat me down with laughter whenever I see it. Anyone who appeared to see that sequel is not good should not turn away from nature. I recommend this beautiful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact Jack Lemmon has his character so straight forward with just the pain overtones adds to the hilariousness in my opinion. Both of them made a string of movies together, but this is the best - of course.
