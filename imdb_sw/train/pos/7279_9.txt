My grandmother bought this film when I was 5 years old (I always love horrible movies) and I even enjoyed it. The atmosphere is amazing and original and entertaining stories. I especially love the scenes where RV is under attack in the desert. Reefs are actually lobby for the flick of the bottom budget. Acting is on average for these types of films and music is amazing. This is definitely a precious gem. I recommend to anyone who likes these amazing films from the last seventy years, early nineteen years as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Dream", "Hospital Murder", and "Return to Visitors , Death Spawn ‚Äù. Certainly classic!
