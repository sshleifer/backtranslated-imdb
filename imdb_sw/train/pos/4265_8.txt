If you haven't seen this very small tenant, you should look for it. It is the story of Sack Saddle, during Sad Sad (Fred MacMurray) who is listed 4-F every time he tries to join any military branch. He gets a magic lamp which actually has a genie (Gene Sheldon), but genie is more than whispering than MacMurray, taking him all the time to serve all the time and worse than what he wants. It's beautiful, fun, and fresh fluff, and you can't help but like that. Plots are like Disney's films, especially since two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) all make many Disney films in 50 and 60 years, although they are not together. Needless to say, it all ends well with everyone, and the viewer may feel good.
