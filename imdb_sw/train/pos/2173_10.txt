Often only after years of years we can look back and see those stars who are really stars. As a French critic, whose name has erupted, he said: "No Garbo. No Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks"; and there, thank you in heaven! Louise Brooks! This is the third of its European technicians. But it is also a unique film that one, if not, first French talkie, by following the script written by the famous Ren√© Clair, for it seems to have been completed (direction, is) by Georg Pabst, and by incorporating the voice of Edith Piaf before it was known ! Many talents that work and in the film, how could it be a masterpiece? And that's what this film is. It's embarrassing Louise Brooks was black and Hollywood when he returned to the Nations - many talented gifts so proudly through! In the film, with the look at Louise Brooks in action, it's nice to see pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and hear the small voice of Piaf. I have never been tired of this film!
