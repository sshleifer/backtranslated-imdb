I watched this film after watching Magic, and the old film was far away. I loved how the lights, makeup, and clothes changed as Gillian changed the story. The ways of Jimmy Stewart did not do much to me in this film, but I think they served to show the Gillian character. I was also beaten by Nicky and Gillian's ways - it was as if the director sought to appear to have been damaged by Gillian's appearance. Nicky sign performs when it shows its powerful Redlich especially struck. I have never thought of a war as to destroy, so it was an interesting way to compare those characters.
