John Waters film found more so far is one of its most beautiful, considering all despair and apparent destruction that seems to be more garbage than his original work. Indeed, dirt and sexually still existed, at least are presented in a style that cannot be considered unclean or disgusting. Due to the great choice of cast, this film has given the true idea of ​​modern art and the nature of your modern artist's view. Love and a small amount of heart (if possible for Waters), this is one of the films I watched on a rainy day.
