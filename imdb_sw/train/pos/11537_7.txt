Neil Simon had a knack for dialogue and anywhere it was more obvious than a flat-striking WALTER MAJOR and JACK LEMMON as a different type in the ODD COUPLE - a mix of comedy and sadness that depends fully on the reliability of two non-mixed friends. The apartment. Lemmon is a neatnik Felix Ungar, resigned from a divorce from his wife and for refusing to cooperate with Oscar Madison's house (Matthau) for serious consequences. It seems that everything Felix says and runs Oscar on the wall and no one can stand in the way of others, and Oscar being a male man can be considered by Felix is ​​the opposite of the truth. <br /> <br /> The fun part for me is when giggling The sister of the pigeon in the top floor visits the dinner. The valueless value between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans are enough to keep you in stitches. The talented sisters of Pigeon are those who made a voice to the Muslims of Gabble (a pair of goose) in the ARISTOCATS of Disney, and here - their comic time on the sad story of Lemmon's despair is enough to make the film hilarity- - The residue remains a lot of time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and you have enjoyed other treatments for its work screens, this is not recommended. Matthau and Lemmon are well-treated (even if they thought to share the roles before opening the film) and, of course, it is easy to see why it was the latest TV festival later. <br /> <br /> Connect: Top Simon comedy, not lose.
