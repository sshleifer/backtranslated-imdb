First of all I would like to say this movie lost more of any recent mistake which hollywood has taken out of its intestines. McBain is a more practical film and violence than many viewers can handle. It has all the classic features of the late 80s / early 90s film. only their money), stripes of the neck, boys of fire, boys who are playing the premises, and of course boys who have fire that are being beaten by buildings. Walken is very good in this picture to give you unsafe lines such as, "let's sit .......... out on the deck." and others who make this film up to buy on the rack of precision in the local video store. if you have blood for unnecessary abuses of hiring this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
