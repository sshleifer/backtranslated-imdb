Marjorie (royal performance and riveting by Farrah Fawcett) significantly avoids being punished in his car with a sharp thief Joe (superly played by horrible fears and James Russo). However, Joe stole his wallet and finds where Marjorie lives. He gives him one terrible day. After holding Marjorie for much damage and psychological abuse, Marjorie can turn the table onto Joe and tie it in a fireplace. What does Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and journalist William Mastrosimone include a bad, sensational and often disruptive story that drives bad nails and debasement of rape while also shows how anyone who oppresses can act violently and violently. Joe sees women as effective as objects when Marjorie sees just Joe as "animal." However, this film on its attractive credit refuses to make Joe out to be just a bad-dimensional plant; instead it is a terrible and final monster of a sympathetic person and wife and child (Joe's confession to the absolute truth). Fawcett and Russo both are better in the direction; they receive good support from Diana Scarwid as an unhappy Terry, Alfre Woodard as a wise Patricia, and Sandy Martin as a compassionate police officer Sudow. All of the movies of Curtis Clark of Agile and J.A.C. Redford's problem, the scissors of the skin increases the tension of claustrophobic. Real power.
