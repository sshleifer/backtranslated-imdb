It is rare that someone comes to the film as useless as this. It is one of the best practices, many films that I have ever seen. Each dialogue line can be translated in several ways, relating to each of the three main characters. The movie sets up an incentive network and two crosses that you do not accept and refuse to allow. Add to this that the romance of a slow stimulation between Kevin and Faye is like moving as anything that has been done with celluloid and you have links to perfect film. It shows the romance of movies such as "Titanic" as they trich they are. If you are looking for a movie to watch when you wash clothes, this is not the case. You are engaged in this film. You can't have a conversation when you log in and out of the room. This movie requires your attention. Give them the respect you deserve and you will get more. Unless you think "Titanic" is the greatest film ever.
