Goebbels's inspiration in support did not reflect. After Stalingrad Reich decided to go to 'total war'. This is known in the film. Part of this was to use women in the war effort, which Germany has never been done on a large scale. The SS murders of women could deal with Goebbels and the public relations of the greatest proportion. His preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible, based on the fact that the Jewish men could move around later. I understand many survivors of the war. Another problem is that 'Red' Berlin has never been so happy because of Nazi and had to be dealt with carefully. Again the murder of women can afford the citizens of the Nazis the level of support they had in their capital. <br/> <br/> It was amazing that a large number of SS uniforms showed patches that showed that men wore they were not German nationals, but were from German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
