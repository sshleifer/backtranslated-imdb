After 7 years of watching that terrible anger called Star Trek Voyager I had felt pretty. Next Gen and DS9 were blood items and Voyager damaged TV Trek. This was opened and probably the best experiment on the Trek Festival. Staff were very good if they were the choice of administrators in part. Scott Bakula played the first captain for the first time in a deep space and his way of doing things was an exciting change to already know everything from the past. Some of the staff were very interested in their responsibilities and I think they have gone to the first good season. When the show was canceled for a long time I was disappointed. In the mirror mirror has shown us what has been hit that can. The movie or movie movie was never taken. Many stories behind and the introduction of the federation have been left to tell, including the beginning of enemies and Klingons ..........
