I have lost count how many comments I have written on Top Slaughter. I have read a lot of bad and I will say this now this is a wonderful movie. Simon Scuddamore made his reputation for a short time for his self-assassination, and even though this was his only film, he was the one who made the movie very much. At first I had nothing about Simon until I read the review on his suicide. Then I got out of the current web page at www.IMDb.com was born in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon could have played a more bad character, but his real life had the strength and weakness. He did a good job, who could disagree? I always wondered how he felt feeling naked in the movie. You must have a good embarrassment to say a little. I saw this film first when I was 12 years old in sixth grade. I agree with some instructions as a girl could not bathe after someone was killed, and that secondary schools are not bathing! I think Caroline Munro who was 36 at the time was another star alone with any talent of honor, and unfortunately for Simon's death she did not make future films. The reason for his suicide is hidden, and it will surely be recognized in the future. Making math on his web page tells you he was 29 years old when he made the Great Transition. He seemed like a boy. I give this film two thumbs, the best awesome film made. Probably because of their horror they did others did not make popularity in the movie business. -Jacob Young
