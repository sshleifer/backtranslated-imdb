I entered this film without knowing anything about it, and ended up enjoying the truth. It was true and honest - Some of the things that the characters said and did were very strange, and a lot of script seemed to be open-perhaps (perhaps this is a common Woody Allen? The games were laughing so hard. It was not even in the joke in the film to se, but in the whole movie itself. The actor reminded me of the act of Seinfeld, where he tries to laugh his joke - they are corny, but if you take the movie seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of ACTORS, not the CHARACTERS. If you are looking for a random film, and you like Woody Allen, I'd recommend!
