I love films that do not provide "end of happiness," and that's the main reason for my interest in this film. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) have been arrested in Thailand for fraudulent narcotics after an unknown call to the Thai authorities. The film has a strong job to keep viewers like (or what) of the girls involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their evil lawyer. Jacqueline Kim returns with a strong performance as his most powerful wife, proud wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls have been used more in prison, if another advertiser has suggested, if I have heard that Thai prisons can be brutal. Where this film reminds me, however, is its end. Alice is involved in the 96-year sentence in total so that Darlene can be forgiven, and we (the audience) realize that both are innocent. Any film that fails my ultimate expectations succeeds with my points, and this well done drama is well suited.
