One of the best "Amitabh return" movies I liked. This was a phase when Govinda went with power and Dhawan. The songs were amazing and quite as we call them "type of masti". The green and favorite player of Anupam Kher entered. The story line has a good mix and it will come out as is known by David Dhawan's pastoralists. To be seen at the time of Mrs. "Nene" Dixit, it was the general violence towards the end. It was good to see Amit doing with power and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it as an example of the film "Bollywood Masala", I would like to watch it any day. I give you a simple 8 out of 10 just to be a clean voice.
