This film has been made by one of the most uncomfortable living in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was surprised for the second time that it made a comedy ROMANTIC, but knowing that it was a very safe, it appeared in the concert everywhere and in local movies, I had a good feeling about this movie. hell / hell / hell, I was right. From the out of bat, the situation (written by Pelletier himself) is a little distorted and hard to follow, but, in the Pelletier style it's 90 minutes of jack-in-box. <br /> Guided by conversion and largely replaced by dangerous Liaisons (and Laclos) "Les Aimants" has a lost game of writing notes on the fridge. In this movie you will have the opportunity to find out who is and who is writing to the fridge of God .... which continues in the beautiful thing of love. <br /> <br /> Great stories, beautiful pictures, great quotations of other movies. Should we apply more to the first movie?
