I went and saw Rivers and Marines again today. It's the second time in two days and yes, I see movies that I like most often as important. Yesterday I was surprised by the beauty of the pictures and works of Goldsworthy. This morning when I throw the coins I received # 29 Water Water (Water). Goldsworthy has solidarity with water, so name. I had to change the verse 5 which moved to # 7 Army. The Art of Blake was War. However, I knew I needed to see the film again. I read one of the few reviews available online from SF Examiner. The defendant loved the film but said Goldsworthy's views were found through the enjoyment of the film. He would like to have only a picture and a wonderful voice. So I was aware that when I looked at this second time. Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well today I could get a little more of the pictures and listen to what he said. I would like to enjoy the film without his opinion? What he does, what he says goes beyond "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stones, Changes, and Continuing to make me think the person is born again of Lao Tsu or Avatar. Some of his tasks / words are Zen like. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> However, the film is only (apparently) shown here at the Bay area. Be a set of Trends. Go to your local movie and tell them, they should not insist that they should write a film you heard from the error fields. It is called Rivers and Water. <br /> <br />
