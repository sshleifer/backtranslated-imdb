Leave for Braik to put a good show. Finally he and Zorak live their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast Coast. I must say that I like all this shows a lot of things. They are what started the Swimming Pool. Brak made a huge album with the year 2000. It may not be platinum, but his show was popular with tons of people out there who love swimming for adults. I tell you that from all Older Boys show without a conspiracy, this should be one of which no plot has been made. That's why I love it so much, it's just a classic in the history of adult swimming. I believe this is just a great show, if you dislike. Hey there were tons who hated and tons they liked.
