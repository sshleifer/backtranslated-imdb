The sun, the retail host in the DC area, is very small, put it gently. He gives an old hippo and gives a little room from a gay couple. However, he saves the famous Arab life, taking a shot in the back which was meant by the official. He enjoys the national media and his words of zany and his beautiful performances. Seeking opportunities, the Assistant President has been placed in the protocol department for the U.S. government. However, he eliminates things sometimes, but he tries hard and learns a lot. It even takes the romantic attention of the State Department official. But, what? Is there another bad idea to do, including an Arab man who wants to take another wife? One blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie shows Goldie as beautiful as pictures and as dumb "as a fox", as they say. Sunny learns its way around the jungle government of the U.S. very, very well. He even has important things to say about his loyalty and lack in his protocol environment. Perhaps, the Arab community will be less happy with this work, but for those who like to laugh, lease today.
