I don't know what people are complaining. I saw this movie yesterday and I liked it very much. Stone once again provided good behavior. He was just as good as he was at Primary Primary Institute. He still has wise but wise answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I don't care if he is like a fake like Barbie. He looks good and that's it. Basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, harassment, and many endings that will stop thinking and talking about it for hours! Half of people commenting on this film have not seen it. So don't listen.
