I remember the previous series vividly especially because it is a unique mix of wry humor and macabre issue issue. Kolchak had a good news from Ben Hecht's school's big city report, and his powerful decision and the behavior of the wise foam even made the most commonly visible part of the world. My personal fave was "Spanish moss killers" due to the original story. Poor young, cajun worried from Louisiana bayou, is involved in a study of sleep research, with a view to dream analysis. Something that is going wrong is, of course, and he is a real dream to the shadow of the shadow of the youth of his youth. This manifestation of pride deprives all people who have lost a provider in their consciousness, and persuades them to death. Kolchak investigates and cancels this horrible reality, very angry at the police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully tried for Keenan Wynn) and a sleepy researcher played by the second founder of the city, Severn Darden, for droll, dropped perfection. The seizure of evil, evil takes place in Chicago's sewage system, and shows a series. Kolkak did not have much better. Not available.
