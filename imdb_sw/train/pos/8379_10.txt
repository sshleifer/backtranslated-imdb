I remember this film from the time I was 12 years old, it was amazing. However, acting is a bit interesting but the story is fantastic as it is a real B movie and a small budget and an extraordinary event was a wonderful look, I must have kept it 20 times. to fight with large-controlled robots, compassion had to destroy it by making a "Crash and Burn" shot, do not look at the movie through the trousers! If your true fan of Sci-Fi then look at this, if it was renewed today it would be a winner. I'd like to see a remake see or even release its DVD.
