Person with fire, it is obviously one of the best performances of actors / crimes I ever saw. Despite having the beginning of a slower story is very amazing and sensitive that connects together well. This is the full responsibility of Denzel Washington, who plays the bodyguard, called Creasy who is harassed by the past and is a drunken drinker but never stops over his duty to save his recent defense, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, a very young, passionate girl who loves a lot of things, and makes a very interesting way, she has great beauty in front of her. As I said the story is hard, to understand it fully, you must look at it several times. This film is done in two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, everyone lives his life happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is a second part, all the film, where everything is everything hard and bad and bad, while Creasy has survived from its severe injury and started hunting and killing many criminals and "La Hermamdad" who had the leadership and implementation of Pita's kidnapping. Denzel Washington shows us many dates for performing talent as well as many talented actors who have great beauty in front of them. It is a real shame that this film has never been acknowledged, Washington has another Oscar for its performance, and also Fanning and director. And even the effects of seeing that were of high quality. If you like to please, a little exciting, exciting, this is what you see. The amazing thing is that the elements of this film are actually based on real stories and real characters! 10/10
