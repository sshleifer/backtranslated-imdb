This was one of the best movies of war I have seen because it focuses on more than the real war characters. All of them made a good job and because many of them are unknown relatives makes everything seem more reliable. The footage of the camera is good is the same as stimulating and editing. This video will reach you and prompts the audience to deal with the paperwork.
