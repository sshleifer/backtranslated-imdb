This was one of the best movies I saw. The movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a big part. Although this film appears to be released from the bottom budget, I have found it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Others might not like the story and say the script does not exist. However, when someone gets deep into drugs like these characters, no leadership is life. I feel this film is a proper representation of what can happen to someone if they are experiencing a major trial. Most of the cast is new to the industry. However, they all took very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into the habit accordingly. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool to use when dealing with someone or loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiral without control. This movie can only persuade enough to change their way.
