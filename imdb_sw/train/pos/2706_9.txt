I saw this film on the International Film Festival of Brussels. I also met the film director. I heard that Ed Wood wrote a story in 10 years! I am sure he thought it would be his interpreter - his victory. Well, if you take the film seriously (as Mr Wood did) it is one of the worst films you ever see. And this is cool. The Great Laughter I came on the first day I died that is not even a good film. <br /> <br /> This makes the film well, very good. Script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is the best. You see, this is either an art gallery ... or a trash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
