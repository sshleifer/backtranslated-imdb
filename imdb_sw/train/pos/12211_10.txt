For Hook or Crook is a very amazing film from a pair of powerful and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They can describe the original story in the style of different movies, and has been shot by Ann T. Rosetti, and it is written in amazement - a real poem. The leading characters are real heroes and serve as a rare type of model / inspiration of particles of domes and trannies anywhere. This film has a lot of energy, very passionate and sadness of San Francisco. I can't recommend it to be enough! The best master of all time!
