**** = Catholic is registered in books and never forget <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = Head on time; should only see <br /> <br /> *** = solid, worthwhile, when a piece of entertainment <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = good movie, but there are some variables or errors can be considered to be good in places, but this function has great issues or is prevented by unavoidable things that cannot be avoided (for example, genre) 1/2 = More than a pot of stimulated by time effectiveness <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible attribute <br /> - California = *** for the strong material of violence, sexuality, and language \ t This is more than a drama, and it's very bad for that ... I remember some of the emotional sounds of Duchovny voice. <br /> <br /> Pitt offers its sexiest possibilities for ever ever and amazing talent. Who started as a hopeless offender "white dirt" came to be recognized as a strong drunk, distracted mind. In some of the last stages in the film, I found it difficult to watch him - he was not predictable and horrible. This proves the most beautiful text and act. The whole game is filled with incredible, sad events that made my breath not less than once, and I don't mean a sense of action. I mean the demonstration of the dialogue so boldly that I won and put it on what I saw. It was like watching a pig and a lion to put on the castle and look like they were destroying death. Again, I am very impressed by the screenwriter; They all did the impossible: oil and water mix. I also enjoyed Juliette Lewis's performance. It is very common for this talented old actor to be seen today that when he does so it is a pleasure. Some of his time in this film brought tears to me. I mean that. This feeling the girl can strengthen your head is amazing, and I remember easily get regular eyes. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I am complicating the quality of the film's artists have been shown and just give "KALIFORNIA" rating ***. But the feeling of darkness that stimulates it is very powerful and sad to lift. I believe that everyone should see this film though. I am doing the truth.
