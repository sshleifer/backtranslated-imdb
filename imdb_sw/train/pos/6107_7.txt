Later, I saw those films ... I thought, "Why did this film have achieved a great success in Box Korea office?" Even they thought the movie had a sophisticated / unusual mode, acting was not good and the characters were not very attractive. For the Korean movie ... I loved pictures of fighting. If you want to watch the film without thinking, this is a film for you. But I had to accept ... The film was a kind of child ... 6/10
