I just saw a Million Fire in TCM and I had completely forgotten this gem. Ustinov builds a cunning and fragmented strategy that has said it carefully from two young people with knowledge ... Well you will see. Maggie Smith is perfect as a bumbler member / neighbor who has a hard time working but has a warm and powerful personality that passes through this picture. He creates a beautiful picture of a warm, confident and realistic man who has long ... well ... Molden and Newhart as top executives hold the challenge of doing what can be banal responsibilities and making them in their own comic life . <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just happy to see and I know at least in the case of Romero Ustinov adds hand to work. This film means being shot behind the age of the computer and it is a problem for a con conventional person or a person for it but in fact the characters are involved and much fun to see a small computer plot is almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Reduce your common expectations of modern comedy and look at the best and friendly presentations, forgive and deeply involve the plot in this picture.
