Gandhi My father is a well-made movie. It shows the life of the great man of Gandhiji Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand alone, his failure, his ego. Not only him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on the screen I ever seen. But I will cut three points if there was a shortage. First, the movie was twenty minutes longer than it should have been. Second, the movie required more research in Harilal behavior. Somewhere, this character was not found. Also, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. No mention of any other Gandhiji child in the entire movie. I believe the attitude like Harilal should have at least a difference of his brothers too, based on the nature of Harilal life. Anyway, despite some limitations, I loved the movie. Recommended ...
