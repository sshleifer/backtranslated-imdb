I have movies and acting it on telling stories. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy and can be seen by anyone reading and understanding the biblical account. In this film I thought that the story of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were excellent. To know and understand the story of David and his journey to be King of Israel, he made this story more powerful. You can feel his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck demonstrated the real humanity of this man who was at a time greater than life. The fear of Susan Hayward, reluctance, but the obedience of his authority as his King was shown to his beauty. One can also feel the pain of David next to that Uriah spent the night at the door rather than at home. With sadness when he was killed in battle. The door of power and authority of Raymond Massey made me feel his anger. Sets were enough, and the sky was believed. All in all I think this was one of the best movies of it kind. I paid ten marks.
