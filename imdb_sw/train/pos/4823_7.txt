It is not a matter of playing queen. On the one hand, the actor must be good and good, and on the other hand, he needs to show weaknesses in difficult situations with the courage of the courage and resolution to overcome the bad situation, as almost all the movies about crosses are the basic line of plot. Emily Blunt is very pleased as Victoria, but it's not a perfect performance if I like, no blame to her. I can't help but feel like this is the change of Mills & Boon novel compared to the black movie, more than about another little queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, ignoring does not give you a sense of feminine feelings, at least not in full, for she is, you know, little Victoria. To see the old Victoria, see Mrs Brown. Jean-Marc Vallee is a good choice of film director. He finished making C.R.A.Z.Y., which was better and made him popular. It was a completely different film but I remember it's a good look and that's probably the same between two movies. But when Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this was with Julian Fellowes, and though I enjoyed her Gosford Park, the story of this movie was not very interesting. Recently I lost all government politics. Maybe it was not less engaging because there was no possibility of a rule. I just say.
