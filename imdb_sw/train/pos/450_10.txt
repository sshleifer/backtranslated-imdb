I am happy to go to any film that depicts a beautiful Italy - in my opinion the most romantic world in the world. Unfortunately the movie was small, unusual for a piece of period, and a little bit on the movie element. However, the best story makes for it. Four women start a holiday resting with problems in their minds. More than a movie period, they realize their problems and begin to fix them. They believe San Salvatore, the fortress they occupy, has an amazing effect on people. "It's a love tub," says Lottie Wilkins. You can view their gradual changes from the unhappy exuberant if the Italian sea makes their magic work on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are plausible. Employees were excellent. The previous music seemed to be very accurate for the Italian romance area. All in all, the 10/10 movie of me.
