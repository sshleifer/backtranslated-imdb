I've never been confused to see this film in the movie if I remember hearing the name again. I finally looked at it this week and what a joy it was. For some reason, I was expecting it so bad that I was quite surprised when I sat and stuck and I found myself completely pulled. I read a lot of other user comments and emphasized how much people talk about his fighting in the ring, but what was strange about Diana is that he is a real fighter in life. All he needs to do is find his place where he is and the ring helps him get there. A very logical story and I wonder that this is the first time that Michelle Rodriguez - is a good job she did. Adrian and his coach were also very good. This movie is a little bad around, but it doesn't matter a bit. Stories, love, and fairs are completely lost for any mistake (which comes with the success of the film however). Example of forcing a girl to find herself and win over its environment by K.O. by Michelle Rodriguez!
