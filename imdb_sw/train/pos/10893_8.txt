It is a good thing I have hired a movie before seeing the viewer's level from this site. It was a good movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The rest was chosen by surprise and Ben Affleck has a good chance to lead. I would like to tell viewers who have not seen the movie go ahead and sell it. I'm voting up to the top with Christmas holidays. The movie was very funny and well written and Ben has a rich eccentric executive very well. What he says and does is how I thought someone who has a lot of money to do. The movie is much funnier than Santa Claus and Christmas And Kranks. Plus has a good story line and teaches the real meaning of Christmas that you can't buy love for money.
