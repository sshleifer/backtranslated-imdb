I have read a number of publications about this game similar to Max Payne, when I played the first time I thought it was a good game basketball game and the desire to stop Max Payne's style (not just shoot-out). So when I played for a few hours I realized it was fun! and how different from the "Max Payne", that's the time to shoot is exactly the same but I think it's different to the style of the game. This game is a non-stop action - a mix between the shoot'em up and fight'em up, very happy, as a big fan of Max Payne should say that the story of DTR is not close to the size of Max Payne, the graphics are slightly moderate and some level look the same, but if you want a little more of the “time of the shot” you should definitely own this game.
