The first time to see the first movie of Buster Keaton and I must admit I liked it very much and just want to be beaten for years ago. Rohauer's article initially warns that the Three newspapers of one nitrate have been recovered and saved in 1954 just before the combustion, and the most inappropriate ones who seemed to have shared hope were separated. Therefore, it is looking for stones, but I have seen and saved more. <br /> <br /> It would be the same as a short three film but if you take the step of an intolerance it is an invention and funny from the beginning to the finish: In the Stone Age and Baddie Wallace Beery riding elephants with goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus; In the Roman Age Buster riding a car with wheel locks and replaced by insertion, No sign of Parking in Latin; At this age of technology You need and humility his car is facing the bits for the first time. All with Beery is after a girl through years, never finished tussle. Little favorite: If the caveman gets knocked back on the edge of the edge but still blows a kiss for the camera - a second or two amazing! <br /> <br /> Great stuff, confirm my love of comedy comedy movies.
