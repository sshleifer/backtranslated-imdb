At least something good came out of the attempted seduction of Damon Runyon's loss of Mafia. "Guys and Dolls," a non-perishable stage music, was captured in the film 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful, fun film that included all the stars including Vivian Blaine (from by nature Broadway show, Jean Simmons (whose character resembles Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holidays") and two of all time leading people, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom recently won Oscars for the Best Assistant Assistant ("From Here Forever") and Best Actor ("On Water Water") and were on their game. Someone listening Brando singing "Luck Being Lady Tonight" speaks much about Dylan earlier got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nikely Nicely Johnson, who brings the house to "Stay down the beat of Banda." Sheldon Leonard includes another page on the rogue gallery of the band robbers. The film has a bright look, the cartoonish, anticipated the Movie Art of the early 1960s. The characters speak in the proposed output, it seems according to the Yiddish tips. Although the social media perspective and gender roles are dated, it is a great joy, and even the religious gentleness of the Salvation Army does not care and does not show true hatred towards organized religion. Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is a good reason to watch this film, but it has many talent to give out in 149 minutes.
