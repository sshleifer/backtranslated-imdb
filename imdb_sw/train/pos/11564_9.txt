I have seen this film many times and I like all the bad teachers want to give ten to ten but they feel that it would be similar to other good films. However, I think this is one of the few gems: full comedy. I will be able to make one of the great comic films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are similar to matching. Script is very bright that you need to strengthen blood. The story is known and described in other comments. Two directions offer amazing displays, girls are the best and the situation is very different. There is no single word (show that Hollywood, you do not swear to be good, you should be a wizard) and move from action to film is seamless. They don't make'em like this again. Not available.
