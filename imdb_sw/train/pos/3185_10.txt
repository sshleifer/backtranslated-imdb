A pleasant story ........ voted ten against the average of my age and sex ... not all comedy very much (compared to me almost wet movie myself) though funny enough. not a fan of music at all so maybe very little to me, but they give you time to drink a drink or soda without missing anything important. maybe five of the time when the harry met with sally? Ahab is not true but if that is in your top ten as it is mine you will love this movie. in fact it leaves you with a warm feeling, reminding you of what romance can and should be like, something to shoot. My summary outlines very well with very few words ...
