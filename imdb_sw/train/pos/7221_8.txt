Every time you think you have to deal with Death Death, another problem of conspiracy is coming. Better just stay back and enjoy the journey on this one. Many described on a kiss on Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which was unfortunate to cut off with the television version I saw), this movie has much more to recommend. Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy person. Once the player is successful, several of his games on the Broadway have decreased. And when his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is not anything but he supports, in the sense of finance and emotional, this does little to make Sidney feel better. In addition to insulting, the player, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), has just taken Sidney to play. It is the first of Anderson, and Sidney can see that the boy is a talented writer. He laughs at his wife that he must marry Anderson over, kill him, and present a play like his own. He laughs at first, but when Sidney welcomes Anderson on dinner, he worries that he can put his plan into action. And her fears could be fair ... <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant script. There are feet and turns back through a conspiracy, and it comes faster and more angry as you approach the end. It's a kind of film that you have along your seat from the beginning, and it puts you there all the time. Awesome and hidden title. <br /> <br /> Acting is best. Caine gives its normal normal performance, and shows a knack to play people with cultures, refined, and intelligent. Reeve also gives a good delivery to someone who is not very close or guilty as he looks. Cannon's violence makes it good for Myra. And Irene Worth gives good performance as a neighbor of nosy who is also psychic. This is the ultimate film that you will never expect, and regularly check to help him take things out of the past. Classic unsungung which unfortunately just remembered for the scene that affected some of the emotions at the time - and that's a real embarrassment.
