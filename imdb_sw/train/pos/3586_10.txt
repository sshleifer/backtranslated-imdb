I first noticed this when it congratulated over the past decade. I saw it again today and it had a great impact on me. He fought himself about a girl, Caitlin (played with Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a colleague who enjoys girls who hurt her. Caitlin is located on the famous high school island, but when she discloses she has been brained, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This movie says the Caitlin fight against the whole city, including a high school which enables athletes to determine social settings, enable them to get away from whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are top singers, and there is a real chemistry between two of them in the entire film. Both characters in this film, which led to real events, did a good job. He fought who really takes on the essence of what it is like to be in secondary school (at least in 1995), and having self-esteem and reputation. Recommended. 10/10
