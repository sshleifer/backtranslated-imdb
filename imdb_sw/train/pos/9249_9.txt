This film is magic, looks and touches. And now they often find Jean Harlow (or any actor of this time, for that matter) to give another woman punch a joke in the jaw? (Twice!) After Ruby's Harlow's relocation after being mixed with Gable Edward Hall (the most beautiful and delightful smile), his problem becomes more complicated when she finds out that she is pregnant, and is sure that this has left him, but in fact, his love has changed him and comes to see him, with the fact that he will be arrested, and with the help of the minister, they are married. The amazing relationship that Harlow shares with his fellow prisoners is only the second of his electrical and Gable chemistry, who was a regular man. His worst character is a perfect match for the gable pig to talk. What? Doesn't like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you can't have a bad dame look - if not for your face!" Ruby saying the words of Gypsy, his opponent. "If you want to get closer to me, I'll need to open another window!" <br /> <br /> Of course!
