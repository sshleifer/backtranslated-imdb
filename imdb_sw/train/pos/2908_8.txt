Travel discovery, this film follows the life of one family living in the city of sleep, the island town in British Columbia. The locals and the dreamers, the locals deserve to allow life to go around until the little, favorite, pure teacher comes with new ideas coming and bringing his life from the continent. Gradually, their demolition has arisen, the father (and the head of the local school) is looking for excitement, the mother calmly, the old daughter with love, and the least by force. Although it's not an amazing piece of movies, the movie enjoys a quiet and beautiful night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I involve anyone outside of Canada to find it easily.
