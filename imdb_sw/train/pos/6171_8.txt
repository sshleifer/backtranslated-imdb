For those who have read a highly respected novel and Rohinton Mistry, this film will definitely attract you, because of how best to deal with it. Without a small section, Sturla Gunnarson's first film film is a feature of the book entertainment (under the last row). <br /> <br /> For those who have not read novel, this movie may be a little bit. Certainly not a great story of cinema movies. Instead it has a great feature of authenticity, but I had no other way. The best way to describe this long journey to fans of the film will be to say it is a bit, the Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of Jewish / Russian milk, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a bank in 1970 of Bombay during the Islamic / Hindi and Pakistan wars. He has to deal with some unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his first human being, a distant friend who makes him a lot of money, and an unhealthy area. In the end, it is not fun, nor is it sad, but what is the essence of reality. This long journey is a nice little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck gets it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
