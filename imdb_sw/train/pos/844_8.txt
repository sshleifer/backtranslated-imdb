Finding a space between a businessman and a spine man changes their entire life. This is an odd film that works, an interesting effort for the author-writer Shepard. For a sufficient role that is a great cry from James Bond, Brosnan is as good as a person who is alone with the one who begins to work under his work, but he cannot unite with anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is as good as a businessman, a good partner with a void in his life. Davis is as beautiful as a loving Kinnear wife. Especially the study of the character, the film enjoys because it feels fresh and unpredictable, very comedy.
