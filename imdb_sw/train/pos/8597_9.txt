I enjoyed this film. I thought it was a good political stimulation about something that had never happened before - The Secret Service Service went bad and participated in the massacre. Unfortunately, with the behavior of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison," they think he is a mole but hayu. He / she is an ethical agent who has a relationship with the First Lady! As he does so, he cannot give a test of acceptable polygraph and makes the accused one a number when revealed there is a conspiracy to kill the President. "Prison" is forced to go to the lights but at the same time still trying to do the right thing to protect the President. Douglas does a good job in this role. I didn't care about the people who play but he is the best actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is the same (at least here) as an SS boss who hunts Douglas until he has proved that he has been telling the truth. When he does two tasks together at the end of discovering and then stop, if they can, plot. Handbags are interesting, too, by the way. Also, I have never been - never, unfortunately - look at the first woman who looks as beautiful as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> This is just a flick action step that includes start-ending. What? Are there holes in it? Without doubt; maybe their number, and because you see a very good view. However, it is actually being played here. It's not just enough intelligence for the scholars here on this site. My advice: Enjoy, just go on a journey and enjoy all the actions and preferences. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end but for otherwise it gets high scores for entertainment ..... which is what all movies are about.
