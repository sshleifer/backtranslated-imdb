I enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film were high marks including the most important, for me however, screenplay and acting. This is obviously one of the responsibilities of Richard Widmark. He is quite persuasive in his performance. Just because of curiosity, consider how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could win this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. He was so impressed here that I would expect his other work. Thelma Ritter, in the role of waslamourous, deserved the appointment of Oscar received by play. This film works on each level. Black and white photographs are very accurate and the story dictates the right of the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have a great chemistry in their hard romance. It is highly recommended, 9/10.
