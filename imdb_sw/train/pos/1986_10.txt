Visits to power! OK child playing Oliver is very sweet too! Starting with the big movies, colors, clothing and the most spectacular displays this must see the film. I have seen many changes to this great novel, but this stands on them all with its boot music! It is an experienced Fagan, never abandoning his character to make a song. You never know whether you love him or not, the same feeling that I found in the book. In other versions you hate him from beginning to end. Bill Sykes .... when you read the book hes one meaning, and so he is in this film. Oliver Reed was wise. His wife inspired this masterpiece. I went and saw his last movie, Gladiator according to his beautiful performances, not to see the head of the head. Music is appropriate for times and feelings. Who will buy this beautiful film? You should!
