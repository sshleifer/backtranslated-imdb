Now either you like Mr Carrey's humor or you don't. I, myself and Irene had all the audience who walked out in groups and, on the other hand, were happy to fall into happiness. Bruce Force is the most dominant, but warns. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure, check the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and I still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you do not see in front of a dog put a seat down after using a funny, don't bother with the movie. Carrey, a journalist standing in a 'light light' button hates God when his whole life seems to be going. God takes the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey enters into the swing of having all the power of God by making her female milk (Jennifer Aniston) great, gaining herself, and answering everyone's prayers with a single computer stroke command. This is not a highbrow movie or even it does not remember, but it is very well made within very small motives, provides a continuous laughing to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be bad for all but many thin-minded squadders and anti-god-squadders. At a more concentrated level, the film tries to reflect on Carrey's own work - it's stuck in its "comedy" that has failed to make sense as a good actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His direct work ', direct', the Month of Man, is more known to be his romps of comedy - or Show Truman (which the Academy voted three choices during the beat of Carrey).
