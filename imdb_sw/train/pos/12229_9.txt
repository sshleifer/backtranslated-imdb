To me there is something very interesting and unhealthy on sci-fi's low budget. As a child in the 50's all there was. In 1957 I saw the "first person in space" in the field of movies with my father. It was with Marshall Thompson star and other slob slum who got a title position. It is also about the mission of the caused space where the astronaut returns to be a grizzly killer. Searched best and very good from me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still live in me. A Good Melting Man is just about to renew the full color of glory ... that's where the events were so well covered. Just gotta love for what is ...... little on the hour of dark scenes, hateful sounds, and music of beauty. Bravo!
