One can only hope that there are many times when a powerful person like Morgan Freeman can take time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all comes to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met someone I didn't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what do you dislike? His smile can melt the diamond. He is just wonderful that I can look at anything that he sits on. That goes to Freeman. he is just magic on the screen. They both threw a film that was amazing since the beginning to the end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was a tender, charming and very simple. <br /> <br /> You need to look at this.
