Just mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that do this among the major effects of Errol Flynn in a successful career. I would like to imagine this role of playing Jim Corbett's striker is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers was typecast like. Flynn appeared as a party to the party from his memoirs and was one person whose real life was more exciting than his life screen. An additional thing that I wanted to describe is the great attention, change, and still incorporates the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a regular partner with Flynn, and the movie film Sid Hickox, montages was created by the top editor and named Don Siegel. I've never known Siegel went back but he's listed right in credit. He continued to do a good job as a director of own action.
