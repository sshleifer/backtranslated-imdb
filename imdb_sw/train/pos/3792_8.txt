I saw this film earlier today, and I wondered how the conversation was right for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it seemed more like a document (the place I liked the best). The leading women in this film seemed to be real to me as girls of fifteen who I know. All, the most enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.
