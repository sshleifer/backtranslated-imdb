I decided to look at this because of suggestions from this site. I would say it was worth the effort. However, you should take into account that this film will continue for 210 minutes. If you do not have the authority to stay, get on the tape and watch it for a few nights. Now for the film, what I say will have "vendors" and if you don't mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a valley of fornication, womanizer and gigolo. She lives with an old woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and gives Alex. Alex uses his days in restaurants and restaurants. This story shows that Alex had once given Gilberte to whom he lived. Gilberte drove a very unpopular person who did not love because Alex had treated him and accused him. At this point, Alex was ready to get a job and help raise his child before knowing Gilberte had stopped and planned to marry someone else. Luckily, Alexandre meets a nymph of a nurse called Veronika and they hit the relationship. Veronika loved Alex for the first time after having sex with men in the past. Marie and Veronika are struggling for Alex's love and they had a third home for boot. Finally, at last, Veronika has been pregnant with Alex and Alex's son and asked him to marry her. We think (as described by Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will get a job and be a service provider of love and his new family. There is hope! The name of "La Maman and the putain", I explain Jean Eustache was associated with Françoise Lebrun's Veronika character. She was a prostitute and then became a mother. So, mother and adultery are one person? However, I know what! French films are more (not all) very chatty, without feeling political, preaching, presentations, worries, wailing and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played well with their characters and made a film together as part of the script was lost and confused. <br /> <br /> Not a bad attempt. 7/10.
