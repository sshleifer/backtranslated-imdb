This is a good film. The non-stop patter takes several checks to fully understand. Busby Berkeley music production will never be mentioned. I think this movie is easily leaving all its efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are wonderful together. Some humor would almost push the limits of today's movies. Put the definition of how they did it and enjoy it.
