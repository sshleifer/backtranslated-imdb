This is a quirky movie which Brits performs well. The low budget, roles of comeo type, are well beaten. The story is very weak, Judi Dench, who was soon a widow, decided to round up all the fake guns "(almost completely) who did during the war in London. The son / daughter should think who has gone to the potty. made as well as the film allows young people to see that they do not have a monopoly on feeling, love and even despair! To "old wrinklies" can also laugh good .. Judch dench was as good as always, the mercy we didn 's getting over the other "blonde bombeshells, the latter was slightly rushed I thought. I kept thinking as I saw that David Jason would make Patrick better than Ian Holm, although he was as good as a "transvestite" player, both in a good cheery movie worth night and girls :)
