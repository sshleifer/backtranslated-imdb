This movie is not for everyone. You are either bright enough to get "it" or not you. The sci-fi filmmakers who are very independent will enjoy this film. I recommend this movie to those who can appreciate the spoofs and parodies. Everyone has suggested this film is fun. If you like to enjoy Monty Python's film or Mel Brooks film, you probably enjoy this. Sound characteristics are made in the language-and-cheek style and one liners fly fast and angry.
