You have seen this movie during release and saved it from now on. What group of wonderful actors (I always find one of the most interesting aspects of the film). He was delighted to see the wonderful actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role with Wallace Shawn is always hoot. Script is smart, sly and tongue-in-cheek, shouting almost everything "Beverley Hills". He loved Paul Bartel's "doctor" and Ray Sharkey's servant. This was a pleasure and luck, but thank God! Unless you are bright, I recommend this movie to the heart. FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov & Paul Bartel were in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in the "Night of Comet" together. They were all three in "eating Raoul".
