Family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father of Jake Weber, son of Erik Per Sullivan) comes out of the family to connect in a house in the middle of winter. They discover the accident while driving there. This imposes some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and slow things (VERY slowly) don't go wrong. I expected the bad when I started looking at this. Most of the comments for this, on this site, are very negative. Okay ... I disagree. First is not a terrible film. Fear does not even start until 30 minutes. It drives more like a family festival and awesome features are healed. At that level, it is very good beautiful. First - bad things: speed is a very small way; Jake Weber is an awesome actress; WHAT is a series of many false dreams; The wendigo difficult figure in the film and the clear outlook we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> Good things: Pretty beautiful great script; Clarkson is better as a mother; a certain positive direction and sound effects that are very scary; The sequence of flaming sex between Clarkson and Weber (which is really important for the integrity of the plot!); do a good job with Sullivan (only 10 times!) and Speredakos with an endless and anticipated end. I think many people are facing this film because it is inserted as a horrible film - which is not. So, if you can ignore it, I think you can love it. I give them 7.
