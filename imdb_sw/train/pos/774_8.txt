I think it's a good movie; I think it's a very romantic movie through the atmosphere and atmospheric atmosphere; I think it wasn't intended to be physical (theory is the result, not the goal); I think it's very common; I think it's gentle; I think it was interesting; I think the participants did not think ... they were well (don't Sean Connory & co) nor the movie is block block, they're like a movie ... usually ppl that can act ...; I think the movie reached its intention; I think it made me feel (or heard it again :)); I think it's not a goal; <br /> <br /> I was so happy ... that I know.
