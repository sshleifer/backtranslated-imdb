Wow! I loved this movie with PENDA Judy Marte !! This girl is not just a very strange face, she is funny and really talented !! He made me laugh often just to be very common with Victor who had hit so much on it! We will see a lot in the coming years ... and probably also from the director Peter Sollett and star-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! It is so exciting! It is true, beautiful, beautiful, well illustrated, it has all found: good news, good actors, good film orientation! <br /> <br /> If you like easy, slow paced, real life, urban movies, as maybe Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! It is better!
