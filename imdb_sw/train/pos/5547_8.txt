The wonder of sand was done by the low-budget PRC studio and it is indeed one of their best movies I have seen. The person who was charged with murder did not refer to the spirit as a revenge for the people who accused him. He uses a string to beat his victims and after several deaths, including an old man who runs a ferry along the rain, disappears. An adult grandson takes a ferry himself and also loves one person in the village and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of intuitive atmosphere, which makes it very creepy too. Release included Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Surprise. The wonder of sand is a must for old fans of fear like myself. Better. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars and half out of 5.
