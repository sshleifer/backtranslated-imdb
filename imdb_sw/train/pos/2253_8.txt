I lost this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the wonderful story of the Mormons. This movie tries to erase how Joseph Smith can turn his "vision" into the world's major religions. It focuses on the difficulties that Mormons found in their homes in Navuoo, Illinois. Showing Joseph Smith's attempt. During the trial, Brigham Young stands to tell him about his conversion to Mormonism, and by his faith in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is killed, and the Youth should face his doubts about whether he is chosen to lead the Mormons in the new world. In spite of his great doubts, he endures, and finally has a vision (that utah is a place for his colony) which gives him confidence in his leadership. Later, if the crop is destroyed by cricket, he also has no doubt that he is truly chosen - however, it happens a miracle, which puts his place in history. I have seen moving movements, and stories have been convincing and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons believe this is a suitable picture. The ceremony is part of the story, but this is important for LDS. The issue is not stressed. I am sure people are turning away from this film because of the religious issue, but it has a great responsibility and it will share all your interests.
