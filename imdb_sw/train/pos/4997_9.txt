This is a good movie for any fan of Hong Kong movies. From a small plot, weak motions and bits of antics of the comedy, the movie is a full-blown action and military fighting. I was pleased to be accepted from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was wonderful in the film. <br /> <br /> Have a director of action as Corey Yuen is what does Hong Kong's move. This modern movie works is recommended !!
