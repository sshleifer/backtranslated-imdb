Eyeliner was almost 6,000 years ago in Egypt. It is not really the amount of extinction to be around the 12th century. Is there a second season you are growing air now? It's amazing to me when comments are made by those who do not know the information or do not see the show. It's losing space on board and sometimes. The first edition of the series was probably sad as it began to fall, but that is expected from any show. The first season is the best. I can't wait for the second season to start in the United States.
