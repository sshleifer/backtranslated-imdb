I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is very amazing in it. It plays the role of a modern witch for hilt. (And it is very good.) 2) Movie helped to encourage the game of fun and enjoyment, Mage: The Awakening. I showed it on various LARP buttons, and it's always a great hit. The love of D&D and Jeff-run aside, is not a prestigious job, but is well done and very enjoyable. The plan is to move quickly and with its simplicity, special effects are good for the low budget, and the script, when nothing, is not widely available, and seeks everywhere. The best way to spend the evening.
