If you find yourself needing to escape, something that will explore you for two hours and allow you to disappear in another world, Domino will meet those needs. This is entertainment, after all! The program goes on your brain - one of these movies (like ordinary suspects) where you want to see it a second time to count it all. I wondered about Domino Harvey himself, how his life was of interest to Hollywood. For acting, lots of visibility shows are not displayed on tractors. And any actor who makes me forget who did their work well. Not once I thought Kiera in a soccer or pirate dress. And given, Mickey Rourke plays well with Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite violence, he shows signs of being able to care for others.
