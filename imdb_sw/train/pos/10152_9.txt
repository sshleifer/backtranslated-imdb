I have been willing to see this since I first saw the listed in his work. He eventually found it on the 2/13/02 at the Modern Life Center. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments about it being "good news for 2 people crossed" were dead. Authors may not have to get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making a film. Anyone who knows the romantic Movie should see it. The Natasha Dynasty of the screen is warm and its smile so lightning, don't say its beauty, that anything that is inside goes to my favorite list. His TV and newspaper interviews I have seen are fun and should be expected. God blesses, his family and future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy and I think others would like too.
