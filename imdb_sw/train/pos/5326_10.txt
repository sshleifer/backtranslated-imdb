"The birth of Beatles", since the American television film, released in 1979, has been true, so far the best movie describing the story of the youth from Liverpool which changed the music industry and the world. As explained by the former view of Beatle Pete Best. Performance from the entire cast is better but, especially performance with Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was given to the story of Rock and Roll era, Mr Dick Clark. Who a year before the year 1978 had produced another television movie, which stood the test of time around "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role of other music stories; "ELVIS". The same was led by an unknown director called "John Carpenter" who has continued to lead other achievements such as; "Halloween", "Leave New York", and "The Thing". That could be said to the director of "Beatles of the Beatles", Richard Marquand. He continued to lead other exhibition councils such as "Return of Star Wars of Jedi", "Eye of the needle", and "Jagged Edge" among many. Just another film describing the story of Fab Four which I know, is the Beat Beat which was released for the exhibition in 1994. However, critics did not care, nor the public, so did not have long life during the theater. The birth of Beatles is a very interesting and simple film that gives you the original essence of the story and the problems that they went and ended there with great success when they reached NYC and seen in Ed Sullivan's show in 1964 I strongly recommend this film.
