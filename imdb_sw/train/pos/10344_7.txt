Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell have joined the star in "Mr. Williams Williams," a 1939 / comedy comedy which is very good, though it forgot, perhaps because of the number of amazing films from 1939. A talented police detective married to his work, while his partner is waiting for a wedding that has always been caused. What is happening in this film is not discrimination - it is called in the area of ​​the massacre only if he wants to walk again in the aisle. Both stars were very good at comedy, they worked together well (and often), and helped to make this sexually fun battle. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are ready for better support. <br /> <br /> If you read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas don't have much of a woman. <br /> <br /> Entertainment less on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here has disturbed Melvyn Douglas, one of our chief executives. He emerged perfectly in a number of films like someone else and a good friend before embarking on the film as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather, a very hard worker (who made it easy) who had a Broadway job at the same time with his film work. He was not sent only as a leading person in the film or was given a very large responsibility under the label system. I urge anyone to see his great performances in "Hud" and "I did not hate my father" and call him lazy or mentions for his smirk.
