... and I love it. Lots of special effects, and for films that have not been done on the mega budget, this film works best to create a wonderful gift. I am one of the boys who did not understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick of a look. It is obvious there on high levels of bored with rings, and based on movies like Harry Potter. Which says a lot for the film again, made for a small part of the budget of these international hits. One thing that I like most about this film is that it puts the envelope of the next adventure from Hong Kong. The theme is foreign and original. Quality production is different from anything that appears to be from HK for practical film, and act is good. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies from Hong Kong, this is the Infernal Affairs of the Hong Kong fantasy movie, and I hope that they will continue to work in this area, until they beat the movie films. Just fine.
