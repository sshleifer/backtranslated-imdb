If you want to watch the film and feel good about looking, then Tigerland is a film for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The image of this film appears to be real; it's almost like a document of something that happened in real life but for a celebration. Boy, I tell you ... REAL drama really real "fought" in one of the events (get a DVD to listen to its definition is not obvious). I see this film as a group of desperate young people trying to escape the ill-fated fate, after looking at Saving Private Ryan I appreciate what "ill-fated fate" is and know exactly how people in the film impressed. I see this film as a crossbreed between "Stand By Me" and "Save Private Ryan." Do men do when they are and the situation "hard pressed" in real life? Some people go crazy, some right men, some men in fist, others do not have medication, some random sleep and cruel hookers try to erase the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink off pain, some fly away buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and some feel very painful makes them very sick fall - physically. This film has all the feelings of despair that got into one ball. But do not misuse his movie, of course, his favorite movie, cocky and funny Bozz (Character of Collin) shines everything, and on that there are 5 female actors in the movie; I'll enable them to figure out what they're there! For discussion, the battle order / action, full picture pictures and music; This movie has all, as I said: from top to bottom. I am not why Tigerland is under reputation. The best thing about owning a movie is that on the lid it says with great boldness of the film "the best film of the year," and it has not completely lost. Put a few gems coming to Hollywood, 10/10.
