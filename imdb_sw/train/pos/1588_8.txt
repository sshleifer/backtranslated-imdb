* What I Like About Sisters * Baby Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) is going to live with her sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid going to Japan with her father; but he does not know half of the wacky things that will happen to him from now on, and not only to him, but to his sister, his friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), Henry's partner (Michael McMillian), robing Vince ( Nick Zano), the lover of Valerie Jeff (Simon Rex), the first boss (then the fire farmer is the husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), his angry colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and the second boss Peter (?) We have a funny bone in the body , please skip this; if you just like the modern comedy this comedy is not for you; If you like a funny picture, sometimes you touch two hot chicks that can act (and no one except 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what is the darkness you expect? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
