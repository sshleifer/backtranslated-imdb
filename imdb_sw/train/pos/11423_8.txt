This movie shows life in northern Cameroon due to the view of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is officially recognized by the colonial (French) government, and his family is one of the most beautiful white families. It gives a sense of life that was like all to the colonists and to the locals they shared. It is consistent with another movie I saw in Africa for the same period (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how to be true or common. It's not just a feeling - things happen in the film - but the plot stands. The viewer has left to draw his own conclusions instead of having film reporters forced, although making a story like flashback from a woman's south-west visit to Cameroon as an adult gives a certain view.
