At first you think another movie of Disney, may be good, but it's a children's movie. But when you look at it, you can't help but enjoy it. All years will love this film. I saw this film for the first time when I was 10 years and now 8 years later I liked it! Danny Glover is good and couldn't play any better part. Christopher Lloyd is a masterpiece and is perfect for that part. Tony Danza is so reliable as Mel Clark. You can't help, but enjoy this film! I offer 10/10!
