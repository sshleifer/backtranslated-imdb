Although this film has some weakness, it is important to see. I chose because of the cast, and thank Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing different roles and those they had taken over the past. They all show people very worried, perfect and bonds, but they make them appear because of their humanity. The story is touching, but it is an exhibition that is growing. "Jane" Bonham Carter is a wonderful achievement, whose romance efforts have opened my eyes to the aspects of being disabled who had no previous ideas, but was also interesting for other reasons. I heard that the film also ended up suddenly, but it was better than emotional emotionally (see "The First End.") The English layout added to my enjoyment - it was England in the 90s, urban and rural, without trouble.
