I have had a cyclone and hurricane for more than 40 years, since my Grade 5 teacher, Texan's origin, told the stories of those he saw during his youth. Fortunately, I have lived all my life in the middle of the Atlantic, many of which are typical and typically not as violent as those of the Midwest, but I have been meeting almost two times, one in PA and another NJ, in the past. ten years ago. I enjoyed the family events, especially the conflict between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the hurricane was near, Dan knew a lot of what he had done, and probably learned this in school, because I know that hurricane security is an important part of U.S. where these storms are more often. However, participants in the film did two things that some people think should be done or are safe to do in hurricanes but really should not be done or are safe. <br /> <br /> When the first siren was hit, Dan and Arthur entered the house and opened windows. For years, this is what people were told to do, but the cyclone safety areas now advise against doing this. Also, people were shown to hide on the highway. This method was made popular with the early 1990s video made by employees of T.V. during a weak effort in Kansas. However, in a severe hurricane, people can be imported from under these. This occurred during May 1999 in Oklahoma. Created in this movie falls during the fall, which is not the usual time for them to happen. (Then again, one of my close encounters was held at the end of September.) Also, they traveled from north-east to the east, while most of the storms in the north-east area left south-east. However, this is not all odd. A typhoon that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 1990s traveled in the same direction (as he was involved in my second meeting). I think the movie should be launched in spring. This film was based on a book on which it was based on the actual event held on June 3, 1980. But it was still compelling.
