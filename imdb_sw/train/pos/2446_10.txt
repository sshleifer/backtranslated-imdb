From the beginning of the Carmen show was there. He was one of the best characters. Why did they run away from him? The show is not the same as before. His way is worse. The best events were Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! That's like South Park without Kyle or Play of Children without Chucky! Not right! The brother you chose is just, ugh! Anger. He is not recommended in the story of the story altogether. He was one of the main characters, and the nephew can't manage him. He was an amazing actress. The most beautiful way than a sweetheart. Return to, or you will lose TON's audience.
