This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and for some expansion I have seen the lives of the villagers. People are very poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie shows just the same. Full loan for the director and actress. They have done a good job. I wonder how movies can be like Lagaan and Paeli can go to Oscar and not Doghi. I don't understand the criteria that movies are selected. What? Money that makes a difference or has many names in the movie makes a difference. <br /> <br /> Hope to see more movies like this later.
