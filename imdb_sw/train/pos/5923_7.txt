The woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town, and they have to deal with an important teacher (Glenn Shadix), their pride, a beautiful girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and hell one big secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, so technically, this is a "bad movie". But, who cares? It's very fun! Impossible things (including cereals) occur, people break up with kitty cats, there are bad ingredients, there are too many cheese to handle! So, yes. You will have this fun. Much. It will not encourage you, touch you, fear you, or attract you in any way, but it will keep you attractive and laugh!
