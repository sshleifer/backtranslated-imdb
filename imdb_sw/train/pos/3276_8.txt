49. PAPERHOUSE (excitement / fear, 1988) A foot with a bed with Anna 11-year-old Charlotte Burke has only her drawings to continue with her company. Her health hurts as fast as a series of 'black' victories. In each of these cases he dreamed of a house in a desolate field, and a boy who had no name of Marc (Elliot Spiers) who lived in it. When the dark, unknown danger threatens the "paper" useless, Marc's life is in danger. His life is also at risk if these dreams have revealed his health status. <br /> <br /> Expert: Raises the first element from the British director Bernard Rose. Taken from the story ("Marianne Dreams") and Catherine Storr, it leaves many functions of "nature" of fantasy in her wake. Every time the story deals with dreams and dreams it is difficult to give a mix of fable and reality to work in the form of the film. Director Rose has done an effective feature of the fantasy of the world with the darkness that tries to evict them. <br /> <br /> Clapped by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely and 'jump out of your seat' time. Few of them feel more in this important part of listening to the audience without knowing what the next area will bring. I also love how she holds the ceremony and never lets go or lose gently in the second sequence of events. Also, his ability to put things in shape (as in P.O.V.shots) provides a movie that shows the direction that you will look like you don't have. It is the only European to find such interesting places as here presented: a private house, a farm, a coastal town, a watch tower. Rose would follow this film with "Candyman" (1992), the true concept of 'person to think' and the feeling of kindness of true worship.
