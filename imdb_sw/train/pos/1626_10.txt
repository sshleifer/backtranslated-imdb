This movie is really FUNNY! If you would like to relax your brain for an hour then then go ahead and watch. It is called blonde and surprising, so do not expect a deep and meaningful joke. What this movie and enjoy all the discounts we have about two blondes. It's just a movie to watch for a date or for a company of friends (especially if it's not too heavy.) Lol) Pamela and Denise are still hot dogs. It's wrong to judge this movie as a piece of art. Yes, this film is about BLONDES! It should be lighter, pleasant and high. Something more, I don't think girls will enjoy it and like this film but the boy will be obvious.
