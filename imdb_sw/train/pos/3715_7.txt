Surely this was a very small number but I can't help to think I have seen it before. He reminds me of another VCA film that I saw Poitier called "Other days of RUBY RAE". They also had the corners of "Welcome to Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in the same implementation. Which does not say that they do not have a good memory ... just that they feel very sophisticated and very fashionable ... which makes you feel like this is close to advertising (as a technique in style and story) than the work of the original and real writer to come. <br /> <br /> The movie is just ... very perfect for my love. Extensive coral filtering (or coal) for my love ... also the opposite set 12mm. So the whole feeling has left me a little - beware of the art that itself expresses itself easily! The French (they are a conservative group) seemed to buy as it was the jury however ... but the short selection of Cannes film is conservative compared to the selection of the element though wondering what was happening in the last few years.
