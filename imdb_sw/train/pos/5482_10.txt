This is an amazing film. In addition to showing a real picture of the most important events in voting failed to remove Chavez, we are given a background picture describing a class-class society. Many of the rich, apparently, have the choice and democratic elections of the people, and are willing to use the military to change the rule. 'Beware of what you say before your servants' is a definition of definition. The director of the country's largest oil company rests as a new president, backing the US, and the new Irish film creators have all over the camera. A good video to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documents about how the media can be used, and the power used, for the interests of the big business, against the interests of democratic interests of the people. Extensive periods.
