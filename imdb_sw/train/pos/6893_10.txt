Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, tender, brave and partner. It gives the best direction to the movie which is the hub, as well as other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as for stories or rhythm. Never wait, always create a new impression: for me, the best French movie of all time.
