Spirit trains are a good and entertaining video, the best of England's 1930's and 40th. <br /> <br /> For low-budget production, Ghost Train is an atmosphere, highly effective, and provides real doubts. Enjoy so much for the dark night (and, yes, the storm). See, take the critic's hat, and enjoy it.
