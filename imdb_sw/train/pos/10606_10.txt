I have finished watching this film and seeing it very enjoyable. It is quiet, a small film that has not prevented you from the special effects or "big" performances. It only takes you in the lives of people living in a small back home in North Carolina. Henry Thomas gives good performance like Raymond Toker, a little lonely child who is left in the forest. Toker's search for the parents of the child takes a journey that will have a great impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, the small conman and the ultimate goal. And David is playing with an evil man in full. There is much more to this film than the first encounter with the eye. Published in the North Carolina area and with the sound of traditional music, it is important to watch.
