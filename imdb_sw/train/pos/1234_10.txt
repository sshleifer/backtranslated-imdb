I was watching this movie, and I still love it today as I was a child. Listen to critics comments. Not right on this film. Eddie Murphy really shines in its roll. You can stay with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone to see. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons, and a little child bald with God as a powerful. So go find yourself and remove this! You witness!
