First things first, I have never been afraid of this low gem as a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). As my head says this was one of my childhood fav movies that I still like as a boy. It is a beautiful, exciting movie for German Shepherd who was not characterized by Charlie (a fantasticaly shown by Burt Reynolds) who was killed by his boss / partner in a crime (it's ha ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent directly to heaven because "all dogs go to heaven because they are against the people, the dog is normal and honest and kind". Chalie gets back to the world because she reduced her hour of life where she gets worse with her best friend, Itchy and a little girl, Anne-Marie. I was looking at all this as a child and I still sometimes watched. Anyway, it's a very good film as I said earlier that can only stop tears in your eye ...
