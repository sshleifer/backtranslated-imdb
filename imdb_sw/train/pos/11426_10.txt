I think this film will be more enjoyable if everyone thinks like a colonial African picture in 50 and 60 years instead of stories. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on the other has small light signals that don't mean so much until you can fit the picture. At first I saw Chocolat I did not "get" until you think about it for a few days. Then I saw there are many things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was around the corner, not the plot. However, it is one of all my favorite movies. The situation in the airport and short shower and good music was a poem. If you like "exciting" movies, don't look at this - you will be tired with tears. But, for some of you, you can thank me later for suggesting you.
