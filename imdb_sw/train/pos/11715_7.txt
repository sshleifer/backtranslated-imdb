This is a little fun of comedy / comedy collaborating with Cassandra Peterson and Elvira: Mrs. Giza, a fearful fear of all time. This meant that Elvira's experimental vehicle and it had great success that was taken by the NBC Network. They experimented with experiments with a television series to include a black busty child but unfortunately sit-com has never made an experimental action due to sexual references. This film however, is very exciting. Elvira is Chesty Morgan of modern day and queen of one liners. This film was followed a few years later with "Haunted Hills" of Elvira which meant the removal of the old Roger Corman movies but faced with the face. Check out this movie instead of more fun experience!
