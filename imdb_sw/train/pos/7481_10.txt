I could not agree more with the quote "This is one of the best films made." If you think Vanilla Sky is "re-doing" only, you can't get worse. There is deep in this film: visually, music, and emotionally. Visual, because the film is soft and delicate sometimes (early scenes with Sofia) and sometimes powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sound connecting to this film in full. Without music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created a sensation, but an eclectic, scored for a film that would not be more suitable for such a fantasy theme (although it has never been given, I was able to get my hands a preliminary mark for about 60 dollars. Another choice of Crowe music, such as Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etcetera etc, is also useful for the film (Crowe has an ear for good music). The most important thing, the emotional theme in this film (ie love, sadness, regret) is very powerful, and has multiplied ten times the experience of visual and music experience, as well as skilled talks; I agree, the elevator area brings tears to my eyes from time to time. The best part of this film however (if it can get any better) is that it is very effective so that each time you see a film, you will find something new - so look around, and be ready to think! Indeed, the theme becomes clear after the first or second look, but there is always more stories than you think. This is the best work of Cameron Crowe, and the work of perfect beauty. Most of my films and music guide comes from this work alone. It has been honest to touch my life, as the true art has a habit to do. It continues to surprise me that there are many people who can't understand this film for what it is (I think the real art is the art itself) <br /> <br /> Below: Sky vanilla is in the league of himself.
