It has never watched this film until recently in TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer with Nazi colonial cities such as many European cities for example: Norway. The First World War was ready and people in this city were still struggling with the lost and wounded soldiers that the War is constantly building. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was an old school teacher. He was raised by Germany and was very unhappy with the Polish people and they did not fully accept it. If the Hitler party had a strong Wilhelm Grimm wanted to be a Nazi to return to punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really true in his mind. Marsha Hunting, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played the best role as a woman who lost her husband and had a sexual relationship with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many obstacles and realities about how Nazi destroyed families and their whole lives. The cattle cars are depicted in this picture with the Jewish people led by Nazi gas rooms. If you haven't seen this film, and if this is the case, make your time; This film is very low in the world for the 1944 film and the story you don't forget very quickly.
