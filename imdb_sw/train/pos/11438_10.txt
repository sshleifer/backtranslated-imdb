Ralph and Mumford, caused in their own country, are not wanted to be the unidentified pawns of Botch Synanomess. Twice about time is their story, the characters they meet, and their efforts to put things right. With amazing surprises and amazing sounds that make up some of the best in the business, this evil film affects the mark. The animation process, when similar to the cutting of "South Park style", is smooth and more than three-dimensional. If I wasn't aware that animation was this style, I would swear it is a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this film in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! You can't miss anything if you don't, but if you're doing, you'll get a lot more experience!
