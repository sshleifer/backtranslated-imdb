TIllman Jr player on the first South African Navy (Gooding Jr.) teacher, who despises all situations and achieves his goals despite a fierce trainer. Screenplay is not bad, too extreme, but the direction and acting is the first level, and this film encourages and achieves what it should do. I loved DeNiro in leadership, although it is not the same as his good work (taxi driver, godfather and all others) is similar to his other beautiful displays such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and reliable here, good performance, Gooding Jr. not bad, definitely one of his beautiful performances. IMD testing: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
