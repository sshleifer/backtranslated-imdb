After reading the Diamond book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but all in all, it's a complete statement. To read other comments, it is comforting to know that 'cultural fighters' are difficult to work, to see 'attacks' on 'Western civilization' under each rug. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little testimony? Certainly. As many of the scholars, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the words 'guns, germs, and metal' when it looks every chance during the series. We get, after the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a very simple (in series)? Certainly. The parts of Spain in South America are particularly exciting, erasing long history, hard to 'stomach, sword, and horse', taking all South America's victory for 15 minutes. (but not quite elaborate) the reasons for Spain's well-being against the established cultures. Does he preach against * Western civilization in any way? Don't. Not a word. It's not my ear. All it says is that luck played a major role in determining what cultures passed more quickly, * not * that luck is the only reason. At the end, if you are looking for something that proves your sense of quality, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all things rather than to influence the community to succeed or fail, this series highlights the most important evidence of historical evidence.
