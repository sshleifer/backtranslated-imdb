Why do these managers these days make horrible movies like "shine"? There is a simple answer to it: the directors of these days are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick showed once and for all to this film that he is true of the greatest directors and writers of all time. Therefore, the plot is very simple. A man named Jack Torrance (carefully played with Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, secret hotel to look for a distant season. The player is that the former hotel's guardian was killed by his wife and two girls. What follows can easily be found by the film's header, but you should look at it to see what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie for a very long time to hit me as "scary". It is some of the most stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the horror is awesome music. Music has become a major part of Kubrick movies (2001: Space Oddysey and Orange Clockwork, just in the name of a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The result will sound and this film will not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say about the story of Nicholson's story. Jack is convincing as a killer of things. In fact, his only event steals a few scenes of this movie. This is the top characters that should appear to believe. It will never have a horrible movie that is very similar to this. R.I.P. Stanley.
