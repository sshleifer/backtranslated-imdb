Love trap is "you must see" free film. When I was down to watch the film, I came up with low expectations, but I had a blessing. Stories are poetic, basic, and creative. The author stimulates you more and more that every area, lets you associate with real characters that everyone can recognize. The movie has allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider to love that. Movie is shown what love, action is not feeling. I was also impressed with the quality of movies and movie movies. All submissions exceeded my expectations. I offer two films of great thumbs and recommend to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
