No movies took my ideas like this has. You see, I've wanted to watch this film again for more than twenty-five years. One and only time I saw it as a teen-age boy that could be a year released, 1977. This preference of the film is given by the human aspect of the father / son looking for and seeking is certainly touching every human soul he looks at. Why this film has not been removed from the storage and displayed as many other films, I don't know. A copy of the movie received and after looking at it again was delighted to see that my memory was real. Rating shows the content of the film. You would like to watch this film on DVD as seeing this 1977 production on the VHS tape used was removed by the overall quality.
