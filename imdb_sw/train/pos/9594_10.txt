While most unfortunate had passed, the ballroom area is still very active and continues to possess their heritage. Some are still alive and very well, Octavia is more pleasant and more beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja has been very successful and gives great support to the gay community in general, Pepper Labeija went through just last year's natural cause, to relax in peace . After passing to Anji Carmen she became the mother of Xtravaganza's house (she was in the coastal area) and she is looking more and more beautiful. Other balls have volunteer groups for those who have passed away, let them all rest in peace. There is currently another project known as "How do I look?", You can check this website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
