I liked to show this a lot - we got the first and the alone, appear, the series in the UK on the channel 4. Character was appropriate on the money - such as the Simpsons for every different kind of people of the city were represented. There was no song of laughter - I never seen this on American television at the time except for Larry Sanders and it worked well here, adding that these wacky cops were certainly like that, and not just enhancing the camera . <br /> <br /> For all, the smallest number that has hit me right: I can't help but I think that maybe it has lost a mark with a certain audience. I think it would have been attacked in the UK if it was shown at an acceptable hour. I will vote this in my usual opinion: where does hell get this for a look again? Any comments?
