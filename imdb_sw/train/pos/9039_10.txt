I grew up in Southern Virginia; I am about the same age as (or maybe more than a year old) Homer Hickam, the author of "The Rocket Boys," a book that makes the real basis of this heart-stirring film. And so I relate closely to the coal of West Virginia's coalition, and with the amazing effect Sputnik was at that time (October 4, 1957) for all of us. Boys Rocket continued to make a good life for themselves. I continued to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because Sputnik raised many young people on the "Science Gap" U.S.S.R. they had U.S. in the Cold War days ... This is a good film for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will affect the foundation of your being. Everybody: Get; see; Suggest to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
