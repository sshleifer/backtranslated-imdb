Pinjar and Mr dwivedi are an amazing movie. In fact it is a greaest and better than 2003. There is a very good display in it. Dwivedi knows what she can dig from MAST Urmila. he's like you've never seen before. One realistic performance. with him is a good actor Manoj bajpai, who has shown the bollywood he has with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl (Urmila) living in pre-divide Pakistan. he is from the family of the punjabi family in the small town. has been taken by a Muslim boy as a part of the kinda to go for years to fight the punjabi family. and then follows a series of decline and turn as a marriage urmila planned arises for a few days. This movie is a very good movie. The storyline is established with an awesome screenplay. All the exhibitions like dubey the same, the copy of the clip (believe but can also work with the dancin jus on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and much more. those with the preliminary introduction of Pakistan, dress, movies, sound, background color will add positive points. from the beginning to the end you meet the u'r seat and the question is next? This movie is not worth watchin but it deserves to be part of your film collection. The last area is the end of the film. I would like to convince all of Kabila-Kabhi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowds of watching this amazing flick. My rating: 10/10.
