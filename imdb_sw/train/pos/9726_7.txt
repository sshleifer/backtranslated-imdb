Well it was a good surprise after all. The trailer did not define the best film, it was even misleading. Especially part of Jeff Bridges was a good surprise, well written, sardoni and funny. In fact though, I don't think where the boy found where he would show signs of impatience for everything his company now stands. One can not be the top suit just for a doubt at once. At the end of the film, during the show Dolce War, was also corny, clich√© and quite awesome. And of course the boy like Pegg's behavior did not want to finish his first week in the magazine blitz New York like this. I hope one day I will see the role of respect for Megan Fox, here he looked at the poor actress playing the song. And by the way, I don't see why he is a "sex sign" of the year, I see more girls almost every magazine of every magazine.
