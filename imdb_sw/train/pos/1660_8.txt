I am a fan of ART, I would like anything about Art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc.. This movie shows so, so I love it very much, it shows how a woman wants to draw anything about Art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her severe family (father), at the beginning of the movie she revealed herself, but wanted someone to paint his, but his family did not allow him to beat naked people because it was contrary to ethics. However, Artemisia could draw his girlfriend and his teacher of art. He loves his teacher of art, and it seems that the teacher of art is very loving with him, so his end will give his freedom to lies. He said he had repented, but it was not true. Artemis loved him, but as he says he will have a lot of trouble, because in the case that Artemis, his father and teacher of Art were, someone was hurting his artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a great movie about ART, and artistic love, It's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is as good as Artemisia, is doing very well, and I like her performance in the "woman's photo" like Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
