I love Satan Satan !!! David Tennant is a good actor and so Billie Piper !!! Who else likes Do Thorp pieces? He is good, isn't he? I hated the bits where he got the devil and where he was told to “go to hell”, as Rose made it plain. Mind, he was funny when he said, "Rose, let us love grace, do you? Shut up!". Lord Jefferson was a hero, not he? Eat save others. I felt so much for Toby (Is Thorp) when he came out of possession for 2 hours because he was afraid. I was like "Oh my god if I was Rose I would be afraid for him". And when she hugged me I was like "grrrrr, she's mine! Hands off!" but I thought it was very sweet. And the doctor .... well, I thought he could tell Ida "tell Rose I love him" but he didn't. Oh well.
