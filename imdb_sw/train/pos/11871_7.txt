Written by Oliver Stone and headed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE makes an unforgettable picture. Al Pacino returns to good performance like Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee rather than a powerful player in the world of drugs as he defends himself against the evil kingdom of crime in Florida. This flicker is complicated, violent, large, large, unpleasant and must keep a record of the word "f - k" more often. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get pride. The heart of a strong heart puts you in your seat to enjoy the destruction of the master of a violent crime. Also playing interesting characters is Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of his greatest generation. He can bring the truth to his character which produces a strong feeling. This will not be the cinema for everyone for you to leave you thinking you walk away from the disaster. Is that enough for you? Crime does not last long!
