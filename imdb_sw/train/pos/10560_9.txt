Jimmy Cagney's color with your eyes always in this story of the action producer who strives hard against the coming “talking” movies. This story of love, deception, women and dancing is given in such a way that if the viewer has never been treated in the wrong time. The trends of mass incidents in the gym were very good. The story has never been lost at this speed of breach. Some parts of the material provided here have been dated slightly but it does not matter because when you look at this in 1933 at that time it is fabulous watching this next to a lot of other drag movies released at that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is awake with heavy eyes in this film, never losing its stability as ever- producer of previews made by movie movies like intros. In this way he tries to save his ass from outside the business, he was a broad producer before this started. Joan Blondell is as wonderful as the neglect of love, Nan, she offers such a wonderful performance that is common to the movies of the time, so cool to see a woman shown as a powerful woman for change. The only problem I had and the film was a great production at the end. These were very good in themselves, well covered and fed up in amazement, but they were not considered suitable in the story. The only link they explain to the main story is that Cagney had to put 3 verification in 3 days to get a contract and that's what she did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls were doing during the entire movie and that these sets could be successful on a cinema. In this way "Staying Back Back" was very accurate for the story. The last crop was seen to bring this proposed story faster and that was not a good thing. I was exhausted after seeing the first sequence of Music and then I saw there were two others coming. This process has gained much from the audience as well. All of them in all filthy films. <br /> <br /> 9/10
