Yes, it is a poultry bundle and causes a slow kinda, but it is really good - and I feel like a man. You should love Judy Davis, no matter who she is in, and the girl who plays her daughter offers natural performance, persuasive. The beauty of a small summer beach is beautiful and very enjoyable for the main movie movie. The unidentified (at least for me) the executives and executives give them the effectiveness of the film that enters you and puts you in mind. In general, I give 8/10. Go see it.
