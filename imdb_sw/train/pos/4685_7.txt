In Lizzie Borden's “Love Crime” (1992), Sean Young plays dana D.A. in Atlanta. He is a lonely man who finds himself very much in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who pretends to be a popular photographer and misleads women, takes their photos, and then leaves them. Normally, a tough loner decides to enter a life of difficulty freezing it as its prey, and wanting to bring it right. They meet, they do love, then the next thing he knows, he is on his hat, get spanked. (Note: The spanking area is only in the "unrated" version of this film. R-rated version leaves you with a number of other events that can make the plot go further.) This psychological thriller comprises several incidents of women's dirt and imagery misleading, such as Bergin dismissing one of its victims near the room, with crop crops. <br /> <br /> As an exciting thing, "Love of Crime" is best when Sean Young plays a cat-and-mouse game with Bergin, trying to catch him in a terrible act. It is unfortunate that the film is not finished, it just stops. That's true. Director Lizzie Borden can only run out of the story to tell him, but after a minute of 92 roll of credit, and we are left with an amazing "what just happened?" amazing. The revelation of the Youth plan is being played in an engaging fashion, but the lack of end-time will prevent other viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado) @ yahoo.com
