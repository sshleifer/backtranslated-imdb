I am only 11 years old but I realized the Full House when I was five years old and I watched it all the time until I was seven. Then I grew up and accepted the Full House could wait and that I had the "most important" things to do. Together there was also the fact that my younger brother who looked faithfully to me for two years began to love to make it think too "girly." I found every day at five o'clock was about 23 and I was once again stupid. Full house made me laugh and cry. It has made me realize how good it would have been if our world was like the world of Full House with Mother. I've heard people say House Full is cheesy and impossible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. Sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. Three men living with girls can get on a regular basis. What's more realistic than that? If anything show up when I come down and bring me up when I thought I was in a perfect sense. I have asked as a hyena in the show and get great obsessiveness on Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that position but they were very young I have ever seen.
