First notes on what makes the movie great to me. The excitement of not knowing what follows will make me suggest the movie the first time I look at (trial for sure: Twister). There are also other things that can look at first as good humor (John Candy at Uncle Buck and Head of Out), a good plot and a good decision (Madeline and Matilda), a story of thinking (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas is MAN), and good music (again Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Music Sounds). What makes me watch the movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characteristics. Since he said, I present Cindy Lou Nani and Grinch. Good performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. Other cast were very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans. But, each single area with Cindy and Grinch-together is the best and most pleasant and / or heart. Cindy Lou is my popular character in this film and the reason for compelling why the movie is better than cartoon. Grinch has a powerful plot, good conflict, and a very good theme (I can't start because I don't want to lose). Jim Carrey was very surprised as the Grinch - especially when he contacted Cindy. And music! Wow! Good music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and songs. Very good work Jim Carrey-didn't know that you can sing. Taylor Momsen! Who! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. On your solo - Are you Christmas - is your voice really as shown? Looks like F #? That is a bad difference for a 7-year-old (evil means in a better way). Good work. This is the best performance with the child I ever heard in the movie (Taylor beat Von Trapp-no small children!). And now for executives. Jim Carrey was a good, awesome, and, very amazingly sensitive (this showed by his special way to Taylor Momsen). Momsen's mysterious words (one of the secrets to good acting acting) is a very powerful-he really Cindy Lou Nani. And while speaking he is more powerful. <br /> <br /> **************************************************** ************** ********************************* ************************************************ <br /> Examples: expression when she first sees Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You yes" and then filled with Grinch line "da da da THE GRINCH - after he inpples in the sorter and then saved by The Grinch)." Thanks for saving me "quote and the following answers and Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy welcomes Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. This is the two best actors in their best interaction with Speaking to each other. Little Taylor Momsen joins Jim Carrey in this area. We believe the hope we see Taylor Momsen in most of the most popular films. Everything in everything was good on this film (except maybe the feet and nose).
