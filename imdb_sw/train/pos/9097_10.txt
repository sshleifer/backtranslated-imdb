I gave this film a high score because it was so beautiful, really beautiful, all the time being stupid. I went to see this film while playing the Philly area, and it was a great night facility with friends. The film is well written and done well, although it feels like a sitcom instead of a film, which does not remove the film. You don't have to find again the comedies like this again, where they shouldn't scare people to be funny. These films around the house of Ukranian house that finds work for young couples who need help. Although at first he helps, soon he adds more adultery in their lives then the couple met. Things get more and more control until .... you will need to see! Banter made me laugh, even after leaving the theater. This film has put me in good condition. I can't wait until release on DVD because I want this film in my collection.
