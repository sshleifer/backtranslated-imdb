I really liked this film. I bought it as soon as I could get a copy of it. This film had a lot of emotions, and I felt real, I could feel sympathy with the characters. Every time I look at it, the end makes me cry. I can really recognize the character of Busy Phillip, and how I could feel like one thing happened to me. I think that all high schools should show this film, perhaps it will allow people to want to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting. It is really one of the greatest movies all the time.
