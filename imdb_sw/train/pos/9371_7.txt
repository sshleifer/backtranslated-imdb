One thing I have often liked about Robert Ludlum's fun is just when you think you have done it, it goes in a different direction. There are many twins and it turns out in this film that I have a strong neck from looking. One thing I like also about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be dependent on leading and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) good story. Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and JT Walsh for cast and you have a story that will put your interests even if they play all the characters they have described. Dahl seems to bring them the best for people, and this will help you to be interested, and I think, even to the end.
