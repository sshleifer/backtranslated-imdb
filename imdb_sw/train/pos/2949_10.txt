This is the funniest stand I ever seen and I think it's funniest I will see. If you do not laugh and laugh at the hilarity altogether, then this is not just your cup of tea. But I honestly does not know anyone who has seen this which they did not like. Now it's 17 years later and my friends and I analyze everything from Goonie Goo Goo on a fart game, Aunt Bunnie for an ice man, Ralph and Ed for GET OUT !! There are many types of personal and collective hilarity here as if you have never seen this film then you miss out on one of the best stages. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, Dice, George Carlin or even greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will be more of it. I don't know where or where Murphy got some of its equipment but it works. That's what comes. It's funny as hell. What? Can you think how this show should be awesome people who were used to Eddie do buckwheat with Mr. Rogers and such on SNL? If you are listening to the audience when he loses his first player or when he says F for the first time, they are completely scared. <br /> <br /> His first time says the word F is when he skit about Mr. T being gay. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. You can look cute in their jeans. Now come up here, and f @ ** on the ass! ‚Äù<br /> <br /> The crowd disappears in laughter laughter. No one was expecting a dirty mouth that he brought to them. But the results were just amazing. I have never been interested in the comedy without delight if I was in this stand. In fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much because of the laugh was not until 1999 when I saw the SOUTH PARK: BIGGER AND THE UNCUT. The comedy was raw and non-modern and went to jugular, as it was done. I don't think it is possible to look at this piece of comic history and laugh. It is almost twenty years later and it is still the most fun thing in the video. "I took your kids fishing last week. And I put a bug in the hook and the kids put a fishing pole back in the boat and hitting their heads in the water for two minutes. They started movin their heads around like this and **** f ***** come with fish. They looked and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said you could believe this f **** n shit? /> Look again and be ready to laugh your freakin ass off!
