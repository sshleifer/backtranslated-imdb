I had no problem with the film, which I thought was good. It is actually a LAPD video video video that has misled me. I wonder if the Lion of the True Gate thought that the whole audience would be looking to see people who were brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. Sama Hango's Gate, this was THE PROJECT OF INCREDIBLY !!! <br /> <br /> Return to the film: Sent was the best, especially Val Kilmer as late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sleaze, he hurt women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his partner), and she does not know into drugs. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates an increase in the wonder of wonderland. Especially Holmes was involved in the murder? We do not know all the facts in the story (Nash is still alive and free), but the film has a very good job.
