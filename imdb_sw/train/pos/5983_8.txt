I first saw this film as a boy. It was when the heavy metal ruled the world. Trick or Treat has every feature for the movie begins. For a cast that shows Skippy from Family Relations, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as Ecclesiastes, how can you go wrong? Returning the message of evil you played on vinyl! Yes, they use the record in this film. In the same area Eddie (Skippy) listens to messages from a bad rockstar in his record player when things start to fear. Monsters start to happen with his speakers and his stereo becomes. As a young man I tried to record my records back with hope that it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later Trick Au Treat is still one of all my favorite favorite movies.
