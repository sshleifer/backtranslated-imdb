I found that it is very surprising that the film really managed to plug the gap between my American culture and founders, that is, Chinese. It becomes a story about ethics, and causes the keeper to rethink their choice in life, and loyalty towards the institution. Surprisingly enough, it has managed to do it in a gentle, humorous manner, which only in the bonds of restoring the seats for the person. I enjoyed the film, and I will look at it again if I could.
