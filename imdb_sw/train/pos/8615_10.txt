I waited for the film to come out for a while in Canada, and eventually it did, I was so happy to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - even making it sad) - however, it includes you. The next day I was investigating again, because although it is about something that feels emotionally, you can recognize after a few days it is a very good story. How one person may appear to be a link to many people, but sometimes you can be blinded by many things. And how Diane Keaton's behavior saves others to be just there. And how to save him in the process too. It was a very good movie, and Chris Pine (one of my dear partners) provides full support to comic. It is definitely a movie that will require a tissue box, but it will actually stay with you for a long time.
