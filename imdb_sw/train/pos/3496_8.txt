I am wondering how many people cause this argument under 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they don't know the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing in difficult situations. <br /> <br /> There is a mad lady who wants the best for your grandchildren. And there are good reasons why many critics like this film. <br /> <br /> And the reason is because they understand the film. I feel sad for the low score given by others. I just want to write a short summary of the movies but IMD requires you to write 10 lines.
