I first saw this in the movie hall when it came out, and the crowd was in the movie that made the experience more fun. This is the cast of the great characters, many great names in it, which few are known as it is now. I think it's a great idea if you are looking for any of these actors, or you like them in other movies, to add them to your checklist. Some cases actually remind me of a kind of comedy made well as in Birdcage or even annotation, an odd type of comedy appearance, and a realistic delivery from these dear actors. The movie did a great job to give you insight, maybe even very real, in the day's soap culture.
