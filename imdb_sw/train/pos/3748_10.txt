I have looked at it many times and I plan to buy the full feature. I would like all the comedy of Jason Steele. It is very different and is very unique and very enjoyable. I love indie movies and this is very good. The program is wonderful but it's very funny. This short film is about Spatula talking about Edward. The order of these events is a bit, and make this film very interesting look. At first you see Edward fighting a spoon, but then the goal has changed earlier in his life. This is a movie of rebellion, but of course, it is still good. I strongly recommend watching this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor can not resemble everyone's taste but look at it yet. It will take only 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO TO GO!
