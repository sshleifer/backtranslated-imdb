Luckily, without knowing anything about this film I was interested enough to put it on TV. Then the tape runs out just five minutes before finishing! But I am glad to get its power because this is a great movie to spy. There are common toy experiments and tiny dirty squares, but it is also a terrible and even sad time. Based on the 1969 production year, some lesbians should have raised a few monkeys. Of course now it is not surprising anyone with these events actually seem pretty well done. And not just because of George's two actors. <br /> <br /> Gas attacks seem to hit every viewer, not surprisingly, and certainly struck me. Very effective. Also comments from both sides of the opposition provide a whole deep story with common doubts and steps. This is not just the story of the war on the one side of the victory, but it shows what leads to the victory for good and evil. In fact, that case of war, more serious. For this artist's music Ennio Morricone is also a must. His work is always the best, touching but never over. And I think I must try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let us have the hope of getting on the DVD soon, so I can have the whole film in my collection and many people will learn with this very unknown gem.
