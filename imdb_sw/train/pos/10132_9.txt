In this first part of Friends, we are brought to 6 characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green. We see that Rachel, a rich girl who is a friend of Monica from high school hours, has left her daughter, Barry, on the altar, because she found that she did not like her. He also decides to live with Monica and independently from his father, find a new job as a hostess in Central Perk. Ross, on the other hand, discovered his wife is a lesbian partner and lost Susan, his girlfriend. (We see him going to a new apartment during the period) Overall, in this section, he gives (and finally sleeps) with Paul "the wife of wine", who gave him the excuse to be weak since he took his wife. But in fact, he was deceiving her. <br /> Ps: I just loooove Joey and Chandler haircuts in this first season! =)
