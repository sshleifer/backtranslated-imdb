Surprising I approached I am interested (Yellow) and is one piece with great courage. I would like to read many reports on his great complexity and open sex. What I got is not this, but the stimulating experience with the characters of the wrong movies and any other. I believe in fact that many of the speakers who saw the film are 'blind' or 'boring' came close to the film as photographic pictures. Maybe this is pornography, taking pictures of pornography is something that is intended to strengthen feelings, but it is deliberately non-erotic. Lena, the main character, throws him all in his performance and gives him the truth and humanity that convinces and sustains. Her breasts can be saggy, so many strokes, her thighs, and her face, chubby. But at the end of the film, viewers come to recognize him, and admit his mistakes as a human. This touch gives him more loyalty than necessary. If the director gave us the bombing of the Bardot bomb effect it would have been closed. I can't even suggest that piece of stimulation. Be prepared to invest a lot of ideas in this deliberate foot film. The patient and eligible viewer will be paid in many ways the other films can rotate.
