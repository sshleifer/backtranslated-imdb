What a fun movie b! Shepis is very good and Scarecrow is different from the original. In fact he brought me back to the leaders of 80 years. The budget is low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never takes itself seriously. From the trash garbage trash on high martial arts scarecrow action, this is a real b-movie gear. Grab some drinks, snacks and two friends and kick back and relax. I enjoyed this film so I came out of all the Scarecrow films. Indeed, it is not for everyone but for each other. Sometimes you should just keep the head thinking and smile.
