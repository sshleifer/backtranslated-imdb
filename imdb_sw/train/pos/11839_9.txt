This movie was very entertaining. Sound sound (Bian Adams) is beautiful and stimulating. Even more amazing is Brian Adams doing all the French songs as well. The elements are also exciting and serious. <br /> <br /> The movie is made from a combination of traditional animations, as well as images produced by computers. The result is true. I watch this film at least once a week with my children and we never care. Stories are compelling and listed. I don't know anyone who could put this film under 7. According to securities in my house.
