I saw this gem of film in Cannes where it was part of the directors twice. Welcome to Collinwood is not too short. Enjoy so much, and all members of the cast force are making their socks off. Sometimes it sounds loud on the little hippo (Cosimo, motivated by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and be taken to prison. While in prison, he meets a 'lifer' who tells him about the "end of bellini"? which for you and me? it is a reliable fire to get quick resources. It turns out that there is a way out of a built-in building in the city store of gold? which can connect millions. Looks simple? ?? well throw all kinds of wacky characters and events along the way and you have got links to one wild trip !! ?? The word comes from one person down to a lower life and soon their team has gathered to try and earn money in Cosimos 'bellini' shot by a pero defeater (Superly played by Sam Rockwell of course stars in doing) and reluctant River Riley ( William H. Macy who has to bring his child with him as his wife bound for fraud !! According to Italian film I Soliti rejects (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also led the film as 'Collinwood'? 'Palookaville'. This cuts the advertising of the last effort and though written and directed by the brothers of Russo has definitely has the Coen's shadows about it. Issued by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but hilarious part as a safe breach.
