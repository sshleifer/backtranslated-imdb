To be a person who lists the Dead Day of the dead in three of his five favorite movies at all times, and at the same time likes this film's film, I feel I must protect this film against the original email review. Opus this short but sweet has been always enjoyable people in the awesome marathons and science fiction where those who attend have such a love still do not know to take zombie movies very seriously. This film is the original tax, not insulting. It is intended to be surprising, and many others that I have heard singing and shouting agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Look at the director came as journalist Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity to catch his guest, Food.
