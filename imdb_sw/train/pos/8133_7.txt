Well, I don't like rap, but I've seen the Fear of Black Hat hilarious. I'm sure I didn't have an internal joke, but some I knew, and it was enough to make me laugh after I stopped laughing. I am a big fan of the spine pipe, so usually I had to look at this. It had come from this is the Wind Wind, sometimes with the openness, but this film is still standing as the original, mental, and wonderful satire. My personal love: "Back at the time of the slaves, they had no helmet to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were very tired to rebel. Now we have a hat."
