I saw this film back at the 2005 International Palm Springs International Festival and the 14 films I saw there would place this position. This was typical of Falk Peter if you're a Falk fan and has shown many chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The title of the film was long and unusual to call me. I wonder this did not make you free. This was better than many junk which the main studio gives you. Perhaps it is also an old man because it was directed to a child boomer and a senior audience. Most people can be associated with the situation in this film. This may enjoy a great variety of regenerations since the time people look back to this film and see it a kind of gem. I would like the rate of 8.0 to 8.5 to the 10th level and certainly recommend.
