It took the end of the film's channel to reflect through the cable films, and I was so impressed I wanted to show the next. I did not know what to expect after reading the summary of the app, but I came from this idea of ​​the film with anxiety and anxiety. He also gave me as an adult who attended high school in 80 years, a better understanding of what our children should compete with these days. The fact that you don't see the bullet just adds to the weight of the plot. See all the struggles of children and adults in order to understand and discuss and be beaten for sometimes there was power. And I will admit that I have given you a few tears. <br /> Overall, it's not a movie that I could find, however I'm sure I have seen it.
