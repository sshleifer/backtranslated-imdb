If the Australian Post Office was required for a promotional film for hire then this is one of these movies that the heart is a good place and you can watch again and again. Miranda's performance touches as part of the undisputed part of Australia by many Europeans, since it can be cold, rain and pain, like anywhere else and anywhere else it is important people around you. The characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the hope of a move to move in the 'office of the dead letter' thought taken. Miranda has gone to make the biggest movies, but I hope she always keeps the ideas into this?
