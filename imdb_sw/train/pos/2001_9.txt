I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big movie in Boston when I was a young boy. Later, in the summer of 1969, I enjoyed seeing this film still playing on the popular movies in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Academy Award for the Best Year of the Year. The success of "Oliver!" at all stages and screens remind me that not all talent begins on Broadway and it ends in Hollywood. This story of the story with Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was sent to the beauty of London and Lionel Bart of England. His favorite music then hit New York and around the world. The film reform was made in England during the summer of 1967 and was released in 1968. Number and music numbers are widespread. Song "Who will sell it?" required hundreds of executives and the film director of the UK really deserved its Oscar for doing it all in a seamless manner. Some of the Canadian and American talents are also part of this amazing production, but it is mainly a tax for a good British film studios, like Shepperton. Good! Other film studio in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham, and Ealing also gave them many films in the world to be treasured over the years.
