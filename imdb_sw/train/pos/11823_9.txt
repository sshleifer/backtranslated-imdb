I was so happy this true to create a Dick Tracy persona. This is a well-designed product that used modern technology to create a comic-based comic story. If you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy movies then you are sure of despair of this translation. The color of pastel and many more characters than the characters actually are really taking time is emerging as entertainment. I personally find the feature of Madonna music being a great part of this film - a CD with its music from this film is one that I have listened for many times over the years, it has done very well and has been made music and made at that time. In my mind, the best time of Madonna all on the screen but especially music. This is certainly bringing "baby" into you.
