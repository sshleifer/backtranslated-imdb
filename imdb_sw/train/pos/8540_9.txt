It is amazing how your life can change for the second time ... To attend the 'Waterdance' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to be used a new way of life may seem frightening, and realize that there are other people being done by A similar situation can help you to continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and especially Helen's hunt (oh man!, Helen is a clean and compassionate woman in the world ...) is amazing, Wesley Snipes also surprise in one of your ultimate major roles. A simple movie and at the same time can not leave us indifferent to the message being used: enjoy anytime of your life ... <br /> <br /> True to such a film that any hour is not attended !!! (sorry, it's Brazilian words ...).
