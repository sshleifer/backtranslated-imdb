Look, if I was interested in the book of Nancy Drew, what I would do is take a book and read it. It's not. From the moment I can remember reading people playing movies because it wasn't like a book. Sorry - in digital age we can no longer watch movies in flip books, however I am sure you can still find silent silent movies in the book form. When the Lord of the Rings went out, the people complained. The third time won Oscar - "The book was excellent." When I sought to kill Mockingbird, "the book was excellent." Now a group of people reluctantly, again, because Nancy Drew was not like a book. I can't say Nancy Drew will win any Oscars - if anything is one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Children's Awards Awards. I say to give them a rest break. It's a film, not a paper. As a film, I have seen Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - including cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (Hammer of Hebrew) and responsibilities to help Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (He's All). This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in the movie and, of course, I enjoy her work more than Julia and Eric; His character stays consistent in all the film and it takes well to the conflict. The thin movie in the spirit of Harriet Spy is good at all times. I have given ten stars because I enjoyed the film, I would like to see it again, and will love it on DVD.
