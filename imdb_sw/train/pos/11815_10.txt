While I write this I see from more than 15,000 lots of rating 5.8. Something wrong with that picture. I personally give 10. I can see 7 at the bottom or possible 8 as compared to people who see this film why it's true. It's a movie derived from the hero of the comic book. This movie won more prize awards. Won Oscar 3. Another successful 5 & 26 selection .... there he tells me is better than 5.8. Some of the great work from very good actors, some specific special effects and in my opinion will be as if not already classic for years to come. If you are looking for clean entertainment, be sure to check Dick Tracy. Certainly the movie can look more than a few times. Al Pacino is good as Big Boy Caprice.
