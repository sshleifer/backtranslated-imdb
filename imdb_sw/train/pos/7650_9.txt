Wow, I loved this film. It may not have sponsorships and advertising that the latest councils of hollywood find but are a double punch pack feeling. The story revolves around this family from Utah and is a relationship between family members who produce films and punch. The main lead (Giovanni Ribisi) has its place very well, he never let them believe that he does all his feelings. It is his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me though. When the two were at the same events they put their line off, showing a wonderful display. Great big, beautiful film.
