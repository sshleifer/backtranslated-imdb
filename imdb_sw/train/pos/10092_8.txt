Elizabeth Elizabeth Taylor is very interesting in this small classic as known as a little girl from London who loves to the owner of tea tea from the UK Ceylon (now modern Sri Lanka). Upon arrival he immediately feels out of place and is forced to deal with a new culture and also have a constant awareness of an angry elephant bull. William Dieterle, who also led Emile Zola and Jennie's Photo, does a good job of bringing some dark, and very close, with a low voice to this love and setting it one of the best I saw with black and white houses and houses beautiful island.
