I have watched this film several times, and I find it very good. This movie is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Journey of Terror", and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usual good / beautiful character. George Riviere, the husband's husband, is doing a good job with his role. The whole movie goes with the situation, and there is a good deal of tension. The camera alarm is good and acting, for many parts, not bad. This film is best suited for a rainy day or evening. I have a non-version DVD, which is far more than the planned TV version. Grab some popcorn, temesha lights, return and enjoy. John R. Tracy
