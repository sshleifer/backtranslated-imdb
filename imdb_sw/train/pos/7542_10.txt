This movie can't stay well with others, but you must look. I am glad someone eventually brought up the discussion of the realities of how African spouses worked to make a name in the community and how many of them felt trying to stay there as "others" African Americans moved. Spoilers (Spoilers Few) Spotlight The Showtime movie is almost like Joint Lee Joint ... you have an African American man (Danny Glover) who worked through HARD through the titles of white law in the 1970s. As anyone in the United States, he moved his family to be unable to comply with his high standard phone but he forgot, there are still many problems going on. African whites only in the neighborhood at that time were female. The person who owns the house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mixture started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to "get involved" so he does all the other women in his neighborhood doing. And just when someone thinks he and his family are "inside", the second right comes comes another African African who has won "lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes and does not want to do them because he does not want the district to think they are okay. He, of course is much better, his new neighbor is "ghetto" not necessarily exist! Who has the problem now? <br /> <br /> What this film shows you is a great pain that takes this family to fit, and how they lose themselves in the process. Asks you what question of racism and start ... with whom. It shows how no matter what color and how much money you have, you can still avoid yourself from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African African children, when "mix" in the suburbs like these fall into the trap of changing themselves to follow culture (full with blonde hair and blue eyes, mind you!) Welcome to them. They laugh together with jokes, not knowing they are joke and don't know .. why. But in general, this film is about 'people'. Regardless of what race, this film gets how horrible you can go to your neighbor and to each other ... everything for fitting ... because you feel you have more money than others, so it makes you the best you are - and you forget your problems and those who come behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, not for everyone. But look and judge yourself. <br /> <br />
