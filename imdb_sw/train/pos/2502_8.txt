This movie was surprised! I've never heard of Hyde's Gackt I didn't have to expect a lot! Because I wanted to watch this film because someone said that the movie has great incidents of action in John Woo's style! Normally I am very careful when this is allegedly! There is only one John Woo and even this day has never been a single director approaching his attention during action! The fact that the "Child of the Moon" would have a vampire you believe me even more! What? How can you defeat the combustible gun vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I saw about this film which was very slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie has beautiful Hong Kong style! But the "Child of the Moon" is not an act of action! It's a drama about friendship and honesty! The goal is on the characters and their relationship to each other! Pop Hyde and Gackt actors do a good job in doing it and are widely believed as friends! The only problem I had was a plot! Several times the movie appears to fly a few years without describing what happened and why they exploded flying! Example: When one member of the group dies (very good time) Alexander Wang sees the blood of Kei (Hyde) of one of the attackers! Without warning and describing the movie jumps 9 years and many friends have never joined again! Also without the right reason given the Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) should kill! I know that this has been done to add a good game! Because the actors are very effective but sometimes you feel forced! In addition to the error in this film program has a play and humidity which makes it difficult to love this movie! It's hard to explain why this film is amazing! But it's just! The general experience is cheerful and honest!
