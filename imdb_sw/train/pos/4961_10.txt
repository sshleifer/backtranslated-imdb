Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are an improper pair that goes into the car and going to make lines according to the need of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a good man, associated with one and all, while Paz Vega is a gold cashier behind "10 or Low items" to look at the line, awesome customers and exhausting out of his mind. They all explore, discover, and learn from each other. By doing this they certainly should be in danger, they love to change, and have a sense of humor, all that they have. I would like this film to be true, I would like this kind of story happen many times, I would not need to go to the movie to realize that we can connect the truth even if we come from different backgrounds. The message of the film is set to open heart, and makes us involved in the possibility of another world where we meet from there - a world where peace can be a possibility.
