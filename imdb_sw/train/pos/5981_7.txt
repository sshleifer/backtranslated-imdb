TRICK OR TREAT is a good example of Hollywood flying on "back messages in the fake music" bandwagon that Tipper Gore and Washington Wives kick-start in the middle of '80s (other, successful achievements in this mini-gen include bad BLACK ROSES AND Silly THE GATE. I was sophomore in high school when TRICK OR TREAT came out and couldn't wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from the video stores at the end of the 80's, but eventually I got a copy of the DVD price budget a few minutes ago and brought many metal records back to the back of the day. Any form of young metal can be attributed to Eddie's experiments "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Price of "Family Relations") in this film if he is being bullied by "pretty" high school students for his heavy metal fashions and flavors. music. Eddie's famous star rock is Sammi Curr (who looks much like Tommy Lee's Motley Crue), who is killed in a hot movie early hotel. Eddie cannot be accessed until he gets a great screen shot of Sammi, unreleased from DJ radio (Gene Simmons of Kiss in short comeo). Eddie recently discovered that this LP, while playing back, allows to talk to the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Recently Sammi gives Eddie's advice on how to get even with his attackers of preppie but when the message spreads in scariness ("Waste'em ALL ... no false metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, which causes Sammi to return to life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi drives a great drum in Eddie High School and takes steps to make a crowd and eliminate a few of "false metallers" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl's dream. (SIGH) No, it is not very frightening in 2006, it was not awesome in 1986, but the TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any of the 1980s metallic and has the sound of a buzz of the banner of Fastway Worship . Well worth finding if you ever surprise your head or have a taste for B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
