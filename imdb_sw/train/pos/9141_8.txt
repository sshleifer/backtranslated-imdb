You can talk to the talent of Acting, or even his choice of making his own life in this film. There is no debate on his music talent then let or now. It looks like a shadow has been twenty years later, but music is still useful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> After living through the feeling of this movie (graduated in'85 high school) I can tell you that there is nothing big at that time. From Tipper Gore (the wife of Al) trying to explore "Nikki Little" and everything else under the sun via PMRC (Music Resources Parents) for each "Bird Band" during pretending Prince, it was a very hot thing. For a few weeks at least, Prince was greater than Madonna and Michael Jackson. We all waited for the film and we were very happy when it was sold. Not discouraged. Everyone had got up. I was a MTV junkie when (actually played music then .... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice per hour. I must graduate this opinion by saying that, at the time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in Punk / New Wave types' Music of Prince at that time passing all kinds and styles. One of the reasons that some of these seem to be cheesy and destroyed now is that it was SOOOOOOOO great then. All things that remind you of the 80's were the iconic then. It was a rule and looked like a clich√© 'now. It was so popular that it was ridiculous. It's like a grandfather's rappin business for Wendy Workers. It seems to be foolish because everyone had found it (sadly, like a kind of extravagant macarena or something. However, I hope this gave you little understanding.
