One of the great mysteries of life, caused by every day, is why beautiful girls are often attracted to jerks and heels than good people. Worse, when the good boys want to marry those girls, girls prefer to beat sores and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, they have shown they just love girls. Stu Erwin is a good boy, who continues to be good after being led and deceived and even after losing a girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is jerk, and he is perfect in the role, rather than sad for his fans. Jean Harlow comes as West West West more, even as a La West in some of its hardest lines. Something amazing is that many of the other characters, committed to being bad - I mean, hack, they are locked, so they should be - it's very good people. In fact, there are many good people here, people who, with lots of movies or stories, would be interesting to fly back but here to go out of their way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So, maybe the story is rather clich√©d, at least with modern standards, but eventually the viewer will be happy to watch him. The biggest complaints I have is that many good actors do not get credit. Once again, we can say "Thank you" for IMDb.com hard.
