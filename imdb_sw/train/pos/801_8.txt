I think JEDI is now considered to be the "end" of entering the popular saga, and it is very good, as it was several. I loved how this one had already gone after sending MEMBA, and I accepted the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing many bad things about Ewoks, they were not very bad. I enjoyed an exciting explosion in the forest, and I felt that there was a lot of sense to identify well with this chapter. Last (with new additions, I think?) Effectively eliminates all 6 chapters in the fantastic story of fantasy. I know many true Star Star fans hated George Lucas for the changes he had made for the original films, but being a relative of the family to these movies instead of the end of life and not missing what I didn't know, I think he did these 6 movie works as fully A tool around. Oh, and, desperate - Carrie Fisher appeared very delicious in her skimpy dress.
