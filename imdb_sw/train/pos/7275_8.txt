There are no links to Carlos Mencia to make a stand that makes us laugh and think. Not only is it interesting about color issues (like not many people), but also talking about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated the same ... why Americans like more than Arab terrorists ... why no one needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in heaven ... the theory of how Easter (was Big Ups for Jesus' Day) began ... his look for the movie Passion of Christ - and his small argument of the series and a woman on whether she has been affected by Jesus or how ... how society should treat physical patients ... and even if you have the right to tell the dragon or not. Also, he did not stop reminding us that each of us has a voice. So we have to use it to tell the truth, say what we think, and don't be afraid if others miss it. <br /> <br /> Carlos is a bomb.
