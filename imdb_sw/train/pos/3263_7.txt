I usually enjoy movies like "space," but I wasn't quite satisfied with this for several reasons. The first half was very good, and Alex Finch died and re-entered into a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Pastor) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who has now grown up. The events with them are reunited with Downey who has once done well, and there is a good feeling of joy and joy once Pastor finally believes that her husband is born again, but from there the film goes down. There are a number of cases related to sex that have completely stopped, especially Downey and Pastor who want to reunite despite the difference in their age now. After this, however, the film can finish the most appropriate way, based on the plot of the plot. I was shocked because I didn't expect the movie to be too bad. There was great potential and this story, and the heavenly events are being done well. There is a beautiful theme of the singing by Peter Cetera and Cher, but eventually the film is not suitable. For the best, the same film, try "Heaven Can Wait." Good, but I have loved so much I haven't seen because of the events in the second half. *** out of ****
