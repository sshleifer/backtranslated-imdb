Movie does not claim to be something interesting as many films do. These films appear as fun and entertainment time. And so was it. It is the Korean version of the male it brings. You can feel for all the film and how it will end but it's not surprising or not how the film is a copy of another carbon. Instead, the pleasure is being done on the journey of "remaining" strands to themselves. Therefore, the film is fun and fun. The camera function, especially the dolly action was stolen very well. Script, being weak tad, was more enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but were full of life and desire. This film will not win any Oscars, nor any sales blockbuster DVD, but look with fun and fun experience.
