I was attracted to this film. When I was 17 and out of high school I got a job in the 20th century Fox as a member of the Merchants and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (spreading carrier deck) I was told to bring the next morning suit and enough clothes for a week or two. When I got in the morning morning then let us wait and almost 20 we went south to San Diego. Almost there we were standing at the Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. As soon as we were entering into the north we went a few miles to Camp Pendleton, a great sea base. There, on the beach, we started to build what is required to be the base of Japan's Pacific island. It took us about a week or ten to complete the installation, which included a water tank, the installation of guns, sandy and urban networks. All this was to pay too much, sometimes 'gold time', which was our three-hour salary at times. Our food was also the first level = supper for lunch, etc. - which was surprising because it was a time of war and very difficult to find good meat at home. When I finished the job I was waiting for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I eagerly wait for two hours of the movie before my hand work came to the screen. Then it was not more than three or four minutes (perhaps below) of the heroes of the dive film to hit the base bomb and beat it with smithereens. Slightly less, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the ambition I enjoyed the movie and I haven't seen it since now. I learned later that this film was written by the government and Fox was paid at a cost and foundation, which might give them a reward and our wonderful life below. Bob Weverka
