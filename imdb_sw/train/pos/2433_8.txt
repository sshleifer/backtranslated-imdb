I was 12 years old when I saw this cartoon of "Casper's Friendly Ghost". It seems to be early since Casper did not look * right *, the same way of Porky pig does not look * right * in the old 1930 cartoons. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> However, this part in after a life of fantom after worries he became a friend of a little todd dog who he named Ferdie. I remember having fun seeing Casper having a friend, as those who have watched cartoons can not know that many people are running away, shouting "Spirit!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie enjoy together until someone else shows ... I hate to leave you and a half spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can't be too too. Besides, anyone who reads the synopsis of the IMDb of the cartoon can reveal what happens next ... <br /> <br /> The last is a bit amazing. In fact, maybe it's a sad thing that I've ever seen looking at the cartoon. But that just means that it encouraged me, which explains why I decided to write a comment on this cartoon and not too many. Or the feeling, the fact that I really remember this cartoon completely is due to its emotional effect on me - I have not seen it since. But the cartoon is approaching note for upbeat, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdie again. <br /> <br /> I'd like to give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second only to Warner Bros cartoon "Peace on Earth," this is more I ever transferred to the short animated.
