I remember Parker Posey on "As the World Turns" before becoming the Queen of Independent movies. In this film, Posey shows its potential as a top actor. In this supporting film which includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese migrator who works as a business falafel street, who hopes to be a teacher. A dependent consisting of good performers who plays with her mother and just a relative of the family like Judy, an artist who is an old fashion, dedicated to the mumeopausal. Posey as Maria learns that she should grow and mature. Losing his library library makes him realize how much he misses as part of his life. Maria's life is surrounded by friends in a village east-east of New York City before it has ever had a sense of yuppies. This film is very good for self and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey as Maria with other characters in other films.
