Although time has revealed how some of the effects of this story of love and adventure are still special. If you have never seen this film before you wonder how much it was stolen and later films. I was looking at this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney Aladdin moved from the film. They loved the film and enjoyed it as a touchstone for many films and filmmakers. I have given 8 film out of 10 instead of 10 out of ten, which is where the best part of this film stays, because in the last minute the film is lost in pacing. Everything is running as they should reach the end. From the point of departure to the djinn until the end appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It does not film, but it reduces it. It is still needed to look for anyone who loves a good story of fairy, or even a great movie.
