I look at this page, and it seems to oppose me to listen to someone walking and walking in a real classic. Indeed, I agree that everyone should have his opinion, but here's my: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be lost by any observer fears, and should be seen by the most common viewers around the world. Indeed, it has lost some of the beauty and size and age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but not because you should love it. <br /> <br /> You should love it because it is a terrible movie, even with today's standards. It is a general lack of access to you as an original audience, so do not put a session if you have not given a chance. Look, but not with a bad attitude. See how happy, how it was before.
