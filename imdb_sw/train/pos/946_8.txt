If the Christmas celebration has changed over the years, if one focuses on religious or secular traditions, it is when people should live better. That somehow dropped one Ebenezer Scrooge, a businessman and a lender in the 19th century London. If her boyfriend describes her uncle, she does not celebrate Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is a humbug. Humanity in Scrooge was expelled from the past, he is a hard case, very much like his 20th century colleague, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. But as Charles Dickens said this story, liberation is not too late for any of us and the spirit of himself and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. Carol who loves Christmas is an inexhaustible season of time when we sometimes forget that it is very much the social definition of the 19th century England as Oliver Twist was. The characters in this film are middle and bottom class. Restrictions are a few tanks on the street people in Oliver Twist, but they should strive to stay there. Still love and happiness eliminates their homes, without thanks to Bob Cratchit's wife who works. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey who did a lot of good in his life and had to be reminded of how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed to lift as much as he had to do for good in this old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart in his live and play performances looks very much on Scrooge. But George C. Scott takes the old man in this film. Its stability, but in a sad state that makes us rooted for it. Scott joins the good traditional people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who have all made many Scrooge translations. <br /> <br /> Among the responsibilities of helping I enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as the heart and strong Christmas spirit now. <br /> <br /> According to this IMD is one of the 32 versions of Carol A Christmas made that they archived and is one of the best.
