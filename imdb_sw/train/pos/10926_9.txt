If you like kung-fu film and you haven't seen this film, you are looking at yourself. This movie is one of the cheap kung-fu prices that can be recommended for fans of all types of films. Typically, it takes a fan of hard die of that kind to see anything in these films, but this has all! The story has been told well, and it has been completed. The secrets of fighting are good, and they last until you have never been with them (unlike Tiger connecting). Throw in a little secret and tortured with one of the movie. Check out this at all costs. Heck, my wife even enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Wu Du! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
