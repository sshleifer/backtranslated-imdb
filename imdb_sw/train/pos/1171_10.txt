I found this piece to be one of the funniest I have seen for a long time. The creators of the south park have made an excellent film of Romero's film which I have ever seen. I would like to know what George Romero's opinion was in this section I am sure was just positive! Put his true vision to his epic zombie fully intact! Many spoofs handle fresh cleaner without making a viewer think if Romero tries to do with his films. I think if the outbreak of zombie happen we can really worry about the values ​​of our property before our lives as shown in this section!
