This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest exhibitions of being on television. I mean acting is good, insisting, drama, comedy, has everything, and for a simple story: Aircraft fell on the island. Anime is great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox again shows us what a good actor, Josh Holloway is very good, Jorge Garcia is Hilarious, I can keep going. Also, unexpected events will occur, past stories of characters, the last music of each section. J.J. Urums has again proved a good writer and producer. I mean this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who does not watch this show, should definitely think to get a DVD and watch it, because they have nothing big. This show is possible to be the best show in television history!
