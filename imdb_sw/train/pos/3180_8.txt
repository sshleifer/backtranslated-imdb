A friend gave me this DVD, which he received from the director at the feast, I think. I came in and warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were shaky and that the text was good but not the best. So maybe that color is my judgment but I must admit that I loved this film. <br /> <br /> Settings where administrators. Youssef Kerkor was very good as Ernie, the main character, a pathetic type in a good way. Adam Jones (who was also inspired) by Justin Lane were the best as fellow passengers Ernie mad. Bill's style (Justin Lane), who uses many films like panda, was far from my favorite; she appeared at least one-dimensional, and reminded me of a very old college student I called a guy after watching DVD. Really kind of loved, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of that was bad. I also loved duo of vigilante. Fraud and beautiful. I give this high score, although it has some issues, because you can understand when you look at what these people care about, and decided to make their film their way. It was done by Adam Jones and staff.
