Anyone who has seen this film and watched it well, I would like to refer to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and has given 3 1/2 Stars. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. It can't be perfect, or amazing, but I liked it. The Chorus line is not a myth, because it is a group of stories about the life of Broadway hope. I read a review where people said that much time was lost in love between Zach and Cassie. That's the wrong view. It is another story with all other stories told about each of the Broadway hopes. People who fail to realize is that those who play for Broadway performances pass through the same things that the average person passes. And that I think is really the whole show. It only shows the talent of these special players, but give us good things to think about life in general. This is a life study as a star of Broadway. Anyone who is interested in the Broadway star is watching this film with a great sense of relationship because they have gone exactly how the characters go through. This is good music. It has its slow points, and sometimes it gets a little confused and crossing some of the story lines, but everything, I was very happy. Look at the movies, and then maybe you will understand what I'm talking about.
