Director Sam Fuller has something to do next, especially in Europe. However, most of its films are more than forgetful. He did so even one real movie one in the "Pickup on South Street". It made too early in his work, the following movies were very poor. From the first to the last chapter, "Pickup" works on all levels. It has been made with fluidity without water, boasting the beautiful performances all around. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players have a good record of high performances, it is up to them. Widmark, who was not a guest in playing criminals, while having a basic meaning, can still reflect on a little humanity that makes his character attractive and also makes him fall of Jean Peters's character for him all more reliable. <br /> Fuller does not slow down in this real strict movie. There is a place where Jean Peters comes with Widmark. It's really amazing in its reality. This is not a careful photography. Less self-esteem than most of the film films of the same period is still a good example of that kind.
