This is the best movie. It is about many things: the hunt for the killer, the Russian bureacracy, the one-man car, and the relationship between this man (the detective leadership) and his superior. which deals with me more is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (exemption of spelling bad, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see their transformation from aggression and error turning into respect and cameraderie and working together. One line in the movie is for me: "He will say something good, but he fails to feel." Good works for everything that has been beaten, even the smallest parts have been done reliably. This is not an exciting action for immediate action; In fact, it goes like a slow game, but it's worth it. It is very satisfactory and not always a crime of crime. <br /> <br />
