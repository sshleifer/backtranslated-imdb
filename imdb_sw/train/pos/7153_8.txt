My wife is a teacher and knows the story, reading for several classes. It has never been seen all that was interesting to me, though, and I bought a DVD to sign this will be a movie that will not be true on my trip. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I found myself thinking that I was right. It begins slowly and we must admit that I was a little bored - but curious enough to stay with it. Boy, I am glad I did it for this reason it ended up being a rewarding and rewarding film. I would watch this again! <br /> <br /> Search was very good. Since I have not read the book, I cannot confirm the accuracy, but we must say that Jon Voight was very happy. You liked the characters you should love, you hated those you should hate, and laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. I can see how some people don't like this film. It's a sad thing sometime, especially at the beginning. All obstacles can be restricted (although it is important for stories). Once the story begins to gather at the end, though, I think you have been paid back in hope for your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
