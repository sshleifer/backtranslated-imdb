Many discussions have been made about "Western psychological", but this is one of the very few who are actually in that kind. It has a lot of name names that do very well, but it is a director who makes this beautiful film. Stewart Granger loses his discrimination to the British hunter to play a retired hunter of the retired buffalo who is respected as Western as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays upstart (as opposed to a young upstart, Taylor's character is middle-aged, too), who wants a buffalo slaughter, and a granger truck in business with him. They employ two other key actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to become their supporters. Granger is haunted by buffalo he killed, knowing that he might be blame if they become the last, knowing if they were the last, the natural way of natural America would suffer very much. Taylor recently reflects the sad side, but it is a true lie, unlike those who want to hear a modern film, designed by nerds and dorks. He is safe, and needs human fellowship. However, he can not stop during the murder. The latter binds two against each other, and an amazing conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well shown.
