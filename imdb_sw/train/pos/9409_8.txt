A specialist creates a fabric that is not found dirty or exhausting, but is seen as a threat to the life of various industries. In this exciting Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is wonderful as a gentle but consistent pastor. Greenwood, with its physical voice, has the interests of love; Parker is his worn-out father. Thesiger is amusing as a sister of the fabric industry. When telling a story, the film also raises some good questions about science, economy, and politics. It is good to be directed by Mackendrick, who would continue to do "Ladykillers" and "Sweet Smell of Success" later in the 1950s.
