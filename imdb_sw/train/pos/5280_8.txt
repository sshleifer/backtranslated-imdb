Reda is a little French of Moroccan origin. With his Islamic heritage, he is very French in view and values. Out of blue, his father announces that Reda will take him to Hajj (journey) to Makkah - something that Reda doesn't care about doing but accepts only responsibility. As a result, from the beginning, Reda's anger but being an Islamic Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk or discuss his doubts. Both the father and the child seem to be very hard and unintelligent - and it is very strange when Dad tells his son that he should not be too stubborn. When I read the summary, it talks about how the characters grew and began to learn. However, I don't think they did and that's an interesting and sad feature of the film. In fact, there were times of understanding, but often there was a shortage of hostility and oppression. In fact I loved this and admitted that it had no complete solution to this - as it would seem to be bad. Overall, the film has done well and interesting - giving Western people an unusual understanding of Islam and Hajj. It also provides an interesting juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the earthly generation. While slow and lack of clarity about the relationship in the film can disrupt some, I think it has given a great sense of film and made it look like a film about people - not a formula. Good and unusual movies.
