First, I don't like to close all the Neil Simon movies. But there is something about this that is unique, that it enters into, and I would say it is among the entertainment comedy that I have seen. The second time I looked at it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmother? Oh, fear they may sue, so he turned them into people. And how would it be quick if they were just a housewife, show a biz star is more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my grandmother is still 97 years old (even when she has appeared very well in the example of Walter Matthau!) He will refuse - but some of you must get resonance in these characters. Second, I have a little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he turned out to the most beautiful revelations I can remember (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, though he did not recognize the similarity of the character he had with the film) . </> <br /> Ethnic ethnicity in taste, and on, you can laugh and laugh or turn this. For me, pleasure reduces.
