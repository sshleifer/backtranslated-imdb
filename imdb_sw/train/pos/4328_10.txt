I have purchased a DVD version of this version against the current 2005 2005 version (which is a brilliant). In 1985 it was replaced by Arthur Hopcraft, who changed Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to TV and who died this year (2005). I remember good work, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and moving music. (Music in 2005 version is more low, but it describes very much). Just to take other monitors on several points: Richard Carstone is the partner of Ada Claire, not Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook for any version, nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by Johnny Vegas in 2005. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. All these versions are the honor and beauty of the great novel of Dickens. Now read the book! It is not perfect, and feelings can make you sometimes, but I reject you not right - and laugh!
