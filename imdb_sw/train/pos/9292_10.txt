If you like the film, don't miss this. If you like action, or fear, or romance, then you will wonder what happens. Everyone here is stuck in the gangster film. And what happens is the cyclical massacre. <br /> <br /> There are a few similar films. Of course you will see a small release, and it will be difficult to find. But the search will fit. If you want to learn the mile as a potential sign, then this is a learning film. You can't watch it immediately. If you never see it happening. The dark city is better. Joe Vrs. Volcano is more fun. But during the Dog Dogs can change the gangsta crowd with signs. . . or at least think twice before being beaten again.
