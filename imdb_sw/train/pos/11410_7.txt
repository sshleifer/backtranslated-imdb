EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me of some of the Warren Williams), leads the best of a small secret mystery that goes faster and runs less than an hour. Douglas Walton plays unpleasant jockey who seems to be interested in losing himself (hypnotism, anyone?), and suspects include a good number of support - everyone from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Advisor. As a bonus supplement, there is Nat Pendleton as a finger detector - and more, to get a decoration burden to deco to the interior of the concept of a rich home. It should be a set that was used in many of the following films. On the other side, the secret is not so hard that anyone can follow a plot for a lot of satisfaction. All of this is obvious to Philo Vance's detective - and then he has a final tournament with the killer film five minutes of being charged. It is clear and passes time through entertainment.
