Inspired at least a little Ivy Benson & Her Girls All Orchestra, who performed in the past years battle in Covent Garden Opera house, this film on the experimental day with the old player saxophone (almost) all of the girl's band who she played as a school school towards the end WWII. All flashbacks are also short for the original band on stage to bring us a wonderful music, and help you fill it back to the band members, and especially the girls' relationship with lone male member - their dance transvestite (who tries to dodge call-up). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turn into a superb exhibition leading as Elizabeth recently widow, and conniving, womanizing Patrick, drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the leader of the current band plays the piano bar at the side of the sea, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army Player Trombone. Cameo seen with other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw do this unforgettable experience. Film romp down memory Lane, and each star cast of what we should, for all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look good at their time! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, aged 69. He still gets my violence going! As I watched it, I was investigating a leading director for non-females. Later, I watched these girls up, and discovered that each of them was old enough to have worked in London in 1944 (though this might be a bit of expansion to Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you would like swimming bands, well-being, or just want to see how good a woman can manage to watch and around three quarters of the past century, do not miss this film. <br /> <br />
