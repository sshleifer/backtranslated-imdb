The big swimming pool there is a low budget, indie feels about it. I often start to watch independent films that have just had a good idea to find out that it is interesting, voter and people who have been blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its ability to be the forgetful of the film is a very first kind of entertainment. I don't know if a big bad swimming is any message or high meaning or example, if I do it then. Starting getting BBS going well, it was easy and warm and human, there was no great dramas or sense of meaning, I just connected with the characters directly off. And when, like all the good films last came I felt sad for losing that relationship. If you are looking for something big, or quickly or carefully somewhere else, check out a movie trying to give more than it can. BBS provides a solid, enjoyable, realistic experience and I felt awards and satiated after watching it.
