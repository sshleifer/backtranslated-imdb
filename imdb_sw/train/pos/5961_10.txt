I can have a preference, I am a novelist of the Hunger of the Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Dresch, who was inspired by Marlon's character in the film. I could not be more happy with the trailer, I hope to see the whole film and I will say more. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. He carries a multitude of emotional vehicles for good form. I can't do well myself! This looks like real people, difficult formula operated and thanks thanks to my disclosure against apartheid, for beauty and for the heart.
