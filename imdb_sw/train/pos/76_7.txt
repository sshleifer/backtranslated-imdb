Vincent Price track on the house of WAX (1953), a film that has enhanced its reputation as an icon of fear, as well as around it? although resources? showman. Although remake, old (shooting at Technicolor) is still a great effort; said that, without the comic aid of the failure, the necessary rest for the cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-D display) and the constant shortcomings of the story (whatever happened to the lost fund that was thought to have turned into a police station. with the given head?), this provides more than a variety of Guignol type and the total value of camping (Price hamming on the difference of disguise as an experimental exhibition showing 'non-' clever starters who used the advantage of his skills) stand on its own two feet. Unfortunately, the participation of the director of Brahm here not only shows bad luck? since the story incorporates two of the most frightening names (all of those playing with Laird Cregar) who had previously helped the LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). Youth leaders are played by Mary Murphy (as a supporter of Prices) and Patrick O'Neal (as a police detective very extraordinary, he himself could lead in one piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I have found just for a moment only used as this for one). The impressive view here is the adoption of a new detection method, fingerprints, which are important in the reduction of Prices (at a predictable but surprisingly high point)? Although the exciting stimulation of the homeland of the crime of amateur crimes has at least as much to do so for a long time! Looking at the stars in the role-of-the-role, the film offers a good deal of fun? especially for 73 minutes.
