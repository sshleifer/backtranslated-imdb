I don't care if you would like my comment or no but I think you write that the movie is not good .. you are very obsessed with the Hollywood film that you can't see how good this movie I am not a fan of Jay Chou but I like to play it and not just its .. and it may be you think that there is no great meaning in the idea and it may be you think it is not interesting but look very much there is more of a step in movies than love and enthusiasm and tears there are more than the US in the world and it is good :) very good. And it's a great cost to do so please please not charge the administrators directing you that you don't know how they work hard to make you happy at this hour and a half to watch them thank you :)
