What a gem of the movie, very good that they did good. <br /> <br /> The movie begins very well with a bad monster that feeds a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other. Bendan Hughes has Vlad's hobby, little to consider who this character is, who has moved to the city and uses the services of a real estate agent to find a house in Hell, we have seen all the vampire movies, we know the structure . <br /> <br /> The movie is watchable, but the performances of the actors are very tall and seem like they don't want to be in this film, but it can be just a part of the manual guide. It does not like the end, but there is a sequel, you must follow it. When I watched the film I thought Brendan Hughes did not fit the place. Later, I can't stop thinking about him, he has a kind of feeling, so maybe he was right for that part. BRENDAN HUGHES It seemed to end in 'Hitler - rising evil' like Lt. Guffman. Where do you live now?
