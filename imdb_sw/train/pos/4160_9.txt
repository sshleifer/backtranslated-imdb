One word can describe this film and that's wonderful. I wrote this film one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well, the movie is about a little boy who might get the world to get a metal body so he could take revenge. On the way he meets the characters of the color and must finally decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange thing, if you're a fan of animation / false science you might want to look at this.
