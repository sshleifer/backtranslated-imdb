I saw this film in the worst case possible. I would have lost 15 minutes when I woke up from the international airline between Sydney and Seoul. I didn't know what I was looking at, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but soon it was shouted by the performance of the leading actress playing a young woman who had been taken. The cluster began to lift and turn I did not see coming and for the last documents I was playing through the flight guide to find out what I was looking at. Coming back I was seeing Do-yeon Jeon sincerely who could win the best player in Cannes for the role. I don't know if the Sunshine Secret is an example of Korean movies but I'm in a DVD store to discover more.
