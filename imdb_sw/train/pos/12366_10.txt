A wonderful film, one of the best 70s films. He is realistic and atmosphere settings. Normally it was an abnormal view. I have seen that many films of some period of time are often not enough. Obviously because many horrible movies are old and should be religion, they are like a mental system that leads to the possibility of music critics here. Before reading the review already knew what was the final judgment. In the film is a good gift for 10 reasons is actually done. Plants read well and film as a way that was released reminds many of the Kubrick films. He feels true. Very good film. I see anthology film of 70 years.
