Thank you Jymn Magon, for creating 2 best cartoons ever. This show has increased greatly over the years. As a child, I did not like you because I thought it was cut to Ducktales, which was something that I liked Disney at that time (like Grandmoffromero). Then later it was good but not good. But after reading the review here, I decided to give another opportunity to buy a DVD and watch all the experiments on the first day I got it, and I was very happy. It's still my favorite part, though the series lived for it. By the end of the disc 1, I realized that this would be a top administrator. <br /> <br /> Anime is very complex and charming. I liked to be Wildcat. She is quite hilarious and sweet for boot. My next love is Baloo, the best attempt at the show. I can see why 'ol Jymn created a show around him. Then it is a Cloudkicker Kit. He & Baloo have a good relationship in the series. Later, Louie. Jim Cummings did a perfect job to simulate the original sound. After him, Rebecca. He has made a very niche, and I believe he and Baloo finally get married. And finally (for the heroes), Molly. Although he is my favorite one, I still love him. I think he's a very good character (better than Webby from Ducktales). And criminals were very original. Don Karnage and his air pirates always deny me, Kahn is cold-cold and angry, and Thembrians are always at least amusing. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, stories come from hilarious (Time Waiting For No Bear, Romance of Red Chimp) anything to touch (Person Elder & Seaduck, Paradise Lost), fun, funny & exciting adventures (In Search of Old & favorite Blunders for Whom Bell Klangs). These are just a few of my favorite times. However, Talespin is the best of Disney, far from Gummi Bears Some of the reasons for this? GB had a good amount of my character (Cubbi), while TS did not have enough for Wildcat. But the end Talespin is still classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 6 best cartoon ever.
