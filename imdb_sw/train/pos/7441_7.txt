Personally, I love Jerry Springer Show, however, I've got "Ringmaster" to be the funniest movie I saw this year. The ultimate satire of Jerry Springer visitors from the opening area makes you laugh in the movie. With a short event that Jerry Springer tries to try to ensure its existence, I certainly recommend this movie for entertainment value.
