When the war finally comes, disaster continues not for five years, but until 1966 when Everytown has been completely destroyed. In addition to destruction and destruction on humanity is a "loss of disease", a persistent plague for four years.

The concept of "Wings Over the World" shows a little corny, although it is a Cabal speaker (Raymond Massey) includes in his mission and dedication for his sake. If he fails, others will follow. This message is always emphasized in the film, bringing home to honesty at the end of Massey's cinema conversation.

Those who choose to be in danger are expelled by more than their control.
