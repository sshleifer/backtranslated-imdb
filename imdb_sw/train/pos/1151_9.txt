'Soup' is one of the best, but it is not well remembered than the 1990s. The first powerful power of the film is a wonderful A-List released. 'Soup' includes many actors and contemporary artists. Sally Field, as a neurotic Celeste Talbert (He gives us a long time while wearing a dress that makes him look like "Gloria F * CKing Swanson!"). His help reads who who-who's the Greats of the 90's Movie! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all raise the film very much. Goldberg is well known, while Downey Jr shows. and Hatcher is fascinating for the comedic quality that they will eventually reach. <br /> <br /> With regards to writing, the film is better. There is a modern edge of the script, which loses for a very extraordinary number of times. There are also several gags to see that exist before their time. Somehow, the film reminds Mel Brooks of its best and often reminds the inspector of 'High Concern' (1977). The great humor of the film is frequent, but it is a good day-to-day television and neurotic actors. For example, an additional publishing session participating with the operating administrator was prompted by Carrie Fisher, both are ignorant and honest. <br /> <br /> 'Soup' is for my money, one of the very best comedies produced during the 1990s. It is the best script and A-Class cast make it a must-see. It's hard to love this film after laughing it for 90 minutes.
