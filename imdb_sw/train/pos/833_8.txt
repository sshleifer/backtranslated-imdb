First I would say the director has good use of names in establishing shots. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed this film but I had to say close to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan separates from this character well, that is very hard to remember that this is one person who played the bond. It also shows the distinction and depth as the actors. It is a flick of indie kick and it was very good to see especially the most common movies that are filing this season. I have seen the characters being comfortable. From the middle I heard it was very good. I also liked how the characters appeared. We often have movies of these caricatures people who are not characters but walks ... I like different ways of this film takes. I think the other side when I think of this film but I think this looks more with the best movie ...
