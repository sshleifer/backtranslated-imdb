In Arlington Heights, IL we did not have a restaurant in any primary school (1961) so I rode my bicycle home to school for lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was a big thing! I would like to draw pictures hidden on a blackboard and see if my family or friends can find it. I also remember winning amazing cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the opponent received the last game of the secret image. I even had a home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game was found briefly. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could find was a hidden lemon as part of the bridge on the stream. Very good memories are connected to the Camera.
