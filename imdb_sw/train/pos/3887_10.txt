I was able to delete this satellite, but I would like to get the original release for the format we can use here in States. Eddie really is glorious in this performance from San Francisco. I do not remember the enthusiastic enthusiasm of the stand. My wife and I all enjoyed this tape and its work on Glory I just want us to buy a copy and help Eddie financially through my shopping. We need more of its available displays.
