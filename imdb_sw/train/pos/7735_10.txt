The best description of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-black thriller has all the necessary elements - an old striker who was standing, lowered a widow with a bad desire, an old striker turned out a short-term hippo, and a kidnap plot planned for punishment. However, the film is not available even in the country of cliche, but it remains and is happy. All these exhibitions are very strange, especially the role of Bruce Dern as a bad observer, Uncle Bud. There is uncertainty in the film movement that, whether or not, adds to the worst case. It is highly recommended.
