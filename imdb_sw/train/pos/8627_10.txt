My God ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Next to Peter Greeneway and Jean-Luc Godard movies, this is a real disturbance but not as bad as Nekromantiks. All small stories have a deep interest in philosophy and lead is a complete innovation, despite the lack of money (see "Figure"). Very recommended!
