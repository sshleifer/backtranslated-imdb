Turning to the "Matador" comes about half through the movie when Danny, a contemporary man from Denver, sat on the balcony of Mexico City, enjoying a quiet time. A man closes his door, and knowing it is Julian, a murderer, he refuses to answer. But did it really? Richard Shephard, director of "The Matador", gives us the character, Julian Noble, who does not show the characteristics of redemption. In fact, we have already seen him working, doing what he does well. When Julian meets Danny at Camino Real in Mexico City, he loses beans and tells his new friends what he is doing for survival. <br /> Danny, who has sold his deal to the Mexican company, but it seems he fights against the inner dress that seems to be the front to get the contract. Danny is a stupid person who falls prey to charisma and charm presented by Julian. Not later, on a cold winter night, the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to pay a permit and take him to Tucson's trip. It is at this time that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, acting against the kind, makes a great contribution to his innocent Julian Noble. Watching him going to lobby the hotel in his Speedo and boots provides a proper feeling about his behavior. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, has a direct part of these ordinary couples. Hope Davis looks just at several instances leaving us to mourn why he didn't stay long. Philip Baker Hall looks like a link between Julian and his work. Richard Shephard leads to fashion work and its accessories. Music results are for Rolfe Kent and the movie movies David Tattersall adds everything.
