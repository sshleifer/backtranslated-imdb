Being that I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, it made me even more concerned to explore this flick. I remember he was interviewed on "Jay Leno," and said that it turned out a chance in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy "Longest Yard" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a great effort to prove that he works. I can't glorify Snoop for his performance in "Tenants." In fact there are civilians / executives, like Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But the thing is Snoop worked "good". He can not seem to shake some of his body's movement of trademarks and sound importation, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has trouble making. The quote I found was influential in the role, and the tension between him and the character of Dylan McDermott. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, although his trick work is more likely to be blocked by Snoop is not a trick. As a great reader and a favorite writer, I could not help but find characters and conspiracy to attract more attention. It was congratulating me on how Snoop's behavior would ask McDermott to always read his work, and accuse him of refusing. But you know what? I am sure many authors are like that. His character was supposed to be guilty, as was McDermott, in his own way. My only advice on the film will end. For some reason, I felt just as fast, though the decision was meaningful and motivated by the characters, rather than conspiracy.
