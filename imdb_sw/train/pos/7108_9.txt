Would you like to solve the mystery? Do you like vibrant details? This is for you. Modern, clever films by Francis Leclerc (son of French French French Felix Leclerc). Flashy and careful editing is a Leclerc word, very helpful by Roy Dupuis who is dythirambic in the lead role. The plan is about Alexandre Tourneur, a 40-year-old veteran who got up from the coma after being unlocked by an unknown person. Tourneur strives to remember who beat him as he had suffered the deer on the road. Whenever he struggles, he has a bad attitude and looks like something that took him. <br /> <br /> It is not a destruction, but a very hidden and playing film. I have my hypothesis on the end (I think Indian caused an accident) but this end was clear for any details. <br /> <br /> I recommend very 9.5 / 10
