The Academy of the Academy of Excellence can focus on the largest variety of species. It is fully explained without discussion, it is a treat to see a young boy who buys a gold fish, with the love he takes in a bowl and then goes to school, leaving the gold fish without restraining and the window is closed. Over time, the nearest tabby of orange comes poking around, comes through the window and leads slowly to the bowl. Fish seems to know something going on and it becomes very excited. If the cat is very close to the bowl, the fish goes out. The cat takes the fish, pulls back into the bowl and comes out through the window just as a boy, without knowing what happened, returning. This was surprisingly made by real animals; how Cousteau got these animals live in this way is wonderful. I just want this film now available for people to see; I saw only once, in 1959 when it was first released, but it remained unforgettable.
