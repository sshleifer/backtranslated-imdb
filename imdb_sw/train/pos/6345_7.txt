The dress and decision was great, there were very strange lines, and the role was done by Jim Carrey. Carrey did a good job as it could be done from a sad disappointing text. Certainly this was especially a movie for kids, but if you're going to spend a lot of money making a movie you should especially give a story story enough to go beyond that of Dr Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it has no important features to be a great classic, for any measure.
