MGIRL From MISSOURI is coming to New York City knowing exactly what she wants: to be a strong thing to marry a millionaires - without losing her daughter. With a good hit it quickly appears to hold the little boy's eye, but based on his reality he will also recognize true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this very good comedy. For her hair platinum & beautiful accouterments, she is dazzler. But his beauty was not to hide the fact that he was also a very good actor. She has found the right to find her spot on the very top of Hollywood's pantheon. The best provider provides the help of the beautiful Harlow: Lionel Barrymore as an old wily, clever rock for Harlow; Franchot as good as his son, was beaten with love; President Patsy Kelly, stealing his scenes as a side of Harlow's sidekick; debonair Alan Mowbray, as Mr. Good Master; elderly Clara Blandick as Barrymore secretary; hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich eye for women; Nat Pendleton as a caretaker who takes Kelly's eye of love; and Lewis Stone, unknown in a small role as a banned businessman. It should be noted that this film was released soon after the Hollywood Production Code was established. Comparing with the Wife-Wife wife, made two years ago, will be surprising - which Harlow's behavior goes after that end, but uses a very different way.
