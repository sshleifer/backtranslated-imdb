LAUREL & HARDY Short term. The boys arrive to clear the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle, a scientist who has just completed his serum rejuvenation. Stan & Ollie continues with their DIRTY work, spreading damage inside the house and on the roof. Then the Professor wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very small film. The latter is a bit, but a lot of leading slapstick on it is severe. Especially is the Stan & Ollie contest will in the opposite end of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as Professor.
