This is a comedy as it was once with this comparison with two remake, PIT money and did we do YET?, Just shows more how 40 filmmakers had a flair for comedy which since then, sadly, lost. I was 15 years old when I saw this and even a little time, there was so much I could laugh. Now, with the experience of people with adult problems, I see many things that I have missed as young people. The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... fully interacted, but the foundation of the movie is in trouble encountered in achieving dreams. It has never been easy and free to view it as one view. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy which still stands on a moderate experiment.
