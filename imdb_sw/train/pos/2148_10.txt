I always watch this movie when it comes out of the TV. You must have a DVD that I think. Different types of people are good. It tells me that anyone can be a player if they are trying hard. My favorite character should be Mr. Aoki. He is very good but full of emotions. It's a perfect movie and play it for a wonderful. Unfortunately we do not have the opportunity to see them going to Blackpool. It can do with full sequel as they are. But I think it takes your attention to what could happen. Simple and innocent stories. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any remake of Hollywood. I don't know if I want. I am not very happy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more similar to the nature of Lopez. I feel that remake is not easy and innocent.
