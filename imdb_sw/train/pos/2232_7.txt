I saw this when I was 17 and I haven't seen since. 'The CBS Movie Movie' was a regular display of one step. I remember how sad and exciting, it really made me sick for my stomach. The effect then did not what they have today, but yet, it gave the impression of being alone in Amazon, having lost both parents and finding a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and dirt more, so they really were, eating its meat. It is a dark film that was hard on the issue at the time, although it was probably scheduled for TV. I would like to remember more information, and if I have the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe it may have been shown on CBS under another head. I have no idea if it was ever released on the video.
