Maxx is a comprehensive predecessor of psychological openness as a wonderful mysterious story. Julie Winters is a “social worker” in an unknown city, full of crime, and she and everyone who knows she has a lot of trouble working. Maxx is a friend and his client, bum bum who thinks he is a costumed superhero - or is another way around? <br /> <br /> Maxx should not be missing for art, story itself, or good sound of work - especially for late Barry Stigler's delicious urbane, speaking for the worst damage to the main villain, Mr. Gone. If you get the opportunity to see this, don't miss it.
