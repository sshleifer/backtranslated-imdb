Being a great fan of Japanese Gackt and Hyde singers, I was very excited when I found out that they had made the film together and made it my message in life to see it. I had no desire. In fact, this film exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers instead of actors, I was prepared for the courage but not the achievement of reality, but I'm happy to say that both of them were able to emphasize and believe the story as it was. The month of the Moon has only the right amount of humor, action, romance and great, when you heart discourage. I can't say that I have been crying more on the film and this time the more tender is handled well by the pair, in my opinion, of course to prove their skills as actors. The fighting events are very strange and although there is a short period of uncertainty to start with, you are quick to enter the film and start closure with characters. I recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
