The first lost series of runaways ran with the ... real and slowing speed. This can put viewers and people who started looking at half of the way they could get bored or confused. I would like to advise new people in the world of the lost just to look at the beginning and don't get pt away from the smaller intervals. All actors are good but why the 5th series' was planned ... WHAT? All this means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years, oh well, I will continue to check if it continues to tackle the discussion.
