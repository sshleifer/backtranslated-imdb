Ok, so borrowed from "It's a Wonderful Life", but that was 44 years before this film, why not a new attempt. Belushi has the birth of 35 years of birth. He had no wheels, his coffee, and he lost his job. The capper is when his self described "a large piece of blue sh **" car decreases down at the end of the day. Comes into an empty bar to call. During the wait, known by the bartender (Caine) as a child who lost the game of the baseball game of the city 20 years earlier. This makes him think how life would have been if he had won the game. He knows when, unknowingly, Caine serves a potion of motion in the mirror that gives him a home, prom queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him a president of a sports product of the games has been cans from. Caine later reveals himself to be responsible for these changes, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never knows at all, and in the development of a plot that does not know the movie but is still odd, he tries to accuse his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to another. The good thing is that they do not spend much time on it, as they are basically stirring up the "Spirit", and Belushi always tells Hamilton the only things he can know. It also brings a great feature of the hokey, like two of his kevetch lovers in the shadows, the new wife Russo, and his infinite lover Cox. But the keys of the film are the beginning of the long, and the end of the ceremony. Also a good job from the great cast and recognition, as Belgians who love so much, VERY attractive women chosen, and Caine is quite easy to go as a title guy. Surprise that this was the second Belushi film of 1990 dealing with him to gain a lifetime of wealth, which was found in "Take Business Services". Although all these films are the same, it is the same as the laughing rate. So look at this for a fun search of "how like?"
