The world is a terrible place. But this film is far from fun. And if you don't ... you don't give it ... and if you don't ... it doesn't matter. It's up to you if you want to play together. Every actor in this was happy. It's just a joke. And that's good for me. Gabriel Byrne is very valuable. Byrne and Paul Anka make MY WAYS, like "Vic" puts it, "... The best version ever". Okay ... it's not a Catholic, but it's not bad. I warned against seeing, but I'm sure I was happy ...
