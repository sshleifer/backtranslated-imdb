I looked at it under the head as it was Russian, but I liked it very much. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with deadly weapons as the expansion of his body. He lived all his life without joy because he was different and because anger caused death. When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya everyone tried to take her away and she lived in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of year, but not so much for those weak. It is not for people who love the original movie of Hollywood, but for those who enjoy independent films. Kinda felt the feeling of the fantasy film of Asia.
