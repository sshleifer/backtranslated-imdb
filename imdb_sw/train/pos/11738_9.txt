ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Guided by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> star: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene, and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> The plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) gives her a TV concert and leads to a small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes collecting her legacy of a dead aunt, hoping to make big bucks to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for him, all he finds is an old creepy house, poodle, and a magic cooking book. At the time of Fallwell, Elvira tries to get money, breathe the life of young people, win the heart of the stud (Daniel Greene), avoid burning, and put a book of cooking from his good uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who uses the book to end world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love all Cassandra Peterson and alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful, and beautiful woman and if Elvira is all with a bad and arrogant arrogance, not to mention she has an amazing pair of few. In this film, its charms are used well. <br /> <br /> I loved 'all the fish out of the water' to feel the film. You have Elvira, with her black black cut hair, her big black hair, and her big 'twins', and she is in a Christian town where many girls are not even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes his story of love with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot of entertainment. W. Morgan Sheppard is similar to Elvira's uncle / nemesis Vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a great presence but has not yet found a way to steal scenes from Elvira. What exactly makes the film not a plot, but many jokes. Everything from the boob joke for fear of fear is here and makes me laugh more than anything from the SCARY MOVIE column. I hear there is about the joke of 56 boob on this film, and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love spoofing in this film. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will like this flick.
