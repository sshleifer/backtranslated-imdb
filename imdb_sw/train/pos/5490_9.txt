This is a fantastic film. Not only does it write the eternal struggle of natural and unworthy people to hear their righteous voice but also shows the UN because of loyalty, discomfort, and neglect of human rights and independence. Chavez is portrayed as a brave and proud leader who struggles against what might be just as ridiculous scholars without any sense of proportion or justice. These traders have written a revolution against anything previously seen. And in the hair of the cross we see the USA, again we combine the conditions and combine all feelings of truth. It is a heartbreak to look at the early stages of the rebellion that we know that the demolition of the democracy we witness is a long-term tool that is used by the United States of America and the emerging citizens. Footage makes it clear that this is not a TV damage or a typical image but the work of the people and his government to fight for the future. Actually the experience of moving anyone with a conscience. Irish film creators deserve our gratitude. Live long Chavez. We need to reflect on the idea that each country must be allowed to choose its government and develop in ways that many feel right. The first phase in this process is the need to know what the actual situation is, and this document has a great job to do just that.
