Do not judge this production for an 2 hour edition released in VHS in the United States, which is an unknown and incomprehensible mess. I was delighted to see the 6-hour version of the DVD from the UK, and it had spellbound. The deliberate and growing sense of danger is to measure, as well as an extraordinary environment and at least; this is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and more than many. <br /> Director Franco Rossi was only kept in his 1968 series of Odyssey, and this mini series is similar to power. Like Bekim Fehmiu was the best Ulysses of the screens, so Klaus Maria Brandauer could be the best Nero screen. Now, I hope one day to see the Rossi version of Aeneid (Eneide) announced on Italian TV in 1971. It / I / I don't know what kind of QUO VADIS more powerful, this or Polish series series from 2001; each has a different reputation, and in many ways helps each other. Indeed, either one of the towers on the same Hollywood campaign by the star Peter Ustinov.
