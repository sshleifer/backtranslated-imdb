Okay - next to two versions of this film. There were 2 people involved in the making - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just a producer - he didn't have any kind of say it in the film - just helped with money) - the 'Adult' version was possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (if it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd's films below, they did not advertise this film and give us all their advertising money for "Righteousness Park", hoping it would lead them through; ... and did not. SO, this film has never had a chance. When "Twice" made for the cable (HBO) - showed the reels and the Bill version and John threatened to charge if it was shown again (you saw how 'adult' version was not up for a long time?). Showtime period received "clean" version. The version on videotape and laser-disc is a version approved by John (who is more powerful than Bill). It is compassionate, in fact, if the 'adult' version is much better and it works better. But it's very doubtful that it will be released in this version on DVD (or any other bootleg format). Sorry to despair everyone. I know all these details as I have been President twice on Fan Club of Time (it still has many things from the film - they had a version of the 'adult' version, but it's stolen - just with the current HBO copy now). 8 stars for the 'adult' version - 5 on the "clean" version. Any other questions, just ask.
