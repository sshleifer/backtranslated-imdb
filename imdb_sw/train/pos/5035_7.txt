McConaughey in fear / thriller? I had to see this. I was very surprised. The plan is told by flashback, and it involves a common and fun family of three entries with a very serious problem. I can't say more without damaging the entire movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to look at it, you will, even less, be surprised. All major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job of leading the children, and his work was amazing. McConaughey's work is strong and fully fulfills the bill. <br /> <br /> This movie encourages you to think. Father is mad? What? Is there a God? What? Where are the worshipers? What? How far would you go? And what is "right" however? I still think. <br /> <br /> And so I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of the most appropriate movies and a second gift, or even a third.
