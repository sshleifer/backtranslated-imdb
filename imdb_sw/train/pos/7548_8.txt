Short, but long, Cat Soup is a very wild journey to look. One day, I just wanted to find my list of On-demand through part of the anime and find it, and decided to look at it. I spent all the time basically and sat with my jaw jaw. At all I was clear of ideas, or I had a short time that shouted "TURN IT OFF !!!". But I wasn't. And in fact, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazing. Very artistic, unusual and dark. I personally loved it with an amazing animation, but a clear story behind him is compelling himself. <br /> <br /> A young boy - well, cat - might seek the spirit of his sister. In the first part she sleeps in a bed, and soon paid with a visit from a kind of bad farmer. His spirit is divided by half. One is also found with a cat boy when the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then all the lost film is lost to me, faithfully. I look forward to going back, and their world is ... maybe slowly fall off? Perhaps the absence of the spirit is the answer back to this, for another period of this film has various stages that the world enters. First there is a great flood, and next comes into the desert of water, and then everything opens (thanks or what is God or ultimately, as you will see). Then I believe they get the sister's spirit in the form of orange flowers. After that, the whole world will disappear. Haha, it never found it, but sends trouble under my back every time. <br /> <br /> With random visual events, I am sure there is a more detailed message behind it if you look enough and do some research. Personally, I would like trippy things like this, and I'd like to spend time doing just that to understand. But for some people it is probably not a cup of tea. It comes as a very stressful, so if you would like your direct animation forward, this is not a film for you. If you have an open mind, I highly recommend this film.
