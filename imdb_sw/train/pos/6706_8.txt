I remember this show as it was always looking at the evening on Saturday. Sabrina is a young girl who comes in with her aunt who turns into witches and she is one. So Sabrina must learn how to control the authority of the hr and use it effectively. Also must deal with a rough school rival called Libby, a good friend and partner Harvey Kinkle ... Show was interesting and pleasant. It continued on the evening of Saturday evening for entertainment for a 10-year-old boy.
