Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I am Italian! Sometimes I have seen this film: 'For the first time', with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the name of an important location of love in Micheal's bedroom. In Italy this film has not been created for many years and I do not know how to find a song. Many thanks to who can help me! I love this film! It's very romantic! Sounds sound is good! I would Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
