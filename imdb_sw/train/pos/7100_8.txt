I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas when it happened in 1986. I remember to give them an award for showing the film. After seeing the movie I can see why. The movie was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this movie is that he tried to tell the story of the side. They created new stories, new characters and tried to hit them near Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about the second wave of Masters Robotech attacking the World. They even made similar incidents from the Master Saga but for different conversations. As a child, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I haven't seen as an adult and can not give a better review. Looking back I was desperate but now I would like to see the film and re-evaluate my situation on it. What did it say, would someone leave this film to the world to judge? I love Robotech and I can't wait for Shadows Chronicles.
