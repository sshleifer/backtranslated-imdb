It takes patience to find a way to guarantee David Lynch, but - to change - the history of confirming the life of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to it. Although it continues to be as quick as John Deere's Sawa, when he meets the guests of the good variety on his journey we learn a lot about being separated from old age, sadness and secrecy, and finally family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth takes over his work for real year's performance, sadness and poetry, blue and caring. And Sissy Spacek calls him as his "swift" daughter Rose who pulls on his personal loss while caring for the father. Often a modern film is well-informed about family.
