What? Have you ever been in your life, you went to sports activities, tried the best for you, and then found yourself in the most important part, where for a short time, you were given the opportunity to become a hero and champion. . . failed? I believe many of us have had that time in our lives. This is the foundation of the film, "Best of Time." In this story the middle-aged banker, named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) who is suffering from a major football hatred, happened many years ago, has been raised to repeat the game again. . again. To accomplish this he must have the influence of the first quarter of football, Reno Power (Kurt Russell) to return. For Reno, who is satisfied with his current vote in life, see no need to change the old record, which gets better as it was at the age. He added to their two problem is the fact that the years have passed and in addition, all their marriages are happening and require renewal vamping. It is not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) is accustomed to remind him of a big drop. However, Dundee continues and will do anything to try and fix the mistakes of his life. Enjoy it for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
