Insomniac's dream was a very interesting film, well done. I loved the way that gives you only in the definition of the main character without looking at the viewer ... acting it was a high score - honestly, I would like to watch Dominic Monaghan to read the phone book! - but everyone, especially a little girl, was good too. I was very interested in watching the film, too. Typically, "independent films" are sandy, the shot-this-on-camcorder looks at them, but this director knows what they're doing. Lighting, movies ... works best. I expect the work of the length of the feature from Tess Nanavati!
