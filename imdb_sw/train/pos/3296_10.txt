Mina Kumari shows the most fashionable and only grace moving from the stand, sitting on the floor than you can find in other movies. The director has produced more memorable incidents of beauty than it seemed possible. Music and play is the highest quality. You can see in the first dance scene the director has all things happening back: another girl plays, the falling level of drinking, a lot of activities, but he knew that we will look at Mina's dance and I will bet the bet unless you are viewed this often, you haven't seen. Perfection.JQ
