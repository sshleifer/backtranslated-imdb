It came to see this Finnish film and I need to say it is one of the best films I have seen this year. Preferences are included in 5-6 stories, all of which take place on the same day in a small Finnish town. Stories are very good at the end, reminding, perhaps, a little of Tarantino movies. Many of the actors did very well, which certainly needed in real dramas of this kind. I was so happy to work with Sanna Hietala, the leading actor, and Juha Kukkonen. I saw btw that the IMDB has bad news about Sanna. His name, as you have seen in my opinion;), not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
