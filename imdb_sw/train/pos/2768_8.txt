Other than the wood delivery of Susan Hayward in this film was as good as any biblical film made. Henry King holds this film in honor of epic in all small scenes, and Peck is, as always, improper. Alfred Newman's exclamation mark, and the twenty-three exciting excitement never remembered him after many years. The incident with Goliath is slightly on the side of the hokey, but not all that was done during the time that this film was made. This succeeds well on the bible of the Bible of the day, "The Words of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It is important to watch, and Raymond Massy is as good as Nathan the Prophet. The film is closed and always good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first wife.
