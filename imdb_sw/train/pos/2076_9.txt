The Good World is a good movie !!! Everyone must see ... It's tears of burst and heat. It helps strengthen the values-nurture on patience, humility and love of the family ... Stories can be related to our life today especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way we respond to that problem is very important and if a person is not strong enough to deal with it, he can leave the useless and useless. I am so excited about how the actors do their work even the small actors ... Their feelings have attracted the audience. The movie can be done in black and white, but the story is captivating that you don't want to end. That makes it very good! There must be renewed for this very beautiful movie.
