A little fun in life is walking the old movies aisle in the rental store, and picking up things just because I haven't seen her. A great fun is regularly taking that movie home and looking for a small treasure like playing this on my screen. Long before Elia Kazan turned into a brand of only the most famous movies (not good people), she made this better than the average game. Checking how well you know how well, well or well-thought-out. Unlike his future films where the game plays great ... possibly more, and without fun, and scandal. Kazan was finally more than a advocate than the director. (um. No thanks) <br /> <br /> His future exercises will be shown here only on the plot. Tribulation comes! But here's an unusual Richard Widmark to play a family member in 1951 and avoid more than the trope of the trope, here is almost Barabra bel Geddes visible, and his people turned down (well, for him); they are a couple and incorporate beautiful-written scenes about big and small conflicts. Here is the observation of comic orders and shipping staff; here is a good time as after it begins the angular warehouse and a group of shooting steering shoots punctuating now. These are the small achievements of movie movies can provide where the viewer can recognize life; the Hollywood thing, for its desires, is now in isolation. These are the times you make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It is a human, man-made film, not a great crop, which has grown more so that he and others (David Lean) will later increase, whose heritage is still seen in the destruction of the Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge. <br /> I have seen it twice and I will be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is looking for in the last scenes, but it doesn't seem to be important to me as a viewer. This reminds me of No Way Out Poitier noir for Widmark as a villain, and Naked City, which must really get your hands on.
