Great movie I saw. You say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it about 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. When I was old and I saw again I realized that the movie is average. Compared to the movies known as good comedys, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie with all switching and racial stuff to break the little obstacles that are great. Also thought of how the movie goes is a good way to think. It's like a lot of movie but also a little decrease which is very touching. I love the whole movie so I give it ... <br /> <br /> It's still good for me.
