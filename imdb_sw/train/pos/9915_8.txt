I didn't go. I was running Vancouver. I would probably have lost this film if I didn't choose Air Canada. Looking at the small screens behind the front seat, I realized this and strengthened it. I appeared in several places and had to fly back but I had to look at the end. Now I expect the release of a DVD in Europe though I will ever be transfixed when I can walk out the door, it's still discovered! The picture of the picture is wonderful and the film gives a lot of insight and 'fills' information that the pictures say. It is recommended (if you have time in your hands).
