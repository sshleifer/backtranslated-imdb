Some films manage live near nature - "Wonderland" is one of these films. Script manages to lose everything on close-fever pitch, but without making it impossible. This exciting stimulation is not selected to cover the weak script, but rather to reflect on the exact nature of the drug. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is the only way to work for its executives. Many of the characters continue to the edge, and often because they are very serious. Val Kilmer explained John Holmes to be a hustler, capable of driving and control. There is no mistake for Kilmer, but its version of Holmes is seen only with the ability to control much anxiety. However, it is a good performance. Comparing this with more 'Hollywood' roles such as "Holy" seems to prove that he is home more in the fricks of emotions. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main force that works together. There are several good displays that come out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have limited time screens around their male counterparts, but they are all wonderful. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott provide wonderful, powerful energy for their roles. <br /> <br /> I left the watch "Wonderland" because I thought it was a film about an actor of porn, very carefully impressed. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but is not involved in his professional career. Basically, this film is a mystery of murder, and like it - it's better. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
