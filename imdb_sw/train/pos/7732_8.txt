The exhibition in this film was amazing. Discussions were good. Jason Patric gave a wonderful performance as "Kid" Collins in this beautiful situation to deal with Jim Thompson's novel. Far better than "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this film was really gone for the roots of fiction / film of natural roots that the story came. I recommend this film to all fans of the film.
