I read the book and saw the movie. Both the best. The movie is a diamond between coal this time. Liebman and Selby dominate the screens and communicate the size of their characters without weakness. This film should make them star. Shock on the label for disappearing everything that was behind this film. It can be easily franchise. Release from the DVD must have a proper remake to revive this film. Look at your TV guide and see if it's listed, regardless of how late, see. Not eligible. Are you worthy - read the book (same title). It will find you off. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we would like to consider what they have.
