Gray Gardens is the world by itself. Edith and Little Edie live in the closest isolation, eating ice cream and pate of liver in a long kitchen in their so-called (shared) room. Pati loses her mom when Edith insults the elocution of her daughter. This is to play Tennessee Williams come to life and should encourage publishers and games to play, as a wonderful and interactive chat is 100%. The situation in the house reminds me especially about how grandmother and her mother-50-daughter lived for ten years (except that they were poor and clean). They could always argue, the grandmother talking about its most remarkable history when her daughter always accused her for lost opportunities with men, work, and expression. This video should see anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship. It is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did a wonderful job to get enough comfortable edies to show themselves correctly. It is rare to see real life in this way and especially in terms of the environment - the remains of a strong family continue to enter the bones of their own homes.
