When the main story should be done in Morocco, this film was severely hit in Romania for 18 days on a very severe budget. However breaking their cards can be, operators and employees are playing with them with the wonderful skills and promises, so that I can finally get all the touch-and-effect results. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides good performance as a bad person. Script and patterns provide many gems. If you like the movie or not, however, it probably depends on your taking Alexandra Staden in the role of the head. Other observers have described Staden's failure as Modesty Blaise. They can be sure, but I have found a happy and very effective translation. Humility can deal with bad behavior through discipline, common talent and courage. Staden seems to do it here.
