Next to the "Star Wars" and "Wizard of Oz," this is still one of the greatest films of the fantasy ever made. It is a real shame not known as old films (perhaps because it holds a story based on a story rather than modern or sci-fi settings, and that is Britain, meaning a small film market) but it's amazing to the sun that deserves praise that. <br /> <br /> Like all the big family movies, one can be a child, an adult, or even a boy to enjoy this film (I am now 18), but someone should know the first first movies. I love this film. It has a unique music mark by Miklos Rozsa (maybe my favorite classic movie) that surrounds any of John Williams's "Star Wars", fast but non-flashy speed, good sets, conversation, and color use (sets and movies won Oscars), with high-quality Oscar-winning special effects (for some time, and some are still fantastic). And, of course, the sultry of June Duprez looks like the opponents of Princess Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones through!). In conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to the "Adventures of Robin Hood") and really deserves more attention. It is a true adventure of magic around, and, with "Robin Hood," is my desert island of the island that I could watch from time to time without getting angry. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (best)
