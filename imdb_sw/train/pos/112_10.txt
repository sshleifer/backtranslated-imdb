EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a priority that gives the viewer an excitement that should come with the birth of the story of the story almost a century ago. This film is unique, and the work of the elite. The camera function and editing are brilliant, and with the stories of separately used stories of the film, it creates an incredible and unacceptable movie experience. Barbara Suwkowa's participation and Eddie Constantine in cast are two pleasure of guilt that should be seen and enjoy. Max Von Sydow provides its main voice as an author. <br /> <br /> One of the movie types! Four stars (top rating).
