"Foxes" is one movie I remember to be shown to young people in the late 1970s. It deals with problems, trials, relationships and youth rebellion. Sound sound is good with rock coding pattern. "More Feel" by Boston and sad numbers like "In Radi" and Donna Summer. My young boy's music. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it wasn't great.
