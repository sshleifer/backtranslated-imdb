so, being a comprehensive fan of awesome movies, has been a while since I found one that made me fly (or fidget nervously.) <br /> <br /> definitely going to get this DVD when it comes out ... Hell is better than ring. The thing that I have not found is that many people we talk to after the movie think that it was terrible, well, if you think, then be so ... I know what I liked and takes the right amount to get me really feel afraid, so I should say that this is worth watching. Now, you may be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and accurate line, because the plot turns back slightly to help create stories (I think if it is displayed in the order layout, it would have destroyed something around.) I am really happy that this movie had very little deception in it ... maybe some of the label writers and what will realize that you don't have to choose red things every time you put them to fear people.
