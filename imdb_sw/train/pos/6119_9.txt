The same, but just dumb open. It's not bad for a terrible / comedy film. I was looking at how people changed it with Michael's version and that is a great trick for my opinion because some adults hate evil and when they see this it will make them more interested in films like this or maybe (they have not seen) fear (possible to play) uncle Sam , I will need to see about renting or buying the film but the second way is better with this but I have bought this on the Amazon VHS and I've got on November 21, one day before thanks. value four cash, l.o.l. in this film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
