This film is very common because it has a very small plot and the movie itself has been made faster and faster. Although this makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it still looks very much and entertaining. It's kind like someone said "let's just follow Cary around and see if it gets in trouble with all the small problems that occur when you are being rebuilt". Considering what an exciting actress who is in the film and the great support she gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. When the film has a very good demonstration, it makes a lot of material. It's a good film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
