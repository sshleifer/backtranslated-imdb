Only one of the best ever! Changing Richard Brooks's novel Truman Capote is not a true artistic achievement. Art of black and white cinema (which should win Oscar), the scent of Quincy Jones and the great exhibition of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as ordinary killers. This film was 0 to 4 on the Academy Awards and did not even be appointed for the Best Pictures when Doctor Doolittle was. Make a Figure! Even though you cannot know Clutter's family as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus on Perry and Dick and the process of hurting pain to follow these boys down. John Forsythe also attracts as Alvin Dewey. There is no error in this. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson and R. Blake the second second. It is highly recommended!
