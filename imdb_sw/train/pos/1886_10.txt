I liked this movie since the beginning of 1981! I have lost a song of how many times I have seen it! We can never make it laugh or be happy if I feel down. Three events are amazing and the script is worth, as well as how it gets to hear the sound of the nostalgic song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the whole script, so when someone looks at it for the first time I must have stopped saying something about how funny the next line. I can't even decrease, though, the behavior of Sir John finds a lot of memorable money. The famous person "I will notify the media" when Arthur declares that his intention to bathe is still valuable, but that list is not enough. The event in Arthur's recent home that the marriage of the couple is shouting, especially its interaction with moose. Make yourself a permit and see this film!
