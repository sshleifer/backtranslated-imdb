I saw this Belgian gem two days after seeing the 'American Boy'. Do not make a mistake about it, adolescence is the fastest trip, whether it is America or Europe. 'Pieuvres' birth (or as the United States 'Water Lillies') is a story of a 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who is similar to Scarlett Johansson younger) doing cool, given a girl who wants to be a team to swim school, just be next to another beautiful girl (Adele Haenel). It is more clear that Marie is more interested in Floriane. Describing all of this is a friend of Marie, who does not know, Anne, who just wants a partner like any other girl. Along the way, we are shown the most common type of young people (broken hearts, lifting shop, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a small quiet film that takes time to work your way on your system (Michael Bay fans, remember: pacing here is s-l-o-w, so clear), but if you don't have trouble with this, Water Lillies is a composer. There is no mark here, but it could pull hard "R", due to language, dirt, adult conditions.
