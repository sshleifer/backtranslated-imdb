The more I see Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate as an actor. Watching this film now (in 2005), I see it is not quite suitable for the movies that existed in the early 90s. The most common characters. <br /> <br /> The most common performances from each of the three actors, all of whom did good work and their roles. I thought, however, that the Hopper and Boyle characters were left unsuccessful, because sometimes it was hard to understand what they were doing and why they did it. Hopper is to love or hate someone of the kind. This plan is very good, and though I have seen a certain part of being untrue, there was a place where I had to give it to the director (ie when he sees the first sheriff). All things, this movie should look at. *** 1/2
