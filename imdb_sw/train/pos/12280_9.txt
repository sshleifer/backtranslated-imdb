This is one of the few movies I have watched twice in the theater. I love this film for its atmosphere and describes the life of the bad hero Esteban Trueba. He makes many mistakes but gets the opportunity for redemption. What? Is this not a conception of comfort? I looked at it for the first time, I thought that after the election winner, the movies would be on - I did not know the book. So the boy I was wrong when the peak came yet! I was completely out of the power of the last hour of the film. Many people here don't like this movie. I can't understand that one little one. Perhaps those who read the first book are regularly-change to the novel screen - just be disappointed that many things remain undetectable, invisible, unspecified. But as the movie describing the story of the touch-story of the family, the uplift and fall of man, the sympathy of the woman, the power of love and hate of hate (and preservation) - this movie is just royal! Additionally, the sound of the sound is very good and cast is amazing too - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. Certainly one of the films that the movie was taken!
