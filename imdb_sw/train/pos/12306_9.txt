Chinese Star Star Star, Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, an ordinary tax collector who decides to spend the night at a distant temple, where it meets the fall of a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). Ling finds that Tsing is a spirit who is forced to mislead the victims with a bad spirit of the tree that gives 'chi' (the power of life), decides to try and unlock the girl by giving her a proper burial. Seeking the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), the ruler of the Islamic Taoist, Ling defeats the spirit of the tree effectively, but he must also fight in Hell against evil Lord Black, whose Tsing should marry. The first Hong Kong film I saw that was not just a military act, the Chinese Ghost story opened my eyes to the wonderful world of Asian horror, a magical scene that had good ghosts the female, fighting with innocent heroes, the sword including the Taoist supporters, the unclean spirits, and the heads of darkness of madness; Immediately I loved the excitement of film, energy, humor, innovation and quality of sight. Two decades later, with this amazing movie still remains one of the best examples of its kind I saw? a delightful, breathing hub that combines carefully with fear, comedy, fantasy and romance. With the positive direction from Siu-Tung Ching, the best editing from David Wu, the amazing movies, and the absolute killings of special effects of thinking (including humanitarian language, many monster hit by many head heads! ) The most amazing and enjoyable experience from the beginning to the end.
