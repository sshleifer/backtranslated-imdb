Unlikely fun if I have never heard on this film. Shameful since it allows to have a broad audience. A wonderful human story and social message was mildly told, although legitimate predictable in its resolution. It was done perfectly with the chiefs. The beauty of the photographs and the painted colors revolves around the gray which takes the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent time in Chinese film (Shower, Home Road, Not One One) has been an exciting which I hope to continue to explore. China and its people are an amazing coat for film makers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as the beginning of anyone interested in the recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
