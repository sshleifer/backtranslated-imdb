I saw a recent movie during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and it is something I believe in the world, and the black America is ready to see. It has comedy, concert, sound sound is good. It's almost all the beautiful film. The characters had a good development, and the movie had various famous artists, like Wood Harris (Note Titains, paid for Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000), and amazing Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Caribbean Pirates). The movie faces many important topics in today's society in a short time, and thus so for class and grace. This is not just a story about life in the hospital, however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are, or who they will be.
