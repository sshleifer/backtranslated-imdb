It is comforting to see the movie you think it will cease to delight as almost every movie of the United States, and then be surprised when it doesn't happen. I like to end up happy as a young man follows, but sometimes it is best to show things in a more realistic way, and I think Brokedown Palace did it very well. At the end, and one friend is essentially devoted to sacrifice for another, so redeeming his original poor character which brought them in the first state, was moving very much. I almost would have done without the last line, which has shown that he did not actually do the deed, because it would make the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and little about crime. If he did this or not it is important. The story itself is bordered with the picture, but vendors put my thoughts and their best displays. It is very, very interesting. About 7 out of 10.
