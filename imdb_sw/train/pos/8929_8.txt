First, I liked the main idea of ​​getting 'intruders'', Others in the fragile Self, for different levels - especially awareness but sometimes more allegorical. In fact the characters are lost in all the film: on the Swiss-French border where the host leads the secret life; in his normal days and dreams; within the body of the patient after the heart lift .... In the last half of the film, he enters himself, returning to the old French colony with the hope of celebrating the past. Total tons are bitter rather than terrible, full of regret and guilts, feeling of failure to be more or less serious. This is the worst picture of old age, self-reliant but not hopeless and lacking in. The directer includes more pictures to convey the pass feeling of anxiety and desire than any obvious meaning. Some of them are mesmerizing, not of humor though, a type of absurdist just playing somnambulist you can see.
