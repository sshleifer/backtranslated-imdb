I loved the movie, first of all because it has told an interesting story, but the story as described in the film felt like it had ceased from a long story. Since the book has more than 400 pages, it makes sense. It takes time from the 1920s to the 1970s, in the South American country of false, it is also very convenient when it is found. I think it would be better than six hours of a mini series than that of a 140-minute movie. Even though it has run away, the story is not too small to get controversial. What is said is well told. It is then that the extraordinary powers of Clara seem unpleasant; either should have seemed evenly through the movie, or should be left out. Two other errors (which may be vendors): Esteban finally returns to good, and the sudden curse of Ferula seems to extinguish, although the story of the story shows that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> Acting is best. Glenn Close, as a striker of the spinster Ferula, is the best. Jeremy Irons, as a rich man who works very hard, is also the best. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is good, though she is often better than she was in this movie. There were many good roles too. The biggest mistake is that the movie seemed to have no language coach; each actor appeared to speak for different types of inspiration.
