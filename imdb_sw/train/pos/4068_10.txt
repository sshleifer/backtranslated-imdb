to breathe, this is of course the best cartoon anime ever made. I first saw the cage in heaven at the end of the 80's as a child and left a permanent feeling. years ago and I forgot the title of the film, and luckily the web browsing I realized this work again. after reading other people's reviews and analysis I am not surprised it has such features and touched many because it does not leave feeling. fantasy adventure, you must see for all children and adults. its better not to give the story away so I would say watch this movie will be clear and clear mind. If you have children to deal with this and I promise you they will love you. there's nothing to say about this piece of art but if you haven't seen it and enjoy it.
