This was my second time to watch the film (through French versus the first version, which was called Italian name) and I feel it improves on the following views. Competitively built as a built-in design The look for the beauty of the styling and Paris settings is very interesting. For a long time, it is not the top of the Polanski class and I would put it on the 9th number in her film film but it is still a mixture of impressive courage and, surprisingly, often interesting. It also has a good reputation, all of which are good, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> However, I am a bit baffled and suddenly forced to Trelkovsky 'change' into the previous tenant; away from the owner of the coffee contrary to the apartment building, where he is offered anything that Simone had without asking him if he would like any difference, there is little to show (as I could recognize, however) that this is everyone wanted him! Well, so he got Simone's stuff still sleeping in the house but what actually drove him to put on his clothes and pretend that he (even if he started doing it without knowing)? Following his night vision in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where all the Adansi disappears) is close to fighting the situation - especially where the landlord and other tenants have been trying to commit suicide as a night in Opera, a concept already used 46 earlier by Jean Cocteau in BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> At the end, then, once you are predictable and not reversed: what made the two residents of this particular apartment fly out of the window ?! I remember this reminds me of the first view as well, and I have the poor to say it is not so clear now! Mind, the first two-third film is very good but I would have that Polanski was not subject to the hidden points of the secrets.
