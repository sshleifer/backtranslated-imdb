"It may be a swindler * It is a good movie I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I didn't know it well but as I saw it Many times and more I started to love it I love songs in this movie.My favorite songs are "Let's Find Myself" and "You will soon come home." That's a good song. The movie is Charlie dies .. When I was younger my sister could not even look at that part. this is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are going around heaven is good in the movie and "clock" is very clever and I also love Ichyy, I really have 3 dachshunds my own It is very good. I love this movie and let everyone see it. I give you this 10/10 star film.
