Say what you will use schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-America. It is a moral standard for some Americans to be called for a higher purpose and how they came into existence at that time. It is inspiring because it is about people with good intentions. For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother of Bette Davis and brother). As Fanny says, "We have trembled out of magnolias." In the modern political environment where, led by a president who was not ashamed of the lie and spent 9/11 in order to bring the worst of humanity's reputation, we climbed the 9/11 killer rate to seek revenge for blood. It cannot all be judged on Mr. Bush - after all, we have allowed him to lead us in that direction and even to choose him again after his lie. Now, in fact, we Americans curse all over the world. Today, we look at this film with a new understanding: That the rise of Nazi authorities in Germany was not due to the decline in German character, but, the guilt in humanity that enables us to fix anything that will say our rights to ethics and ethics. I'm not comparing George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But, I explain how a leader can beat us with fear, hatred, and worldly freedom to do things that are despised. Unfortunately, the girl, who will do whatever is needed for her own well-being, regardless of the sexual immorality, is like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have their heads in the sand, not even wanted to vote. br /> <br /> The film as looking at the Rhine reminds us of what we desired to be - the power of human well-being - and that we have in us again desire for higher goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
