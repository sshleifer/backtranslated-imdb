In 1970, after five years, Kurosawa made his first film to paint. The Dodes card is a film that involves many interactive stories in Tokyo's small neighborhood. The title comes out of a boy who has lost his mind as he does the train runs. We get to know more people in a small community, two alcoholics who do business because they are not happy with those. An old man who is in the center of the city who helps out burglar which tries to rob him. A bad father and a child who cannot afford a house, so they think directly. At the end of the film, stories come in full circle, others are happy, others sad. Since this was the first color film of Kurosawa you can see that it uses it for its own benefit and shows. Maybe very. This movie goes in different ways and it is difficult to sit down and get into it. But do not get into error, Dodes Card can be better for Kurosawa, but coming from the general director of the time, it is better than 99% of today's films.
