This movie was ideal for the following reasons: 1) It had backdrops and great sets. 2) Demonstrated the distinction of the environment that was damaged by war with the same technology. 3) John Cusack's acting was severe. He showed very well. 4) It showed the weakness of everyone in a ruined state. 5) It has given us a picture of what might happen in the future in many ways. I was also impressed by acting in many places. Hilary's work was, I saw, very beaten. The values ​​and values ​​of everyone in a broken state are about grabbing. A free journalist and a conservative businessman have the ability to do anything in any situation and are also unpredictable. Great things. PSP
