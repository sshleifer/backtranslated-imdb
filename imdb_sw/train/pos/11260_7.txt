Well the story is a little hard to follow the first time, but that's because all the vampire's hit the 70's hit and witches dancing the drums. This is undoubtedly disturbed by a few vampiric violence. And there are very interesting candles and they use them. And for the girl on stage girl, vampiric or not ... this movie just rocks !!!
