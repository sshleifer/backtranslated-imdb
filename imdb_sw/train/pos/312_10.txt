According to true stories, this series is a gem within its kind. The slave who is the queen by touching the heart of the most powerful man in the village. The Tijuco diamond mining town in Brazil, a diamond-based advocate - chosen by the king of Portugal - is the last authority. After the safety of his family, Xica da Silva a little and beautiful finds his world threatening when he decides to sell him to an apartment house in the city, refusing to realize that a black slave girl might be his daughter. With great effort to save himself, Xica stole a diamond collected by a diamond consultant to the king, with a view to using them to escape. The king's army is coming to collect diamonds the next day, however, and when the root is lost, no diamond consultant is led by chains, his family is driven and thrown out of the street with only clothes on their backs. Martin, the son of the diamond winner, retaliates. Xica and other slaves, however, are sold to auction, and Xica lives at home for Sergeant Major, an older man who bought him just to catch his desires. For the town of Tijuco, however, comes a new consultant of diamonds, Joao Fernandes of elegant and angry. Once she was struck by the beauty of Xica, she runs the General Secretary to tell her. And so begins the story of love, filled with dangers, preferences and desires, between a deliberate pastor and a crafty slave who rises up to one day to be queen. The series is full of good faiths, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. And it can really impress every minute. Sometimes it is interesting and sarcastic humor and dark, waiting for waiting and failure. "Xica da Silva" is definitely unnecessary. I wish I could buy a whole series on DVD.
