SPOILERS ININ. It seems that von Trotta is much more easily and what is the balance of personal stories against the history of events than it was in the previous version of Versprechen, Das (1995). <Br /> <br /> The direction was considered carefully, and I found it very interesting - especially where the details of knives were involved (a series of headlines and new lighting lights in modern times to remember the death of various characters in the past ). To define two points that most people are confused with: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this may seem to mean, it was not intended. Von Trotta told me so! (And she is a very beautiful woman, by the way!) Second, the timing of the events was the correct correct historical date (the exact date is shown near the memory) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film. There is evidence that Goebbels was angry about doing this, and he had planned to finally bring back those whom he had set free. Overall, what was most interesting is that it was the original story from the 'over-movied' era. It seems embarrassing to have taken too long (for various reasons) for this film to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> Besides, please, Margarethe!
