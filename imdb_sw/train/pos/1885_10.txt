This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was excited to see it on a DVD which is an exemption to view old versions of the VHS of grainy. I've never seen it for years and I watched it today so I might wonder how the movie stands up to time. It is one of the most common storms, which are not available, where good writing (a very funny line after a really good line) is connected to good patterns and best displays at all times. Dudley Moore got a Oscar selection for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won the best actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" did not win the best goal of Oscar -it that no comedic actor was able to win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). Steve Gordon the film's film confirms each of the characters with a warm sound of the story. It's just simple, IMHO movies are a rare gem. It's just sad that Steve Gordon lost one year after "Arthur" released. <br /> <br /> About DVD that is available as 1/2007, it's so / so. Although video quality jumps over old VHS copies, there is still no regular gray version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extra bonus that is good but not enough. One example is a comment from the Director explaining how much he desired how some deletion takes and events could be incorporated (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make a difficult choice for the final edit. The DVD, being the perfect design of the material, certainly should provide too. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy which is one of the books.
