Michelle Rodrigez was made for this film, when I saw the first fast and angry. You can say that she was a tough woman. With this movie, he did not only have evidence of his action, but it shows no fear and it is difficult if he should be in this film. She is the most beautiful girl and that's what I like about her. This movie is about a concerned girl, living as a boy of tom and getting into trouble with school and family. Since he is interested in his brother's training as a bomber, he decides to follow his love to fight and ask his brothers to teach them. Although he does not think he has the power, it may be shown wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a little slow at the end, but it was done well. It shows, that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the ability. I recommend to appear.
