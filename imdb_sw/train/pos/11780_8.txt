This is a document I have received through the UK TV source more than 4 and I think I have found it very interesting and stimulating. I will also look for a book that was the source of this document. Basically this is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond on what some parts of the world of the world succeeded and others do not. The discussion that he gave is new to me and he said about how the correct crop yields and the right animals where there is a potential reproduction are indeed compelling. For the document itself it is good to shoot and well displayed and not a lot of re-created events that destroy many modern documents. Diamond also helps that it is not a self-degradation which is the fault of many scholars when trying to get a message to civilians. People said that his theory is Marxist but I don't buy this and see more of social geology. It was also fun to hear the theory about social reform that is not involved in religion. It is highly recommended to watch.
