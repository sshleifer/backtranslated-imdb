I found this to be a great Muppets film, because I felt it was a better heart and had a better comic delivery on a lot of lines. Muppets try to go to Broadway to sell the original music they have written, but on the way, they run into common problems, including loss of Kermit here. While there are not many here like "Muppets Movie" of nature, there are some with Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Only time and delivery of many lines are good, and situations that Muppets find themselves becoming hilarious. The original songs are also good here, and the latter is satisfactory. There is nothing more to say about the film, but the Muppet fans should see it for sure. It's a movie of the Muppet's funniest and it has a great interest to all. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
