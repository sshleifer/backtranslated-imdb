Among the levels of the same type of fabric, where acting and logic are taken into the door, this film is about class. If the person responsible for the repair would have put "good" characters in this flick, it would have been worse (except Richard Dawson who did well, if you could ring for his own "act"). I love this film! A person who runs is a gift of God to man (perhaps just men). Surely the most popular film of our time so I will share with my favorite line: "It is all part of the rich structure of life Brenda, and you better F ***** g." Ahh, many people are called "Brenda" for quoting this film than I could imagine.
