Some of my films that like Laurel and Hardy have a very small plot. Rather, it gives them an unusual situation and lets them become hilarious! Films such as HELP and BODY BODIES are among the funniest if you see boys working or cleaning the house. Here in DIRTY WORK, many films are similar to the other two films - Stan and Ollie are a chimney hole and they use many films to try (failed) to clean the emperor's professor. To see Ollie fall through the chimney, boys who make house-to-house aggression and the ignorance of Stanley's ignorance all work together to make a very good film. <br /> <br /> However, in the odd twist, there is also a really wonderful subplot that begins with the end of the movie. It seems that the professor is a true scientist and works on a form to make young people. Later in the film, you see him doing a duck in the duck and even duck in the egg! Since he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise you follow later? When this subplot was not needed, it worked well. What worked well is the middle part. Give boys something exciting to do and you will be amazed by the good results. One of the best film teams and almost gets 9.
