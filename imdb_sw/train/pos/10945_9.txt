Best ever since Seinfeld. He really really funny. Its general empowerment, gay neighbors hulking, leaving the song or cartoons, make this the most advanced TV show. One of the few shows I am sure to check. The area that was black black black in the drug store ("oh waiting now that you're almost looking at the old" turns the face with the finger and goes away lol), breathing overdose syrup, sleeping with God, it's all funny or so stupid it is very happy. It shows the weak points are her sister and cop-alone because they also have found the usual !! In fact I can't wait until the next show, something that I didn't feel for any show for a long time.
