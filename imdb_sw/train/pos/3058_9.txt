I bought this year or more for $ 2 (yei, $ 2), left on the shelves for many years, now watching the DVD when closed and cool. <br /> <br /> This is a haunting movie. The best performances of all the people involved, especially the 6o boy (about just waiting to get on this film). Plot reminds maybe my favorite movies, Grosse Pointe Blank, but it is clear that it is the heart of the heart, this is a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical psychologist and psychiatrist, the problem rose to my back when the new contract identity was revealed. Horrible things! Work brilliant round. Pete
