I've meant to see this flick for the last few months. I was really surprised how good it was. This plan revolves around a group of high school youth who are bothering a boy named Marty. They are always annoying until one of them gives a terrible mistake that takes away Marty and burns. A few years later, groups of uncomfortable youth are invited back to their high school which is now left for the party. However, none of the unfortunate young people organized this party. Later in the movie, young people start dying in the worst way possible. I can indeed tell you that they also enjoy it. At the end of the film, you see it is a dream and no one has ever seen it. But, Marty is in a severely burned hospital. Although killings have not been done, it seems to be burning and bonds. <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome but that's good. <br /> <br /> I love stories. I feel compassion for Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The wicked find what comes to them at the end and when they have heard that they are satisfied with the victim to get their good revenge. I would like to strongly recommend anyone to take this if you are looking for 80s <br /> <br />.
