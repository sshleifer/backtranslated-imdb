This is my favorite movie EVER. I looked at it at least 10 times and cried every time. My family ask me not to look for me to cry. I think I love that it is a true story written by Antone as much as I like the movie. Acting is an overview, and participants were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie she has done so far. I cared for a young boy who was also born in prison. He was a very young man I had ever met. He is now taken by a wonderful family that fought for nearly two years. I saw this movie when the war continued and the future was uncertain and very happy it is safe and loved. And I'm very happy Antone and I've found his family. I would like to know more about it and how it has existed since meeting with her family. I can just say good things about it!
