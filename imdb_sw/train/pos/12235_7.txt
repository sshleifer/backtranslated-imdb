"Good Man of Melting" is the production of comfort, wonderful and powerful Z-grade that everyone who respects the camp-horror just needs to see himself! The best way to describe this gem below the budget 70 is as a non-shy copy of the Hammer's "Quatermass Xperiment" ... once once it is red! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of the position of the position, but returns to the creator of the terrible disease that makes radioactive and ... causes a melt! To shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve comes out of the hospital, leaving the way to the pus and falling off the body parts. Doctor Ted Nelson should seek him quickly, as well as the disease has also put Steve up with enough desire for the human body. The premise may seem ridiculous but this flick has a great entertainment and has a great impact on recycling from Rick Baker's hand. The face of the dude face looks like a rotten pizza and its heavy immunity makes sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that the screenplay of William Sachs does not lose any time on the scientific scientific explanation or emotional speech. Breaks begin immediately and last until the end of the film. Just enjoy this horrible problem and try to turn off your brain activities as much as you can because, if you start thinking about a lot of folly in the script, you'll die in all the fun of the camp!
