This is the same on my list of the most wonderful performances that I have ever seen. I laughed hard, I'm sure I missed half of the joke. This shows Izzard as a good talented partner. What I really like is that he can never be "throwing" information to his listeners. Its time is unacceptable and the procedure is closed together as a piece of performance rather than a series of gags. Top pieces.
