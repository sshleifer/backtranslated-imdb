There is very little doubt that HG Wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century. Jules Verne claims to be the father of false science but his stories were more legendary stories using fantastic innovations as plot devices. Wells was great and brought the story of the story. Perhaps his great heritage is that there is very little like any evidence that people believed in life on another planet before the 20th century where so many people including Richard Dawkins consider that almost assured. There is no evidence of this and no one can help to ask if it is Wells who initiated this for human thinking? Of course it was Wells that planted the seeds. <br /> <br /> CONDITIONS OF ACCOMMODATION are taken by Wells from its own novel. It is clear however that it can not explain the difference between the novels of the novel and writing screenplays. Often dialouge carries, supplied load and is not recommended. One case for sure is two operators from opposing parties to discuss the war situation "Why should we kill each other?" This reflects the opposition, close to the shameful nakedness which Orwell had Wells in his Wells essay, Hitler and State of the World and it is true that the fight against the war on Wells stands very well. It is impossible to believe the dialogue between RAF experiments and its distinctive number in Luftwaffe a few years later. . There is an amazing and haunting picture as a child drives a drum like a strange march back and the collapse of society and the fear of Wanderng's disease is recognized by wonder. Even the story of a very lazy show of the past year has a compelling nature It is a picture that makes this film with the color of Arthur Bliss which makes the film remembered. And that good Wells doesn't ask the question "world or whatever will it be?". In short, this is a film whose mistakes are easy to forgive
