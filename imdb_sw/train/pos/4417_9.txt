This film is a romantic and romantic voice described by the eleven-year-old boy who lived in the Cuban town of the Castro Revolution. It is a true work of love. <br /> <br /> Names of CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just an experimental market like this action film. LIVING WITH JULIA makes more sense. It has more connections to European movies than RAMBO and revolution is just a trouble for everyday life of people and activities. The fact alone makes the film more reliable than most of the work related to this time in the history of Cuba. The use of high-pitch sounds weakens the story but the film does it without success Partly from Hollywood films that say more than the composer can. <br /> <br /> Comparison with CINEMA PARADISO and it's a good game like the film is melancholy about the movies, but there is less pain of losing life that passes the love lost. <br /> <br /> Revolution, like a JULIE film, does not seem to have an end.
