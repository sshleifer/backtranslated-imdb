... that Bette Davis version of this film was much better than Kim Novak version. With all other comments written here, I love the Bette Davis version, although the version of Novak has more than a line of stories. Davis' Mildred's feelings, seem to be more than a sluttish girl who seems to be an elite. it is a sudden feeling that makes * a part of a poor doctor who loves. He has feelings of despair, of failure, of "others" - a strong feeling that he despises. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, expresses her feelings immediately and refuses. He has no sense of despair, or of failure, or of "other"; instead, she lives only as a poor woman of Cockney in Victorian times. The Novak route was Mildred more dangerous than Davis', next to the entire movie. Davis' Mildred was ** could never be infected until he had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he cursed him - by his way of keeping the body and soul together, and by continuing to use his love for him - he gives a refusal to deny the saint of the snobbish than you appeared on the screen: â€œI wiped my mouth I lost my GOD! Novak was better. The truth of Davis was great. The IMD warfare is unanimous!
