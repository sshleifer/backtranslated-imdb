I enjoyed attending the Pacific and Eddy surveys at the weekend of the Santa Barbara Film Festival. This film had taken my little attention when I left the article about it in Jalouse newspaper. It seemed interesting at the time, but nothing exciting. However, I saw it in the concert program and I decided to explore. All I can say is that I didn't have a speech when the last credit started. This is one of the most beautiful and fun movies I have seen at some time. Photography, artistic leadership, acting, and especially leading, was not seamless and valid. There is nothing 'selected' for you in this film and really makes you think. Something that many films today make quite the opposite. The discussion is carefully planned and, although this script is not a wall wall wall, the characters' words are intentional and meaningful. It is definitely one of those films that deserve to see the second and the more you see, the more things you see. It is a highly layered and intelligent film. Sure when or where you play again, but you must definitely see for movie lovers.
