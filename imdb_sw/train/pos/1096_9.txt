I first saw this film in 1980 at the movie spot of the day. After most subsequent comments (and video purchases) it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a relic of another age - a local comedy set in the middle-class of America - but it has done well well executed. But it is also a document of his age - a celebration of the post-war hope, the improvement of the child and the age of low users. This film is not "pleasure" pleasure. The three most amazing three leading leaders - urbane Melvyn Douglas; rejected Cary Grant; always determine Myrna Loy - add to the memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My love - "It means we get an explosion" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". Love / Love / Love.
