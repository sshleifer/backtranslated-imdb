The idea is a very short film and a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaving the most desired viewer. The producer has produced a small quality film that cannot be compared to any short film I have seen. I've tested this film at the highest level. I also recommend that it is displayed to office managers and business people in any establishment. What comes out of it is the fact that people with thought do not listen, their voice never hears. It is a lesson to learn with any office that wants to continue. I hope that produced will produce the second part of this 'idea'. I hope to see a sequence. Once again it encourages Halaqah media in producing high-quality film and quality and subject in mind.
