I have a copy of it on VHS not if it is too bad to be transferred to a DVD and if anyone wants to bring you back to classic Christmas records please emil me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i searched everywhere and I found nothing on this and I thought that I didn't exist be alone on this planet that has this classic on tape there being other people and if they make me fit in them that very few that has this classic so I feel myself fortunate and I have every Christmas Muppets except one that John denver did with Muppets again think of his so-called holiday smokey i not for sure but around him.
