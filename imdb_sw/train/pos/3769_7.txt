Oh, get, learn to have a little fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy to me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I saw. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a little stupid, but come. If you enjoyed the "Wonderful Wonder", you should be happier with "Bogus Travel". This was a movie before "Dude, where is my car?". This only one is true. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you have enjoyed the first, you should love "Bogus Travel". It's just a wonderful movie and other characters who didn't remember. Just for your pleasure, see, then, and remember that it's a silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
