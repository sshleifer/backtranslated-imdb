Religious violence spread everywhere. Australia is not immune. Dingo was hit by the mother and the mother was tested and taken to prison for being "killed" her own child. I don't mean to destroy the story to you, but you need to know the basics before you get knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself in jail. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent a movie and discover how humanitarianism of people of different cultures continues to flourish worldwide. This is a very moving picture with awesome characters. Both Meryl Streep (with its famous Aussie reputation) and Sam Neill, whose attribute is a statement of his birth, is the best. Those with support responsibilities are also good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this film for many years. Check out!
