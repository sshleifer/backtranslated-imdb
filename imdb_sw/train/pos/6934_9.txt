Winchester '73 is a good story, and that's what I like about it. It is not your western day - it uses a gun, which passes hands from different characters - like a telling story about these people. Rock Hudson has an Indian delegate, Jimmy Stewart who is leading a strong and strong man, and Shelly Winters has a gal who can cope with the reality of her husband and west wildlife. It is important to recognize the proper political forms - they kill many Indians in this film without accusing. For today's standards, it is still violent. But it's a good story and worth looking. Enjoy!
