Okay, first and foremost, do not ignore the last person's check. They agree to fall asleep so it is no wonder they didn't understand what was going on! If awesome / afraid to go, this film is not so bad, it certainly looks very much. Right from the opening events you get a general idea exactly what will be the cause of all the evil that follows, and the end is proved right and everything is made clear. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, it was an eerie from time to time and if the old films went it was approved. Great looking at night! I offer 7 out of 10.
