I have spent last week watching John Cassavetes' films - starting with 'woman under influence' and ending up 'opening at night'. I am absolutely and completely beaten, especially with these two films. from the first minute to the end in the 'opening night' I was completely and completely absorbed. I have seen only a few times, but the feeling that this film was full of from two-thirds inside, through until the credit occurred. everything on this film, from the way of shooting, the amazing performance of Gena Rowlands, credit, opening, music, plot, deep meaning, speed, compassion, nature, characters, deft short ... for me , it is very realistic. I cannot agree more with previous views about making a desert island because the depth of this film is something to see. if it is not praised to have a home fire, I make sure that instead of making a final attempt to save the money under your bed, you will redeem your copy of this film instead.
