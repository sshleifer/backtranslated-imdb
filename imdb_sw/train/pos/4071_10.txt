I saw this film for the first time when I was seven years old and I was happy with it but for years it was impossible to know what the film was called. I am now twenty years old and I have had a film for an accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. though my memory of the film was a little hazy I had no desire for what I saw. The animation in this film is best to mention the whole world which is so reliable and so animated that you are drawn in the film and that alone. But this film also has a plot that will be good and welcome adults and children alike. with an arid island, a total of mad, granny friendly friendly and a love story built well this film will not leave you down I would recommend this film to anyone.
