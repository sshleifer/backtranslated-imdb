This is probably the best document I have seen for so long. Jonny Kennedy was still a very good inspiration. Not only was the most painful illness there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never stop reaching people and spreading his love. Watching the minutes of his long life struggle was exciting heart. Listen to the sound of his ass and see his beautiful signs of heart. And seeing her smile was incomprehensible. I feel that I am blessed to be able to touch the small giant. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this film - consider yourself fortunate to meet Jonny Kennedy.
