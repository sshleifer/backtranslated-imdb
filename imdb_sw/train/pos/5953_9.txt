I understand that Paramount wanted this film with a logo of Rodgers and Hart, but he could not solve the problem of copyright, so Burke and Van Heusen who wrote among them many Bing Crosby songs have contributed very good points. <Br /> <br /> Reading Leonard Maltin saying that this film, "fit Crosby as a breath" and I can't put it better. No, not the satire of Mark Twain, it's a Bing Crosby film and in 1949 Crosby was a star banning in Hollywood. At once Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming did not love on the screen. This was a woman whose technicolor was raised. William Bendix's Road to Brooklyn looks out, but it is a good effect of comic. The Trio Crosby, Bendix, and Mr. Cedric Hardwicke have a very good time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of its copyrighted file for filters and if you are hacking your version on the moon. The third song plays Mara and Always alone with Rhonda Fleming. The song was chosen for the best song, but it was lost to the child is cool out. Nice also that Bing managed to record the symbols of Decca and Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. One thing I like about this film is that it shows the Comic Crosby talent without Bob Hope. I love pictures of the road, but Bing was a comic talent on its own and this excellent film shows than any other. <br /> <br /> This is a Crosby on its game.
