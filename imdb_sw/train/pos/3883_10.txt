Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm happy to have it now! She is one of the funniest helpers I have ever seen! The player often reaches himself completely in his trick and Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing for the whole show. If you would like to laugh you should see this special!
