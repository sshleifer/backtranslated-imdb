I just watched 6 pieces of DVD. All acting is better - no question. There was not enough action for me to say. No real doubts like that, just a lot of first-class development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor for "whodunnit". If you would like a good story slowly and carefully then this is for you. Peter Egan as Magnus Pym leading is the best. The film has shown the life of the traitor. A man who would be a faithful member of the British Intelligence Service but was damaged by psychology and his unhappy childhood that fraud was his way of life in all things. When he was a child he pleaded with his father, but his father was known when and when again as a string with a man. Pym does not harm you with the ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those around him (wife, son, counselor). Pym is destroyed by the influence of his father - has eaten his fiber of moral values. He has no real love or trust in him. It is a very long time in the psychological series and not too short in the 6-hour series.
