When the United States entered World War, the government forced Hollywood to film propaganda. One of America is probably the best because it is Mary Pickford's star. Pickford has a young woman burst between two men: Jack Holt (Germany) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed because of the war as the two men want. When the Pickford ship sails has been opened by the Germans (consider Lusitania) because it makes the media, Pickford has a huge area as he stands on a motorboat and cries for the German commander. Later, of course, he runs all Holt and Hatton when he is being held as a prisoner of war in the ch√¢teau. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers one really great location in this film as Pickford and Holt is walking through the bombed-out village. They pass through a broken church which only one wall is still standing. Due to the wall is a huge cross. When they are standing and looking, the wall falls but Jesus' pattern remains, standing in the middle of the air. It's a very surreal time in a film which is otherwise similar to an un-artsy. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, pleasure to watch. He was a very ordinary actress who avoided the hand-moving histrionics most other executives of the day spent. She is also very pretty. Holt is very good here in the lead-man role. Hatton is the same. Among the list of executives in the "extra" section is Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill, and Edythe Chapman. A good film, but interesting to see the US propaganda work.
