I loved this movie !!! The characters were people who can feel. The boy from the back of the service still likes the girl who comes back. Tom Drake is always perfect in a romantic guide with Donna Reed as the love of his life. It seems to give him if he has been hungry for his sight and his hesitation and confusion as his feelings for him played well. Others of quirky characters in the shop were perfect if they tried to bring them together. The most touching condition however, was a young couple in his grandfather's house. I laughed part, I cried for some and I enjoyed watching this film. In fact I have looked at it again.
