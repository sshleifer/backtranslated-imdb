We looked at this on the "Disney's Wonderful World" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things must be closer to "Mouse" than usual. Since this film runs only 74 minutes, and it had to close up to two hours of TV, they had, and I did not, the rest of the business 6 to 7 minutes. And during this business break, they had another announcement on the "TV show" diagram organized by Kelly Rippa's oh-so-annoying which loudly announced magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". <br /> Again and again, breaking after break, Disney took some time out of the real movie to tell us, honest audience, that we needed to get a copy of the series. Thank you, Disney, for making us a service to create a good for your beloved gem movie. However, all this business and financing-register made the hard work of getting into a real movie of "Cinderella", because when the broadcast was over, I had forgotten where the story was dropped. <br /> <br /> But of course, the original "Cinderella" still continues its magic, and the story is still good, though we have seen it many times. It was a shame they had to be cost-effective for all markets for what appears to be dirty track.
