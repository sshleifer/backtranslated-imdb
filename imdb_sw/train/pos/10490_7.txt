But another example of what UK movies can achieve: simple stories, told and done well. Brenda Blethyn gives the layered functionality and warmth as a recent widow and financial financially closed, ably helped with solid cast support. The "small city" card gets play, similar to the series and many television that have come from the British Islands in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). As mentioned earlier, this film uses a beautiful rural landscape of ravishingly, in this case the Cornish River and wild coast. Some viewers may get a general acceptance of marijuana using a little challenge, others may get a little bit better and safe. But it's an enjoyable spliff, be sure.
