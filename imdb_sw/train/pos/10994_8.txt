This is my first opinion! This is a wonderful movie! I watched every night on the TV. For the first 5 minutes I thought it was a movie B, but later I understood what a wonderful product that was. <br /> I suggested to other friends to see the film, just tell me it's bad B's b. Its okay. Top parameters. <br /> <br /> I think that the film is close to the product of genius! A well-known director did a good job here and is embarrassed to say that he was out of the game all this time.
