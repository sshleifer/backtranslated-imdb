I have been looking for "Dick Tracy" for years, and because it has been an important part of my life - it was with me during childhood and I was seeing it many times. Seeing it now, as an adult, is still a very good movie - dark, satiric and very incomprehensible. About the only thing that can be said is the selection of Oscar Pacino that you have received - except that you have not been discussed frequently and did not make a great shock when you left. <br /> <br /> Pacino is more on-top but with a good effect if he's obviously having fun loads. Beatty is as good as Dick Tracy and behind the camera will be able to capture the atmosphere of the comic book of the film better than any other film, perhaps, I've ever seen. Just look at one scene from the film is to breathe. Lighting, velvet overtones and smog / smoke combines forming a great effect <br /> <br /> There are some of the most wonderful colleges including Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles," and I don't think there is any mistake at all for the conditions - even the most necessary behavior of the child is better than expected. Overall, a very good movie that has not been known for many years since its release and has been hit down by only 5.7 / 10 Average IMD. Review of critics is very good (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film again it is not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of discovering the comic book, from style to accuracy. <Br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. Star 4.5 / 5.
