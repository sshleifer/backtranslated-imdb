If you are a fan, then you will enjoy this. If you don't know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca, or Cin√©ma's Seduction, this is not a movie to start with. It is very beautiful, miserable, girls are hot, and it's fun to look. There is no sex even at the end of the 45-minute film, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not full bearing. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this film and her hair is located in the hours of chaos, so she does not fire in this if she has been in others. But its panties in this are very good (you'll just see the movies so that it's not a real voice). If you do like this, you might like to enjoy the "Girl 70", "Vampire vixens", or "Assistant Assistant" (which is a little more sex). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sex, more fear / exploitation based (but less budget) movies, see the Factory 2000 website.
