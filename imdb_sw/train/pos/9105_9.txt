Women have never seen interesting and pleasant as in the Salazar's Piedras film. Although the editor's editor here and there can help the film, it is fun and enjoyable with a terrific mark from the latest films of Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women face their male partners and their families. Starting with various stories that should meet as the plot goes, Salazar shows its female artists in the same nature of neurotic and border-border known by Almodovar. A woman with a high-quality kleptomaniac spreader, a burlesque house madam to take care of her disabled daughter, a doctor's doctor stressed by her former boyfriend and a taxi driver caring for her misguided children and husband, all striking Madrid in the scenes created. Using some of the usual Almodovar actors, the director succeeds in the first film to give depth to all the participants involved in the film, and to create genuine sympathy with each other. Women control the line of conspiracy, and men will be left with their own, finally ... Surprised by the first film, and deserved time at any rate. It seems that Salazar emphasized in the required guidelines for actors, but an invisible act is shown at any time on the screen, especially for Monica Cervera, which played in his short film. A must for all fans of Almodovar, and fun for all.
