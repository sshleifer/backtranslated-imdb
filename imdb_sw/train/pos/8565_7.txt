If you love animal films, this film will be fun. My wife loves animals and animals, she especially like the parrot in this film. It is aimed at children, but I laughed more of humor. The style of French style has made me laugh, and it adds equity to the script. It's a Disney film, with its sappy, fun, family directly, but I would like to leave the theater and interesting.
