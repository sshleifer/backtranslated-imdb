You must see for anyone who likes to photograph. stunning and breathtaking, it stops the clock. he saw it twice in the movie and now on DVD. holds well on DVD but on this big screen it was something else. He gave my two daughters to see this and they liked it, my oldest crying at the last time. The simple explanation of the love of the child in nature and especially the fox is well spoken. in some way he reminded me of carrying to tell stories without writing a document. which works for children very well. without preaching it is very important, you make your own mind. But this movie star is a cinema movie, what they did. just amazing wonder.
