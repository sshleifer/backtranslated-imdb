I saw this film first during the International Film Studies. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps because of years of age or wisdom-increased, he appreciated the slow input, reflecting of film notes. Kinorous and warm and dusty clime dust, the story is deep psychological, filled with many layered symbols, and inversion of the news that 'Other' in a country where no one knows. the coming understanding is filled with unresolved memories and guest management. Created nearly 20 years ago, it is also a multiplayer of many international films that explore colonial landscapes in colonial areas, without clueless for the cultural conditions they have entered. Also much published — with a lot of money — works that have been done since reflecting the same theme: Indochine, No part in Africa is two that in comparison maybe make Chocolat looks color and boring. It has no adrenaline-pushing action or severe violence. The effort is intelligent, emotional and subtle. But, that is said, is a good film, worth watching.
