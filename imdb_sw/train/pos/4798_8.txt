This is not a film for fans of traditional Lynch items. Instead, it is for those who enjoy the good news, or have grown tired of rush things and many feelings with Oprah-ish "This is a very good movie! You must see it!" - semantics (he is right, at once!) <br /> <br /> The story opens without enough, and we are taken on a journey that I believe, most of us will come to realize at some point. A sympathetic journey, where we make our past adjustments when it is near our inevitable destruction. The role of the actor is not wrong, the film is done (quite often!!), and the discussion comes only from the viewer to understand the story of the story. <br /> <br /> movie warm. Not very interesting.
