We loved the movie. I am a mother to two young people. I like to have movies I can watch with them where loyal men and behaviors. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever and love means more words. I would like to see more of the Davis family. But above all that I liked left me with the same feelings that others did "please don't be". We all want the participants to change. The new actors were rather good. My 9-year-old son loved this movie too. asked me to go buy all. He is a movie critic so he says this tell me something. Family should see all this purchase purchase for friends. Help restore time during ethics. We will be reading the books now that we have stumbled. really hope to see more. Bless the joy moving forward
