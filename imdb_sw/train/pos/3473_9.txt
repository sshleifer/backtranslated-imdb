I agree I was confident when I first saw this review of this film. Did it have a VH-1 climbing under the holes here? I mean, Harris and Quinn don't watch or even sound like John or Paul. But I must admit, this film really surprised me. It's far from the exploitation film I expected. Rather, it is a characteristic attitude, low key, modern, and ultimately looking for friendship, and the last lesson we all learn: it is difficult, if not possible, to catch what we have, and what has passed.
