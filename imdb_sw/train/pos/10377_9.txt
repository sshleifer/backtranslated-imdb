The movie I expected very little, and just look to pass a quiet hour - but it's time it was found. Roll is best if there is not even a very little story of 'land-boy-lost-in-a-great-city-makes-good', it is very strange, the characters are interesting and the speed is the same. Toby Malone is a true star of his film and his lovely photo of Matt, said a young boy of the country and Aussie who runs a football hero to come to the big city to try one of the biggest teams. He is greatly assisted by John Batchelor as a local Tiny gangster. Caution for these two. It is highly recommended.
