This film has tips that love their links very much, I love the last, when nobody knows what they will do about their lives, but it's best when you see and realize that the priest is right, it's jut for two, so what other people do there ? The movie embrace you for a new life, experience, be able to dream of someone else and achieve those dreams. It also shows you the life itself, as hard as it is. But it gives you the opportunity to choose what you want and what you need most. Hope these views work for you. The movie worked well for me. I bought a movie through;) Beware.
