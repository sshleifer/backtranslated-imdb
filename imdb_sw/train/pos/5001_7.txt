Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman animation always confirms how to make the animation well. I had a good time to look at the first part of the Creation of Creation. I thought it was a good translation for the American audience. My only concern is that many listeners will not have the trick of the trick in this show. After becoming a fan of the BBC version and a short film, I knew I was in the time I looked at this. The migrants did a good job similar to the pre-recorded animal sounds. See the first section with Goat, who is seen stoned, and dogs on the street that continue to call "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not for a long shot. In fact, I'd be happy to see the last show for the perfect season. But as I said earlier, the audience will not find.
