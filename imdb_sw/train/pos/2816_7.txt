This is the top of Jackie Chan's top, because the ultimate fantastic and great humor, however then that's nothing special. All characters are cool, and the film is entertaining around, with Jackie Chan is just amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had a good chemistry together, and both are very funny, and I thought the main opponent looked really awesome!, However dubbing was just awesome! The development of the character is on the average of this kind of thing, and the main fight is just wonderful! There is a lot of unpleasant humor in this, but it bothers me, and the end is cautious! It is very good to look but generally very well done, and when it doesn't have the amount of fighting you can expect from Jackie Chan flick, it doesn't make you look at, with one of my favorite moments in this film is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), playing around with guns and goes away !. This is the top of Jackie Chan's top, because of the ultimate fantastic, with great humor, however then that's not a great thing, it's still worth looking! The direction is good. Jackie Chan is doing a good job here with a stable camera function, beautiful horn and keeping the film faster for the most part. Working is very good !. Jackie Chan is as wonderful as ever, and it's amazing here, so happy, so much loved, as always does the stunts of things, had a wonderful chemistry and Wai-Man Chan, struck the ass, and played this strange cocky character, was amazing! , I just liked to stop visiting! (Jackie Code !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is as funny as Jackie's best friend, I loved him very much, he is also a very good military artist. Other cast make OK guess. Generally well worth looking! *** among 5
