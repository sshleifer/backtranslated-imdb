Marlene Gorris has put herself as one of the directors of the world. This sensitive, beautiful film depends on the story and Vladimir Nabokov and it catches well that the author's dark temper. John Turturro gives what I think is his best performance (I'm not usually a fan of his); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Well worth seeing.
