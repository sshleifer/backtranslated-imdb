I loved this movie! It was all I could do that was not tears when I looked at it, but it is really a very promising. I was hit by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the talent of Tom Hulce's brother who is a slow-minded figure from the traumatic and horrible experience of childhood. But Tom's behavior, though it breaks the heart, does not know personal compassion and is full of hope and life. This is a great movie, don't forget!
