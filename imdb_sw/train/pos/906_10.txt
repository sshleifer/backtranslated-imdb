VIVAH is in my book BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !! In my book is one of the best 100 movies found in the voice. It is unfortunate that this film does not have many technologies and it should not be very popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a true success from the director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj sometimes took the VIVAH brilliant. This is the most simple and beautiful movies I have seen this year. After seeing Don 2 which was the CRAP and the future Dhoom 2 which even hitting don in it, I finally saw the movie which is close to my heart and my culture. I don't know why the voice is moving away from the good culture we have and making fingerprints of finger fingers like Dhoom 2 and don. The story is good and is very closely linked to the Indian system of planned marriage that I also want to be part of. Our system that teaches us to obey the elders, to follow and undoubtedly listen to their views is clearly shown in this film! Of course there is no power in choosing your life partner and it should be a short meeting between couples and to them to decide whether it is clearly displayed in this film. Retrieving the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of Safari among the good times of promising and marriage. The phase where the boy meets the girl! .... They both understand. They are trying to try if they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the many that occur during marriage. > <br ita ita ita ita ita ita ita ita ita ita These songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like the TRADITIONAL PRAYER MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I need to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
