There is no denying that Ealing games are good, but for me this film looks like one of the best. The basic background of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is found to be part of Burgundy, not Britain. We then follow the lives of the residents in their war set treasure found after the bomb explodes, and put out black market traders who soon realize that being exempt from the UK law, rationing does not exist. When they are prisoners on their own street because the government has decided to be closed by the fighters we see them fighting against the system. They are forced to water and food in their right stand. In fact it's worse than they were before they all started, that's where the values ​​come. It is when they lose any food they think they are beaten and ask to surrender, just have all London respond to their problem by sending food, lots of it. So it enables them to continue their fight. This film is a very accurate symbol, acting is good, and Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren are standing out. It's just smoothly, not a lot of shock and storytelling was not caught under your throat. Well worth watching
