Found in the city center and outside the Detroit screen, this comedy became a new comedic of a new comedic. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very good man, who happens to be an army from Japan on the way of a secret industrial thief, who has a kind of 'proto type' super turbo, for fear he goes to the United States following a thief, having ordered his commander . Pat's behavior faces the 'Jay Leno' character, speaking quickly 'but under the form of a Detroit cop player. While crossing the route, although Japan's 'Ways' are respected, they meet the 'ways' of the former Detroit police investigation. Two obstacles have to walk each other for the first time, but then develop 'rythym' which turns into a dynamic layered force force, which solves the case, cool. After fighting the city's crime boss with a stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two come out of disrespect to be friends and work together. Slightly more to wear and the need for extended holidays over all, they manage to come to win the win. I measured this 9. The direction of Lewis makes' this become a comedy almost completely. Enjoy for all ages. I strongly recommend. (***)
