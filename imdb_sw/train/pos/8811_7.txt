Film and eleven artists from different parts of the world gathered in this film to express their views and ideas about the WTC attacks. This is one of the best efforts you will see in any movie. Movies like this are rarely performed and respected. This movie tries to touch every WTC base. Here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film unique. There is a story from Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for an attack from America. There is a teacher trying to educate his pupils by informing them about innocent people killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes the story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where the film creator comes face-to-face with the dead soldiers in the WTC attacks and the Emergency Disease who was involved in the WTC attack. Then we see the story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of five Non-True Children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap and win money from America. Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you can see the Black Screen and slowly see the real footage of the WTC buildings come down. And the people who have fled the building are going down to save their lives. The most important stories are from Mira Nair (India) where the mother struggles to find respect for her dead son whose name is tied to a lie in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, our heart blows automatically as we hear two names anywhere in the world. First is the World Trade Center and second is Osama! This film completely transforms our perspective and makes a powerful step to claim something more. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this film to everyone who likes to have that kind of DVD collection at home. Surely the value of each money you spend. But please do not expect anything other than the film on this DVD. Certainly there are films of movie traders but no extra features.
