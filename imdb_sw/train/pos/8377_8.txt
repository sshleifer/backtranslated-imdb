My friend and I have something of Robots. So I try to find movies with robots. And this film has robots. Great. They beat pigs and bangs between each other, as well as the destiny of the nations that live in equality. In fact it's cool. You should forgive this film many shortcomings and just try to understand what the director and his staff of the technicians could put on the screen while working with a definite budget. It is very difficult to love this film. Because of those big robots. They seemed like Transformers and they fought as a wrestlers! It made my girl smile. And that's good for me. And specific mention should be made by the character of the former character Paul Koslo: as a surprise Russian villain, though he is ruthlessly protesting against his unsuspecting opponents after they have already surrendered or complained that around them around him in the bar has caused his vodka to taste " as a blood "(a line for the top of Bela Bela Lugosi) is clear to have a ball and film benefits at any time while screens. This is a little flick that fits its features of worship.
