After what was considered to be the official dirty poll Harry and The Enforcer (1976) became the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, more dirt and grittier than ever since 1971 classic. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> But now it's a new killer, a murderer who he wants to pay, to beat his attackers. The sudden Impact brings new meaning and black voice to Dirty Harry. Callahan is a new murder case that surrounds the back of a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, with her sister, who has survived. Ten years later, he is out of retaliation by beat his attackers. At the same time, Callahan had a serious problem with his superiors after leading the master of the attack on the heart attack, which people are hunting for him. So to allow the heat to die in the city, Harry is to go on vacation in the city of the sea, but at the same time the rapist is in the city too, while hunting his attackers individually. Harry is on the investigation and sees the killings are very similar, as he lives in the ways of the killer. A sudden impact on my opinion, must be one of my top 10 retaliation films, as well as the second Dirty Harry film yet, better than both Enforcer and The Dead Pool together. Impact suddenly has what nature of Dirty Harry, the dark voice and the value of entertainment. So you feel lucky, punk?
