Not only this film has one of the biggest film titles, it is a third-party partnership of 70 actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I have found to remember this film that will announce Halloween week back in '78 facing Linda Blair in Stranger at our House. I missed the first time to choose to see another film. Later, repeatedly, I noticed I made the right choice. The movie is not so bad, but, you have no reviews or surprises. However, I liked the area where Richard Crenna is promoting a family dog ​​without any benefit.
