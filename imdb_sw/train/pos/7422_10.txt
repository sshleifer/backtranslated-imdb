As a long-term fan of Barbra, publish any such search. That aside, this film is an array. It has restrictions (stressed in other ads), but offers time information (late 70s) which will no longer be, and is happy to look at the screen. Streisand won hard to make this film his own. I don't think she was satisfied. But it gives his fans a new Barbra (for a while) and singing LIVE, a little visibility of young people, and some heavy-duty task. <br /> <br /> Stories are bad, but exciting, and they hold your interest around. One "end" layout is difficult for many non-Barb stayers, but speaks to those who enjoy his talent. <br /> <br />
