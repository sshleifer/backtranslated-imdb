Cluster is simple. These movies begin to look like your typical blind chick flick on two interesting young people to meet each other at the airport, then things take 180 degree turn ... <br /> <br /> I for one, really dislike mind numbing love story nonsense which extracts the usual cinema movies. And it is my opinion of humility that Wes Craven, according to his original meta-horror films (Sceam) also ... Lovely pleasing to delightful, and just have AWESOME basket Cillian Murphy that dreamworld all filled with sugar ... <br /> <br /> Scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, find it blind, right? ) in this film is amazing, he goes from being totally alive to be a nihilistic sicko, which is included in my book. If she continues to evict her striker (Jennifer Garner who looked like Rachel McAdams, whom I found very interesting in the way), you can't help but sympathize with someone ... <br /> <br /> Murphy, locking all the guns of the club without thinking ... <br /> <br /> Craven, and praise. The best quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after hitting snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane): "Thanks for quickie !!!"
