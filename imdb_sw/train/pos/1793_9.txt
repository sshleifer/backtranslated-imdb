I saw a Sunday afternoon movie. I really liked this film. I loved everything about it, from the time of sappy of mother and daughter on events where Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries because of her bad decision in marrying someone with her parents and not because she is really in love. I loved this time because they were only true. At first I was very scared because I was hoping that it was not going to be like Bobby, which was to be thrown down but not a real non-real movie. But in the middle of the movie I felt quite different. You will laugh and cry but eventually you want to see the evening once more. Believe me when I say GO see!
