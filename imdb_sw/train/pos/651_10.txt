** possible advisors ** <br /> <br /> I love this film and have no problem staying awake for it. Reminds me at 20, unless this is better. As Veronica says, two chicks at the same time. It brings input into me, regular conversation, these two chicks of real life, instead of hookers, breaks every step of the way. I'm getting into the conversation too. Even if it is completely b.s. from time to time, why? Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to is about on himself is usually full of meaningless free b.s. philosophy. It's just a false group, and about as wise as b. Philosophy of philosophy often enters into: charts. The only program with this movie is the husband is almost like a woman like women, she is in b. and humility. The brunette bubble is really a man there. <br /> <br /> I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chicken gets clearly exposed to Veronica. He would like to pull a little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica is going all his way. He is a brilliant. He gets a brunette to think there is something between them, and then he steals a boy-child / person, which is just right because they seem to be from the same age group. Brunette knows that she has had the last time, whilst her face in her hands when Marlene Deitrich is singing back to that, paraphrasing, there are a million couple in Paris this night, but I'm just this to avoid. <Br /> <br /> Do they marry the last marriage, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only think of a deep endless relationship in the break before marriage. They are very selfish to be anything to each other than to stone. <br /> <br /> I like this film though. It was interesting, it looks good, and it's sexy.
