I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my famous military show, hands down. I hate normal tolerance and generally does not like discussion discussions, but when Hal Sparks attended the Talk Soup, it was necessary to watch TV for me. I rarely missed a part during his flight, and I was sad when foreign troops began to shed (though most of the visitors still did a good job). <br /> <br /> However, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I think they should never have seen the weekend professionals. They were long periods of the Talk Soup that included the best from the whole week, and were closed out with the comedy sketch sessions. The original bits that Hal Sparks had said. In one he had a bad comedy collateral, and in the exorcist as his head spun head as he told the joke of the day about bird food. One time devoted to disgusting the entry, as the Hal Sparks group was saved, has continued to multiply through that part, on the label. Well, maybe this doesn't sound like funny when I explain it, but all I know is that instead of Talk Soup, just two other scenes I have watched over time are The Simpsons and Late Night and Conan O ' Brian. So, if you like the comedy exhibition of these exhibitions, then I would like the Talk Soup when Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That said, Henson and Tyler were two forces too. All three forces brought something different from the table but all were good comedians in my opinion. In fact, in the years of the Tyler star and stars, my interest in this show began to decline, but every now and then I will find Soup, spiritual successor of the show, and indeed, a new host can bring unexpected laughter from time to time. Well, I've lost enough time to talk about a TV show that no longer exists in air and at the center that I am generally popular. Go see something else!
