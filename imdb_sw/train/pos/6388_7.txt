Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before looking at it: <br /> <br /> * - It is the first adventure of Disney's sci-fi animation. I don't know how appropriate (I like nitpick) but it made me the first heart when I heard it described. * The summary was seen, for the most part, cool. Obviously, it was also "a great cry" according to other critics after the truth. <br /> <br /> * - It seems to have been so bad that Disney said, "Dial, redirect us again" Spy Kids ". So, with all that said, how is the film? Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for an animated fantasy which involves stirring music and very special effects, but "Atlantis" goes out. It's a loss for all the shots of CGI's eye-candy in "Beauty and Animal" and "Aladdin", so much that is close to the best Effects of Display. The characters are probably not remembered (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is very small, but this is not the film you expect. Here is a discussion you are bothering me. "Failure" (like, "only" takes, as, five million and one hundred or something; as evidence of the death of traditional animation. I don't think that's true. How do you handle the "South Park" film? What? "Final Fantasy"? True, stories and art are everything, not the way. I don't know what a Disney film would be like, but I don't think it didn't go on the picture yet.
