I was a fan of the series as a child and after that has always remained in my mind as one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to the original animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait un Fois l 'Homme ..., many of whom I love). I see that other Japanese cartoons of this kind of later released can not be identical to Mazinger Z, if they started to stimulate repeating the same pattern. That thing, novel, can be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good reason is its invention, and many fascinating organisms, amazing devices and amazing characters; in fact, we were eager to see every new phase to find out what kind of new fiend or bad machine waited!
