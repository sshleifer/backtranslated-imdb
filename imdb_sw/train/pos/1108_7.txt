Some of the Altman recognized "masterpieces" seem sad to me now. Maybe it's me. As the last auditor, I even like the "minor" Altman (shown recently on FMC), although I don't think he had a target of many viewers. Political organization as "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of the "docudrama" of the satellite are now installed, like Dick Cavett watching Tonight Show, but I've got a lot of wonderful and insightful conversations (eg "You are real." That means you don't have a threat to anyone "). The story is not "big," but I liked it, and these are amazing, especially Cavett (like "own"), Lauren Bacall as a conservative old man, Glenda Jackson (who served as a member of Parliament) as a left-wing professional. (in the opening area of ​​teaching a person dressed as a carrot on politics), and Carol Burnett as a basketball case. All in the inappropriate style of Altman, though perhaps not as inimitable as usual.
