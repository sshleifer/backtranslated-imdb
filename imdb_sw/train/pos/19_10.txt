I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel it should fly here. I understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this film is that it is not afraid to travel the black road to loneliness, failure, lust and sadness. Each of these two men, as shown, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, but to find meekness and comfort in each other. Just a good acting can do this work without having a emotional quagmire, feeling and gun. In fact I was interested in these people because of their humanity given by these great performances. I have any reason to love Jane Fonda for Vietnam's actions, but personal feelings, she's amazing in this role. Robert DeNiro is as good as a man whose mind and goodness begins his failure in the world without his power. This is the first I have seen DeNiro with compassion rather than the difficulty of selling the character and I love it. This film was a great surprise when I watched it first and I hope to see it again.
