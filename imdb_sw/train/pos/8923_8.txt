Blob is the 1950s of the B-movie sci-fi flick. Maybe you know the story: two young people (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit down, and when they go to find it, they run to an old man with some weird ... blob attached to his hand. They take her to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, blob spreads, eating everyone in his way. Special effects are fun, like the story. There is a lot of touch, like a soldier who plays chess on radio and cops in another district. It's not a trick, but it has a special place in its kind. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
