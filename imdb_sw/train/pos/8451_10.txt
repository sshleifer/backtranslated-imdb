When I went into it: When I started looking at this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I have never seen anything like this, and it was better. But when I started collecting a series on VHS, and years later on DVD part of the Bandai collections of Anime Legends. It was amazing, and worth looking. It had a lot of explosive action that would beat out of your seat. And of course, the headlines "Communication Only", and the Rhythm Sounds were "better." Night, Noin, and Zechs. My favorite gundams in the samples that I liked most are Zero Wing, and Epyon, and in fact Altron, and Deathscythe I, and II. very much and we can sometimes win or lose. If peace can also be hard to find, and I believe the Gundam fighters are doing the right thing, and trying to get world peace. This review, after watching this show, see Movie Endless Waltz.
