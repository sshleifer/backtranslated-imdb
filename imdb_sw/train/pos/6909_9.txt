... and if you are very good, you will be seen as the Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a little story, but it was fantasy after all, and composing and acting was a spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actress / offender, full of little neuroses and vanity that thinks executives to have them. You see the details of executives that match the back of events. This was one of the best responsibilities of Dreyfuss, as his character has his role to dictator who is dead! And the split area: like something from Casablanca, in fact! Raul Julia was as good as the Police Police Secretary. He finds true lines of delight, some of which are rituals for other films, like "Circles on common defenders!" Sonia Braga was better as a girl friend - with a real fire number: "You should get Oscar for tonight!" We should not forget Johnny Winters as a CIA agent and a number of visitors are playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all have done perfectly. <br /> <br /> All in all, memorable memorable under the month of Paradori. <br /> <br /> -R.
