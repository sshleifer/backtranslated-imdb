This is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that with today's political standards, the treatment of Indians is unacceptable. But moving this is not about politics. It's on stage, chat, comradery, acting, manual, music, and photography, and it's amazing about all these things. Grant, Fairbanks, and McLaglen are electricity together, and Jaffe is good. This is the last movie of buddy.
