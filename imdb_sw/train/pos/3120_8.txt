Paul Greengrass definitely saved Bourne best for the end! I have heard many people complain about how they published this film, and others even compared the camera style to the Blair Wizard project. All I can say is so ... is it? Do you love me? Coming was not so bad. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would like to stylized stre choreography. For the remaining film I have not seen yet. You can tell him that Damon has got well with Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it may be a bad thing, but in this case it is a very real thing. In fact he becomes Jason Bourne in this phase. Damon also has great support sent to Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was adding good to the cast, for he added more detail to the CIA secret organization. Though the movie is full of a big car and unusual action, they were able to keep the right amount of development in them and all that happens. This film stands more than two other Bourne movies, and it is definitely one of the best seasonal season of the 2007 season!
