This movie is one exception of the rule that good is worse than the original. It's interesting for the best. This movie is a comedy slapstick action comedy where something appears happened every second. For more than one event all the audience laughed loudly with jokes. It is a great advantage to see the first film but not the demand. GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also have the advantage of being a parody in recent decades production TV series such as survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is Swedish movie for Swedish listeners. So don't see if you don't know with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
