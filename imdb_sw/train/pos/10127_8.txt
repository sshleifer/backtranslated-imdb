This was the beginning of all! In fact, this is not the best for friends, but this was an attempt to show, let's not forget and not bad for it. We were sent by a group with Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first section we get a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will come in the next decade, when Ross says: 'I just want to be married again' and Rachel is stabbed by the wedding dress ... probably not as deliberately as when the writers when they were going to Monica-Joey's relationship but it was appropriate now to look back. Something else in this period Rachel is brought to Chandler as if they have never met before but in later periods, so-called 'flashbacks' is facing two encounters in the last three events. However, this step is a good start for a great show. This session may not be normal friends as we are used to, and it is still a little less experienced but on the next few events we see why the show was found to be! Keep watching, the first season is an explosion!
