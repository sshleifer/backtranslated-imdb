I liked it! The plan was wonderful, Drew Barrymore and DC who did out there were few for both. Drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be less than his life at the time. Dennis Christopher as fearful was very good, and as he does his best work - I am a big fan of Dennis however, that's why I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I didn't get the end! that weird animatronic red skeleton looks just like it was out of filmschool, which is exactly I think but could be more. and anything with a knife - if it was a concern why did not just remove it? It was a very mixed mix when it was a strange thing of Doppelganger or was a DC-or was Dennis at all? Because Doppelganger made by Dennis and Patrick. In events with Patrick as Dennis as Doppelganger then I think Patrick would see. It was just the same but it was a place, all orchestral marks were seen around the theme but this theme was standing. A lot of bleeding and freeus shots of Drew nude. <br /> <br /> All in a bit of the Modern GPM-Right Pleasure. Do not read too much, do not wait for a secret message and an amazing script because you won't get it. There are some moments of diamonds and sand-bound buttons.
