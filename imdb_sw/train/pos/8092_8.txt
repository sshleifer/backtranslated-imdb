I appeared in this film at the age of 8-10 in the winter, November evening. I was outdoors playing all day, freezing, and when I got around 4pm, I had a hot cup of coffee and sat in front of a TV and blanket. I was surprised that I was looking at a cartoon that was not all fun and ignorant - and in fact it was dark, and in morality. It took my mind. I am sure it disappears the text, and is shortened in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still takes the spirit of the story, the choice of carrying the burden for the good of others, the result of selfishness, a desperate decision, etc.. The quality of the animation leaves the complaint space. But one part of this film is increasingly clear on the new film is the sound features. John Hurt is good in this. If you like how the behavior is attractive, look away, and just listen. His voice is wonderful. I have seen it again and again, and often bring me back at that time, as a child, I am thirsty for some magical adventure. It is for this reason I say 'luck', the film is nostalgic to me and so I forgot its deficiency. But between John Hurt, and the fantasy of Tolkien, it still reached me, and still makes it.
