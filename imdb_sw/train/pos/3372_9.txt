At the time of the tax for Charton Heston the greatest after his recent passing but this film is not one. His other former generation films were HH, THE HUMAN RIGHTS, MANE OMEGA and PLANET OF APES were his best works. The 1973 film which is trying to predict the future of the world, in 2022, which is so prevalent that the human race has been caused by the authorities to eat food produced in the world called "Soylent Green" which is manufactured by the human body . This incredible and non-implausible film was as ridiculous during its release as it is now and taking the Indian population that will be about 2 billion for that point will then let the meat of animals not know. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character supports this global secret that the world authorities have emerged to meet the nutritional needs of overpopulation by using cannibalism. Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message they present is not the Greens Party of today Thank God. Blood mining was done by natural people in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until only 40 years before this film was made but it has long been abandoned by human civilization. It will be a slave of close sex and return to a female feminine wave that increased in 1972 when this film was made. The movie was stupid and it seems to be alive now but it has a very low-minded film and late film with Edward G. Robinson, but there is still no legitimate reason for restoring the film except academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a dud of the film and I can't even recommend to the boomers of the child or fans of Charlton Heston. All other reviews of this film I have read are all similar to the dystopia community in the future which the central theme seems to involve USA that ecological disaster has been done. <br /> <br /> The only features in the film are that the world has surface overpopulation.
