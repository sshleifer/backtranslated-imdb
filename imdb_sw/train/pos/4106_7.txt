Certainly this is not an intelligent video and a great message, so we do not think too much to understand if you are not a Czech. It is just a comedy. Humor is simple, pretty funny and sometimes, maybe, little morbid. The characters and other characters are similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý) so the authors are. But it does not matter, that type is very different from these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, will try to laugh and there will be a certain chance will succeed. It is not a bad film, not a skill, but I loved it. Other events should see.
