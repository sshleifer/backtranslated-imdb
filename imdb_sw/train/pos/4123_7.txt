The freedom to have your Sea Driving Power, excited to go under the adventures of the underwater, a wonderful and delightful person (and very good!) In beautiful Bikinis were all the symbols of "SEA HUNT" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> What is the only reason to produce a sea type to go to the "rental salary" * series. Let's look closely now. There must be other signs around. <br /> <br /> If we look back a bit, we see RKO Radio Photo production of UNDERWATER! (1955). It was the star Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of Scuba Diving The most interesting adventurers working in salvage in the Carribean, including the Pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was very successful and it is not remembered for its story as it appears to the heads of swimming suits. Beautiful, shapely Folk Women in some really realistic 2 suits bath suits (Woo, woo, Woo, Woo!) Always include Guys; and the presence of powerful, fighting people with their best beefcake exhibitions "possible" is the same for Gals. And there is one feature that is the true legacy of this former RKO feature. It's on Soundtrack in the middle of music queues and themes. It's Recording "It's Pink Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and His Orchestra. Anyone who hears this or Song (with Lyrics) will not forget you soon. Its Beat Carribbean is very interesting and its rich use of the Brass Section of Orchestra has Powerful and immediately provides a quick feeling and memory. The 45th RPM Memorandum of the Song made the Top 10 Top Songs of the Weeks on Saturday on the NBC TV of "YOUR PATH OF PARADE". We can't remember just how many weeks or how high. (Maybe someone can fill us in that item, please!) So, we have joined "SEA HUNT" and its odyssey in getting "Tube". Public was taken to UNDERWATER! indeed, but they would go to SÃ©rie TV. ZIV TV Production ZIV was earning a reputation for placing a variety of products which, for the most part, was not connected to Networks for multi-channel treatment. But they have been very successful with Television Syndication. ** As we mean, provide Chapter One Exhibition Center at one TV station for each Market area. (Much like to locate the publications to "sell" a comic diagram for various Papers around the Country, and the World, even.. /> <br /> So, we got 'Mike Nelson', himself, the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges was around for nearly 15 years or more and turned to the most memorable performances of the support of the Boston Blackie (with Chester Morris) for your CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943). ), HOME OF BRAVE (1949) and WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). Lloyd brought a very persuasive approach to his reputation, with a fine, impressive fine effect, with a look for a guy who makes his life with his ability to It took as good as the Diver's Diver, as it was working on board the ship, or fathoms under the Sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did take a quick role, but contrary to many unfamiliar information, he did not know with SCUBA. *** before this landing Mike Nelson gig. But Mr. Mr. Bridges appeared to be a quick student, as many of the close-down shots showed that there was no doubt about it, that it was Lloyd and mask, bubbler (air tank) and fins of flipper Stories almost always involved helping the client to pay, such as Detective self would. Why if the customer was a beautiful woman who looked good in a bathing suit, all is better. <br /> <br /> Like other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions, "SEA HUNT" has a fine, haunting Theme Opening and Closing, with some original music and original queues. At one time, I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the top SVV series, the success of the ZIV series knew before and likes the "THEATER FAMILY FAMILY" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". Apart from the exhibition hall for this underwater saga, here Chicago was shown at night (after 10:30) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (Our NBC Partnership, known as WMAQ TV). And I can only remember the original sponsor in this market was. And there was even on the ads made by Star! It is very good to remember and look at Lloyd as Mike Nelson, climbing his powerful boat. And when we were invited to return next week and we looked at ...... another adventure of "SEA HUNT", sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing's LaCrosse, Wisconsin 'creators of Old Style Lager Beer!', All while Mike was throwing , shaking Old Antique. (Shame on you, Mike! Drinking beer on your moving boat! We tell 'coastal guards!') Then, the boat would leave the compound, accompanied by a sea-hunting theme and ending Credits. / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> \ t OF THE SERIA "," POINTI OF WEST "(with his camp" PEOPLE OF ANNAPOLIS ")," SEA HUNT "and" HIGHWAY PATROL ".
