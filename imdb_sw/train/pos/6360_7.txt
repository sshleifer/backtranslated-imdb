I have been reading the leading comments for this film on the front page and the results of voting and being cured down. <br /> Why is that some people can't take a film for what should be. This film should have a strong heart, a sling in the cheek, a family comedy, things to make kids laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this film makes. <br /> <br /> I cut my nuts off this film, I thought Carey put in good performance with the whole film (if it looks at Christmas) really giving you a little fun celebration <br /> <br /> so all movie managers they stop trying to hear like film students and knock every film because it is not "Driver's Taxi" or "Godfather" and take a film for what they should be, entertainment !!
