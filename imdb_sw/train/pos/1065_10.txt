The Dark Angel is a sci-fi futuristic series, put in the post of Apocalyptic Seattle, centering on Max (Jessica Alba), a young woman enhanced, during flight from her creators. <br /> <br /> The dark angel world is absorbing, (not as much as Buffy say, but it takes it even though) to an interesting and reliable set of characters. Indeed, it is not for everyone, but those who give it will find themselves looking at one of the most enjoyable series there. The angel of darkness is ignored by crime, and under the standard, and was abolished by luck after only 2 series. Which was a great shame, since this was able to be a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 long-term BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. If it's the Angel of Darkness has not yet been made, then search, and if you want more, Fox's lobby to make another series.
