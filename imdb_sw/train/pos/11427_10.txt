I loved this film because in my mind it seemed to capture exactly what I thought life in African colonial Africa should be like 50 years ("my" generation). But I really was locked with its pacing of stability and to the end of glory. Within the last 5 minutes of this film, you must carefully consider what is happening. I've never been attracted to the "wrap-up" of the film. I remember waiting "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters slept on the bed!
