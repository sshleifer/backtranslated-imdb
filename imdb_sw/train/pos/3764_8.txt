Okay, I will accept - I am a goof ball and I always like a real comedy. When I saw more movies and Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than anyone in the world, I still have a soft spot for dopey comedy which doesn't try to be modern but it's just funny. A couple of films that once come to mind are the MONTI PYTHON AND IN KITIKA, UHF, BEGINNING THE TRAINING, THE STRANGE TRAINING AND THE BATTLE BACKS AND TED. All do not have a snob appeal but only a critic or a professional film critic can not hate them. <br /> <br /> When BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as amazing as the original Bill and Ted film, it's still great fun. Also, unlike nature, in fact it seems to improve by constant viewing. I remember I didn't like the movie the first time I saw it - maybe because another movie has set a high level of laughing. But, every time I see again, I am surprised at all the best - especially those that involve Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this reporter is about different from Bergman in SEAL NEWS if you can get it !! In addition to many laughter, this film has some better music - one way that is better than the first film. Kiss songs at the end are good but they are also complicated rock songs - if they are not formerly joining De Nomolos. Watch the children and adults alike.
