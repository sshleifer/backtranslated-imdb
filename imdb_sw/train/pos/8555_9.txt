* First, although many say it is the worst, I do not think it is true, considering this directly reflects the young 21st century thinking. . I agree with the fact that it's a young movie but comedy movies today don't have to be young? i mean ... movies are more than a chance for young people to walk; together, seeing such a film during sleepover or something like that is very good to have a good time. <br /> <br /> * More views about the amount of dirt in this film. Well! Let's get to the truth ... is it not to reflect on the youth's thoughts like those from the film? would you like to see what ... good books, romantic things? that's not all that will be in the minds of the young people ... \ t you have a young idea or often think about how to be a boy, or things like that. Thank you for reading!
