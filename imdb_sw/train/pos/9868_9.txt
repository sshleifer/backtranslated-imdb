This is open to the aim of the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different in feel under the cartoony (in spite of the deliberate character of cartoony of heading creatures). The story is not one that was great in your face values ​​at the end (as more as going on your sleeves shirt) but chooses just to tell stories about relationships between different "animals". You know the results, but you can't help interference. The characters themselves are more than their voices (the best known actors are making a voice), unlike many Disney movies. They are good and are completely trusted, to wonder. The behavior of the group is shown by the beauty and revelations and behavioral styles are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself rooted more quickly than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> Animation is a brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be asking for an opportunity to go on a slide of ice in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic aid of the prehistoric squirrel and his attempts to forbid burying his nuts. I came to want the products required, especially the sloth toy, just despair the next day when I couldn't find anything without a connection. Which, in wonder, makes the film more clean. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
