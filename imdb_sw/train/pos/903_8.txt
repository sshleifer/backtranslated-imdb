I can honestly say I never expected that this film would be good. I don't like family films. I am away with a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The last music director (MPKDH was full of evil) And music was very humble and had a bland. So several points and more. Finally I saw the movie and I was so impressed with him that he brings us to the youth of the MPK and the HAHK wedding problem, and we have the winner. The story of the story is similar to HAHK, the heart-shaped at the beginning of the worst situation at the end. Shahid Kapoor was surprised by a good performance. This is a great improvement, and most importantly she suits the best role is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, this is her best performance. Look at her screen is so exciting, you should love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are severely beaten. There is no one who feels out of place. These songs were broken but they looked good after looking at them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi is good ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also good at looking. These songs are not colored and dance, and are similar to ballads. Far is Hamari Shaadi Mein which should remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the idea in the film? The movie flows slowly, and the end is completely stretched. But the film still goes at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.
