This page. Hitokiri - led by Hideo Gosha - star Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei are (with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) on the best filming of existing films. It is a story about Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada It) to work for Nakadei, who wants to be a diameter. Okada, being "clean" for Nakadei is treated as a dog - and after quite a while he knows - what he really is for Eagle. <br /> <br /> But there is much more in this film - every fan of japan movies should see it !!!!!!! (Tenchu ​​means heavenly punishment)
