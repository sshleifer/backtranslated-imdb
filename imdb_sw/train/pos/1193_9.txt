The "Last End" keeper has been in touch with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13 years old. It was a movie that was in front of others at the time of dealing with local, environmental, and intermediate variations between short-term effects and long-term desire. It is as important today as in 1956, a comprehensive film discussion and importance. Then on the settings are good and the movie is very good. Memory of this movie will have me until the end of my days.
