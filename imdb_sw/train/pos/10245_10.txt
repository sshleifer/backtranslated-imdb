this was my own favorite when I was younger, it had everything big with 90 children's movies ... favorite dinosaurs, good children, gold, and small songs (and not typical of beauty / beauty and animal species songs, but those who enjoy it! I ran again on this film and I still love it as much as it was! I recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie, and I certainly think that it should be brought to the young generation! sorry not more information, I have kinda rush ... just please, believe me. all who oppose this film kill their inner child!
