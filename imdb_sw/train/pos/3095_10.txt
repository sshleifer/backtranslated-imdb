So, what is the reason? Is there a kind of vendetta against this show of AWESOME or someone involved? Why the best show that I found in the canceled years? I've got. I saw this show for the last fall, and immediately love it, and watch it every week. Then it went, and I tested Tivo, but it didn't look. So I forgot about it for a moment, until I found the events on the ABC website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else - with all the junk on TV today, it was comforting to see something that was closed and developed like this. I am looking for Boston's Legal for my revision of the agreement, and the House for fixing a brilliant-secret jackass. My wife loves the Anatomy of Gray for her "originality", and I love / dislike show, but it can not be far from the truth for me. It is a very good game. Everything that can go wrong, it does. But at once, there is a ceremony that is really true. Real people, real problems. In fact, there are many things like the old gangster turned out well, the girl running from the group, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are out there out, and I relate to each of them. I can't seem to get enough. I hope that ABC will appear their heads out of the toes of the beans and continue to show this. Get respect for having a QUALITY festival out there. This can be one of the best displays of all time. If someone only allows.
