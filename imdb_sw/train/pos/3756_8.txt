It took place only ten years after real events, and put in the bunker under Reichstag, the Pabst film catches. It reeks death of sulfur pending criminals of the world war. It has not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to wait to get into their cave. A little bit of the dialogue between the two Members: "Is there a God?" "If He did, we would not like." This is not easily available for exhibitions or shopping because it will be interesting to watch and compare this film with a document about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" {aka "Spot Spot: Hitler Secretary") and "Fall" with Bruno Ganz.
