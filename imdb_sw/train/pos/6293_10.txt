Buster shines in this section, which is the only car I saw at the end of the work that allowed him to make a comedy (silent!) Which made him famous. It is still shocking to hear his gray voice in the talkie talk - his voice is about the only thing I don't care about, such as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take pratfall is still not the same. Even repeating some of the magags used in his early two reelers and Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deep thanks to Rod Serling for submitting us to this section, and by providing maximum of the full Buster. He did not have much time (one part) to do this, but this is a touch-touch tax for the great Hollywood.
