This movie contradicts the first to the beginning of Bears Care and Care Care Cousins ​​goes. I don't want to refuse it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate film, then it's a very good movie. I remember this early 80th anniversary (and getting into its audience of the population then), and loved it more than the first movie (not that I did not also enjoy it, is that this just seems to have a little extra thing for it) . Certainly it's blacker than the first, but maybe maybe that's why it's so beautiful. And it's dark in a kind of subtle way too (that children can't fully understand, but they can still be a little afraid because the atmosphere provides away, and adults look certainly getting as fast as I now watch this film again now in twenty years and five) where basically you have a little girl who works with evil spirits / demons by sharing something else. Find images? But just look at that as a child, sure if I said it could be a bit scary, but no trouble. In fact if anything gave me another game of fantasy I could play when I was that age. I can't tell you how often I was pretending to have the Heart of Light wanting to close me, give me help to take Bears Care, tried to bring me to its dark side, and things like that. The movie was also good for my thoughts. And it also has deep emotional depth too. I was looking at at least once a week. Hadley Kay was also a perfect choice for the Heart of Darkness (always I thought so and I would always like it). Now it's so bad that they didn't make the sound of the sound available. Sometimes I just want to hear Grow Up without watching the film, just like it is. <br /> "What love and care if he can't save him?"
