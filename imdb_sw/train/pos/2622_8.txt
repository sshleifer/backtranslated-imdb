Everyone, my name can be wonderful, but nothing else! Anyway, I haven't seen anything like this before it's mad! Of course that is a good thing. It's a very interesting movie and my whole thing is always how they intervene in other things! As a little chicken, fish pretending to be King Kong and the Runt pig say, "Twas beauty who killed the animal", World War of the area and more. Walt Disney Company has never touched her touch perhaps not for this. Also, how they did as they watched the film and it was like a movie of the house. Some of the parts do not match. Like the first king of the lion, they were not Timon and Pumbaa and Lion when he beat Scar? In this film, they do not! fought with backstage hyenas. Ther more, the reason why Pumbaa is not sure because he was influenced away from other animals and also, it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anyone knows that Timonn's story was just told, where only the pastime had publications? <br /> <br /> But far from it, IT "S GREAT!
