In a small town in Montana two brothers grow. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), another is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Pastor Maclean and they grow up with his studies related to religion, and fishing fishing. In this fishing fishery it represents life, little. It is good and keeps your mind even though there is some time you need a little step. Perhaps the movie has this time because it is not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Other things happen even though. Norman is going to Dartmouth to learn. After six years he returns and is involved with a beautiful girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has been a journalist and known as "fisher writer". He is popular and seems to have a good life, but he drinks very little and very gambling. <br /> <br /> The movie is directed well, has a good score and all actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this film is the movie. Mountains, forests and rivers all look very beautiful. If the movie was made only for these things it was good enough to look. Fortunately there is more.
