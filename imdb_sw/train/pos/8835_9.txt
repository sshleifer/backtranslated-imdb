A strong political view that presents it as an old age story is what this movie is. What is offensive is that it works effectively on both levels. It should not but save. This story of four boys and a girl growing in 1953 The Communist Belgrade is a strong heat. That's what the seniors call the classic movies. Obviously, in 1953 Belgrade is not as complicated as a dictatorship and fascist as the Communist community is often displayed. One can listen to rock and rock music, one of the songs played is a song "Hey Babu Riba" the title of the film. But the jeans can not be bought or certain drugs that are legitimate legitimate. Unlike the heavy opposition of the Communist community this movie is to show how it affects the lives of five characters who call themselves as four. A girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and she travels to join her, a piano that has been taken from corporate use from one of the boys, giving you suddenly your home and a quarter to your new friends because they need. Boys spend a lot of time listening to music and are described as despising the fascism that communism has created when dealing with tiffs and the charlatan of the fascist who Stalin has put on a tattoo on his hands. These all lead to actions that take later and remember when it grows away, as this film was released in 1986 in the Soviet Market evening. A great contemporary value of regular watches. "Rebellion is not your enemy but it is still a friend of anyone."
