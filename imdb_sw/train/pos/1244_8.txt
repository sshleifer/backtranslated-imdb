I saw this film first on television several years ago and I really loved him. Charles Dance makes one of the most scary criminals anyone can think of. Its sophistication is quite different from a very good hero. I've never been a lot of fan of Eddie Murphy but to get his offensive image here a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Glass Check". Charlotte Lewis is, using hackneyed words but only one that is used, for very good. Other events have been created with amazing surprises: a series of dreams, birds, anti-fighting scenes, and fierce fighting. Through all Murphy is a modern man suddenly dropped in the eastern story, an amazing and exciting version of Kurt Russell in his fantasy fantasy fantasy. Like the movies we have James Hong, an unlikely actor whose events, however short, are uplifting even the Derek. Since 1955 Hong defines a good actor, "class action" of his profession. "Gold Child" is stupid; not perfect; but it has many features of liberation which are fantastic and exciting fantasy, worth viewing. After four years I have seen the "Child of Gold" again; I enjoyed it even more! True is a great joy.
