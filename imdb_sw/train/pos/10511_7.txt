"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with himself but painting, going with his friends on his car up and down, saying hello to the people of the city, and trying to make the match make everyone know . I think there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do but rumors. I wish she read a little more. I love Gwyneth, and I think she is a beautiful woman. He is talented, and in "Emma" someone has the privilege of hearing Gwyneth singing. I hope to see "Duets", where he thinks singing. He is a brave English-speaking English and all the Bretagne of nature, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Wedding and Funeral, playing in Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (True, Madly Deeply) appeared to be one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is a royal part of the American film, that no one except Bruce Paltrow's daughter (St Elsewhere) and Tony Winner Blythe Danner Award (Finger Fingers). He will surely be around for a long time. Lucky us! I loved Emma and I also suggested. It is one of those ancient stories that are accurate in those days. Scenes favorite: Emma singing and playing piano. I especially like it when you sing duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​did not ask me to contribute a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a paradox, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were more successful." Miss Bates: "It left us without a speech, I tell you completely, and we never stopped talking about it since."
