I saw this during the Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I didn't remember a lot of that. As I was looking soon, I sat there thinking, "This is the most wonderful thing I have seen". <br /> <br /> 'Travel' events seem to be caused by an overdose of LSD. Animated characters are more of an unusual color / versions made of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Other non-Disney things I noticed: children are threatened with knife action and prostitutes (during the Road Portobello song) . Also, the subject of the subject was a little dark, and saw as it was set at WW2.
