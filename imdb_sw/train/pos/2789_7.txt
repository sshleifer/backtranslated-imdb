Dial as Beckham is full of scenes but still has a possible total line. It is about a girl named Jess who tries to achieve her long life dream of becoming a famous soccer player and eventually gets a chance offered in the local team. there are many boundaries and boundaries that are facing back but still have refused and are struggling. I would like to recommend to anyone who likes a good film of light and wants to get leadership and what people can achieve. The choice of the song is very good, 'to convince my child, just go on ... go to you and you can make limits and problems.' Any hope that had helped your needs in the audit. Dial as Beckham a big flick
