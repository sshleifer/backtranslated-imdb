This is a great short. I think every sound has been made by a jelly jason. (you can only say clearly if you have heard his usual voice though, don't worry about them sound the same. edward spatula fights a fight against teas and he meets strange people. in fact, everyone who knows he seems to be very mad. <br /> <br /> "editor!" "peterson head, we should take you to the medical unit!" "No, I can't destroy it." "not such a discussion, I'm sure you will be good." "im goner edward, and you know before you go -" "yes?" "Can I just ... kiss one?" "um, no." "come, just one, small, peck on the lips?" "im walking away now master." <br /> <br /> there will be a very early film. The date that is September, but probably looking again.
