This is the movie of Arnold. Now that you know it, I've saved a lot of your time when you would take it to read this review. If you don't like Arnold, then you like this film. If the case is another, then you will probably like that. It's as simple as that. Now, if you are still reading this I hope you love Arnold. Good for you! He is quite good not he. Man Running is a common feature of Arnold. It has been a retro-future of what we know well from the B-Sci Fi of 80, has a group of strict linner, lots of violence and explosion, and a beautiful heroine with the end of fun. <br /> <br>> In this case, a rough opponent is the 1984 regime control, which uses television as the best control of the crowd and the game's gladiator performances. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these exhibitions and turns it all to the bottom, with little help from his two ambassadors and beautiful Amber. <br /> <br /> Not a great movie budget, but still managed to create a beautiful atmosphere of the future, with beautiful matte painting and sets to help. It has no 80 hopes, but I find it charming. Working is different, Arnold doing his regular work and shouting, with the help of stone that is facing stones. Heroine Amber is, making it gently, very little, and a little named Damen Killian is a good man of television. <br /> <br /> Despite all wrongs, the movie shows its message very clear; The television is an opiate of citizens, a good way to control people. It also includes some of the future video editing videos, allowing bad people to change faces on the video to disturb their audience. This does not seem to be strong at all today, which is a little terrible. If you have seen Arnold movies before you know this look. Enjoy.
