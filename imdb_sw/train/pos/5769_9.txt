Will all of you have to do the problems of Todd's hell! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a film and see what you're coming to! Boy gets 735 zombies and regularly cast to work for FREE! Of course the acting is being destroyed sometimes. That is not the big deal that you will see. But it's not so bad, if you want to see it, see the National Zombie and the Raccoon zombies. <br /> <br /> This is a clean, beautiful old to create a video of Guerilla! Todd is a weather specialist, and close to a good boy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The order is not visible. But what is hell, I still love this movie. I would like Todd Paper will happen and hide and make a remake of this which was going. If anyone has ever tried to make a film, they know that just finished, it's successful and itself.
