An enjoyable game, which provides a fun and easy game with the ability to write replay. Reliable for comic and providing low-quality learning provides this game something that does not appear in a lot of work today. Also, animations and animation images used (although long-term animations are taken and slide intervals in the Nintendo 64 version) use full advantage of platform platforms.
