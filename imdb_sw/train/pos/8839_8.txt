Thank God this is not based on true stories, because it is a story. It is planned by the characters who are not recognized who the destruction does not know the limits, before the devil is a dirty surgeon, to throw a jaw into the perversion that you could overthrow (and sometimes it is, even for - or maybe because of - the pain of contempt of human dysfunction around) if it was not done with the greatest victory, the greatest of his stars. The best script with Kelly Masterson and good direction and no other except Sidney Lumet does not provide either. The main damage here is the family origin, with the two brothers who had declined (brilliant exhibitions from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) who decided to steal their own parents' shop, the fastest-growing attempt. <br /> <br /> The story is told at a time of change (which is known on the screen, such as: "Charlie: two days before theft", so no one should be confused); Some people said they did not like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding the skeweredness of the whole thing, considering that two brothers in question do not play for full control - among them you can't make a handful of poker save your life. Throw in these additional terms: one of the brothers is addicted to drugs, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also better), who has a relationship with another brother, has hit a great brother's competition, with the truth of a sister's drug abuse The brother hates his father (good performance of Albert Finney), who seems to cause great pain in the past, and you have Shakespearean / Greek trouble in your hands. Continue carefully.
