When I was young, my parents found this film so I could look at it. I liked it very much, and I watched it frequently. Even when I was in Grade 3 I was still looking at it regularly. Recently, I looked again, for frustration, and though the show was not aimed at my age group (I am in my last youth), I still got entertainment and education. This view teaches good lessons about thought and getting along with others. Other places I found quite entertaining. Also, this show does not contain any bad content, so you can leave the kids alone with this show and do not worry about them grab any bad language or whatnot. I would recommend this.
