I was delighted with the best players. The story is one to stand because, even if you are in danger of doing it. While abuse and pain are often in front of the film, this film focuses on a good old squad. Although some squares have been done on a regular basis, these boys take it off. Go back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master to take a movie.
