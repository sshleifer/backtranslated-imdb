The program does not begin to describe the film: someone writes a film, or rather, * this film. It is a very reflective reflection you think you will go into it as a black hole. The author writes something and happens, or something happens and writes about it. <br /> <br /> It is a very philosophical, like "Waking Life" but beyond Zen oriented and for that matter, better, in my opinion. Once there is a man-on-road interview and then you see the shots of these people are photographed, and then you see that their responses are written when someone continues to refresh his lines. There are good conditions and insults of the eyes. I hope it comes from the DVD so I can watch it more carefully. You have seen Cinequest (San Jose film, CA) on 2/25/2002.
