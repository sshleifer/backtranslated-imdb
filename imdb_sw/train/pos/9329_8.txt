I have seen the Holy Son over three times. I fail to see how this film is a gay film, I am not even gay, but I don't see it as a gay film. It is a homosexual film, I can't see why each gay film should be a strict film about being gay. I see a film to be sympathetic to learning death, the death of someone who is your brother. I think Theo returns his life almost immediately after rehab because he wants to look at his brother dying before him renews his life. I got a conversation in the area when Theo told Ryan he would be a father to be very moving, Ryan says that they don't want to know about things that he can't see or share with anyone. Isn't it frightened and sad? I strongly recommend the film.
