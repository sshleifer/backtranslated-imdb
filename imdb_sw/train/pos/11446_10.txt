Right now I look at this film for a second time (on TV) and for the second time I have fallen into it while you were running an hour already (I think I saw 2 minutes more this time) this movie is very interesting, Goldsworthy way looks at nature, change nature in a way that you yourself will not think, is really wonderful. This whole movie gives you a feeling of warmth, seeing him dancing with the world around it and that love. Or just seeing his hands, covered with dirt and broken fingers, just touch you.
