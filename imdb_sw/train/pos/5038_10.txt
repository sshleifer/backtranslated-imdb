It's a real treat and unexpectedly. This is the real exciting movie all about. I ran to the video store, caught the movies without reading the limit around the back and I expected the best. I was completely surprised and interested. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all gave good performance and made their characters true. The plan was well thought out, well written and guided. It enabled you from the beginning to finish and never did get boring for one minute. I highly recommend this film for those who are attracted to, especially the best and those who keep your attention. Certainly 10 out of 10 from me.
