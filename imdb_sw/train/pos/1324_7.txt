You stay there for half an hour and watch the story, you believe it all, then look at one half hour of the same story without opening ... and then go back again. Brilliant. One of the most exciting films in the San Francisco International Film Festival is a document. I don't know if - except Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing Friedmans" - there is always something like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden False $." It shows, it describes, protects, shows, and asks everything about Norma Khouri, the author of "Disappearance of Honor," which is well known and the best of the best sheep of 2001 in respect of honorable death in Jordan. What is so amazing and what makes the film unique is that this "exposure" of Khouri is done with full participation of Khouri. <br /> <br /> For the first part of the film, Khouri offers her story about the murder of her friend in Amman, a book story. He seems completely reliable, convincing. Then his story is taken away, revealed, for honest and influential people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigators in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while. Khouri returns and refuses to prosecute, taking a false test of lies in success. Here comes another part of the worst damage - not explained here because it will reduce the value of shockâ€¦ and then Khouri returns and is facing charges (not all, but important in terms of the book) <br /> <br /> Houdini's move , to round after this round of weight weight, surprise after surprising - with no "end of happiness" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant.
