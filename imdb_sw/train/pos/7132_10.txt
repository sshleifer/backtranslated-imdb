A heartwarming film. The usual work done by John Thaw, who recently passed. Someone who was always very. He was one of 10 British actors of my time. He can be remembered for his famous Morse Auditor. As Jack Regan in the TV series 1970 'Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. You must see for all the family with a beautiful DVD of my collection. The file will return to several references to people who remember the British war and indeed those who were exiled to London to avoid German bombs. The relationship between the two main characters.Tom and William the boy was doing well with the book with Michelle Magorian.
