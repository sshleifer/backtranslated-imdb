I have seen Blob several times and is one of the low budget budget videos from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Jelly amazing as substances then gets involved of his hands and a young couple who saw the land of the meteor come when they took him to the local doctor, where the old man then gets quite a crowd. The doctor and his nurse are the second victims and the bulk gets greater. While these events have been reported to the police, they do not trust the husband and the youth and accuse them of doing all this. They finally trust them during the masses, now they are so big that they turn to the city cinema and everyone runs on the street crying. Then he is involved with dinner with young couples and others inside. Blob has stood by spraying the fire of the fire in it and it locks, which is its weakness. They are then sent by airplane to the Arctic reserves and are kept there. But it's just frozen, they don't die ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a natural environment for its time: young and small town. Blob has a beautiful rock rock and the original theme and the movie is the world's atmosphere. Blob was followed in 1972 and the revision came in 1988 but this is the best of Blob films. The release is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is a movie that made the star and Corsaut Aneta has her partner. I don't know any other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob must see for all sci-fi fans. Good. <br /> <br /> Testing: 4 out of 5 stars.
