One of the most important aspects of many Chinese movies that you can find, if you are lucky, in video stores, is the most accurate versions of real, realistic stories. Furawell, My Concubine, King and Assassin with this movie are perfect models. The film makers take a true story and work hard to create movies without compromising the fact easily or commercial - the most popular Hollywood hall, and especially the Disney films. In this story we follow the later years of the famous street actor mentioned the King of Masks for his artistic skills of Sichuan. Although he has lost his son alone many years ago, he seeks to get a male successor to continue his traditional and deadly art in a society that prevents women from having the job. Master Wang is sold to a child by a slave trader. All is well as he prepares to adopt his art. But the child eventually appears to be a girl. From there, the story is very interesting, with good performance with the Liang of Opera's Sichuan teacher - a geographical style associated with the Peking Opera. Farewell Concubine's fans should take a look at the artist's Liang's performances in the role of women in the Chinese Opera. It can help them understand that the players of these female roles should not be gay or famous, but people who have had a psychological condition as they do not fully know their own gender.
