I don't know what I get so much about this film, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it was over. I am not a big fan of Paul Winfield nor of the war drama, but I was really questioning and when Winfield got his son. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. The truth is told, I have not seen this film for years or has not been shown on TV for a while, but this movie is the amount of odyssey of one person after the war. Winfield shows a deep understanding of the heart and the heart of the lost person and his memory. There is a basic message in this film that wants to stop the end of human values ​​after this war and the fact that he can deal with them. Why this film has never been on DVD or video is confidential to me.
