"Hamlet" of Kenneth Branagh hits all the scores. Acting is very good, 70mm movies are good, Oscar clothing and appointment are wonderful, and Patrick Doyle's logo (also Oscar-nominated) are sensitive and moving. Oo - screenplay, and someone else named Will S., not too bad either. Critics of the film beat Branagh to receive a four-hour Oscar film for "changing" screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was one gutsy. I can't think of the most beautiful way of doing four hours flying. <br /> <br /> Welcome to every decision Branagh works consciously: the use of the British Palace of Blenheim for outdoors, Edwardian clothing, and staging of "Be or be" in the mirror hall, mention a few. Release of Hollywood permits like Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in small parts may be worried, but that's nitpicking. The big forest becomes more: Derek Jacobi takes on the status of Claudius; Kate Winslet clearly shows the nature of Ophelia being mad; Julie Christie brings enthusiasm for her display of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect-perfect as a dedicated Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell raises the role of the possibility of lack of appreciation for Horatio for apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is given with enthusiasm and enthusiasm; no time lost in the entire film. The last events show the size of Shakespeare's tragedy in the most impossible way to cope with the exhibition. Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, arrogant, and ultimately successful resemblance to Shakespeare's language and poetry. It is clear that Shakespearean's big changes have been implemented? A great reputation, but it deserves.
