The first film has been made. Traders come from a factory, a bike, a more walk, moving forward or left. With Melies, Lumieres is the earliest part of the move to the cinema - and Melies begins false stories, movies, fantasy, artifice, festival; and Lumieres fresh, non-decorative, inquiry. The truth. There are many scholars who undermine the termination of movies from the end to the exhausting ways of old. But consider this again. There is no 'target' about it. The film is full of action - the static, humanitarian area has increased in life, activity, and the stability of the shape of the shape burst, beaten from behind to right or left (but never, of course, forward, where the camera is). And still the camera standing stock, it has energy, the deficit possible, puts it to its will. The movie can be a revolutionary innovation, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to list the world, edit, block, minimize. The worst is the historical fact of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere workers. Older people are investigating their employees, an invisible eye about its useless minions. So the film describes two types of bonds. Behind the gates, workers are locked in their workplace. The opening of the door appears to be a picture of freedom, escape, but faced with another wall, the fourth wall, more than binding. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, the image of the invisible, the power to see all to convince its servants. Fear, all the prophetic film.
