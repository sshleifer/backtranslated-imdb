The film shows his relationship with his beloved partner, who often has a strong hatred, and his cooperation with other accident victims, especially black down and out with white-supremacist biker. Films often humorous, often depressed, and always reliable. Get out of the kleenex box and watch this on a good Sunday afternoon with your partner.
