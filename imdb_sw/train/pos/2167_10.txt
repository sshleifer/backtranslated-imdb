I saw this movie back in 1984, we first started looking "This is a Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we've been ready to sleep. So we went instead of seeing this film. If you have any conspiracy theory around your head, you will need to look at this. The question asks you when you watch this film: Do you think the government will be able to do that? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I don't want to give as much information as that will be a spoiler and I think you should see the movie yourself. But, in order to let you know, we continue to talk about this film 20 years later and try to try to explain it to people it's not the easiest thing in the world.
