As with almost every time, when the UK comes with a set of entertainment and / or a successful display or attempt, Yanks will come along with the moving structure and produce their own, completely down, version. Someone About The House is, of course, no exception to the law. The Yanks' version (Third Company) was not known, pap of the brain that appears to run forever. High quality of high quality (non-existent) quality. The original, on the other hand, is a memorable gem of love that had savvy (like Fawlty Towers) to pull the sealing at the right time (unlike 637 cases of 'hilarity' which the Third Company came with). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry between Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made all a very simple look, scripts, while not exactly Oscar Wilde-standard, were constantly funny and Chrissy was a tone tone tone who has walked the face of this planet since the Dead Sea was just hearing well. 'Nuff said.
