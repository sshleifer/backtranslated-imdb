It can be a remake of the 1987 tale of Autumn after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel employs rock music as the center of this film describing his self-centered view of life, where love, ambition and frustration results have very important roles. Rock music may not be a good car to show a great feeling, and it is still not very accurate to use it as the rock-ground musicians are more powerful than normal. The director considers the love of the subtle love and the futility of the end of life rather than rock music. Love between father and child, lovers, and friends is pleasant and provided through good performance. Mabel does not try to attract rock musicians all the time, instead, he tries to bear real life on the screens, making great efforts to work on this project and collect information in Beijing's lower pub. Daniel has probably given the best performance in all his movies now. Its normal brutality and reticence fit fit the mood of the film perfectly.
