He should kill him and if he doesn't, Jack will kill his father. Lisa is in a big mess, because whatever she chooses, she will kill. Acting was not true. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy did well. Feelings were well chosen. The way with the script of this film is also great ... And I can say what - this is the best movie of death in the 21st century yet ...
