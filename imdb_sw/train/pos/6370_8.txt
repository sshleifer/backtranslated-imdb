To my surprise, I was very pleased with the Disney animation unit recently. The film had its scope, but in general I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to understand. It was also interesting to see the Disney Animation film that was not music. I was close to pushing up the borders with Tarzan. With joy they gave something to music to relax. Another positive feature of the film is that the comedy was not quite low (la Hercules), instead of a trick still has made the kids laugh when not making adults feel giddy or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One desire was animation. With all the animation films that occur outside the Disney studio, you will think they would go along and get a little. There's nothing to say about traditions, but think of the possibilities and stories of Atlantis! In general the film was entertaining, and certainly has a value of a multiplex journey. <br /> <br />
