I saw it at the Legacy Theater in Joseph Smith Memorial Memorial at Salt Lake City this morning. I will think that the level of happiness of the person during this film will be based on the person's level of acceptance of Joseph's story. However, that aside was made well, it did well, and it was a good score. If you get Salt Lake City, you must see it in the Heritage Store. I have never been in an exhibition hall apart from the quality of photography, sound quality and beauty throughout my life ... I wonder if the Church will stop watching me when Batman starts there! Being that I am LDS and seeing Joseph being a prophet, I was touched in several places and I brought tears very little ... which I think is expected since they took the tissue before the movie started! However, I am told that this film is available at several LDS Visitors around the world, if you have 70 minutes to watch because you believe Joseph Smith or not, says an interesting story.
