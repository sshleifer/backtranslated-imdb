I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and never seen it again. For my life, I couldn't remember the head and I just fell when I examined the features of Roy Thinne's movie. The best modern, dark, and spooky TV of fear movie in the same class as "Farm Crowhaven"; "Do not be afraid of Giza"; and "Satan's School for Girls", both lost the classics of Satan. Also I think it has many parallels to the classic Clint Eastwood, "High Plains Drifter". Why don't they leave these small movies, especially when you explore all the latest garbage filling discount DVDs on Wal-Mart? Many of these flicks follow the ritual, so sales should not be a problem.
