I know, I know: they are babies. But I just like this kind of film. A plane that has suffered "plenty" and has not lost his belief in humanity and his sense of humor. What is especially about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - parrot- and he is not used as a force for some hotshot human actor. Additionally I would like the story: Paulie describes her life for the clean when she hit the rock. (By the way: The voice of Jay Mohr almost looks like Joe Pesci's!). With Cheech Marin in fact, someone is humorous to me. Since I saw "On Smoke" I have considered his way of ignorance to do, and make the situation easy to hilarious .. can not help himself.
