This film was to open eyes. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I remembered and then I was 12 years old. The whole message that the director presents is for everyone to wake up and make no mistake of leaving God out of our daily lives or just going to the extra mile to insult him. A great deal for non-believers and believers alike!
