This film seems to draw until - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who find it cannot fail. <br /> <br /> To begin with, there is a lot of comedy in this film in which many viewers don't "get". Of course Li Li's looks like Kato's Bruce Lee - thought, is a joke. A boy who has a temporary bomb tied to his heart - angry? Of course, it's joke! Some readers may be asking, if this film should be very interesting, why all the violence and gory? well, for one thing the tolerance of this level of abuse is really different, from culture to culture; and when Hong Kong viewers will realize that this violence is severe, it is certainly a little more than the average HK film. Also, Black Mask is actually a kind of film that takes kind of deals and pushes them to excess, because only the assemblies themselves have not thought too much. After decades of looking for people to be shot without any open injuries, many people were afraid to see Bonnie and Clyde and the Wild Bunch trap that bleeding everywhere. But the fact is, when you are hit by a quick metal projectile, it is almost entirely that the blood decreases, especially due to teri. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comic movie of Chinese comic. It is true that Spiderman movies are not available - but if they were honest with the truth, they will be! Well, despite its comic-book nature, this film is loyal to the truth. The only query that I have is a photo of photography and editing more stylized. If the creators of this film had hit it with an eye on the Hollywood style of the Hollywood (if, for example, The Rocketeer, or the latest sketch of the Sky), I doubt anyone would see it as hate. <br /> <br /> But if it stands, I still had so much fun to watch this film.
