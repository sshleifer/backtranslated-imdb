First I would like to say how this is great. It is surprising and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is nothing but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His realistic reality shows through this great masterpiece. It is an exciting story of a low and outward heart (VOIGHT and Hoffman) who build a close friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) artist Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich with leisure women. Recently meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor person who can pay taxes. Ratso becomes Joe 'manager' but soon all men can't get Joe work that causes stealing food. When they try to live in New York's streets we see how difficult it is. Can not find Joe girl until they meet the woman at the party. Joe makes money and soon Joe takes Ratso to Renzo, Florida. The last five minutes are breaking the heart yet a short time in the film. From the COWBOY of MIDNIGHT we get an urban outlook and sometimes confused about life.
