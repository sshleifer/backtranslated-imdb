This modern scenario has a great deal of fighting. Now it is true that acting is a little bad. But if I wanted to see a film-based film I would like to watch a cheesy film like the American beauty. But if you want to see a film with a real military art in it and with wonderful stunts without using the wire and jumping to throw the air like many close movies now that have on the stomach kill. Then look at this. Now it is really two main stars in the show where the child reflects the power rangers and another cast member of the show that has a little part in this movie. But the feeling of fighting is enough to make Jet Li p ** s his pants. And stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to stay firing and admire.
