This is one of the best movies. It's one of my favorites. Effective film. Stories are very sensitive to touch. Good work of the camera too. <br /> <br /> Names of artists and actors are not on the US Star list. However, it provides the same or better displays than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without tolerating a man with a kick-box their way to save the world. If you don't like this film then you don't have a heart or feeling. Then go to watch film games. No murder or fear here. See the movie. It should be. TH
