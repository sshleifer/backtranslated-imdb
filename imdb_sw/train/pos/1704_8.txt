"I moved out here to avoid this kind of thing!" Sheriff little town cried. <br /> <br /> "Does this happen much in Chicago?" His deputy asks. Well, no, no, not true. The initiative is that the Martians' group is hacking the Halloween Rebroadcast War of Orson Welles as an account of a real Martian invasion, and they need to get into action! The following is a group of mishaps involving the Martian experiment to conquer the "Big Bean, IL" city. Everyone concludes are children in real dress, except for the daughter of Sheriff and her friend, a child in a duck suit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> anyone but themselves very early. It's a fun movie of the family.
