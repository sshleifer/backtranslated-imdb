Among the factors that make this ideal for this point, I must say # 1 is Christine McIntire. Part of the Shemp when poisoning and its response is very strange. I think that, like a single poster suggested, Christine was trying to hold the laughter during the area, but actually made her even more serious than the bad, exciting when Shemp could die. Another person who helps this stand out is Goon. His view was a great cross between a terrible and comedic ball. It is impossible for the behavior I chose to meet in the dark area or, for that matter anywhere. I would like to have a real secret of gold in this, but hey, while this is a good, who will complain. Not me.
