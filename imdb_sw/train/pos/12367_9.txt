Well, after expecting a long time after seeing a few clips on Bravo's 100 Moments Modern Movie I was waiting to see this film for a long time. The plan was simple, a good example of Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) enters the apartment building which is the gate of hell. Sentinel is a less interesting film, even if it is a little slow. It is a combination of the Omen Child and Rosemary. Acting is good, and there are some really troublesome pieces such as an awkward situation with a dead father and a chubby woman in the middle of a cake eating orgy and laughing Last is a wonderful mix of people who have been lost and spoil. It's very odd, of the camp but last, I believe a great film! One of my favorites from 70 years, even if it is not very natural. It's wacky and very sad! Perhaps one of all my favorites. 9/10
