Ah, I loved this film. I think it was all. It made me laugh more than once. Yes, I am a girl, so I write this to a girl's perspective. I think it's just a scandal that scored 5.2 for rating. Many citizens vote? It was far beyond other romantic players. Because I am a woman enjoying all the flicks of chic, on the contrary I like another music. Romantic comedies are less familiar and not as much as they mean. But as I said, this film had it all, almost, in my opinion. A great script, a good linner, good acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's behavior reminded Gabrielle from the Masters' Workers, but why? It was amazing. I will put this film on rainy days, days I feel down and I need a few laughs.
