There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that.Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team to write the detective news. He murders his girlfriend Jim Ferris who had plans to go solo. Columbo enters the picture and asks all questions from Mr. Franklin. And it returns to one more question. Columbo is a wonderful character and look for him for shabby. It is difficult to believe this person can solve any crime. For him he could. For each of them! Peter Falk is one and alone in the world that can show this character. So no remakes, please. Jack Cassidy murders with Martin Milner who is being affected. Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife Joanna Ferris. There is something interesting about the events between Columbo and her. How she does omelet and everything.Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. In fact he met a fatal fate when he died after suicide as he does here. I have been a Columbo fan since childhood and I still enjoy watching them.
