This is the first movie I saw Ashley Judd and the first film Victor Nunez 'which I ever say, and I am a happy boy I did. Its stability, its speed, 'its realistic direction of the young woman begins only in life,' her beautiful adversity through her make her a mark in life, the decisions she makes in real terms, people she meets - nothing wrong with the film this. It is close to the magic of the film as I have seen outside the "Star Wars" movies, and, from what the film is, it means that this film deserves the highest quality. Acting of Ashley Judds, Mr. Nunez'writing, and 'her simple story of good quality makes this beautiful story of coming to the age of the film.
