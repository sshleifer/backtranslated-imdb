I was able to write enough comments on any of the characters in Gundam Wing, each one can lead a series with their internal conflicts. Instead we get 8 titles that take us through 49 gold events of the grace of the Anime. It has a debate that you can move around your head for months ... years, then come back and find a new meaning from, a masterpiece in writing script (though it has a typical character of the characters that there are differences between heads and English). It has many concepts and philosophy that make you think about your own opinion. <br /> <br /> The relationship between unloved men and female characters is the only shape of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are happy to enjoy. Refusal of a male refusal is inserted by the internal problem that makes love (the word never mentioned in the series) of the most important women in their harsh environment of the soldiers. Women expel men 's issues that we rarely, as they all see, which makes men more leading enigmatic. It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, his great reward. <br /> <br /> And then there is a great robot battle. Enjoy watching the amazing order as beautiful as any place to fight the image of Hollywood. Any young person who struggles to see a lot of robot fighting as a work of children's cartoons, as it is clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but it's okay. Many of the big robot robots in Gundam Mrengo have a huge pathos of pathos, usually with the rebels of youth fighting with what they believe against the oppressive community makes their faith heavy. Regular change in tone and emphasis through each section makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, it's fun, to consider stimulating research on the possibility of the mind and the human body.
