The enjoyable movie though I think was able to be better if it was more detailed. It's half the secret through the film as you know why Elly is running like that. Then, when we get an explanation of the return to his childhood there are still many details. Perhaps they had shown some obstacles or something. <br /> <br /> However, it's still a good movie that I would like to watch again. 7/10 <br />
