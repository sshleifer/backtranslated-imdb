Manhattan, the middle class of America Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two young girls in the four bedroom with only one bathroom rented an apartment. Jim works in an advertising agency to raise $ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his home due to lack of space. When he sees a large house advertisement sold in Connecticut at an affordable price, he runs with his wife and a real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends the engineer of friends to explore the house, and the man says that he should put down the house and build another. Jim is investigating the news with other engineers and they all judge him there and soon find that he bought a "money hole" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Builds His House" is a very funny comedy, and magic lines and top-notch screenplay. Cary Grant deals with the role of man led by the inspiration to complete the American dream of owning a big house that finds that he made a bad choice, when he lost his touch in his work and the feeling of his friend's jealousy. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very interesting movie that seems to have led to this beautiful, "The Money Pit" classic. My vote is eight. Headline (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Pain")
