I should say that Higher Education is one of the top 3 movies I watched. It has a brilliant brilliant, and a good brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in the University can be. There are 3 main stories, leather skins, Africans-Americans, and gay. I was surprised by all the stories, but what was given to me was the story of kristen, fighting his feelings towards another girl. The end was good. After seeing the movie 25 times together, I still cry. I would like to give this film 11, but I must get 10/10.
