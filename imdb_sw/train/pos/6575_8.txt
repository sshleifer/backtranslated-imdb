'Armor and Man' is one of the funniest of Shaw as it is run correctly, and this production has a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, a filmmaker, before the film, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a boyfriend (Patrick Ryecart), and who builds troops from the enemy (Pip Torrens) during the flight. .................................................. ... land. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are happy, and the whole play is all fun. It is highly recommended.
