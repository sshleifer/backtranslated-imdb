Like many people on this site, I saw this film only once, when it was the first television in 1971. Some of the long-term events in my memory and the general feeling of trouble is how I remember being affected by it. I would like to see it again, if it was possible to find a home video. Possible talent: I wonder if someone would agree that the creation of a basic plot and characters would be found from the 1960 movie of the UK, originally named the City of Dead, called Hot Horror Hotel for the release of United States? There are other matching films of the future UK Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One description remains with me years after watching the film. It's a small but important moment next to the beginning of the film. If I remember, the minister and his wife are standing to help others on the side of the road, in 1870, elsewhere in the West. The best friend Ray Milland identifies himself and his mother (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful woman of the females. When a preacher helps Ray Milland with a car, rattlesnake slithers to view and too much coils, without being left by any characters except Yvette Mimieux. He does not look quite frightened, but stares in snakes and silent concentration, until it goes away. At this wonderful moment, we already realize there is a very common thing about these people who seem to be ordinary, although the possible risk to the minister and his wife is still unknown and unknown for a long time. One small part sits with me easily after all these years, with many others. The film has a haunting quality on it that will not allow you to go, and it is not surprising that people remember so clearly. One should make this available for home video!
