Every time this film is on BBC someone at Radio Times says how it satire against the world after the rationing war and well-being. I don't think this is the point of film at all. The film represents spivs (small criminals who fled blackmarket) and a women's ban against the government restrictions but in fact they were the Tory front organization. It is undoubtedly the movie sends politics / social status but eventually people realize that they need all control to ensure the right community, want to be British and walk through outwardly than abroad. But I don't think they are going to be the same as they were before.
