I agree to remember seeing this when I was three years old, then my parents voted suddenly on all but a few seconds with another cartoon. Then I was 8 or 9 years old when I got it again and since I could better understand, I thought it was a good movie then. Quickly making a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I again found it because of the features / other internet tips and not just the movie. I am sure it is still good with children, but for us 20-30 somethings has definitely got "Status of worship" written everywhere. It is embarrassing that the original production went through a bitter process; as Fox gave enough time it would be more to be recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they had to do it with a completely different story and all the sound of the stars could be, but that's the Fox to decide. I have gambling here, I know. I still think it's a good film, but it can be better than big.
