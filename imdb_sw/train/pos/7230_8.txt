The "invisible Mouse" is a fun and distinctive cartoon of Tom & Jerry. It incorporates a common cat / mouse and a war, but in different ways this time. Jerry accidentally with a bottle of invisible ink and is very obvious on this because he knows that he can prepare a lot of "surprise" to Tom, frighten him, torture and confuse. <br /> <br /> as weird, it's too cool and wonderful to see what we can't see: invisible Jerry. It is interesting to see the things that lift up the air without seeing who does (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had their own life or even as a matter of ghosts. It is equally exciting to see Jerry eat candy and fruit when he is invisible. I loved the music that plays when it is not available. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes on this short time are when Tom sees the shadow of Jerry and annoys him even when Tom tries to beat him with a pot of refusal and Jerry writes "Lost me". I also love when Jerry is drinking Tom's chocolate milk, looking again and looking for pleasure. some good artwork too.
