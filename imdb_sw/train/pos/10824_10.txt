"Still Crazy" without doubt is a very rocky all-time. It has been the opposite of "This is the Ring", which has no connection with. "Wind Wind" is satire (and, in fact, not very good, despite "entry" for many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Bomba", "Still Crazy" has chief executives, great songs and humanitarian conditions. Knowing about people in the "Still Love". That's all important. Oh, yes, good music is very good, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreign and Chris Difford of Squeeze. US viewers had already studied with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later they will learn with Bill Nighy (Underworld, True Love, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter movies).
