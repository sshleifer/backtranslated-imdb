I used the “Hardcastle and McCormick” opportunity to buy the first season value (release of Canada) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the experiment, and immediately I visited. I scored 5 stars on Amazon, and I am a 10 star mark here. It's just beautiful. I liked about this is the opening and closing theme, and of course Stephen J. Cannell's mark at the end of each section, but most of all, the relationship between Judge and Mark as they worked together to erase all cases. I was so shocked that I also bought the second season as a friend, and I enjoyed the same. If you do not have this good track on the disk, I believe you should buy and put it in your collection.
