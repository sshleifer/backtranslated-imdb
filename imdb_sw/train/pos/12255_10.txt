Among Austen's films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more than "Influence," which is the one that transformed me into Austeniana. Before seeing this "Emma" I had seen two earlier versions, but in Emma one appeared to be worse, more like Lady Teazle, and on the other hand appeared to be half bad, as the offender could, where here appeared to be the same, young and ignorant and stubborn. Normally I thought the attitude and production situation showed the charm of the novel very good; in fact it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, instead of being treated for Christmas. The script is very well formed, and the adapter of the adapter, as the shaft of the light which shows Harriet to Emma in the church, all is in the set. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would like to expect, but I have been very pleased: it brings out the power, the practical side of the character, as opposed to the change of Emma, ​​and its outbursts of choleric against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a model of fraud around Carrolli; Samantha Morton as Emma's patron is similar to soft and exactly as she should be. And as in the "Foolish and Destruction" of the producers, it is considered that the last conservation of the characters can be trusted - only in some cases. For me this production was and remains happy.
