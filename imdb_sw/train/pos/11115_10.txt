I believe that Sopranos is an amazing show because of all the characters living in it. I have bought every video so far and have been waiting for others to be allowed. In all 42 pieces until now, the better is definitely part # 3, refusal, fury, acceptance. This period deals with my most popular character at all in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed by catching a bad truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was shocked because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his group. Finally, he was shot through the eye when he had a bath, and it was my most popular place in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 to me. And my favorite character # 2 was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy beat him in Hucklebarney's park after he was arrested and tortured. My first 3 character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character of # 4 is Chucky Signore, one of the people of Uncle Junior. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters have died. That's the only thing about evil about Sopranos. All winter people have been killed. Do you know what will be good to change about Sopranos? They should have a whole place where they show all the dead characters of hell and all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio, and Paulie, because they need to take revenge. Brendan Filone will beat back !!!!!!!!! 1
