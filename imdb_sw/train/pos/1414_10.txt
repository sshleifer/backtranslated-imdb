First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this film's length film. It should be well known as: "World, 2009". Secondly, allow me to handle complaints of other investigators who have seen the "World Series" series of 2006. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this television series, but learned here, that this film is full version of this series 2006. I judge any film, for personal features, not for that source. I deal with the results, for themselves, and the results of "World, 2009" are very good. I remove these unnecessary complaints of other administrators: it's just an extended version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". So? It's useless. <br /> <br /> As a buff of a film with someone who has watched a number of natural documents in my life, I was surprised and very impressed with "World, 2009". This is the first movie from DisneyNature's Disney's Disney and follows in the Walt Disney District Film and the Academy of the 1950s and 1960s. > Film view, film editing, music logo, sound and all recipes are best. There have been other interesting sources of interest also in these groups. What really puts "The World, 2009" off is its' scope. It covers the whole planet, which requires all seven continents. After my first look, it was obvious that this document of the document required great effort and the amount of time and talent to create. Three production companies were required to make this film an amazing text. The “World, 2009” honestly describes four different stories in their immigration as they go on a year through. The seasons starting in January and ending in December, from the North Pole and Africa Pole <br /> <br /> two special new high-tech cameras were used for this film: camera one of 360 degrees computer controlled motorized rotating lens and other is camera HD set for 1,000 frames per second. This filmmaking technique has actually added drama and beauty to some of the "World 2009 exhibitions" especially Duma after a big white shark leaping out of the water and catching sea sea with a glance to the sky over the top of the highest waterfall in the world . There are stunningly beautiful shots in this article <br /> <br /> Via Sinematography, music and narration, There are drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this film. With great music logo made by world renowned Berliner Philharmoniker, excellent innovation and crafts Posted by James Earl Jones narrative, I consider the "World 2009" as a great natural feature length documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really paid very well here. This film should be a look at all schools around the world. I am a Prize for the Best Documentary Award, among other awards. True, amazing, amazing, exciting and amazing. Highly recommended
