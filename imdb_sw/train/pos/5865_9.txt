Check this on the cable back to the early 90s and love it. Never seen it again until it was displayed on the cable again soon. It still gets a great movie in Vietnam. I do not know why it is not above tested. I've seen everything about this compelling film. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situation brought by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this film being more hurt now and our situation in Iraq. I would like this to be provided with more cable for most people to see. Human action on our soldiers is not left on the battlefield. It brought home for all others there. And this film is one of many that brings the house in a very difficult way. Good film.
