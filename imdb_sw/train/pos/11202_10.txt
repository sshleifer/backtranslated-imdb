At first, I thought that the Ring would be the most common movie with a common plot. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl likes two men - but Hitchcock brings to us on a silver plate, with laughter and fear, with compassion and pain. The way he makes the righteous crowd, the power of the girl's attraction to all men, the pain things that come along with the mind-opening techniques for its greatest movies (North and North West, Crocodile, etc.). The Lord did this even before three years!
