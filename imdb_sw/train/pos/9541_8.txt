Wow child, this is really some of the fine Asian fears / gore, and the movie's wonderful stuff. This is a Japanese splatterfest which reminds me of a little of Tetsuo, except in this case with all blood and guts, there is a wonderful story of love. It is hard to imagine how they dreamed of this fantasy dream, and other foreign creatures that infect humans as parasites, and turn it into a machine or think cyborgs. Anything wrong with these creatures after taking human, must kill and eat another. hmmm, yum yum. This would be known as a splatter of factories or something like that, and the sound of a good voice to add to all the fun. The film also gives a little bit of "The Thing" of Carpenter for creativity and effects. I would like to put this in a compulsory form of having gorehounds, since there is an infinite damage and some very fine. And it must have it with stones, because you don't even need to read the small titles, the image of the photo alone is enough to travel the mind. The creation of tiny organisms within the human body as a fetus reminds us of a film of Frank Henenlotter, which is another cult of excellent film and humor. "Machine Machine" is great fun for gorehounds, no doubt about it, and I just love it.
