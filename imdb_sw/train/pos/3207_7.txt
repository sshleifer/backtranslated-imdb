Of course, in any case the typical criticism of the film, the soldier is a very bad film really. Kurt Russell is a modern soldier who raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being filtered by a group of very real soldiers in the ruck of dangly fear which looked a bit like Gladiators competitions without falling mats. Get out of the junk planet, considered by the hippies of space that teaches about gardening, family life and, um, breast. Kurt does not talk too much. Finally the most powerful soldiers turn around and kill hippies to beat back back when they are running. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. The planet gets perfectly. Finally. Without a College starting a new group of "Best Explosion", the soldier can not win any prize. However, as bad as it is, it's still an enjoyable experience. Military equipment is more cool since Guests (APC exactly) and, for 90 minutes long, does not give you a welcome. Please note that the bottom score is just a guide. Highlight five points if you are interested in taking and refusing one more if you love miniguns. About 7 out of 10
