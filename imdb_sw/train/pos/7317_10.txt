This was a movie that I heard about all my growing life, but it has never seen it until a few years ago. It is a truly developed character. I knew about Michael Myers, he saw a mask, he saw ads for all the following sequels. But I was growing during the decade where Jason and Freddy beat the shock game, and did not think much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was lacking with cheap items. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly awesome movie. Now, with today's standards, not as a graphic and visceral, but this film provides on other levels of movies that loses today. The atmosphere in which John Carpenter builds is very interesting, and the fact that it is installed in the whole city, in the middle of the west is the guarantee of its power. The effects of lighting are less frightening, and "Shape" seems to appear and disappear in the shadows for will. A simple but simple but simple music game adds to doubts. <br /> <br /> All players' performances have been done well, and with special nods for Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is a good Laurie Strode because she is very good and can be affected. It's more scary when beaten by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much in it, we want him to live and go away. Donald Pleasance plays Dk. Loomis as a man in the mission, and works well. He adds a sense of emergency to trouble the city finds itself because he knows what evil kills their roads. Overall, not just Halloween is a great movie of fear, but also a great film. It is used on multiple levels and attracts the audience and not enabled. This should be a common view for anyone who wants to see a real movie. And for the most terrible time, try to look alone with remote lights. Don't be surprised if you think you see a "Shape" that walks around the shadows!
