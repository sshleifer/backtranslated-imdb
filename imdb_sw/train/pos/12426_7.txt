David Duchovney is building a role that he had to imitate in some degree in California - a troubled talent. And it is a role that plays well. <br /> <br /> This awesome start begins at a good speed and extends to the end. Timothy Hutton has a good villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a shameless doctor seeking his way in the world of crime written well. Drugs and desires of Jolie sultana combine cocktail head. Unfortunately toward the end of the story they get a little weaker and the relationship between the offenders and the FBI is provided and run as if it is designed only to develop the final area. But, that aside, the movie should see.
