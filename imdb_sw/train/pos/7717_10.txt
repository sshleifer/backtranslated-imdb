I loved this whole film of my life. It is a similar story of mind too, and a lot of all common things. example. The ship lost many years earlier was Bellerophon. In fact, in this classical mythology was the man who was killed in Chimera, the story of the story comprises two or more creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is a clear chimera-own and its monster Id. I love movies where writers have exposed their listeners with mental control, unlike many modern blockbusters who spend $ 150m for special effects, but about $ 1.50 on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheers
