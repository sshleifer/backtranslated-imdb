Many people have said that this film was not close to good as the first. Well, maybe not - to you. How, though, does your child respond? In fact, he loved it more than the first. The old Disney movies may sometimes be a little harder for young children. (For example - Bambi's mother is shot.) This movie was good for my little girl who loves humor and end up happy. <br /> <br /> If you want to be a snobby about what should be Disney standards according to the previous - skip this film. If you have a beautiful girl or a young heart of love you like, buy this film and treat your young children. This movie is as good as a sleepy movie for a dream of happiness rather than a dream. I am happy with the film that enjoys my child & it is not good to attract parents at all.
