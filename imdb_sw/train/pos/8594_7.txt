Sentinel I was hoping to be a good film and a young man I was right. The biggest from the novel and I thought this was the original story but I think it was not a very good story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland also, but it is still very difficult to dismiss his role as Jack Bauer in 24 but finally you do and he is very different from Sentinel than he is in 24. someone else tries to eliminate the television but failed.Ava Longeria was not good in the film and had a back seat in any matter. After seeing the film I had a nightmare about Sentinel and couldn't sleep. All Sentinel is a good film and I would suggest.
