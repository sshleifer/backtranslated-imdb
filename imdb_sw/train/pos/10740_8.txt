Made by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and described by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon this is a compelling and breathtaking story of how beautiful New York shines on the dark day. I saw this first when I was a 12-year-old, and at that time still touching me. Find out how great 9/11 was actually seeing this expanding the entire effect of 9/11. We looked for who the heroes were, how daily life was included, and how to put their lives on the line in which many people could run and save themselves. These brave men put their lives on the line and watch this enhances their appreciation. See if you can, this is the best document I saw.
