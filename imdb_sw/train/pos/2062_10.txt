First off I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is a little over-the-top. Tone down below maybe the scarecrow would have made this movie a little less cheesy. But in general I think it is one of the best movies of B. Tiffany Shepis is quite amazing, not to mention the most amazing. Although this movie lacks the most important nude, there are many other movies that see him. But here it gets all the evil, especially towards the end when it goes away with a full scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a good job as a sheriff and as a lover of a drunkard. Yes it is a low-budget B-movie. But among all I have seen, this is definitely one of my top favorites.
