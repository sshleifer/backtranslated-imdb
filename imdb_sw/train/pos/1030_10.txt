I use this with BABYLON 5 as the best series of sci-fi television conducted. They both stand in my mind because different from the STRE TREK series in advance, there is consistent reform of plots and characters. If you are looking for the original STRE and STAR TREK: TNG, they were a good display, but there was no theme or field that linked all events. In many ways, you can usually check out the perfect outings of the sequence and there is no problem understanding what is happening. This was under trial by the DEEP SPACE 9 (with its many battles that took the last season) and the other shows TREK, because there is a bigger story that brought them together. This co-operation has been developed as a concept by BABYLON 5 and you have seen this largely by SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel to take a form. Of course, there were small "lost" intermediaries that were not connected to others, but these were very limited and they were too far away and were also interesting. <br /> <br /> And speaking of funny, I loved the SG -1 stretched the light of constant attention and was not so bad. In this way, I enjoyed most of the BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a good character and his bitterness with the love of Homer Simpson - it's so bad he slowly withdrew from the series in the future season. <br /> To understand the SG-1 really, you should look at it from the beginning and see how intricately plots work. This solidarity demonstrates the strength of staying unique. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving a good opportunity, then sci-fi might not be the kind of you.
