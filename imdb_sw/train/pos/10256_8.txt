The first phase of this series of bad reputation is presented as a hot film discovered by manufacturers and set up as a camcorder for amateur, full and digital timer under the frame. It gives a woman a robbery with a group of black people who are tormenting her for several days before killing her. The innocent striker is safely beaten and beaten with raw meat before his fingers have been broken and pliers, his hand was hit with a hammer, his hit eye with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the more nausea area, female prisoners burn him with hot water and leave the dirt to live in the burn. The series received great news when American actress Charlie Sheen, believing in a series of real killings, tried to ban its distribution in the United States. The FBI screening revealed that the films were just what they seemed to be for many viewers - the innovation of recycling by misuse, but obviously specific effects. Gruesomely organized by the Japanese book of comic Hideshi Hino, who also led the third and fourth part, this film is a sure way to erase all but more rooms. But, gorehounds maybe not available anything special.
