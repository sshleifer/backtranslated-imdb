I am very excited about this - I am a great fan of movies that causes the mind to leave you many questions and ideas to discuss, and this was a stellar model. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good for it (well, almost every day. Let's just remember about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, will we do?) <br /> <br /> I loved exactly how you were involved when traveling the theme and avoiding ban - how past and future events interact and share. It was also very good for skill - the art of the art was very good, and I would 'see it on the big screen. Future events had a similar feeling in Brazil in many ways, and even now the most common centers were compelling. But perhaps the most amazing thing about it was showing two actors usually not very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both gave a wonderful exhibition here. Pitt exactly - I would like to see one or two movies before that makes me realize that he could do the truth (contrary to what I thought earlier), but this is exactly true. I found myself asking my friends at the same time "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his work (although legitimate that may not be too much).
