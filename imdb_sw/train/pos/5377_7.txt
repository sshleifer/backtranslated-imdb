"College College Girls" is my first friends with Edgar Wallace's work? and generally my first friends and films "Krimi" in general? and I can say that I am very interested. These things are entertaining, though I have never expected to be that? goofy! The film has an exciting and beautifully designed plot, with a delightful rate of health, loss of flamboyant and good killings. Are James Bond a bad mastermind? who always sits in the shade and in front of a big monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill some girls in special college and a new form of toxins. There is also a tribal ruler with a whip, dressed as a communist member of the KKK, to eliminate the remaining characters, such as the kooky police commissioner who continue to resolve the case through psychologically. Eagerly, if I knew quickly that these Krimi films were colored and colored, I would have purchased their collection already. The pretzel mark raises more questions than the answers at the end, and the great predictive experiment on the Scottish Inspector General's Yard account is sometimes too little to swallow, but I don't care because it was good entertainment. Even the 60's funky sound remained stuck in my head for a long time. It's like the difference in the Italian Giallo, but with the slapstick elements.
