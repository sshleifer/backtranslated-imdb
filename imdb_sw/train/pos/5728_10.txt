I went to this film expecting an awesome film of art. I found it frightened after the horror. It's a awesome film on the basis. It is not colored as other films of fear where the haunted house has ghosts and gloves. This film did not even show many deaths showing fear of characters. I think one of the best things about the concept that is not the only house that hates anyone entering the home. They are haunted no matter where. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am very surprised that critics did not like this film. I will see it again this week and I am happy about it. I have made this film 10 stars because it has made a terrible film should. Fear s ** t out of me.
