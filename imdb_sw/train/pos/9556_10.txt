When our first TV station launched, it filled many schedules with old UK programs. "Lock Your Daughter!" was released correctly, and I - swayed with a few seconds of film opening - were hit on an open tape. The best I ever did. <br /> <br /> The executives are suitable for their characters and bring them a good, perfect and accurate accents (Foppington of Christopher Plummer will leave them in stitches, such as Hoyden and his family). Two more elements, yellow wheels in a combination of wheels and match characters, wonders to see ahead in each area, and risqu√© views are done on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> I showed the film a few friends years ago and called a piece "lost treasure," as much for cast as for the story. To this day I will only refuse to think about the discussion. What? This Gem gets a way to release the DVD, I will be in front of the line.
