I read Nancy Drew as all sixteen years and collected books as adults. I liked the effect used at the end (and a little bit at the beginning) of the film where the line drawings in the style of the books on the screen from the film. It was a good way to show the relationship between the situation in film and books. For example, the events and suppliers of Eastern antiques reminded many of the events I remember from books. I thought Ned was fully beaten, and Emma Roberts was a 21st century translation of Nancy Drew. (As a picture of Betty Crocker, he keeps on time!)
