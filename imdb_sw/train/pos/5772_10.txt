I was watching this show as a child, and I loved it! I watched it when it came to the age of Toonami .... Sheesh, I am too old! I had to be 13 or 14 when you arrived ... But however, it had a huge plot of conspiracy, and I was one of the girls girls who looked (and added) Sailormoon, and I was very happy. Animation was not the best .... Very interesting in other places, in fact, and the sound made it was sluggish at the beginning, but it was a good look, and I found myself entering it day after day. br>> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warinors are classic, and all the time of my one faves. Go to Ryo !!!!
