More as a psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho looks good as a head. The person who manages the movie (the author as you will) shows movies here in his own way. Many of them are ordinary, but they are all listed here on the IMDb and I will strongly advise them to see (especially Hitchcock, Solyaris, Talk & Lynch movies), because Slavoj Zengine will go back! Or in other words, he can destroy them. I don't remember if he had destroyed more than what I listed (I think Chaplin movies too), but as I wrote it would be better if you look at them all before! In the IMDb list there is a lost movie, which I gave the report, so it can go up there soon. It's a movie of Meg Ryan, but it's just a short snippet not a big deal of any program. The comments of Zizek and comments are things fun to listen to, if you are interested in seeing things through another view (even if it destroys your favorite movie a little for you ... it doesn't mean it will do it, but it can)!
