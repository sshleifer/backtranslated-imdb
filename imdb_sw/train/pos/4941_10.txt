I believe many people voted for the movie, not because of lack of quality. But it did not follow the standard of Hollywood. Some disputes have not been resolved. The latter is too little for others, but the journey of rich characters and a long list of supporters offer are both stimulating and entertaining ideas. Even the movies are excellent due to urban environments, leading is also excellent and creative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 in my book, this film will put you in a normal position and the expected script of Hollywood is not. They risked and did a few different things. I think it worked well, struggling to avoid any direct reference to movies because seeing it is the best answer, not accepting someone's interpretation.
