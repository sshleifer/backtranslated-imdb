I saw this movie just after hearing the raves about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience seemed to be very little. But still, Alec Guiness leads to a powerful platform for a jolly, like formulaic, romp through the industry after WWII England. This is a disaster story of making perfect products every day. Remember the car that runs on the water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not insert, squash, or even become dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their staff are surprised by the prospect of cancellation out of business, and so the plot gets a little thicker. It makes the whole business worthwhile, and looking at it to hit the factory's research laboratory is always a blast! (Brits those ... it's always a small mouth at the bottom of the fire.) The film can run as well as the innovation of Guiness of innovation, but it is a beautiful journey similar.
