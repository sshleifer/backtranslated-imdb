I was very fond of this silent game. Kurt Russell and Kurt Russell alone could play very well. He was raised from childhood without knowing anything but war and fighting, Todd (Kurt Russell) has been ignored on the planet after being made heavy by the soldiers. was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it quite his - the original, courageous, and all human beings. I miss the fact that sequels has never been made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My & nbsp; //www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
