I liked this film very much, and returned to see it twice in the week. Mrs. Spectators put nails in action - it was like a hungry cat on moving, with its prey. He screams in anger and lust, taking the "very young" partner, and beat hundreds of fragments of the mother of the beautiful Chinese terrorist on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film was full of good touch. Maserati, beautiful wardrobe, flower boxes along the roof. I enjoyed the ancient Greek class and mentioned 'Antigone'. It had a sense of 'O' Story - that is, where people of the way get into an unprotected sexual adventure. While walking a wonderful apartment in a buff, he is comfortable - and why not, what prevents the "Devil in Meat"? All the movie is a real treat!
