Is there anyone who comes to know where this film was hit? The area at least on the corridor is good. It seems to be UK. However, the Ivy floor building is actually seen as a Brill building, with its attractive elevators. Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I was playing, but I never seen him. Maybe he was a husband's lawyer, but, again, I do not remember that the character is on the film, unless it is mentioned as having a phone. Maybe he was in the area at least? Or the ballroom area? What? Did anyone see him? Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he beat this film.
