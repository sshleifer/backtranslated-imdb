My brother took this house from the rental store and I remember to expect it to be. I think this name has taken me away. I can never remember starting a film with low expectations and becoming a winner. I watched the film twice before letting my brother return to the shop. It's so bad that the movie speaks to me how this way did. I was caught up with Ruby when she was trying to make her way through her life. The worst thing about this movie is that it seems to abolish very quickly. I could keep looking at the clock. Another obstacle is that I have been concerned with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She is perfect in this film. This film is easy in my top ten favorites at all times.
