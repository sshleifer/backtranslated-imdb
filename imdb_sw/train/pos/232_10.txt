What's a good movie. The characters were not only alive but alive, a real glass everyday life and crisis within the family. Each character created a unique personality in a story that the audience could easily get involved with someone who knew within their family or close circle of friends. The story has a true flow to the viewer can come in and become part of the festival, laughter and tears as the movie plot grows. Script has a good job of getting common sense, actions and effects of characters for conflict, opinion, and resolution. It's not epic, but it's a very good movie to watch with loved ones. Find out a lot of head and 'ahhh' when you share and enjoy.
