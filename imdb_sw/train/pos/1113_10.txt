Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly is one of the funniest women in the world. He started as a comedienne to stand in the 1970s, but his great break came in 1983 when he starred against Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated jewel, "King of Comedy". His film work was never completely removed, though. He made several odd but entertaining pictures, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but amazing places he created himself. <br /> <br /> "Without You I am" without a doubt it is her good effort. Is the effectiveness of his show-far-Broadway show that has made him a star? and the best friend of Madonna for four years. In ten planned and organized screens, Sandra returns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and makes known songs by Burt Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich received Sandra doing 90-de-powerful performance that is all sexy and unique funny. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't miss this film; it is also rent for its beauty (weird) as its odd talent as comedienne. And has caused filmmakers in their work? "Hedwig and Inch of Anger", for example, would seem very different as "Without You" does not exist.
