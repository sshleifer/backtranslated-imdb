After being converted to Oscar- "Secret & Lie", Brenda Blethyn struck a star in "Saving Grace" alike. And I would like to tell you, this is not the type of film you get every day. After her husband has committed suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) finds that her unintended financial decisions have left her a huge debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to reach the end: marriage. That is true, Grace begins to strengthen. Every aspect of this movie was played for great effects; there is no bright time anywhere in it. And I certainly did not see the last end area coming! But however, you have gotta see this movie. You can only feel more of a little celebration after seeing it. If nothing else, it can work as a good lesson about knowing one's money. But of course, there is more LOT than that!
