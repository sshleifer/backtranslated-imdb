They still love 17 or so years after I first saw it, I actually found that I have lost my copy of this and I was very angry. Although it is not a communion and nature (which I considered as a child is careless and an adult I care about), this is what cartoons * should be * like. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to enjoy with everyone. I am surprised that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than cartoons we see today that don't teach our children anything. Music is good, and you're in your head foreverâ€¦ I have downloaded all the sounds of one voice to one or the other.
