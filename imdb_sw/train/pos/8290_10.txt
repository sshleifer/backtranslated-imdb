This is just one more example of the perfect genre of Gene Wilder. He wrote and dreamed this mysterious star. No one could do it well. These concerns could be lost. I wish Mr. Wilder will serve us with some of these. I have enjoyed everything that I have seen Mr. Wilder but I had no idea how he had real talent until I saw "Kill in a small City," and this continues. He certainly knows exactly what the audience wants and how to open it with his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. Her magic trick comes through the walk. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who loves secrets and / or works of the film's Gene Wilder. His star grows more clearly.
