I can't call "We are Back! The story of Dinosaur" just the kiddie of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it asks them a security question to bring creation from one time to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who gave the voice: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. For example: a woman given, a woman of "Cheers", a host of "Tonight Show", a More Honest Name In News, a famous chef, a police chief "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the three Amigos and CNN brothers. . <br /> <br /> But I think that I shouldn't just focus on cast. I thought that this film has something for two children (for fun) and adults (natural history). True, it is run, but kind of understanding. I would say that John Goodman was making the voice of Rex here is a sort of predecessor of his voice working in "Monsters Inc". Value to see.
