The IMD lists this as 1972 for some reason, but other sources that I have seen including good app details such as '68. It does not mean, unless it is quite interesting to watch this abstract trick of the film and video (one of the first art works to connect two looks) in the context of the Gate Gate of 2001, released the same year. It is precisely not my thing, but I can use it for small doses and many colored colors published by the psychedelic feelings of this flower series, Rohrschach blocks, birds, etc. are very good and very beautiful. Assisted help gave way to many other 70-year-old video artists, and deserves more attention.
