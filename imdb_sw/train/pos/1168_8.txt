Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian smoker or a professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers disagree. In terms of content, this very enjoyable film is not good; for the question of amusement mystery, is it fun? is a very example, violent, very cruel, a car is well-known. "Arzenta" is an improper, but very interesting film, better than the current Hollywoodian trash which gets the same label. It comes from the flirting of Delon's shortest and Italian B's '70s' movies. It uses a tough teen of Delon, persona, of a badly ill-made art gallery that he made during his youth. I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this film, that he had a role in the beautiful flick of Eurocrime. The score is very good, and a good preliminary song The decision felt that the gusto which the Italians had had a film that is considered an exciting work, where music has an important part. <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out of Erika's most interesting Blanc (31 years in '73) looks like an unknown hooker. At that time, Arzenta's partner, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a typical star) left the movie after '75). "Arzenta" is amazing published? A delightful view of volunteer, some special atmosphere of Expressionistic. The movie was led by Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (the comedy of Delon). Not to mention that these two movies, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, do not match it. movie action - second is a light comedy, more relative to spoof, though very interesting and crafts made.Duccio Tessari directed film like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Satan's Sons, Butterfly Bloodstained, La Viva La Muerte .. Tua! , Guys Tough (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc..
