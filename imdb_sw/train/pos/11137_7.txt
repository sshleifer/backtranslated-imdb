At midnight Cowboy made a great shock when it was released in 1969, drawing X rating. For today's standards, it will be very difficult to pull R rating. Jon Tazama, who has been the best, has the potential in his role as Joe Buck, who was out of the city that wants to be big and women in New York City. He meets seed seed seeds called Ratso Rizzo, who tries to be a friend of Buck for his own purposes. Finally they tie a bond that touches and attractive. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman just shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but not more than in this picture. He is a tendency to have everything else around him contradicting the comparison. The loss of the Academy for John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions made by the Art Arts and Science Academy. Director Schlessinger has a left hand and its production, but this film has a sudden downfall that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. It deserves to see the performance of Hoffman alone.
