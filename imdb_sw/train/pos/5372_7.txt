Among the first five events of the "Hammer House of Horror" series of the short Hammer, this fifth period and the strange head "The House That Killed to Death" seems to be worse. As a great fan of Hammer Studios' Gothic Horror films for many years, I wonder what it took so long to finally start watching recently recently. So far, I have only seen the first five events, and I have a strong feeling that the better is still coming, but even if the series stays as entertainment as the first five events, I will be happy. Although the second and third events were interested in seeing their sense of humor and the beauty of darkness, this fifth entry is definitely one of the first five that gives a real Horror. The period begins when an adult kills his wife without unknown incentives. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) go home with their daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Once the move, however, the family should know that there is something very wrong with the house, which seems to be haunted ... The second time directed by Francis Megahy is better than its previous entry, "Growth Pain" ( Session 4), and unidentified executives provide good performances. The film is also made well for the topic of effects, movies and logo. "The house that was killed" is a solid place that provides things that my colleagues like to love in a short story. The film provides a horrible situation, during the horror of real and twist mind, and it is suspenseful and very entertaining from the beginning to the end. In general, this is recommended for fans of Hammer.
