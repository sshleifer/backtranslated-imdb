I can see why this film was Oscar-selected for Best Live Action Short, if it was built properly. Even if you don't like Blues (though for me, this looks more like a jazz), you can easily appreciate this film. It has been done very well, though for my life, I can't see why Gjon Mili director should only lead one film - this. In other words, the film has been selected and the director has not yet received any kind of work. For black artists, I could understand this not leading to their migration to the higher gear, unfortunately many white people are concerned (or worse) for blacks or "music type". If you look at this film, if you enjoy the original part, skip forward to 5:50 points - where it takes too much. When the woman finished singing and the singers began to erase, the pace changed slightly.
