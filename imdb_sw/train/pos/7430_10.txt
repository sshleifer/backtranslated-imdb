I loved this film very much, and it moved exactly. Two actors give us such a great exhibition, finally, it is really heartbreaking to know what finally happened to their characters. The series between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and the song is just the best they have. That's why I did not feel surprised when I learned that it has won 5 gold gold prizes (the most rewarding film on Golden Globes), Oscar and even Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. Great movie, which is often criticized (perhaps because Streisand trembled to participate in it, certainly as "co-director"). His art is great, and it will certainly enjoy you!
