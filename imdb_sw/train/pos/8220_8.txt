The fourth in the series of "Dirty Harry", this film includes one of the most uncomfortable, unscrupulous, impaired women, who I hate. "Ray Perkins" played by Audrie Neenan. He is a modern version of the contemporary contemporary lifestyle of 1945's "Detour", "Ann Savage". His non-verbal view and immersion opens me so much I have never seen this film again until I got a dirt filter that tied him .... and at least some of it! Then I would enjoy all the film. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) may, violence immediately follows ..... within minutes! It happens often is almost laughable but it makes a quick-moving film, entertainment and a satisfying end if all scumbag offenders are removed automatically. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our original nature .... and connects, sad to say. Many of us would like to see these dirtballs to get to the end, and who is better than Dirty Harry?
