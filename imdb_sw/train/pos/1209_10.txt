At the time of the worst cartoons, I'm shocked to see a good-quality film making it on the IMDB List for Animation movies. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first. I don't want to refuse it. However, when I was in the age group of target for this film, I didn't even see it, nor would it be important if I did it. People who made it could use the "New Generation" to realize that this is another way to Care Bear Family could start. Maybe we mean to decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family began to come true. This was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 years, and it did not frighten me or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
