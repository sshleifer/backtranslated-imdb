I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. Far I loved it. The executives were very honest. Alexandra Bastedo was very good .... I'm just planning a DVD (15 pieces). They had the highest authority. They had the best human skills (power, hearing, sight). 3 actors were very good at their rocks, they are widely believed. There was good news in every section. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script thought it was good, and the characters make it beautiful. There were no concepts, like in other exhibitions. They did not try to make jokes every 2 minutes to show the light. I highly recommend this TV show for anyone to be like good things.
