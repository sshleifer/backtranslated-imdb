This is one of the best movies of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies have a great dance but romance stories. This still has access to relationships but it is not the same as another film. <br /> <br /> This photo does not only contain a play but the best characters and a bunch of good songs. Music is the main theme here and what is good is the addition of solo tap and Rogers. She is not only a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with a huge figure. He also plays with Fred, of course, and they always enjoy watching on the dance floor. Over the 1950s to see "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was a real kick for the first time I saw this seeing this little Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although he had an early hairstyle of '30s early, I realized his voice immediately. Also in this film is a quick appearance with Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but it must admit that I have not yet left the ball. I can't find him, but I know he's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for some want-chewing in the third part of the film, was fun to see with Randolph Scott - though better in the west - looks too. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, beautiful and beautiful film if you want to enjoy the many talents of Astaire and Rogers.
