Genge of Roses. "Every rose has its thorns." The old western and hip hop mix, is fully connected. The style of clothing, environment, and all the plans are appropriate for what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - in five years, stole twenty-seven bankers and then lost without tracking. Now, a small western city is surrounded, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Gang Gang is ready to rise again. And this time it is an individual. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women split up after five years of running together. When Rachel's sister is murdered, she ends up with her friends again and runs the revenge. Good, around the western edition. (If you have seen Girls Girls, this is better for the female characters). I gave 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the environment made it to me.
