I would like to start by saying I'm a great fan of Carrey. Although I will admit I have not seen all his movies * cough * cough of magestic *. The Bruce Bruce was enjoyable. No other ideas have gone to how cheesy gets to the end, I don't know what they were writing. Somehow I could not help but feel like this film was an attempt to re-create Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> For a good explanation, The Daily Show of Steve Correl is HARIO and so is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Power if you're a great fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see the heart of a light (soft piano music) somewhat interesting.
