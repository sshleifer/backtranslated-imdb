Many have already said in this film and I would like to join those they liked. It is a unique film that uses a variety of features: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess. In points you scream, for other points you feel for the characters who are wrong and fail to expect. Sabu's Sabu can be shown in a series of films. One is that when all three men chase a day's dream about a young woman who just went through the street. This sequence is done well and shows the characters of all three athletes very well. It's fun and interesting at the same time. Another example of Sabu's skill is part of the film where fighters are getting tired. First one of them, the most common of the three boys, admits that a woman who feared someone else is coming back and you see them playing with another one shooting with herself who is moving too much. All refugees get to this point where they think they have something that they have lost or they are getting again. And in one part of the film they stop communicating, whistling, just laughing. So here is the beauty and humor of what we call a life that Sabu can be shown in the film. Its characters fail (do they end the end?) But they do not take away their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" who make the right to claim Sabu that he is a professional. Go look at them! <br /> <br />
