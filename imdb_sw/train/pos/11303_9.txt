Visconti's first film has a combination of optical eyes and anonymous technique, accompanied by compulsory exhibitions from Massimo Girotti as a good drifter and, better, Clara Calamai as a good manufacturer, fearful Giovanna. Remed several times as 'Postman Rings twice' but never to worry. He can't believe this was the first film of man! It shows the courage of a person in their workplace.
