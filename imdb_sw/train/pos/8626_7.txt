"Der Todesking" is not the actual type of film that makes you happy? Jörg's second cult worship of Jetini, which is actually more beautiful than "Nekromantik" with beauty, papopo and seven short events? one for each day of the week? related to suicidal suicide. Among these incidents that are already very confusing, Buttgereit incorporates real horrible deaths of a devastating death. All these events are not the same but, as beautiful, "Der Todesking" is mentioned entirely on the list of all the artistic art films. Particularly on Wednesday's events, involving a person to describe his sexual pain to an ordinary visitor in the garden, and one Sunday, considering a young person who is concerned with the dead, is very intense and very destructive. The added value of this film, or any other similar shockumenary, is possible and I don't even know if Buttgereit had any kind of contact messages here. There is a clear mention of the chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but in particular we remain unaware of the incentives of these people to leave their lives significantly. In comparison with what I anticipated, "Der Todesking" is not for use or for convenience! On the contrary, I have never had the hope of Buttgereit to be a crafty and thoughtful reflection of human suffering. Thursday's episode is a good example of this, as it shows a different class of popular German class time titles, age and work of people who emerged on the screen. Production values ​​are poor and editable often lose expertise, but this is not true in this kind of movie. Is this lesson strong and encourages us to reflect on a little fun? but also important? things of life. Use of awesome music, too!
