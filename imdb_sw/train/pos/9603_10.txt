I have one word to create this film, WOW! I saw "Dario He is going to West" at the Tribeca film festival. People in the theater were mourning. This movie shows the difficulties that Darius faces Dystrophy of molecular. The movie was very well and really made you a part of the movie, I was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very lucky to have a good health, other people in this world are less than us. And sometimes we have to give them and help them, even to the end. I would give ten stars, and they gave Darius when they were not asked, they did not do with the money they made to a needy friend, Darius, the world must know, Darius went west.
