It has the Destroyers <br /> <br /> "Sneaky Man" is perhaps the most weaker movie that Paul Verhoeven, director of the great movies like "Total Note", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" has made. It is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was arrested by a completely script of the query, and did better. The first part of this film is very good, with lots of jokes, serious effects and even Skunk Anansie on sound sounds. Unfortunately, the movie blows a flat in the second part, it was facing a typical film of slasher or perhaps it's very bad "Alien". The latter is particularly concerned <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon keeps returning to life after several events that should (in the sense of the word) kill him. </ SPOILER>. And anything is not quite known, in fact: the issue of being invisible has not been fully followed. But all, Verhoeven can sit well on the average with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of the stars ****
