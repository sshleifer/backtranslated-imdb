This is still another false and compelling film led by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a Communist agent group who are trying out the secrets of America - they will leave anything to succeed. <br /> <br /> The movie will start with Peters on the main road and visible federal agents. They know he is a link in a long chain. It is not known for everyone is a wild card on the horizon - a small panda time (Widmark) is also on the train and can steal the secrets that Peters carried. Widmark thinks it is just another fund who has been campaigned - later he knows the weight of what was stolen. Now it is Widmark alone - and Commies and FBI fires on its way. <br /> <br /> Widmark and others are unique and the movie comes from beginning to end. Although he had no bills, special mention is made to Thelma Ritter. This former actress was perhaps the performance of her life as a dove. He was often given this opportunity to act and I was surprised at his ability to play a broken and sad woman. <br /> <br /> In addition to the script and directing to go, it is very good - but with limited discrimination. At first, I liked Widmark's way with Peters. It is one of the few times in the film you will see the woman struck the square in the mouth! Now that's hard. Later, of course, it becomes very close - very close to being honest. Still, with a very good game with an effective film like Noir, this can be ignored. Watch this film.
