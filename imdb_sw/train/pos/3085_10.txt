I watched non-working sessions on the Internet and I was very sad that the show could not return. It had a good cast for mature, talented and amazing chemists. It seemed like all actors are personal friends in real life. To the end of the show began to be active, fun and very visible. Of course, some of the lines of story are not true, so what is ... All the characters are interesting and you care for them. The period reminded the cross between 2 other interesting things: "Sex and City" and "Ask". Great big to cast all. Note to ABC does: Nielsen ratings reports did not show real results. The viewers of the show will write more. I have been very disappointed with large networking networks with a real TV or youth exhibition. Why get hardware, better, well-equipped, we should switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for setting up other web sites online. New media media will get more and more popularity among the audience.
