This film has many steps before opening loans than in all Hollywood films. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and star Jet Li. This team has brought you a lot of Hong Kong movies, including Once Time in China's series. The move was fast and angry with the wonderful work of the wire. I just noticed a wire in two shots. In addition to the action, the story itself was stable and not just used as a filling. To get any practical film to fight this you must look at a Hong Kong movie hotel in your area. They are worth looking out and usually never despair.
