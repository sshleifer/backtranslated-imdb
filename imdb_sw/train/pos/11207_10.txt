This document was selected by Oscar and it is easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is an interesting piece of work. Why not published is a secret which Disney can only describe. Good use of live pictures and animation in the hub. This was used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed for a long time. * sigh * most recommended.
