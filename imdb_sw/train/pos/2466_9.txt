I've never thought of four hours very quickly when I saw this film. This film returns power and art to Hamlet which was always meant to have it. Even the most so-and-so talks are made in new and innovative ways. And throw it wonderful, Brannagh bright stars. It is its charisma, power and command of the role that defines the movie. Making a full and complete copy fills many holes and allows you to discover new ones in spite of length. Where one can expect a dark, very aggressive castle, we are dealt with a good feast for the eyes. Light only comes from Hamlet himself, as appropriate. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.
