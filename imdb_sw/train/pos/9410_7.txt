I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people explaining as a comedy. It was always exciting, but in fact, it wasn't very funny. If I were expecting to be a comedy, I would have been disappointed with the film, but, going without expectation, I found it fun and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I realized the main character. I was less concerned with the satire of the capital or work, and more in the basic story of a man to fight his invention. A person who does not intend to earn money from his invention than he sees is filled with fruition and incorporated into production. He is quite a hero when he refuses to take big money with a hot woman to return to suppress his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have likened to Jurassic Park; I, I liken to Fountainhead.
