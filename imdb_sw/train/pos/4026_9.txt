Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a thought to stimulate the film that makes you think and makes you question our culture. It is undoubtedly the best Indian movie that I have seen until today. This film should be displayed on film films all over the world and I believe it would be a great candidate in Cannes. All actors were cast completely by Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai in their role. Story story tells about the distribution is a very important story and that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It had no weakness or discrimination and has provided a human-story supply. Here, there is not one country shown as good or bad. There are poor Indians, evil Akinas and the Indian and Pakistani Indians. The movie is excellent and the music is pleasant, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the movie was awesome ... and acting only took my breath away. They were all fully beaten.
