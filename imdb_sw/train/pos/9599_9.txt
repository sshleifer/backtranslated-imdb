I saw this film on the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and had no dry eye in the house. It's amazing to see not only Darius a good man, but how interesting the team is also at a young age. It also made me think how MTV's disgusting was, and how to be given a chance to engage and encourage in a positive way, they refused. It shows whether they are very concerned about their youth and their audience. <br /> <br /> It is a true warm and warm story ... take your lids but it's good to see how caring and attractive young people can be today.
