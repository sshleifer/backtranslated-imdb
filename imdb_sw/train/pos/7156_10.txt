Holes is an amazing movie. I love it and it's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney which is not cheesy. Usually a blow is a very cool picture. I wish Disney will make more pictures like that. Such is actually the birth of Disney resources that shows that it's cool. Do not reach an improper idea, I do not mean Disney's bad mouth but many things are planned towards children and THAT'S OKAY. Children deserve to have their entertainment as well. But Disney has been convicted of attempting to appeal to a young audience and usually fails. But not for Fever. It's any kind of any movie of any age can look and enjoy and not immediately thinks it is corny. True, it is a kind of movie that even a lot of young people may enjoy because there are characters in it that can be involved. <br /> <br /> Holes is doing a good job of being a good family entertainment but not having much fun and living a bit on edge. I hope Disney takes more risk and makes more flicks like this.
