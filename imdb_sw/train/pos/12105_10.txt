Antonio Margheriti of "Danza Macabra" aka. The 1964 Castle of Blood is an amazing Italian center of Gothic Horror, and after Mario Bava's "La Maschera Del Demonio" (aka "Black Sunday") of the 1960s and "Pit and Pendulum" of Roger Corman's 1961 (with Vincent Big Price) another must-see that he found Barbara Steele the most remarkable features of the reputation as the most important women horror icon in the history of motion motion. But it's not just good and brilliant Barbara Steele one of my managers at all times, the screenplay of "Danza Macabra" was co-written and no less than a priority movie Sergio Corbucci, who led as a Spaghetti Western professional skill like "Django" (1966) and "Silence Great" (1968). Italian number 2 in the field (after Mario Bava), Director Antonio Margheriti is one of the all-time masters of Gothic Horror, and "Castle of Blood" is certainly a success for him. Of course another film works very carefully in creating a very bad situation, but still as good as this fascinating masterpiece. When he met a famous legendary legendary macabre, Edgar Allen Poe, in the worst tavern of London, the little journalist Alan Foster (Georges Rivière) receives a bet from the leader, that he can not spend the night in his haunted castle at night of hearts all night. Once Foster comes into a strange castle, amazing things begin to happen. After a while, however, she meets with a good host of fortress Elizabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele). Incredible events so far, however, have been only a dangerous situation of bearing a fortress, however ... <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / The movie and the great logo and Riz Ortolani creates a very strange environment which is more than comparable. Barbara Steele is amazing as always, I can't find enough words to praise an amazing actress. No other actor has ever been able to connect the beauty of refusal and rebellion as it was with Steele, and no actor would like. Apart from Steele, the film is thrown into another wonderful beauty, Margarete Robsahm, and also provides good performance. George Rivière's performance as Alan Foster is good, and all the other exhibitions are also very good. The "Blood Fortress" is the best in many departments: Barbara Steele gives one of his most beautiful performances, movies and places are very good for comparison, the atmosphere is very amazing ... The only film is perfect condition, gothic beauty and art fear. In short, the "Blood Fortress" is one of the most high-quality and Gothic Horror films, and should not be lost by anyone who is attracted to such a variety! 10/10
