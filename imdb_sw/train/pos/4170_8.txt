I saw this film immediately. It included many things that were visible on television movies at that time. The only problem I had was the name of obvious reasons ... Immediately she thinks a great snack cake with Drake! Leaving the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would have been completed. Richard Crenna can always bring a sense of weight to whatever he does, however - if the plot is good or bad. But this was a delightful Halloween pleasure offered by the CBS network. I liked the part that Crenna takes on a flight to run a hidden country to find a professional who could help him conquer the evil animal. He asks the taxi driver how to look for this person. The greatest debate between the native tribe of Crenna and Crenna on the side of the cabby lost the confidence of its tribal people. 'Yes, Mr. Barry, I left these things when I came out of the mountains ...' - referring to a profile that they have never seen or advised, and nobody knows how to contact him. <br /> <br /> Apart from regular rental, this movie still enjoys.
