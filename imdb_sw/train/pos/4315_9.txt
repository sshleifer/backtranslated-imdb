I watched this film again and remained concerned for the number of deaf people who expel it as New Age papia. A good film, which takes its time to develop, continues to come closer to going on the edge but is not recommended and ultimately is reflecting, affecting, and truer life than many film people who reject its "coincidences" you can see. I was angry when the movie as "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I loved the last) were chosen for the best photo that year (join alone that "The Lamb's Tranquility" won!) And this was completely ignored but by appointment one for better screens. After reviewing it again, I think history supports my original response!
