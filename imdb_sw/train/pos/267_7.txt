It all starts with a series of burglars of non-related items in the hostel for students on the Hickory Road, London. Taking care of his sister, who is the homeowner, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look at it. He agrees, but soon the pieces climb up when the girl, who admitted that he was involved in theft (not all), found to be killed. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a strong brain practice, without being as hard-hard hard as "One, Two, My Shoe Buckle". The murder, theft and theft of diamonds are a linked crime, and at the end that connects everything is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially the psychologist Colin McNabb and the wonderful girl of America Sally Finch, the Japp Inspector has its exciting time (perhaps more closely this series has come "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon gets the most important part of the story than usual.
