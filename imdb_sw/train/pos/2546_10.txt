This is only about one league as 'Black Cat', although I would like to give 9 instead of 9+. That's a true reputation for a film that has been hit so badly that it's amazing! <br /> <br /> `Invisible Ray 'is a terrible part, part of the game and certainly a sci-fi part. In the 1936 film, the sci-fi features were a good deal ahead of their time. The combination of fear, ceremony and sci-fi is a perfect mix, while the characters of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. Director Lambert Hillyer holds many things that James Whale did so many times. What I say is that this film is eerie and shot. The area with the fabric outside the Lugosi room is a perfect example of feeling. It's time to stand in the film, which is not very popular in today's genre movies. Like 'Black Cat' and 'Lost Island', I can't understand why this film has not yet been removed from the DVD. When you think of some junks that have already been transferred to a DVD it is not surprising. However, look at this film if you have a chance. Offered to a DVD takes it quickly and puts it in a respected spot within your DVD library.
