I saw the German version of the movie on German TV and I was very surprised. I usually like to see the document, but I can't remember that I've seen one better than 'Earth'. I knew some events from YouTube videos that I have found for random browsing. I also remember that I have seen the parts of the film in multimedia stores, run on high-definition TV. After seeing the movie is open to me why footage is popular among Youtube users and retail multimedia managers: It's just amazing and interesting that you can't help but focus on the screen, regardless of whether you are generally interested in the documentation or not. Of course, there are exciting movies, but in relation to the document, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best of that kind.
