A wonderful role for Eddie Murphy to take in the length of his work. While there is a lot of "Eddie Murphy's behavior," plays a decent man. Some of the cast are good, especially Charlotte Lewis good. The beauty and tranquility of his character was made the sound of the film from getting very Murphy.
