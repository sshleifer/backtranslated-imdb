Since I first noticed this in the theater has become my favorite. Since then I have seen many times and have never been tired. The layout you have a lot to do that (Colorado I know it will be envious), but the story is natural and I loved how to serve the young people the mountain city as heroes. There was no film I can compare this too. John Lithgow has a clever man, but I like how he is not lost - he has to follow Tucker next to it and that's what continues to be interesting. This is an action movie on the BEST. I don't think I will see another that is entertaining. It does not require 50,000 bribes to be evicted to be a film of action. It should only enable you to be offended, not attacked.
