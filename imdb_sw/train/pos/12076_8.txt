This was typical of the B movie in 1940s Hollywood and still succeeded more than its expectations. Why? It has a good plot and has been stopped by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as a female, of all men. <br /> <br /> When a young woman responds to the secretary, she certainly gets more than she did business. The only talents that his employers are looking for are those who will lead to his loss. It seems Witty and MacReady want to give him away as a daughter-in-law with his wife, respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and wants to make Foch as well as the body can claim. The film deals with how Foch tries to find people in the city to trust him and how to avoid largely everything he does. Why do people not believe?
