I don't know what another viewer is talking about - this was a good movie, creating a sense of era that feels like a time trip. The characters are really young, Mary is a powerful match for Byron, Claire is a young and tad annoying, Polidori is a striking-down sycophant ... all are beautiful, curious, and decadent ... not terrible horrible they are in Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of film, and I love it for a different reason, but this works as a trader of Ivory and Ivory, and it was from my lessons to capture the best of what summer should feel like. Romantic, yes, but it completely repeats my mind in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the film. One of my favorites all the time.
