this is a good film! I first saw this film when it came out. I recently saw this film again and still continues to my memory. Most of the films we watched when we were young are not seen to hold when we look at them later. The film is truly an example of 80 types of films made at that time. Keaton is very good, all the participants actually did a very good job with Ron Howard was very good to allow the story to push the movie together and forcing. The speed of the film is fast and a few slow places to see cars from the 80's are very good. From the 80th century I loved to see the disease again. Film is a good film for any lovers of lovers and 80 movie lovers.
