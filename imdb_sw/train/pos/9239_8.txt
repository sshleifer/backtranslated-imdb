As I said in my opinion on the first part: these two movies are much better than most of the Fiction Business Scientists confess. The situation in the second movie is not moving if we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but later, thousands of refugees fleeing to small cans, are protected by only one powerful position. But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the news eliminates, it takes war on Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a bit of Mad Max because all those who fight it are oil for their spaceships to travel to get the world off, but it works for me. It is an exciting recreational Science Fiction that includes good actors and special special effects (though those are repeating themselves, say at least :-)) I would like to continue with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we have been given a second sequel without the characters of the name that confirmed that the story had worked before especially because the characters of the feature were well chosen ... <br /> So it reduces less than the 1980s production, but thumbs up to movies two from 1978.
