The last WP's 2006 WPPP, proved to be a contest with fans, but for one reason only, the match-only matches were Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But for the recent hip PPV that December to Dismember, WWE knew that it was doing something to make fans talk again, this proved important when it introduced MNM and Hardy Boyz for a mixture and announced that the match would be a match level. The match was brutal and one of the best levels I saw, but Joey Mercury's face was a general mess. Johnny Nitro didn't even look at her boyfriend, they just continued if nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal didn't do anything during the match except people hit with a few shots levels. By the end of London and Kendrick kept their names. Everywhere on the show Kane won the MVP in a good inferno match while placing a MVP costume for fire. Chris Benoit declined Chavo Guerrero in a good match, Gregory Helms won Jimmy Wang Yang keeping WWE Wareweight in a solid effort. But the main event was a total aggression, King Booker played with Finlay by taking John Cena and Batista. The move was shoddy and no one concerned who Batista has taken to his girlfriend. Total results: Kane failed MVP in the inferno match. Paul London and Brian Kendrick kept WWE Team names against Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a level match. Chris Benoit won Chavo Guerrero to keep American rank in a good match. Gregory Helms won Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the Championship championship. Boogeyman beat Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> Undertaker won Mr Kennedy in the final match game. John Cena and Batista failed King Booker and Finlay in a weak match. <br /> <br /> Total Bridge - B
