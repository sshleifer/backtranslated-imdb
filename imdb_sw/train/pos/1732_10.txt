"Sandra, Making a Woman" is a film between exploitation, and for two reasons: (1) the best and non-dynamic performance, and Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was the assistant to the project. These two talents, both of which have been beaten down, make "Sandra" film which should be seen. Another important feature of the film's success is its authenticity - nothing fake or "Hollywood" about this film set in California. It's really a piece of life. The typical house that Sandra is living at the beginning of the film, clothes are worn by character, where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart blowing at her door, and Sandra is sitting in bed without making- while Digart is trying to buy her cosmetics, looking at it as if she just got up (but even so good), weirdo guilty who takes a love to love him while wearing a bra, one room room that Sandra may - all of these films are quite realistic, and as such, a viewer is given in a small Sandra world from beginning to time one becomes interested in it and wants to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with skill and respect and leaves with many classes. This video can easily be easily lost in the hands, and it could leave any of the usual sexual commands, but the Garver / Gale team sees that "Sandra" is not just making a woman but making a film The best.
