I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered that one of the first films that I really loved was that it was not an act of act or comedy. So, in my later years I decided to look at it again and see if it was just pride or there was something in the movie. To my surprise, the movie took place all my expectations. It's a good movie. Feelings of good quality, other jokes, good songs (not very big, and that explains why I didn't remember music) and all in all use in my time. I was surprised because the last films from my childhood that I had seen again did not happen even my small movie's movie and yet this movie, which I saw first in the second grade, made me cry today as I did. Perhaps that is because my dog ​​died soon and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why the filmmakers are filing (that's money, of course). Yes, there is a continuous brightness. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. Movie itself is fun and wise. So do not get off with stupid people who always seek bad things in life, because there is nothing good, and this movie gets 10 not because it's perfect. It gets only 10 because it made me feel.
