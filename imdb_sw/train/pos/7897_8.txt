At first you see this film does not look like a big one. After all the Bette Davis movies and just 166 votes on IMD and the 6,5 level should be worse. But the movie turned out to be pleasant and original surprise. <br /> <br /> would at first expect that this is typically every model '30 film for formulaic love story but the movie is amazingly well constructed and has a common and original story, which also helps make this film one very good look . <br /> <br /> The story is carried out by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They were helped by the cast of so many characters but the movies involve only two of them. Their behavior is characterized by an unfamiliar and wise story of love writing which also makes an exciting work as well. It makes this film a delightful little comic to watch, ie perfectly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite short (more than one hour long), which means that the story does not waste any time on I would like the lines of plot, development and characters. It makes the movie also a fast paced fast, which helps make this film one fully watchable for today's standards too. It does not perhaps makes the movie a bit of one easy once but this never goes at the expense of its leisure or fun. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful beautiful romantic comedy that deserves to be seen and more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
