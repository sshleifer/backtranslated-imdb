This is good - good work, sets, clothes, music - but all the story itself. I wonder if there are more views of this movie - certainly one of the best of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It is also a good movie to see briefly with the "Random harvest" which contain a crisis the opening of the opening / WAR / WWII - the middle-aged, WWI unknown English WWI officer is in hospital towards the end of the war, with a shell shock and full amnesia without any idea of ​​his name, origin, or anywhere he was - he shows that he is a very rich man who is planned - "he is healed", he will not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br /> But there is the end of the film. "<br /> <br /> My appreciation for all those who participated in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (an amazing and amazing option), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. br>> This lasts with you forever.
