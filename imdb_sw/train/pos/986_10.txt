If you would like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", '01, you would like to act like a boy who has never even had a break in life with a wind around Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold. Alvin Sanders has many eyes of the FBI to watch with the wind to find bricks in the jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 Series Series, decides to focus on the poor Alvin and use him as called Fish Hook to attract criminals. There are lots of lots, dramas, cold bloodshed and the best places of film and many expensive cars have been sent to Yard Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were the best characters in this film and it was a good entertainment through the whole picture.
