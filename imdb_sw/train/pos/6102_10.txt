I had to give this film 10 just because it made many films made by black and FAILED MISERABLY viewers. This film did not exist with all the images of adultery, and it also flew fake groups, journalists, and bad language. In order to explore several relationships between doctors, African Americans, and African female sexual relationships on a new and exciting level. I was so surprised by the films of the illuminated light and some of the most beautiful and heavy issues. The film will encourage them to be happy and sad at the same time. I saw it at the Boston film also. It started with AMC Loews Boston and I believe that this film makes it a great audience. Black people (and everyone else) would like a film like this - if the industry was SMART enough to make it out there! <br /> <br /> As an additional - like your doctor, living, medical student, organized student, married to a doctor, has a family doctor, have a doctor in the family, or know the doctor's time - they also like this film. It showed a legacy and practice in a real and life-style that was well known by doctors, residents, and medical students who watched the film. Dennis Cooper completely live in the local medicine - so definitely spent his knowledge / experience with the film and it looks so much.
