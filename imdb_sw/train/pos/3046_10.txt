All the best films "encourage" directly to flick video video. I was afraid that the "Gladiator" was not a very good film, because I didn't see any film that had anything similar to anything on Roman shelves for new months. Then I saw the full sacrifice of Full Moon, Demonicus. I am a fan of the series of Puppetmaster of Full Moon, and Gold Dolls, but I've never seen one of their fake non-fiction movies. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> The history of Demonicus happens to a group of fighters in the Alps mountains. One of the camps, James, finds a cave with an ancient gladiator residue, and feels encouraged to remove a hat from the corpse and try it. He becomes himself, and, like Tyrinus of pepper, he has to kill his friends to revive the dead, who is a real Tyranno. In fact, like many Monthly film, this has little or no budget. Sometimes, editing and trends were very common I would like to swear I was looking at Blair's witch project. Experiment to eliminate ingredients and heads remind me of a skit of Monty Python. Weapons, though it looks real, look realistic plastic-y. It seems like this was done by a group of friends with a digital camcorder at the weekend. In fact, there is nothing wrong with these films, just don't lose this expecting the technical hub. It seems like there is an experimental study of the script too, because, even though Tyrannus does not do as a gladiator to the end, at least speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All are leaving, I really enjoyed this film. It's not like a puppet film to kill, perhaps, but the Full Moon still opens! The only thing that was despicable when I was no Month Full Videozone at the end!
