Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I did not watch this film for the last five years I saw it. Magic still. There is something that certainly has this newsletter to feel, songs and all the secondary features please. Criminals in the form of sisters sisters are evil and evil. Then there is more magical than all the Disney, the mouse makes dress and well knows others. For the rest of the four Disney movies of all princess are beautiful but this is a wonderful magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh and in fact, Cinderella is amazing as the main character in the movie. If you think about Disney movies they may lose their charm. And Elene Wood and other movie has to feel so, you just can't help but smile <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that the dream come true. In fact in the real world some believers are hoper's. In this film is more magical when his rainbow comes exciting. <br /> <br /> And in fact some are ... Cinderella
