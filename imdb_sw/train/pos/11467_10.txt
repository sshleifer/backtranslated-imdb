This is the best film I have come for a long time. Not only the best film of its kind (school shot) The way Ben Coccio (director) decided that the film was very good. He did it using the young actors who were still attending high school. She gave birth in the rooms of the office rooms and use the actors of real parents as their parents in the film. Also actors also photographed using camcorders to make it more visible as a video diary. That is modern (if it is actually a word) There are small, however, for example when Cal calls a gun (?) Land rover rover range (or vice versa, It has been a little time since I've seen it)
