Footlight Parade is one of the best 1930 music comedy songs. The snappy script with all the stars including Jimmy Cagney, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler makes this film cut off on others. Directed and selected by the innovative skill of Busby Berkeley, this film will give you from ear to ear from beginning to end. Busby, of course, is an unknown master of Hollywood music and "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Address 42" for his credit (like Drums Director). Footlight Parade is faced with hundreds of very attractive klaria girls, Berkeley's trademark. The number of drums described was shot by only one camera and Busby was the first director of the film next to the players. Its deficit on shapely feet and shots "back" is shown here. The overall effect is strong and ringing. Our child Jimmy Cagney has Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short production of music sessions that took place in movie movies to attract viewers before talkies are shown. She is surrounded by corrupt partners, spy company, and gold partner. Although Cagney was strong in vaudeville, this is the first film that showed his talent to play. Joan Blondell was not remembered as a cricket of Cagney, a lovestruck secretary. And Ruby Keeler is as beautiful, as is common. The movie is increasing in number three of the best productions, "Honeymoon Hotel", "Water Water", and "Shanghai Lil", each one is a hub and not likely to be modified in today's Hollywood The so-called "special effects" have taken place in the creation of the movie. Underneath Under Claudia: Lighter and failure, and some of the best music producers have put on cell cells. During the Depression you are very happy.
