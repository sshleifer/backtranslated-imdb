'Presque Rien' is a very beautiful picture of a young French girl experience. To explore all the exhibitions and to preach, it is a wonderful natural, very fabulous film, sounded by the feel of the city of the sea where the action takes place, never can be pleasant but it is always true. If anything is too close, for there is little in the usual way of conspiracy, just events from life. But the lack of normal tension tends to count down as much as possible in the most attractive world. 'Presque Rien' could be a lively live film; but its simple humanity serves well compared to the preview of the pre-conceived ceremony or a brief opinion that often finds treatment for this topic. Value check.
