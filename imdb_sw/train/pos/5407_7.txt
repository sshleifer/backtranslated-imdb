I've been enjoying Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, both are corny, almost in some places and indeed, even though they are aimed at young children they are too old in some areas to be able to store them for information, "Hey, lift, it's a children's movie. , "but all that is, is not yet the best pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are so and I am very happy. This is as interesting as the last three, and it is certainly interesting. It has some good and touching intervals since it is a delightful introduction, clean of Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best movie of Pokemon, but I'm enjoying more than the third phase, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is just fun, it doesn't matter, the family popcorn is happy and should not be considered anything more, nothing less. This film has high scores and interests, especially around the top / end, like making all the tests, and the characters, when enough less than the previous three, I thought, still interesting and interesting. These films are the lowest and most critical of the four-dimensional dimensions, and it is not recommended.
