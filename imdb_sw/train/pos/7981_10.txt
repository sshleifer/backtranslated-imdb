In Mexico City, a former CIA criminologist and now an evil man John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is employed by businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendations of his former friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be a guardian of his daughter Little Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pass the transformation of the creasy winter, making it live and forgiving again, and feels great love for her. The girl who was kidnapped by Creasy has understood that she was murdered by criminals, vowing to kill everyone involved in the execution. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is near the hub, and certainly will be classic in the future. The story is excellent, not corny and although having a 146 minute race race, the viewer does not feel when passing. The cast is composed of the best actors and actress, their performances are the best, Denzel Washington show, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The movie has a very short time, and the screen has wonderful lines. I loved myself when the character of Christopher Walken describes Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that special Creasey is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who said that "Man on Fire" is one of the best films, if not the best, of the year in this type. Voting for me is ten. Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of Revenge")
