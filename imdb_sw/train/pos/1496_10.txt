I was happy to catch this film on late television late and it was my interest through the whole picture. This is a very strange, yet still amazing English look at the house, with the evil decorative look and exhausting furniture and rooms that make you wonder what anyone would want to rent this house or even yourself. There are four (4) stories related to this house, and everyone living at home meets all the problems. You will see a beautiful lake with a pond around the house and also singing a sweet bird, but do not let your fool, there is a panic everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80" provides a great performance as one of a home-based person and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and his daughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid) makes a good story together, her daughter for some reason likes to read WITCHCRAFT books! If you like exciting, awesome and amazing films, with lots of surprises, this is FILM FOR YOU !!!!
