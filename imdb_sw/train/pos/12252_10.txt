I really enjoyed this "Emma" mode. I've seen it many times and always expect to see it again. Although it is only 107 minutes, most of the novels and small squares were built in a satisfactory way. All characters are shown well. A lot of discussion comes directly from the novel without a joke joke added like in Emma Thompson's Sense and Attention. As a guest, I enjoy the full diction of actors. Set and dress was beautiful. I see this version completely with the text of "1995 of Pride and Prejudice" but 1995 by the producer and the reporter of the pictures were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job showing "Emma" who Jane Austen said she could create no heroin but would like. She is a snobbish but has only young people not knowing that she still likes. Mark Strong was also very good at Mr. Knightley's show, not a convenient place, I think, although they have no charisma displayed by Mr Darcy of Colin Firth in Beauty and Engagement. Even the last event (the vintage festival) that does not occur in the novel offers an appropriate end except when it shows that Emma is cold and unhappy with Frank Churchill where in the novel he had been successful with her, even telling him that it would be fun of duplicity, if in its state. Incredible departure from another trust is shown in the film. I see that dress is more beautiful and more elaborate than in other versions of Jane Austen's novels.
