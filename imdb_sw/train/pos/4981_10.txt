I personally feel this film is a rare treasure. It's not just the beginning of the work of Shirley Temple, but a rare look on how our society has changed. You understand, some things that we see today as sex, then it will seem innocent. For example, parents of children in the film along with many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this as just an adult imaging. Many people did not think of anyone looking at children for sex, except for young boys who longed for girls. For them it was not sex. Remember this was before having internet, TV, etc ... Most sex crimes were not brought out. Sometimes there will be a whisper on the child and "funny uncle". But often that was all that happened. It's very sad. But it's sad today, for even I could see this film as anything but what was planned, innocent and interesting. When I saw such a Shirley dance and the boys' eye shook the ball, I felt a little worried. I must recall this time it was done! The children did not know how sex was. Parents knew that, all of the children in the movies and those who watched it. Imagine it may not have even entered their mind. With the eyes of old adults at the time, this was no longer sex then as Shirley was playing the house. Even today children will enter the beauty contest, most of them are too old to mature, for three years. However the child is only pretending. I did not accuse the child of wanting to act as an adult. Or old movies showing this. With all honesty, our media has done so many things that look back then seem sick and wrong. This can sometimes be better. But I really believe this movie is not one of them. It provides a rare look of innocence, which we have lost for a long time.
