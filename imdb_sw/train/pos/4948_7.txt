This is a very well-designed film that explores the landscape, and gives each viewer something different that takes from them. The cluster is simple: the famous actor Morgan Freeman decides to research the next role by visiting the shop and looking at people. He takes special interest to the farmer in "10 or Low items" (Paz Vega), who finds the presence of a strong, powerful, and brave. Two players play softly and bring a strong direction for characters in the study of behavior. Not a common study of behavior; everyone represents the whole world. The life of the cashier is connected to the "real world" sharp and bitter, while the rituals are widely found in his extraordinary life that can not work as simple as remembering phone numbers. He readily recognizes the face when he talks to the people, and the whole point of finding real people shows that he is not one of them. But not only is a real-headed actor for his work; we see the back process too. Several characters recognize "He," and mention how he encouraged them with his film roles. The favorite songs of the cashier "Al Pasar of Barca," about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers rather to pay (ie: to do honest work) for a boat, she could not be well chosen. It resembles the attitude of Vega, the only shopkeeper who has any intelligence or desire, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (That is all the purpose, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It is an unfamiliar film, perhaps by being beaten. If you don't have a slow sense of slow and a "chat" method, this movie will enjoy it. The characters are quite different, and the effectiveness of the action makes them attractive. Good hour.
