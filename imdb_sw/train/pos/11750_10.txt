See this in the theater in '86 and fell out of my seat laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beyrouth?" ... "Beirut ... he is the best ball of baseball who has ever lived." You know how it will stop but it has a good time to get there. Practice exercises are very funny but the best place can be one while Jack and Reno are trying to watch the game of Falcons v Vikings on Monday night to try dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have much fun with this and it's so bad that it is ignored as a comedy on comedy.
