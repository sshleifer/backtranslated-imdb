This fascinating documentary tells a wonderful story of a journey to take the children of Tibetani blind to the Himalayas; but also the competitiveness of humanity between two wonderful people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the web team (see) leading children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for the poor Quettians, who agrees with the journey but finally has doubts about how it goes. At a certain level, Sabine does not only know the mountainous philosophy (with emphasis on graduation); he probably has the right to recognize the difference between the goals of the hills and the desires of the children but his accuracy with his accuracy makes the person difficult to listen to, especially if he has a better quality. In the past for this (good failure), we gain insight into the lives of children themselves. I enjoyed the film, though it offers a clear message to promote it - although it spells a fight, the film describes how amazing all who live in it. But it is difficult to refuse and evaluate it, even if it is presented to the viewer regardless.
