Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demon. I read other 'comments' on this show with the message board and people just don't get. There is nothing visible on the T.V. it's an accident. Most money, time and work are put in the production of T.V. for there are mistakes. This view is foolish because Sarah wanted to be stupid. Show this is young because Sarah wanted to be young. I thought the joke was good and displaying the theme as well as the other number of music is very amazing. It's a lot like the House of Pee-Wee's House for destruction, slacker's twenty-something object of glue, Future photos of America from Basin. Sent is awesome. Events and actions are good. I hope that this show is successful since Comedy Central did not allow David to use his show. Who is Sarah's sister? She is not on the list thrown on the home page of the show. I would like to see her stand. Does anyone know about their date of coming up or DVDs that can go out there?
