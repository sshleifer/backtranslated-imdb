This is the best movie of all times! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's, only once it appeared on the Bulgarian TV, and I liked it once (I was 14 years old). 25 years later I bought it in a video tape, and a few months ago it appeared on the DVD in Bulgaria. I live with this film 35 years already, and so make all my friends and family. My son was a boy when he saw for the first time, and he liked it once, too (and this is a generation that just watched Hollywood movies and not talking or understanding Russia at all!). What makes this work of Danelia special? It is hard to say, because it is difficult to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch many of these films with the same joy as they did at first. I can't remember any such film, no matter what millions of cost or how much spent ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
