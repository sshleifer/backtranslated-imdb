I have seen this film twice with my favorite young people. This should be a religious fave! The best line, "Your dress is very cool!" says Prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a mother of you. I also like the 1950s and cars and motorcycles. General melancholy is very departure from the usual swashbuckler. She tries to stay cool, but can not hide her love for the princess-to-be story story. His umbrella is not a mirror (original story), but Cinderella loses it but gets it from the successor of the throne. My only complaint is that it does not show more and it seems impossible to find. We hope Blockbuster or Amazon will begin to store this once soon.
