Vanilla Sky is the 2001 movie remake of Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, the humanitarian and emotional version. Tom Cruise has David Aames, an example of selfishness that takes the feelings of other people for granted, and thinks himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, the best of David, and in many ways, just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, a boyfriend of Brian who accompanied him on David's birthday. Cameron Diaz plays with Julie Gianni, a regular bed of David. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions, with their results, make the Vanilla Sky one of the emotional, and the most complicated attractions. I can no longer explain this plot, because it is more compelling, less than knowing. Ignore all those who call this film also combine to follow. If you're targeting, you can't be confused. Movies are very difficult, but not mixed. And in my opinion, one of the best movies found.
