I don't know whether it was right or wrong, but I read other comments before watching a moment. I say I disagree with many views or problems people have had. <br /> <br /> As the first time the "director / producer of Lone Wolf", I would like to see things that I might want, not necessarily from pro, but for people just getting wet feet like me. If this fact is also from the first timer, as I read it, I enjoy the effort. There was a comment on music.I thought it was very good for a piece. Someone says it's kind of droned aside for a while, but I have seen that the attraction of the project without (us) must be aware of, and when he pulled out the gun out with the guitar started items, it was like we knew there were trains on tracks, but to realize it's just now moving. Yes there is a clip of 180 degree / piece there, but shi * occurs. For anyone else see the dirty shirt of Hugh turning white (near end, rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind the movies! Give the child a rest for God! All in all I think was very good. Only 2 items that I could mention were not mentioned - Do not walk in the brass brass brass and camera, and I would show the splatter on the first shots on the shot, still people didn't need to know what it was. My experience so far has taught me that it is not difficult to make a film, it takes time to learn how to do it, then when you do, and then get more time to think of all the information you need to shoot before making a call. "publish time!" IMHO, it seems like the director / author Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is actually his first report card, I would give him a "A". Some others report to the head office in whuppin '.
