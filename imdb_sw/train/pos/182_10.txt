If you are not migrated to the world of Gundam, this is a good place to start. If you have been burned on Star Wars or Star Trek, here is a powerful, true-scientist series that can be inserted. It's not the story of a boy-saving-world-in-giant boy that you can expect, but rather hard, emotional forcing a space war game where the line of "good" and "bad" boys are arranged less than different. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young man who lived in an empty area. She uses her days to talk about Suits and playing with her friends. During this series, Al became a friend of the "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. At the end, Al little learns hard lessons about the warfare and suffering and sacrifices required. I liked this OAV series, and its cool sandwiches, including stories, and visible behavior. I recommend this series for anyone who really loves SF anime, or for those who think anime is just entertainment or entertainment.
