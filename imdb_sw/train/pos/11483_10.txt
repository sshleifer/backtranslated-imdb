Something that causes this film to be scary is a way that shows Andre and Calvin as a (size) ordinary boys. These are obviously not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they move around the camera, forget the written lines, etc.. They are just making a video as a role to show 'victims' how usually their lives were. Their parents think only boys are a home video film. By observing the attacks of other children in their schools, Andre and Calvin are learning what they do not want to do and inform (usually in the form of this "Old House") of any potential 'Andres and Calvins' who can watch this video as make bombs, get weapons, and do not enter before Zero (day of attack).
