Before watching this film I thought that this film would be as good as Flashpoint because before watching this Flashpoint movie was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I had previously watched. In addition to the sexual experiences I was desperate, I thought the sexual events of Dreamquest would be as good as Flashpoint of sex scenes but I was desperate. Except for Asia Carrera sex, any sex scene in this film does not make me feel good (you know what I'm saying). Jenna Jameson is not doing the same kind of sexual experiences of what he can. Felecia and Stephanie Swift are two of the most beautiful girls who hire me and also away from sexual events. Even though it's its adult movie but if you are away because of sex, this movie is very good. If the size of the adult filming experience witnessed this film it has actually raised adult filming rates. Stories, acting, leadership, sets, makeups and other technical elements of this film are very great. The actors of this film have done a very good acting, all have done a good job. Dreamquest is definitely raising the bar of quality of adult movies.
