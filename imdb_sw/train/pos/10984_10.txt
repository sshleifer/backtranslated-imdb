One question that should be asked immediately is: What? Would this film be made if the women in it were not aunt and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> Answer is: Maybe not. But, thanks, they are (or were) cousins ​​and aunt Jackie. This letter of the Maysles brothers on the existence of (man could not call it life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr., and his daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same appeal of trains - you don't want to look but you should. Big Edith and Little Edie live in one of the most wonderful homes in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly deteriorating around them. The once beautiful garden is now a jungle. A good oil painter depends on the wall (with a stool on the floor behind them) and their beautiful pictures as young women living in space around the walls and covers old newspapers. Living alone together for many years has dropped many barriers between two women but they have built up others. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. The costume of Edie is a pair of shorts and the nose of the panty pulled on them with pieces and pieces of clothing wrapped around and around her head. As Edith says "Edie is still good at 56." And in fact he is. There are times when he is near the light and all women show the beauty that was in the past. It is a low level of sexual tension. Their way of eating is (to be honored) wonderful. Ice cream spread over crackers. The dinner part for Edith's birthday Sandwiches' Wonder Mkate was used in beautiful and plastic containers. While it is not meaningful in their world; as Edie says "I don't have any time." Their relationship with men is amazing. Edie feels like Edith destroyed her experiments in fun. He says "If you can't find someone to recommend you, you can also be dead." That Edith responds "I'll take a dog any day." It is clear that Edith does not see her role in the lack of a male Edie. At the beginning of the film says "France fell but Edie was not." Sometimes it's hard to hear exactly what it says. Two women are talking at the same time and often competing. <Br /> <br /> There is a wonderful relationship with animals in all films, Edie brings raccoons to a bed of water and Wonder Bread and cat's food. <br /> <br /> One time Edie says "Exhibition of the aristocracy is responsible." But they seem unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a hard film to watch but well worth the effort.
