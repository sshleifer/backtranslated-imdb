The film begins with a family that all went in a different way to their young daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very fond of Joe MacLeod, (Zack). Mother plays with Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne) who walks suddenly with her daughter and Zack doing and then all the problems seem to be high. Jill Dunne has a husband who is going to travel or stay away from home very often. There are also serious problems occurring when the family travels to a camping camp where Olivia's daughter does not like and cannot cope with sleep and requires a tent to be observed outside of all the bugs. In many ways, Olivia performs a better performance like young Mancuso, (Richard Grant) gives a great responsibility as a hotel owner. This film will allow you to think about how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with fear and fear. Enjoy
