This is a docu festival that is not suitable for new land, reconstructing all images and is not realistic. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of World War in 1918 is not a commitment but a weapon. However it is announced as surrender. For example, European news vendors were not (and did not) hit the headlines as they made their paper. However, this American custom has been employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not find the German eagle until after taking power but there is on the lecture as Hitler announced one of its winding winder. In fact, most of this desperate production has little more than Hitler's talks. The movie also develops the story that the porch of the putsch beer was published in Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle shows the best of his lesson. But his cast is enough to quickly and often however. This view only depends on the first part. One can only hope the second will be better but don't use it.
