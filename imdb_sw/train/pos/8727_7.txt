The life of Bugs is a good film. But to me, it doesn't compare completely with movies like Toy Story and things. Don't make a mistake, I loved this film, but it was not as good as Toy Story. Film has displays, laughter, and others that Toy Story had. But the film does not feel like ... I don't know, but I thought it was still a good film. <br /> <br /> life of bugs ... I don't want to say this, it's a film that I don't remember. I saw years ago. Of course, I haven't seen the story of Toy in years, but I still remember. I should not explore this film, but I am. I give you a finger, though not the best work Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> Life of the bug: *** / ****
