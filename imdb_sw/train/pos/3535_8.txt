** WARNING - DO NOT USE! ** <br /> First, I would like to say that I loved this game. I got for Christmas after two months of leaving my parents. I am glad to have done that. First, I would like to say that one player was very good. The first level is one of the best in the game, when you are in London, and some bad people destroy it by catching the prime minister's daughter. Of course you should save him, and it is quite large, but you should probably take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think also the funniest part, is when you are in the airplane, and the people repeat Big Ben. Just prepare a jet-packet most loyal rocket launcher and blast clock clocks with enemies down. Click fun! All positive standards are very good, but they are very short. There are four mini-levels that you can open, and that is one of the cuts, because only the first two are very happy, and the last two opening is' kill the 25 goals, 'i mean, c' mon! We have many buttons to open this message and the last bonus message is quite bad! <br /> <br /> Most player, I and some of my friends agree, it's very good and it's challenging, even if there are no bots. Halo did not have any bots but it is still some good player games! You can be the burden of the wicked, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without going through their attitude. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be repeat and extra missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is an odd picture, but not very often). Player - 10/10 (do not need to comment, it's just fine, you can get a car in airplanes and cars). Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (The only level I go back is Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I offer this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> It can be a little improvement, but it's still good.
