On His Body Death was a very good movie. It was an honorable and entertaining, while it was still nice to be beautiful. you can pass the first 20 minutes though, the movie begins to get more interesting. I don't see how this movie was bad. It rating is just too little.I could be dealt with 5.5, but 4.8? Also, giving this film 1 is embarrassing.
