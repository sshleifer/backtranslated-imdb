If a person who has never been into sports, it seems like it would be difficult for me to get into football (or if we Americans call it so hard, soccer) -theme "Bend It Like Beckham". But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and his WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) like to play football (yes, I will tell the UK and international way) and just beg football player David Beckham. But the traditional tribal parents of Jeshinder do not accept (his mother offers an early definition of football in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was a kind of cliche in that sense, but you have gotta love this movie! And if like me, you're going to this film without knowing the definition of "bend" on soccer ... don't worry, movie spells (I'd never hear about David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley has hit a great deal: a few months after "BILB" came out of the country, made stars in the "Caribbean Pirates": "Curse of Black Pearl".
