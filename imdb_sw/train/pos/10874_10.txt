I must admit, I was expecting something quite different from my first 'Kata' last night, although he was happy with the unexpected efforts of Australia. I am a true fan of truth as they come, and found 'Cut' is not only the best of Australian species that has ever been produced, but one of the great animation / comedy films of the late. My only concern is that ordinary listeners cannot take on many of the comedic elements - the film was not the most clever in the program but it made me laugh every attempt trying to resemble every possible kind of fear that could . I am sure this was the intention of humorâ€¦ this hope was intended to humor. <br /> <br /> And of course, there was a year. <br /> <br /> The use of 'improved' garden shears was beauty - instead of expected stabs and slashes. In short, there was a huge amount of different types and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to enjoy even the worries of these suitable films. Both Kylie Minogue (short of her appearance) and Molly Ringwald were just another reason to see the film - all these exhibitions were extraordinary, with Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in the role brilliant as a jokey teacher. <br /> <br /> For all, I imagine this film is one of the best products over the last few years or years ago, with a good / practical satire - toungue-cheek until the end. <br /> <br /> Love it. Go see!
