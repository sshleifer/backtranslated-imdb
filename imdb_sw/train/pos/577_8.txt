This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Footage is amazing, regular. He also received Oscar for better photography, and so it is okay. I have many movies in the collection of my films and several more I have seen instead, and not many of them are better or even the same as well beaten like this. <br /> <br /> It's unique and general movie. Sent are strict and do a great job in showing their characters. We follow their expectations for volunteers, and involve them very emotionally. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot of this film why it represents, and how to show it. I recommend to heat
