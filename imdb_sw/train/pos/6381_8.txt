"Atlantis" is a new and accurate step for the Disney feature. It is a good choice to make a film for stories like as "Atlantis". I did not have any expectations for this film, but after looking at it, I don't understand why this film received good views. Even in my country the advisers were not positive. Atlantis is not a perfect movie, but it is still one of the largest Disney websites, even though I doubt that this movie will find the history of "Disney classic". Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this movie of physics was led by the same directors as "Beauty and Animal" and "Hunchback" (therefore Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to overcome their movie traits of monster, he, I'm just sandy). Well, no matter how much. "Atlantis" is a lively, exciting and enjoyable film. Even this film is a feature of the PG testing point, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, do not kill me for writing this, she she). <br /> <br /> The story is a little predictable, but it does not destroy the movie. Animation book comic is suitable for film and keep safe from the usual Disney-style. It's color, dark and deep. Deep Canvas systems are very amazing. Movies are also funny sometimes, even I am more giggled than laughing through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very interesting, but unfortunately they do not have enough time to know everyone, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The score of James Newton Howard is quite great. It's amazing and foreign. (SPOILER) Most amazing about this film is how they make the sound of the language of the Atlantean original, tribal and true. It's really amazing (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> Script is solid and well written, but there are still unanswered questions in the story. But luck they do not have much of them. So you are private, listen to the consultants and look at "Atlantis", because it awaits you ...
