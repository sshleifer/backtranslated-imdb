I recently looked at this, but when I started I had no idea of ​​what the concept was, what the topic ..... in short - I didn't know what it was. It was a document, it was a common comedy ..... Well, it was NI. It started a bit slower, but I think that's because I had no idea what kind of program I was looking at. But it soon caught me in. The part I saw was Robert Wuhl speaking truth and fiction in history. Especially how we (amerika) learn history that is not really true - and how we should learn what we did. He did it in such a way to keep the viewer completely, interested. I have learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how this kind of software can be. I would like to see this taken as a series of HBO. I believe it can be as fun and effective with different topics - especially if it is "taught" in kind like this.
