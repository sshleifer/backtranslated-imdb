I don't even say what about this film. is just one of a few of the movies made that I would consider the will. trying to talk a plot or a performance or technical information on this film will be in plain words "like playing about architecture". it completely affects the nail on the head in a way that catches those moments in life that leads us and then run from us never to be experienced again. this looks like a film version of the character of charlie kaufman in Adaptation of the film that wants to write. The latter is left open and controversial, no fun ends here, just a mystery. there are no good lessons of life, only two horny and intelligent children are trying to feel enough and uncomfortable feelings ...... romantic love. 10 out of 10 are looking at a special woman and suggesting to a stranger ................
