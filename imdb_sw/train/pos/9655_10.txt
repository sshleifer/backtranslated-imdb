Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best film made ... But it's better than most of you. I haven't seen a homo-themed film better than this. <br /> <br /> You Americans are accustomed to watching the story of the story, and the open start, development and results. But European films are a short description, but it makes you think and feel. Most of you didn't understand the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this is not to show us the simple "summer love movie", and commercial characters who "fall in love and live happily ever". The holiday season and the beach are just history, and this film is directed to every young boy who can feel recognized by these boys. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you don't know this movie, because of 3 parts, it showed as flashbacks. At this time 3 is: - During the winter in Pornichet, they meet and love. - After a year and a half living together with Nantes, Mathieu does not go to a psychiatrist. He is trying to commit suicide, and Cedric brings him to the hospital. Later, he seems to talk to a psychologist to find out why he did it. - The last part, is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, during winter, alone .. think about how his life has changed, how his life is, and trying to find it. It is possible that some people could not understand all of this, because all events have been mixed between them. But however, as I said before ... this is not a pleasant movie. If someone wants to see the meat, then we have the Belami film. Something nearby, what it wants to show us, is how cruel it can be to life, to a young man who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave home, and try to live a kind of life that he thought could bring him happiness. But what seemed to be perfectly at the beginning. Later is not the same as he thought, and worried, and feel that he has lost his way of life. He is lost and does not know what he wants to do, or what makes him happy. Finally, she becomes sad and is trying to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, is it funny? What? Not a pleasant movie. Very hot events? only a few .. but this is not a entertainment film. Do all about feeling ... friendship, love, joy, happiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel familiar with the life and problems of Mathieu, and that's what the director wanted to do. of the violence of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo-themed movie ever.
