As I remember, Ira Gershwin, the singer and brother of George, gave Gershwin's catalog to this film and was hit by producers. In many ways, it was the most common music of 50 films and independent Unit from MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli for a lot of help from Gene Kelly. All Broadway music teams but, in my opinion, George himself was among the authors many US, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two male music films (One guess for another?) And I think that her casting was doubtful. But, I think all others need clarification: Oscar Levant was a man known at his time and, as a real friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this film. He was a skilled piano player and a skilled singer and also known as neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as every day, struggles for himself. <br /> Leslie Caron was not known this time and was a French "gamin" type. Dancer talented, was never a real beauty. George Guetary who plays part of Maurice Chavalier, oops, means Henri Baurel, was a Greek and not French but certainly is more than the same as the French boulevardier even as very small for that part. Gene's hoofer sound is used here but Guetary has many voice tools. Although Gene was the best place elsewhere, in fact, in the "Singin" in the Rain "where his character is more calculated, even here he seems to be a heel something else (He, not for anything, was thrown as Joey's first leg in Pal Joey. , the music of Broadway.) I was very unhappy with the "I Got Rhythm" its location and children who are rarely seen as planned in my opinion. But clearly the film is a clear ballet at the end of the film according to the music of the head and the sets and clothing in the styles of beautiful French entrepreneurs. Gene and Oscar, like artists, and I don't think music numbers have been started as they can be but, on the other hand, Gershwin's music is very popular in this film. they think ed to be) and sa mono is good but not small.
