Okay. As you can see this is one of my favorite if not a favorite film. This is a game of character which is quite hilarious. The main character is a business person who is stuck in "one thing, different ideas". She sees a woman looking at the melancholy out of the dance studio window from her train every day and wonder about it and decides to know more about it. He decides to join the dance class just to know that he is not a teacher. From there they tie with four other players and learn to enjoy playing and also know about a wonderful woman. <br /> <br /> No free sex (or any) involved, how a small group of people learn how friendship is organized and developed. This movie was made by Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and a new one at the time of interesting no place of fun like the original. Movie has never been big in America because it was not eligible for Oscars since it was announced on a TV in Japan (the movie cannot be released on TV or is not eligible for Oscar selection). It won many awards in Japan for the best film, cast, director etc. for their "Oscar" awards.
