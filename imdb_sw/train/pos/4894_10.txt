I grew up during the music found in this film. What a good time to music and play! My only complaint is that I was too young to go to USO and nightclubs. I think it looks like I live in the past, (I have a good memory) why is it a bad thing for that? World War II was a terrible time, but the music was concerned. The death of Glenn Miller was a great disappointment for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was the best; sounds! I don't know how I missed this movie. My main reason for this definition is to identify the modern generation with the alternative to the music of Rap and New Age, which is my hatred. Please check this film and give it a chance!
