"Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" There is no higher there to compare with the complex solution of "The Sopranos". Each and every character has layers on a layer of full truth, completely and completely three dimensional. We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simple example of good and evil, he is evil. Soprano is an exciting, bright, and fascinating protagonist ever since. If you are faced with a major challenge as a viewer, and have ever changed to your feelings about entertainment, see "The Sopranos". I despise anyone to sit down and look at the first part of Season 1, and does not want to continue the series. Each season is quite brilliant in its own way. The DVD is important for any accumulation of **** for out of 4
