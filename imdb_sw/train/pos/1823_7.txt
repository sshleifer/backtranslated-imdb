I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I have never watched it after that. One day I was a child and my cousin had never seen all the Dogs of Heaven so we rented all the movies and watched them together today and loved these movies. Many records have come to look at this film and I must admit I even cried a little. I am 22 years old and the end is still getting me. All Dogs Go to Heaven is one of the most interesting films and I have trembled with this rating of 5.8, I thought this movie would bring good memories to others as well. I accept the animation was normal but the story is charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog that is killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But Charlie wants to take revenge on the earth for a watch that can't stop focusing or that's the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look forward to Carface and spy on how Carface gets all his money, he has a little girl who talks with animals and finds who will win the community. Charlie takes a girl, Ann-Marie, and makes fake promises to get money. But she concludes learning that maybe she should put Ann-Marie first before her when Carface returns to her for revenge. <br /> <br /> All the Dogs Go to Heaven is the perfect film of the family, not the Disney, but this is the best film of the family to watch. Not to mention that it's just fine and touch. I know it's ridicule and some people call me mad, but this film for me when I was a child made me believe that dogs have a spirit. How could they? They are very loving, and I think I will ask again. But however, I would just recommend this movie to anyone, it's an enjoyable movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
