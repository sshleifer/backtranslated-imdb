Screwball faces a romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is open to love with all the women in his picture - he respects - but Audrey Hepburn is (usually) to put a mark in front of others because, after all, he is the king Bogdanovich perhaps fell in love with in the movie 30 years before. He draws him to the closest, gets the signature between him and ben Gazzara of boiling / boiling, and allows his room to stimulate. The relationship of love made during the film is fast and exciting, although I was exhausted by John Ritter's television. Campen Colleen, Dorothy Stratten, and the earthly, physical-physical Patti Hansen both enjoy watching. But in fact it's the Hepburn valentine and he drives it completely. *** from ****
