I recently (May 2008) discovered that this childhood childhood was available as a DVD. Although I have seen a great movie since then (at the end of the 70th (I was 10 years old in 1978), this third period, the bottom of the budget is still strong. what I am happy is that I now looked at my 10-year-old daughter, and she finds the same as I remembered from behind: Music of creepy (had to hold my hand, though born and looking at LotR and Resident Evil), ever changing the theory who was a sinner, and also complained about the sounds of the show from the time before Norway discovered the difference between acting acting and filming. The series was carried out in Norway, and it is still worth checking.
