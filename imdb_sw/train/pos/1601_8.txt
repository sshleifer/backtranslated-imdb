It is a very simple live and very charming film. There was a time when I could see why Cher won the Academy Award for the Best Player, but there were times when I wondered why Glenn Close did not win Fatal Attraction. However, Oscar and the Golden Globe won, and the chosen BAFTA Cher played Loretta Castorini, a simple woman who had a paid job who was asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry her. He promises that he will return to the month, as his mother is ill, so he means when he needs to find many families to attend a possible wedding. The only problem is, when he sees Johnny's brother who is not supported by Ronny (Golden Globe has chosen Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and there is love going on to the new area (where the name comes from). Also, Oscar chose Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe to win Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. Approaching no wedding by Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won Oscar for Better Writing, Screenplay Written directly to Screen, and was chosen by the Best Director of Norman Jewison (At Night Heat) and Best Picture, was selected BAFTA for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Screenplay of original, and selected Golden Globes for Best Pictures - Manual / Music and Better. It was 96 numbers for 100 years, Quotes 100 ("Snap out of!"), It was the number of 17 for 100 years, 100 deaths, and was 41 for 100 years, 100 cuts. Very nice!
