I remember watching this film, thinking it was very interesting. I wanted to know what happens next. I was surprised and how much they could reach a short of 8 minutes. We start at the school yard. . Two friends are discussing the fly class. Little B says Kid A "Don't go to class today." And Kid A decreases, claiming that they can miss something very important. So baby B jumps with a child A class goes. When he gets there the teacher tells him that today he is going to learn a special and most important lesson that he will learn. They came to learn the meaning of life. He gives everyone a booklet, and when he gets a child A, he runs and tells the boy next to him to share. In fact, the child will not share, so Kid A goes to find a teacher. When he finally finds him, he gets terrible revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I advise everyone to see this short time. It will take only 8 minutes from your life, but the message is very important, it can help you during life.
