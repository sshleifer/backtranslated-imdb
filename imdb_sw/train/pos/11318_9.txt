This is the strongest invention of the Italian novel of James M. Cain The Postman Always Rings twice led by the great Luchino Visconti. What is most interesting about the film is that in every way it surrounds the source material that is a great and original (Camus's amazing also confirms Cain's novel as an important impetus to his historical novel Stranger). The film is more powerful and stronger than the novel because Visconti has the ability to form a similar film of Cain's design but provides more gender surveys. Cain's most popular American novel is also very interesting for the construction of sanitation (Cora's behavior is very fearful to be recognized as a Mexican and embarrassed that married a Greek migrant), which is not appropriate for the Italian rural environment that Visconti is working in. This allows class chaos to take center stage and dance among the bonds of love, the death penalty of two main actors. This film is a tough, amazing, and satisfying experience.
