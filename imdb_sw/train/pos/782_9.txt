This is a very moving picture about 3 best-friends in the small town of England. One finds love lovers with a new beginning and a little piano teacher, When a catastrophe strike and hearts are changed forever. Certainly the film has a tissue box with you! A piece of power work. That is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! EXAMPLE OF USE !! SPOILER! * The protagonist is taken by his good teacher, a good piano and passionate romance. His envious "friends" are playing a prank of common which causes a quicker disaster. She loses her love with her friends in one bad swoop. In the end an unexpected surprise brings them together (in my opinion the amnesty is not accepted)
