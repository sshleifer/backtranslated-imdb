I was so impressed with "Waitress" Shelley Adrienne (2007). This movie only confirms what is clear from the film. Adrienne was a good director-director, original and unique artist. He was able to show the doubts of everyday life and the wonderful humor and the reality of the heat and human hope. Ally Sheedy stole this film for bad performance as a fallen woman on the edge. Male Leader Rod Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is well. There is also a great comeo of Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the film "Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as his eulogy hope: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In the sea of ​​pain, <br> > <br /> Regardless of how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You are broken by rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let the unfortunate fall down, <br /> <br /> do not betray the heartless at your door,
