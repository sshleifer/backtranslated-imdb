I love this movie. I can watch it regularly and not burn it. I think this is one of my main movie parameters. <br /> <br /> Stories are very interesting. It leads us to 6 characters; each has a unique style of kung fu that is very mysterious and very deadly. Each of these characters is taught by one master but their identity is kept confidential. The dead Lord sends the poison of 6, his last pupil, trying to try the mistakes he accuses some of his students have done. How will the last student get other links? What? How will he know which of them is bad? The ways in which these questions are addressed are part of what makes this movie beautiful. We also get to see each other to combat each with each mix. It's fun to see how their styles resemble one another. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you would like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. Not available more than this.
