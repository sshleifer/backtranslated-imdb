I had looked at a lot of series as I could watch on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that I had worked at night. I managed to catch a certain record, at least ... and, of course, bought the latest DVD released in full series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was more unusual for the first time, but they used the right number after the experiment. Sounds are suitable for characters, and writing is best. Instead it is comforting to see the animation repeating its roots by translating adult themes. The thing is, through which society has arrived in the last century, you need to be more open about it to today's standards to be recognized as an adult show. The characters have real people and are placed in situations that are similar to we often face real life. It's your typical example in the matter, but humor is more like you would like to expect from the night's television as a skit to talk to show or Saturday night ... back when SNL was actually playing. Good work, Dreamworks. Maybe you need to work with one of the most liberal networks to keep this series going ... and also to improve the sale of products in a row to help delete it is expensive. It is a challenge to do this with a cartoon of natural maturity though. Hmm ...
