This would have been my film one of 1991, unless it was hit by a brilliant JFK. This is a very good movie! I liked it. I love stories where the lives of different characters have others and how to deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is shown by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I've never been like Martin or his style, but here he is good. I liked the entire speech he gave Kline near the end about Grand Canyon. Writing was the best. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, author of good dialogue, along with Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has created three-dimensional characters and well-thought stories, and a message that feels good in our lives. The best movie. 4 out of 4 stars
