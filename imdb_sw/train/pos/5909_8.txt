I remember when I had five and my parents thought it was a common movie of the cartoon .... except when the bras and bullets started flying. I agree with this film that will make anyone and everyone be recommended because it has been chosen to select everyone and anyone .... but the truth is funny as hell as deep. I recommend this to anyone who loves classic worship. Also try Fritz cat and NINE Life of Fritz Cat. If I am right Ralph Bashki also made the film too. Because Coonskin was the head of denial at the same time it was also called a Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World with very little star Brad Pitt. Traffic heavy was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
