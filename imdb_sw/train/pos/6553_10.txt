It breathes the breath of air when the movie gives you a line of story with the beginning, middle, and end, secret, cunning, and heroine attracting all ages, which succeeds us with wit and its charm. Andrew Fleming's film is really amazing modern, returning to a good old reliable story which was common in Hollywood. He drives far beyond the special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a great film, with a very powerful actor, and a great player. <br /> <br /> The film depends on old books, but it has been updated on enough to put in this century; however, talent can be different, yet the heart is a mystery, and there is a wise man here, one that connects old traditions with young standards. Emma Roberts is an old girl, who believes good behavior and respect for others; information that is not very popular from today's films. She is still good to get to the boys' concerns but she also knows how to now be respected and self-respect. She gets her medals for hard work and is not afraid to show less deception when needed to achieve her goals. <br /> <br /> When taking vacation in California, our heroine is given to Hollywood's actress Hollywood who was a victim of foul play; suddenly she "visited" by her spirit and this sets a series of events that can solve a mystery or cause something to be horrible for herself. What makes the movie so entertaining is a brief description, because she finds that her traditional world is not comparable to the California area, and this is shown well, without using the abstract word or anything of image or sex. Finally, the director has enough control to make the whole web more accessible to all viewers, from young to adults in the audience. It is a movie that deserves to be seen, respected, and enjoy, a popular and stylish film, and will not be afraid to be counted as happy! Five stars
