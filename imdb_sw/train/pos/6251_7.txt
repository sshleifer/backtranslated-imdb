It's not brilliant, promising or creative, but 'Dog Days' is for some reason the study of very interesting behavior. It's like CRASH is facing a bad level of heroin, but it's not true. It is an Austrian film that follows the lives of several troubled, anxious and angry people and their bad relationships with each other. It bothers, it has done well and it is interesting to look at the little things these characters do. Certainly not with a strong heart, this filthy film does not give a conclusion or revelation at the end, we see only the lives of these evil people over two days. Grade: B
