In some ways, this movie can be powerful, interesting, and heartwarming at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring stories to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, high-and-down life through the innocent eye of thought: a bird. Paulie begins her life as a baby carrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as Pepsi girl) and a speech problem. When he learns to speak correctly, so Paulie does it. However, unlike many birds, he can talk and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like a bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an ancient artist, Ivy. She teaches her behavior, etc., when she goes across the country looking for Paulie's owner. The movie continues with a twist of futures, until Paulie ends up in a laboratory where it finally hidden in the basement, and found by the Russian guardian, who is touched by the legendary bird. The plot is collaborating with a simple, romantic theme that language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the voice of sound is amazing. A good mixture of flute, digital base, and horn reinforces the movie to the point of pure fun. An emerging camera and a pleasant environment likes the story even more. And, as the last opinion, the puppetry is completely believed. (Unlike the star wars, where Yoda is similar to Muppet) this film is one of my favorite movies, and the notes added that my four-year parakeet has died recently. In general, I tap this film **** out of four stars, thumbs up two, and a great hit.
