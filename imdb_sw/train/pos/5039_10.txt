It's amazing. Surprisingly. This is a movie about two children who are a father suddenly has a vision. He says the angel visits him, and tells him that they need to kill "demons". He gets orders later, and begins around the demons, which is by the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with a head to the head, and burn them, to put them in a rose garden. Their father says he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, and misleading at the end. What I like about this film, is that it fully grasps the human weaknesses. Is their father completely mad? Or, is he the truth? Listeners are left to decide. Go to your own judgment, and see the film. Now.
