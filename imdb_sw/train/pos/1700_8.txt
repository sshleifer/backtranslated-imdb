I loved this film. you should respect the midgets that are dressed as small martians. Certainly the story can be thin sometimes, but you can't eliminate the way it is done. I was looking at it all the time when I had 8. her children's movies, and on the other hand, has some of the universities implemented. Blanzae's "Home for Range" is amazing. Very well if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
