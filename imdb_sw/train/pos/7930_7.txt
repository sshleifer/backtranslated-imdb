I will be honest. I got this movie so I could enjoy it. I mean, come on, "Hood of Dead Living"? What other responses can I have? The thing is, though, movies (and its creators) decided that it was not done. Instead, it would try to try to be a good film. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It came very close. Little cheese under ordinary music, a little expertise in photography, acting, events (such as props - love the Best Fund Purchase) ... well, it's not a classic kind of movie zombie, but it's still a very good movie itself. And acting, writing and reinforcing all are more amazing than I would expect. There is even a humorous humor, as two of us leads a discussion how to decide whether a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can leave a low budget (which leaves the fingerprints in everything, alas) and around the dirt from time to time, this can be a very good time on the movie. No, it's not good. Yes, it would be better. But the creators, executives, staff, all tried to make a good film (instead of a classic camp) and that counts for much. The zombie movie line is a mile, and thank you, boys, for not adding. <br /> <br /> Kudos for Quiroz brothers. I would like to see what they're doing next. And hey, man, give them a budget!
