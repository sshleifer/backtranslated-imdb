Manning Man viciously lampoons modern US media complex, and hits his dead-center goal. It may be a simple goal, but it removes it even less. Resources takes action to fight (including pro fighters as Hunters), television network, ratings of Nielsen, the US government (shows that it is an entertaining-dominated), crime & penalties, and other half-tenths along the way. It's a great cry from Stephen King novella's original, and Arnold isn't Ben Richards's novel either. But who cares? Basically it is the Flick of Arnie, with all the order of the most beautiful steps and other required buttons.
