I was going through the list of Oscar winners and I was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and Kid Sundance for good pictures in 1969. After seeing the truth, however, I am not surprised again. It was a way before his time related to his style, movies, and flashback use to help promote the character of Joe Buck. Something interesting to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in a short movie. I think You had found naivete and evil-time-anger. Two traits that took me after I got a blow in the playground and when an old man begged him. I think when he appears in the mirror he tries to see if he really did - or what he will do - a terrible thing. I think it was a good decision for Hoffman to take this responsibility. Otherwise he would be a model after Learner. However, this is considered to be all the time because.
