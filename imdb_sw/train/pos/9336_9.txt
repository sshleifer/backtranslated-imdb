German privacy TV is unknown for imitating Dutch and ?? size? US form. In fact, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxing just went away from the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can't stand the screwball comedy? Don't look at Edel & Starck. Great. If you still expect a game of lawyers is similar to the rules and orders or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or see the Law and the Commandments as the most brilliant in what it does, but I beat.) E & S is interesting, often talking about a thought-provoking theme, interesting, romantic, wonderful, wonderful, courage, too. In fact, I am very upset by the authors who found the best deals after the end of serial. And my stupid nature requires to restore itself to itself: the production of private German television. German citizens will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Briefly: See. I don't mean what English interaction is like, but hey, it's important to learn German just to look at them four times. Pseudo-happy end is included.
