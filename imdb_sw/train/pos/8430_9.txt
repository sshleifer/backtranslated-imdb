It's always good to see Angela Bassett doing a role that can sink his teeth. Sometimes it becomes rough, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman was forced to make a house on the soil left out of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at the role of not completely sympathetic as her lover, Boesman. Willie Yona gives a great performance as a newcomer to the new life of Boesman and Lena. It is not often that you have the opportunity to see an intellectual film related to mature themes. Although it is the basis of the play, the late director John Berry (who also led Claudine) opens the material because the film was hit on a lot of Cinemascope. He also places interesting things by blocking the creativity of the actors and by showing us just the things mentioned in the play. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry can lead Angela Bassett to the selection of the Academy Award. That is definitely a film worth searching.
