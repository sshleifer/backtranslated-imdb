Despite what the head could indicate, "the pig is a pig" is not Porky Pig's star. Instead, they have a little pig with a desire to be more concerned than John Belushi's behavior in the "Animal House". His mother often tells him, but it is not good. So much so that he goes to another house where the ignorant scientist has given him more than any human being can handle (but there is a surprise at the end). I would like to say that this cartoon was seen as the owner of a centralized cartoon (Daffy Duck began three months after this came out). But don't make a mistake about it, it does good things here. The whole feeding chain seems to be more important today, due to the obesity epidemic that reaches our country. It is not a great cartoon, but it is worth seeing.
