Play player Sidney Bruhl (on top-over Michael Caine) killed for playing. Enter a wonderful little child (Reeve solid) who just wrote like that. Weave into Bruhl's most powerful wife (the most productive of Cannon) and the German psychic (very funny Irene Worth) and you have been involved with amazing surprises. It is not about "Sleuth" "Deathtrap" rates are not less than the best, emerging to be filled with waiting for the contest with Ira Levin. The material, and Caine mainly provide lines of the top line and gusto. <br /> <br /> The film loses a bit of middle and end steam is much more satisfying than the pride in the original play but in general "Death death" is solid, well used and pleasant.
