I have not put great prospects for this movie, which has left me surprised. The story is a bit strange but sometimes I think it has a credible trust. The action of the action is very good and the accompanying music is used to influence the traditional patriotic feelings of American movies. This may not be the most beautiful movie but it has never been normal for Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
