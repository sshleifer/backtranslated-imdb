Those who only remember late Mr. Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a raconteur specialist will do well to find this beautiful piece of satire of '60s'.

Ustinov (who wrote the script) is on the form, as was the joy of Maggie Smith, here he was sent as usual as a cockney succumbed to an accident. - The flight of dolly birds. Bob Newhart also puts an exciting performance as a skilled executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is very happy as Ustinov and master of Newhart's female. I love you so much about this film? It's not just a thought of 'thinking movie' but also touching a little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very persuasive if two misfits are in love (the whole area concerned with the deck of the card is very good). In fact, the script is no longer recommended computer-read more than many films (that is, quite difficult) even though it feels to feel the computer's '60s' big steel component. There are also a couple of frogs that detect to reach the second or third, but I think these are small niggles. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a film that is good to find, and after seeing it once you want to see it again and again. <br /> <br />
