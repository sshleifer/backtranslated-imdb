I really liked this film! I was trying to look at it for the first time because I thought it would be very painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, look at "Two of Us" returned to me during the fun time was still alive and there was hope and possibilities. I think that the author did an amazing job showing "it could be". Aidan Quinn was as good as Paul and met the head of the challenge. I was amazed at his inspiration and his behavior. Jared Harris is also a talented man and was quite trustworthy as John. My favorite places were a reserve and a roof area - something that was very interesting. The film has left me sad and satisfied, both of which I feel right, from the environment.
