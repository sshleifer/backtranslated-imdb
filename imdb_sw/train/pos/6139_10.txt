Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, dance, and special mention to "Portobello Ballet" is beautiful. For the animation, the match between the animal has become a classic instant; The climax and attack weapons are cool and interesting. I recommend to see the 134-minute return or at least 11 minutes of video. Here in Italy we have only a minute of 98 minutes, although the film was released in its initial release during 117 minutes. 98 but it is not appropriate to mention both World War II and all the events between the English and the Nazi invaders!
