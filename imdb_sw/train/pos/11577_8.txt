This was a real true movie. It comes out only to prove that you don't need silly items like promotional and labels to make the film. Passing through the valleys for seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords are on fire, the fighters fighting with the plates of sinking, David Essex is the image of the villainy of hell and John Rhys Davies is just dude. I enjoyed this film but I love s ** t movies, this is a perfect example of a ** ** movie. If you would like a world war you would like this film, its swashbuckling, its speed, its silly, samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It also appears as it was done in 1972
