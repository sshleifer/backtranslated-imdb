This is a simple 9. Michel Serrault, better known for comic roles in the original part of his acting career, does an amazing job, even surprising to imitate Dr Petiot, the author of French storytelling story. He / she is only reliable at any time and at any time in the film, that the losers completely lose their character - the only best ever ever achieved this, and when they do it is only a small part of the best part. The whole story (real story that happened in the 20th century France) is powerful, so it is bad - it makes a very powerful film that one remembers long, long.
