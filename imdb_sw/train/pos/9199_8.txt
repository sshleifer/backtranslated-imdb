Jack was later shot and created for the murder of the man who promised to kill his father. A few months later Jack's day is killed and he searches the city for the man who bound him for murder. The search for Jack takes him to a * beep * which does not end until everyone is dead. Through the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill the endless streams of people in 15 levels. The game play is basically â€œkill 30 people, get switch to open the door. for the time until the level has been made. The dead for justice is also a tough game. You will be placed in the evil and bad boys armed with the Sub Machine when you just have a pistol. <br /> <br /> Dead for Justice is like gory as it is difficult. If you hit the guy in the face and the gun of the gun will blow on the walls, ceiling and floor. And since there are several people in each area the walls will be beaten with blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
