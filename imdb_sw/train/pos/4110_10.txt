This, and the "hidden fortress" is Kurosawa which is very dear to me. I don't give out 10 as candy, but this certainly deserves, as nothing. Although it is a very long time (as all of Kurosawa are too many) you have agreed with the problem that gives birth to many films; The story of the story is often free and progressively slow, with passages that are not needed or are highly rooted without the real purpose of a story or character description. Dodeskuken gave me the same experience as the "hidden fortress" made; in spite of its length, there was no one minute I removed. This is also a rare film of Kurosawa through, it does not have a story story, but many independent stories that depend more on character details than stories, unlike any film I have seen so far. It also depends heavily on the discussion, which uses it carefully (especially in the story between the father and the child to arrange "new homes"). It is still something that makes this a hub of how sad it is, it can be described in human terms and compassion, without pointing to anyone at any time. From the beginning to the end it provides a high degree of emotion from laughter to tears in full balance.
