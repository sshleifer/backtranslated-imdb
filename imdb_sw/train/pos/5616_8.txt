What can be said, in fact ... "The Planner" is the first class of excitement done in the same degree of doubt and complete cohesion. It is an effective film - everything seems to be because - though the plot is not supposed to be intelligent, and much of it is not thought in some way. So we are left with Trelkovsky (Polanski) who is becoming more calm - a Polish man who has found an apartment because of the dedication of an old tenant - leading us through the world of increasing fear and uncertainty. After the party's sponsored party with a small group of workers, Trelkovsky comes under an increased investigation, it seems to be unknown to his colleagues in his building; The entire film regulates the deterioration of his mind and gives us a full understanding of the seat and future efforts of David Lynch. "Planner," however, is more exciting and despicable, tied to the unexpected layout of comic, good performances, and a true haunting mark. It's a movie that has much better experience than described, so you forget.
