I am a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put the animals as chief actors you will win me. Bound Homeward did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put it new. It was a perfect achievement. It is very movie of archetypal. You have obi-children of the group (the shrewd) who is wise and prudent, you are likely to be beautiful but unbelievable and unpredictable, and the king of prissy who thinks he should be promoted and praised. This third design is very broken. I also love how they did Chance and Sassy powerful characters, and they didn't do it. Many people say that it can't be good because it is a lot of children's films. Those who forget it, however, are supposed to be the children of the film, and this still does not remove the usual movie. This is a good movie to watch while tired and just want to watch the film. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, the blue air of the best air plot. I would, of course, advise you to look at it.
