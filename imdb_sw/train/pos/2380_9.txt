I didn't care to walk. People really went to the place back then. It was borrowed to the trust of this piece of this period and a particular view on the Martians technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, especially for the "Thunderchild" area, which I considered to be one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't pronounce this film enough, with his loyalty to the story of Wells! It's about time. Actors are fascinating and exhibitions are attractive. Also this film is very important to see only the music of Jamie Hall really great. It was amazing to see the same matches playing the author and his brother in London.
