In Holland the gay journalist Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a speech. She lives one night with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and is having sex with her (considering she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but he looks at the picture of Christine Hunky Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to try. Then things get amazing. The Great X-Art Gallery in the United States in 1983. Why was an explosion of X? Let's see ... there is damage, male and female completeness, harassment, filth, sexuality, church-crossed church that will surprise many, gay sex in crypt ... and all is comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for extreme sexual practices and rejected as trash. Thus, Verhoeven filled this film with a very clear sign, thinking that critics would think it was an art and praise. He was the same! Critics loved the film without realizing that Verhoeven was playing a great joke on them. However, it is a good film. It is shot by Jan de Bont (now the director himself) and there is a great score and an array of "secrets" in a discussion that you have never been bored. All actors are good - Krabbe has a degraded attitude but (somehow) it is a scandal; Soutendijk is just stunning to watch and play its part in full - a little smile she gives when Gerard admits to stay with her is cool; Hoffman is very good and beautiful body - deserves a loan to make a church chain and go with Krabbe in a cry. This is not a heartbreak or weak heart, but if you like many movies that are challenging (like me) this is for you! Method 10.
