The joke is clear, the gags are corny, and the characters walk praise - but I can not stop from laughing on his movie entertainment. No matter how many times I see it, I still get this vote, and I strongly recommend it to all lovers of entertainment no matter what. It has many proposed, and some of the best views have been seen to this day. If you have had a bad week and you need to chuckle, rent this on the way home on Friday night to give your weekend a good start.
