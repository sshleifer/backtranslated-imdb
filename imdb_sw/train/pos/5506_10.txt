I can't understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this document "0" except for political reasons. No, the film does not detect "both sides" of the story, but certainly one film for Chavez against the propaganda forces against it should be seen as an equality attempt out of the general description (especially given A. The history of CIA engagement in South America in sparking civil unrest - google Archive National Security and B. vaccination in the country and elsewhere of the scenes clear faked of Chavez supporters shooting the missing opponents). What's more amazing on this film is the fact that the creators of the film remained in the presidential palace all the way though the revolution - certainly the first in the text of text - pictures of fighting from both sides!
