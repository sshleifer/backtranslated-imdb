In fact I have loved the Dalmations 101 when it happened in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I thought it was strange but I think 101 is better because I think it's more fun, more humor, and also that movie was the basis of the same story with the cartoon version (one minute and one (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103. Dalmations. I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe no, we all fans of dalmation should know if there will be 103 dalmations later.
