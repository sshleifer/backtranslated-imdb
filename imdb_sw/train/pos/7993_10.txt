There are many reasons to watch this film: to see the fact that Latin pain in America with something to capture, the destruction of police at the continental level, among many things that we live in Latins. Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this man continues to be the best actor and that continues this way. Dakota Fanning for just 10 years, the best actor has been with me and I will thank him. Some of the films were wonderful, I have in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they have been made for those who produce Hollywood to make the movie completely in Venezuela, where they show our best truth about damage, traffic traffic or political problems. They have been a few movies that are playing in Venezuela (for example: Violence, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) should do more, as they do in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Songs "You have Mirada" I hope it comes from sound, it's best.
