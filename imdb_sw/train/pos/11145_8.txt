After apartheid, rural migration-so-called migration from the country - is another social and political issue of the 1960s. Now, Midnight Cowboy is involved in rural trips and the tragedy of friendship in a psychological perspective. It has the end of the pain we are experiencing one of two of the fate of the passes. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger gives us the most innovative ideas, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluation of New York City two scums. Good times Joe Buck (Voight) dream of all the beautiful women of the world asking him to share the fantasy wild love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and beautiful life in Florida clean and sunny. So, Joe becomes a hustler turning his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a player to earn enough money to move to Florida. Besides Ratso helps Joe find his way to do whatever he can. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share the medicine, share a home that does not live, share their income and thus share the fate. Sadly, the story continues, Joe knows that being good is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women pleasurable; and more so Ratso can't see Florida since his heart fails to defeat his disease when he was on his way. <br /> <br /> It may always be the same, and Justice does not have rights during the day. Then, "Midnight" offers a realistic view. With the tragedy, no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Each characteristic of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is an opposing view of social and political issues, a rural trip.
