This seems to be the second remake of this film, after being closed before 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it reminds me of the future film, YANK AT OXFORD. All of the films are associated with a fun blow that comes to one of the top schools in the world and both, gradually, learning slowly about the team's work and skill. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his great opponent, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in the role of helping Jack Pickford - always remembers as a brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes much better, like a compassionate person who becomes a mouse of Tom - in fact he has a very good experience and just a good time before the big game! All Clich√©s are located there with the movie, because it was done many times before and since, it offers a few surprises. However, it's a good film and it's enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, for the best movie of the university, try Harold Lloyd's FRESHMAN - is the most exciting soccer show and Harold is very happy with mercy than Tom Brown is angry. FRESHMAN is probably the best picture of college that you can get from then. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a small picture is that William Haines played primarily an invisible and bombing character with a program similar to over and over again (such as WESTPOINT and SMART SET, among others) - and if you 'Have seen one of the films these, you have seen it all. Well done, but certainly not the original! And, because it is only a second film, anyone who scoops the 10th film is highly recommended to see these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just watched and saw this small film was the most tested film on IMD from 1920 !! Talk about over-rated! There are several and several of the best films - how this film was # 1 is the guess of anyone.
