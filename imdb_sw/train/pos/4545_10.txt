I saw this film recently. 2 hours later, my head is still hurt due to laughing. The plan was very bad, the joke was very bad, but what I was not sure was: <br /> <br /> 1. The 2 scenes before and after the movie with Pat and Jay (which caused more laughter) The head through the windshield that has caused the evil one. This game is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour, and my copy even came to sleep saying if you didn't like the movie, send a certificate to HBO. As I was considering, the date you had to use was January 1991 (which also led to wackiness to ensure).
