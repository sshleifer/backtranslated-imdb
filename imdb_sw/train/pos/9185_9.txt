DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a great surprise. It has the best (especially from the Callan Assisted), good movies and compelling stories. In other words, it is one of the most striking queries that emerge from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> Calling a photographer who gets a dream of killing his models, (who lacks hand and foot). While the Callan models about the genocide actually become dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own ... but there are more pictures than he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie did not receive the merit credentials. Many critics and filmmakers beat the slasher films released at the same time, but it stands on the bulk of the polls. They are clever and unique, which is not something that can easily talk about many of these films, but also interested in enthusiasm and doing. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind.
