When the story is sweet, and playing and singing in the main part of the film is fun, the only film (and what makes it a jewel) is a series of dreams. It shows a mixture of the most advanced American music (Gershwin), the beauty of the art of the French art, the most dramatic choreography of Kelly (including rapturous "pas de deux d'amour", actually kind different), consisting of the most beautiful color colors planned for setting. The comparison of the ongoing music with the explosion of visual and dancing was the real work of creativity and a great artist.
