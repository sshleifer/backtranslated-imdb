Halloween is one of the best models of free film. It is well done and has more psychological features than you can realize at first glance. It's a simple movie told very well. Music is full and one of the haunting symbols ... If you haven't seen this film yet, you must look at it. Release is very strong. I would not have done sequel after the end. The first was better and it would have been finished if it hadn't been good. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the film. He wasn't found to be an old man (he is very good today, without hair and seventy clothes). Events through the mask are one of the most terrible things!
