The hard and amazing work of the job from an experienced British author Hanif Kureishi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette", (this is the best thing he has ever done ever since). It is about the intellectual people whose lives did not add much. They have been able to destroy what they have been given and largely empty containers. The only character on the live screen is the mother of the head still feels dead inside until a fierce minister shows her love and pleasure with sexual pleasure. He has his own intentions but to deal with him with a good deal of mercy. This is a film that people and places feel, where characters are more than a screen button. Somehow it's like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it is a piece of hard work. Director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to create instinctively. And it's good to act. <br /> <br /> As the mother eponymous Anne Reid betra lose her life in every sign. There is no false writer in his extraordinary performance, and a very good actor Daniel Craig shows shadings to his character than even to live out. If the film is exposed to false falsehood, perhaps, in the character of an inexperienced daughter, she finds a horrible thing with her husband cheating (or should be in another way) and even a messier life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw admits you in however. Film is also very good looking (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and should be a title, unpleasant, like the best UK movie of the year.
