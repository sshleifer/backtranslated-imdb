I saw this film when I was 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and I never forgot this film! I was very touched and transferred to a young warrior with a beautiful eagle. And I can just believe when it turned out to be just an eagle when everyone in the playground thought he would go to die ... my sister was in the movie with me and I asked her as soon as she remembered the movies we saw with the boy and eagle and she said he remembered as we saw yesterday only. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is TO LOOK! You will never forget - like my sister and I ...
