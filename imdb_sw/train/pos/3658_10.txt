This film is like a gospel story. It has direct loyalty and crime you cannot believe that it took place after the war of the world when Italy was destroyed and destroyed, and filled with many homeless people, poor people. It is the stone of the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the permanent innovative resources of the country of inspiration. Toto is a character like "Idiot" of Dotoevisky, modern Christ seeking his way in the big city. He is good and pure in love, and His works change people to meet them, such as do a wonderful work. Stories are told in a natural way and simple style, but it is designed by magic that is close to the fellini's fantasies of the surrealist. It is one of the most stimulating, enriching movies made.
