I really hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on one day of DVD. The period with the sisters of Hilton, George (played by late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a common hilarity. It shows the racial competition of the brothers and the brotherhood among the brothers whose lives were used differently but all ended up happy. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad returned boldly to the chemistry they participated in The Cosby Show for many years and put it in the middle-class position that shows what they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The role of comedic power ... Madeline Kahn, Pililia Rashad, and Mr. Cosby ... classic mind!
