Kalifornia is a movie about lost values. Traveling the black road forever. The way back. The plan is about a couple who have decided to find a better life in California. Someone (David Duchovny in his high role so far) wants to write a book about the most popular crimes committed in America by his girlfriend - who is a photographer - will take pictures. So, putting a strange way of killing without knowing what is going on on the way. Sharing the cost of the trip they decide to find another couple and put the ad. But a couple who respond is not just a couple. It is one of the most wonderful couples ever. Girl is a stupid creature, a shadow that has many dreams and likes cactuses. That person is the opposite. A brutal murderer. We learn that early in the film and we follow him during a trip to California (not to C as usual, but with K, perhaps symbolizing the killer's example), during his rebellion, murder and ultimately defeat. All leaders, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes provide very good performances and you should consider that when this movie was hit even one of them was a star. The photography is amazing, and the darkness covers a large part of the movie, and music resembles the dark character of the film. In general this is a very good movie. Don't miss it. You will think again before you take a guest in your car to share gas with!
