when I saw the advertisements for this I was thinking "WHERE DOES I NEED TO GET! because it took "new head". well, I still love new love. but george lopez is a beautiful show of amazing. I love how benny odd is. Carmen is a very good character, it's amazing to see how stupid and attentive can be sometimes. I feel bad for a boy who plays max, looks very young and he is real! but max is a happy character, and it does well. yea, angie is very little, but she has her lovely time. Ha ha george has a big head! Nah but can also be good too. funny show! it should be constant then improve home.
