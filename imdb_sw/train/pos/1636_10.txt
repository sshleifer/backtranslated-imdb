This is one of the largest movies of over 80! It looks like "turd in punchbowl" !! I can't believe Mad Magazine accused or nothing. However, they are struggling to name themselves on "show" and "Stuart", "I-say-a-no-enlish Chinese woman" and "guy UPS for speed". What is it with that? And, I love Ron Leibman-he is foxy !! Wonder why he removed his name from credit? It was his funniest role that I know. Of course, he is not as close as he was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this movie is similar to the National Lampoon Holiday. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, the Last American Virgin, or all the other 80s movies, you like this! Buy it and you'll see what I'm saying!
