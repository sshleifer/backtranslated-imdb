The movie is very realistic. In fact, it is not the genre of Cinema of the species where each line must be pronounced in full and where each argument is correct. Employees who work with a partner do a great job that represents the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their daily lives. In general, the film faces a state viewer trouble. This is where the authenticity of the whole story is obvious. Not everything happens in the way we think it should happen. I can say though the movie doesn't end in bad memory. We look, we learn, we see ourselves. That's perhaps the moral of this story.
