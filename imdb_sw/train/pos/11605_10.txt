The main reason I was seeing this movie was the star Susan Swift, an amazing and all-known actress. When traveling movies do not care about the motives and do not make movies about magic, but this film was amazing and interesting. It did not depend on the impressive special effects and did not take much into account when the viewer lost and confused. This was a real creation of a simple and solid creation and good acting with all.
