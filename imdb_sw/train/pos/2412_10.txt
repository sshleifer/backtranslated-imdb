I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best and most successful "Series" to come to any Web for a long time. This exhibition had great potential and I couldn't wait to see every week. This can be continued to be a great Subscription Session. People expect this kind of act as we are "Reality TV" overkilled. I crave the type of writing and act that shows like Dallas, Landing Knots, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. provided. King Cove stressed this concept well and I just expected to get better. There is much to expand with these characters and all of them were very interesting and interesting to themselves. It would be a loss to explore this and develop these characters after giving us and catching us into their world. I really liked this show because it was wonderful, interesting and highly impressive without going overboard or offending. He liked it.
