Briefly that begins this film is a real picture of a man named Gary, it seems to have been taken regularly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a little "different"; he is an actor and gives Chevy an old named Farrah (after Fawcett). Lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from Gary sometime later asking him to come back to Beaver to get a picture of the inner talent contest which he has put together, including the Gary's awesome combination as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, my. The following two shorts are a Gary story, the same one you just saw is shown by Sean Penn and the second and Crispin Glover titled "Kidogo Kidogo." If you have a sense of humor this person is obviously watching the movie. I was double on laughter in many ways, especially the performance of Crispins that could definitely stand on its own. When it was over, I had to restore the film again to watch the real Gary and all its idiocy shining. Although Olivia was a perspective, I would like to see one of the "fake" cup to take the jab to Gary's Barry Manilow simulation, but also he was ignorant.
