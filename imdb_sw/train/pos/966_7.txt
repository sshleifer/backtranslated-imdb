The Toronto Festival 2005 Film Festival It is official; "Takashi Miike" dropped. The mid-mid midnight watch of the film "New Takashi Miike", "World War Spook" or "World War Yokai" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call what you will do this is a fun journey. Colin Geddes, the fearless tenant said this film was original for children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" to Japan. After the investigation I can understand where they went with it, but this damn is "Takashi Miike" after all. Inspired the film '01 "The killer", while the observation of the festival ceremony was sent to the investigation. And no, that's not just the sale. Plot Summary: The little boy with a troubled life is "chosen," and sits in the midst of the Great Spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who are his companions through his journey. This is not for children, well not 'young' too. Certainly they are very afraid of some of these spirits (even those friendly) are shown. This is different from anything I have seen on the movie movies before. Fantasy size, some funny accessories (but dark) material. You can not bother you can guarantee that. Will this fall to North America? Without doubt. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
