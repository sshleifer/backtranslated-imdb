Scanners II: The new Order is very good as the Scanners of David Cronenberg, Scanners were held in 1980 by Scanners II in 1991 so they are the eleventh year between two movies. The film takes the Scanners style which is a good thing, it will not be Scanners without a blast of the head so Scanners II has an explosion area that is just disliked as the first. Scanners II: New Procedures have other events to consider well done. The Scanners Plan II: New Order is taking a new top of the series since it has scanners used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a small scanner named David Kellum knows he will be used and decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: New Order is a great sequel of the scanners of David Cronenberg sci-fi classic and should be seen. Check out this. 10/10
