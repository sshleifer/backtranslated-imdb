This is one of the best movies out there and that says a lot about it on television. I wish you were d.v.d. Helen Hunt gave the same performance. Played rookie copo thrown in the serial killer case perfectly. When he falls because he kills another child it was amazing. He is alone, so he finds him. When he speaks to his mother! WOW! Steven Weber as a common killer was awesome! He brought him the truth into his dark world. It was worthy of Oscar. When he talks about killing children, scary! When he knows who it is! What is the area! They should not be like that again. It was really exciting without having fun.
