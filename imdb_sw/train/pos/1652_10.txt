This series gave me to write to Deighton and genre when I was younger and I love this story story. However I would like to agree with the above comments. From what I have read in the past, it is not Holm's performance that leads Deighton refusing to have a series released but publishing that all three books were found in translation on screen. A great example of this is the re-opening of the board to complete the work of Samson's field. The event is not in the book, the character described in the field of mines was never in any books and crossing the Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. All this story is clothing. The change in the same Setting destroys the credibility of the story. My attitude towards Holm's performance is that he demonstrated the discomfort of Samson during his refusal to his wife well and I believe he did well in showing an aging agent for trying to eliminate the class. Samson all pays his father's tax and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemore's opinion, he had acquired knowledge that he could be running the department. I think the real loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is a decline when compared to Samson's book - a fascinating physical man who can use its size by forcing the presence.
