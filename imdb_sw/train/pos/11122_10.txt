When we started looking at this series on the cable, I had no idea how to take drugs. Even when you hate behavior, you hold because it is well developed, you can understand why they are experiencing frustration, fear, desire or temptation as they do. It's almost as a viewer gets one of Christopher's training. I can't understand why Adriana could criticize Christopher, in words, both physically and emotionally, but I need to read a magazine to see how many women can do and tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give it to a loving and loyal husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. It doesn't matter how much you look at the part, you can find something you missed the first five times. We look even at the intervals of the series (see the 1st night of the advertising and advertising but all languages, A & E with the language taken, to return to the Modern Web) - whenever they are, we're there. We are now destroyed. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "Albacore around my neck" is my favorite Johnny Boy. When these entities have entered our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I should get life. I will make the series completed, and have collected all the DVDs, and put the collection in my will.
