The night listener may not be one of William's best roles, but it makes a very interesting character in a rare but very different film. I can assure you that you have never seen this type of movie before. Some people will probably not love the pacing of this film, but I think it's better than the movie. It is obviously one of the top movies that have come in 2006. It has an exciting performance in a film with good content, a great feeling. This is not a American film. Neither is a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a film that has a secret that you have a hard time to decide which results can be. This is not the best movie that has everything, but hell, it is a beautiful and natural movie.
