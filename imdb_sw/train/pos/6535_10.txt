This was a great movie! Although there were only 15 people including me there was good! My friend and I laughed very much. My mother also enjoyed. There were middle-aged women aged 20 and there seemed to enjoy it. I love the places where Corky and Ned are similar to both they love Nancy and makes her beautiful lol. And when she gets the roadster and Ned there. Oh This was a great movie even they thought people felt it lol. Go see i bet you will enjoy !! I really enjoyed it and also my friend. People were very hard on this film and they didn't see it. I bet sometimes will give the movie and space administrators. They all did a good job in my opinion. But if you have young children it is still suitable. I will probably take my seven-year-old girl to look at it too.
