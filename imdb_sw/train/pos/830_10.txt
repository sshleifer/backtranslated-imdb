I had no hope of going to the film, but I thought it was strange. Pierce Brosnan is the best in a very different role. She has lost the suit of armor that was taken by looking for ignorance and paying off to show that she is the best actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear are very confronted, and makes one of the best young people for a long time. Humor is the darkness, the Brosnan presentations, Kinnear, and Hope Davis are good, mix it with a feature that touches the story in friendship, and you have a good film. It may be one of the best girls for a long time. This is a film that shows that we can expect good things in the post-Bond Bond career.
