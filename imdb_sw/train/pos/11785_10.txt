I don't know how to describe the "dark room," because in summary it is not actually doing right. It is a short film of Lynchian and two beautiful girls in a wonderful, wonderful atmosphere. I would like to say this is the most obvious in the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian scope, as opposed to "Elephant Man" or "Similar Stories." It is hidden on the Lynch website, and it is useful to search.
