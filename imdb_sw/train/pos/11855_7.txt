Wow. Something of surprise. Although it's wrong, it's better that I expected. The new Arcturus of space space with 3,000 rides is in the last days of his sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, Cerebral shipping (main computer) shows the alarm bell and commands everyone to leave. Soon, there are only a few people left including one of the astronaut ships (Penny), captain (Cary), and the line-line director (Kenyoni) > It turns out that the bell was false and that the great Cerebral makes it <br /> <br /> correctly. Passengers and remaining employees should avoid ships and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie begins very well. Opening business is very touching. There is a clear correlation to 2001: The Odyssey of Space and History of the Titanic sink. The film is slow and has problems to solve, but it is generally done well and used properly.
