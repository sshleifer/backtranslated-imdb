A wonderful surprise! I expected more downgrade along the line: Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such a film. Perhaps that's why a few are approved by this kind of Bruckheimer price. Strong debate rather than linking one-one links, a good background / motivation instead of south-n-bake discrimination and when migration came to thirst for it. Fanboys expect rollercoaster of Armageddon: stay away. This is one of the most practical fans. It did not treat me even Jolie seemed very little.
