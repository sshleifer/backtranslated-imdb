The real manifestation of little love for keeping college but also attracts a great viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and makes me shed tears or two. We rarely will see movies and actors of dirty cities that can appeal to older, non-black audiences and show real-life picture of young adults. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place at the university and the city where two people meet and fall in love. In the past are friends and friends with different situations that affect them for better or worse. Some of the conspiracy may say, but this was not expected. I found myself rooting for living with a couple's relationship, seeing my past in their story. During deep thought and revelation came to perform the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> It is a sharp film that I would like to approve for those small hearts and with love or have ever been in love. Great movie. I will be looking for a copy to add to my film collection.
