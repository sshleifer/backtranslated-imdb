Couple ODD is a classic film version of the game Neil Simon famous about the newswriter news called Felix Unger, who is obsessive neat freak, who step in with his best divorced friend, Oscar Madison, spot and full slob, after his wife Frances gives him out of the house them. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and sadly since he does. Neil Simon classic comics first came to Broadway and Carney's art to play Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes Carney into a film version and an unforgettable performance like Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only a very funny role but so vividly realistic that it brings the element of melancholy figure dubious ie Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his position as Oscar, one-of-a-kind gem of the comic performance that provides a steady laugh around. This part of Lemmon and Matthau turned into a comic gold which had been visited again in nine other films. With all these characters again with us, watching this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. Simon's play has been well expanded to the screen and introduces silent chronicling sadness Felix's suicide attempt namely the winner. Support support includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner as the Oscar girls and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters, the Oscar and Felix blind days. Of course, later it became the best series of TV and Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing like nature. Fun from beginning to end.
