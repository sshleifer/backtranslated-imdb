This is a very powerful story-based story that can stimulate a look. I say this because the brutal media might be bad for people, in this case a couple of Australian innocents are alleged to kill their child. Streep Meryl got a lot of insight into his performance when the film came out but I thought Sam Neill was good. Let's just say both were better but the role was very difficult for Streep because he had to learn accent Australia. (He learned very well I had trouble understanding him in part.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, all I can say is this film will be emotional.
