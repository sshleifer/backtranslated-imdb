Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the film is not worth telling the story, that it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. The idea of ​​a mystery in the form of an unfamiliar film is an old man who lives to the French and Switzerland, a man dedicated to his dog, who still has a partner, but his heart condition is increasingly threatening his life. He has a child with a small family who often meets him, but when he finds that he needs to transplant he will go to Tahiti through Japan to get a heartbeat on the black market and restore long-term relationships with the child of Tahiti women ago. What does Denis do and a summary of the story uses his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the size of the natural, human partnership with the animals, etc.. Much of the time 'film' is useless, but it is because we try to connect all the dots placed before us in beautiful pictures. Life is like that: we look, see, explore, integrate, process, and do what we want. Trying to use this form of filming (such as he did in the most amazing 'Beau Achievement') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether or not the viewer finds the finished product has a lot to do with our personal information processing and concepts. This is a fascinating and seemingly interesting film, but many viewers will get a long discussion on very little. Probably looking again will change that. Grady Harp
