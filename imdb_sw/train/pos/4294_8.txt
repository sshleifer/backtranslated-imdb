There was no eye eye among the spectators yesterday after leaving the movie, after seeing the film's film in the home sold as part of this year's film film. And the selected tears was laughter. This film was hilarious, no other way to say this. There was not one thing stirring in, I laughed that way with me and each of us three hundred French francs. Alain Chabat was quite strict. Clown great if the requirements are needed and considerable if the situation is required. Performance was quite high, but this is exactly the story that is needed and what worked well. Very good was Charlotte Gainsbourg who I love to see a lot, and my mother was also a very good performance. Sisters could have more details of the script, but apart from that there was nothing right up. I had a good afternoon to see this film when Hamburg had dropped out of the rain, and I would like this film from France to get a regular release in Germany. But distributors are this country does not seem to understand that French makes a good film. I at least can't wait to get a DVD that gives the subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because the film I need at home look several times more!
