... when this film proves that it really is not recommended. If a few lines, it was very strange to see this film, without registration, in an unknown language. My friend sent VHS, with a few pieces of paper and all the translated verses in English. with its interpretation next to me, I began to look at this story (it is really a story), and from the first tunes of music crying when you unlock the features I have exceeded. The color, which is very small (well, in most cases), the incredible comedy, pipe, genius, good ... with a few other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), this can talk to anyone's heart without words. Whenever you have an opportunity, see. Whatever you do - don't miss it. It's once in a lifetime experience. Oh, the act is good, the sound is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
