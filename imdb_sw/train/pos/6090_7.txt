The envy is not as surprising as I thought it would have been before, but after some reviews I had read it was more funnier than people were giving equipment, in fact it's really not a movie of minutes like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben still with jack black work with each other and christopher walken is as good as ever, so the story is on black jack's habit of producing a medicine that makes the dog pooh disappear, ben obviosly wants no part of it, but when the product makes a black jack ben rich ben bener begin to see envy, not for All the channels with all the bener and black jack have funnier with the best movies under their belt, but like your fan either I recommend this as yet flick funny and I cut my ass off quite a bit, as a big fan of ben bed says this is small a little but still great fun, give me an hour
