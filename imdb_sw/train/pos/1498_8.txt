This is a very exciting and sometimes anthology, that if it is too short in the screen department, the more it makes a deficit in acting, the area's work and the overall exciting. The best events for this are first and Denholm Elliot is playing the author of fear that came from a character from his novel in the work (the perfect example of this link to the outside builder); The third, and Christopher Lee as a man afraid of his own daughter and the last part and late delayed Jon Pertwee as a pompous star film star who gets more than just a new role on his recent project. The discussion between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is interesting and fun, quite clear to create real opportunities to lift! The pumping is usually good in the weakest part, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the net of a woman who is considered and down in the inner museum, is anything but "good" if we are told to believe she is! A man of awesome beauty was needed and instead we were given a woman with a turtle jaw. Small items along this movie and are the most beautiful landscape of the country house is one to catch when you can.
