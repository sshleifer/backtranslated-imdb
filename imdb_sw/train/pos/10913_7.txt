William Powell is a doctor responsible for the murder and ex-wife of the old "Bradford Grandmother," also with Jean Arthur's star, Eric Blore, and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had a chemistry with a woman who lived with him. Although he and Myrna Loy were a couple of full screens, the actress made other films of "Thin Man", one with Ginger Rogers and this with Arthur, all with a very good effect. one has not been tired of seeing Powell as a witch, a debonair specialist and "Mrs. Bradford" is no different. The old lady. B has Mr. B who served with the debate of alimony back and then back in to help him solve the mystery that he dragged him into. And this is not the first time he has done it! It's almost as if there is a film of "Bradford" before this or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his secret-former writer is always bringing him into trial. At this time, the jockey riding on a horse that has loved to fall away from the horse and die before the last line. <br /> <br /> The solution of the case is a foreign type but it is a step by step. Steps are banter between the couple and the interference of the old lady. B. Jean Arthur is very good in his role and very funny. However, with the actor who comes as brainy as Arthur does, humor appears to be like a wind. I think the author had something else in mind - say, on the wacky side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, he says, "Ah, maybe it's about my alimony. I've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it," it's more than a number for Powell instead of a big statement. It still works well, and shows how good performers can do its own part. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth checking, as William Powell and Jean Arthur were always.
