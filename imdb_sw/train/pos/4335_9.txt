The performance of Oscar-caliber and Peter Falk in the role of Oscar-caliber. I liked an unequal investigation, a long-term marriage - how many times do we find it in the film, where usually the film ends when a boy and a girl gather? This is a movie for adults, a difficult view through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how everyone has done to each other and grow during the story. On top of that, he gave me a great deal of abdominal 10, and I am one of those people who usually sit without hate when other viewers laugh. This was one of the real movies I saw. Great, original joke.
