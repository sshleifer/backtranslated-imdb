Rudyard Kipling immediately wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but because the human heart is too small, everyone has a unique opportunity that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this might be a quote from some of the most directors of today when they come out to acknowledge eternal love for that special place and show the situation in the lives of citizens and its guests. The result is a good collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others lead us to a respiratory walk through Parisia's plans, human feelings, motives and expectations. <Br /> <br /> Every other quarter, always a moving story about ordinary people in search of love, whether in the parking lot, the art studio, the station center. And Paris I love it is about many kinds of love-loving for a partner, child, parent, for those who tell us the world but not around again, love that you need to turn, serendipitous love for a stranger as your eyes are faced with, or a love that doesn't mean just to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? However, this film is not just about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, mix, ups and everyday days. And its important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope. I am giving this film 9 because the last part of it shows how some stories can continue to develop, but not all and that's what I'm missing, and for "more progress" I don't mean special mention for the future of the characters. In addition to everything else about me I can say - to attract them. It makes you want to leave everything behind you, run to Paris and live the life of a little romance.
