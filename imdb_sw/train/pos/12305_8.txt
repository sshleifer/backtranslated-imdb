It was not quite sure to expect and this, out of a good review of the uniform I read. It leaves, I have never thought of this film, because it is so close to the "White Bride" to work and deal with fantastic. This resembles a narrow line between being farce, comedy, and a good old story of a spiritual story to tell. There is nothing horrible about it, not the theme, it is really a story of love relating to a boy who shouted to a good spirit, who is in trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the person who tries to save good spirits. This also takes place in ancient China, and the Kung Fu exhibition of overseas, with a trip to hell (more or less). Some stop-action ghosts are very cool, and the result of seeing it is the highest level all the way. I could watch this kind of Chinese movies every day, because it is so entertaining, beautiful performances, and good-to-cheerful language. And I expect to watch the first sequel of this movie too. It is highly recommended.
