I thought Hugh O'Conor was surprised as Christy Brown younger, and certainly deserved more recognition for his role. I couldn't believe how he played well. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also good. My favorite part is where boys play soccer and Christy uses his head to stop goals and then refuse the penalty! Amazing performances with two Christys (and others also).
