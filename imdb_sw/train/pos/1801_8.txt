I saw this film when it was released earlier in 1989. I enjoyed it, and I am still doing it now. But what I know now is that this is "adults" for the film and the G level, especially the idea of ​​dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise worked wonderfully together, and the voice of the Reynolds singing fit for a dog junkyard. There are some good songs from upbeat ("Let's Make Music Together") emotionally ("Home for My Heart"). I've found a good plot, though it goes away for once or twice. The last part of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddies I have ever seen in the animation. Relevant movie.
