"Men's Last Hard" are typically western for 70 years. Most of them seem to be led by Sam Peckinpah. Also this, but Director Andrew McLaglan is a student of Ford Ford and this can be displayed in many scenes. IMO start is very good. Somehow McLaglan wanted to show viewers a journey from civilization to the desert. In the third part there is no emotional damage and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He should play an old man called Sam Burgade but is in a wonderful physical shape. I have never had a feeling that she has problems growing on a horse or a rock. For me he did not look very encouraging as he usually do in most of his epic movies. Same goes to the beautiful Barbara Hershey who plays the daughter of sheriff. Perhaps the two had trouble with the director or they were not happy with their responsibilities. Hershey and Coburn do not show the best but still good. If the author had John Wayne in their mind as Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is little used in his role. On the other hand there is James Coburn as the defendant of Zach Provo. Coburn is a very good villain in this. He shows the wicked man among the hatred of maniac and cunning. His role and his acting is the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Themes and Shootouts are strict. The shooting events are blood and violence seems real. Zach Provo and his group had gory and violence events. I am missing the usual western point of the movie. I would like to accept bank robbery or something else. It is generally a flick of the western entertainment. Not a great movie but on average because of the big Coburn, a very good start with some gory and violent events.
