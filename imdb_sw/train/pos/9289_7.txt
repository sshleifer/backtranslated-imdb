In BARBARIAN AND GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real member from the United States who was responsible for opening Japan for international relations in the late 1850s. in 1853. Harris, who came a little later, worked through the details and helped help - many of the Japanese did not have a certain view of the first contract. All this is true and displayed in the film. According to other sources, the romance between Harris and Geisha of Japan is more false and this romance is a lot of direction of this film (therefore, the title). <br /> <br /> My first first text when I saw this movie was one of the surprises. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he is diplomatic in many films, he says please and thank you as he humiliates people !!!! So to see him playing a person who is not working and he can play a diplomatic game appeared very unusual. In fact, I can't imagine so many actors in 1958 who would be more common in this role. By the way, I have seen pictures of Harris and Wayne not quite the same. However, despite the story takes great freedom and grinding it, the film still looks very much. Movie theaters are good, the film shows a good understanding in Japanese culture and culture and acting is not bad. All in all, the most beautiful and visible film has been typed. <br /> PS - Read through trivia for this film. You see more about real characters of life as well as war between Wayne and director (John Huston) where Wayne seems to hit out! Based on what I have learned about Huston and the way he has worked with the actors, this is the event that I believe. And, it is also a good example of John Wayne "diplomacy".
