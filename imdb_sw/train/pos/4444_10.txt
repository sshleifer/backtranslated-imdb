Many Italian lovers seem to hate this film because they are not connected to the first Demoni movies. And for "Demons III" in the head, someone could assume it would be. The problem is that this film has never been excluded as part of a series of demons. Only distributors "Demonic III" on its original name "The Ogre" for money in other popular films. The new American photo of this picture has the name "Demons III: The Ogre" in the art of the box but the film itself says "The Ogre". I don't know if the previous releases had the name "Demons III" on the actual film itself, but this new release seems just to be a little lie. If you can adopt "Demons III" in the head, you can enjoy some "The Ogre". It comes from the intro, and sits well. There are no movies and films of the film slowly, but I am still physically. It's not just expecting to be like other Demons films. I offer "Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try.
