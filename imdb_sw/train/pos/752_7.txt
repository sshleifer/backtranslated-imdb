Four young girls in the Los Angeles suburb are in trouble: sides, drugs, fighters, mixed parents, old lovers. Jodie Foster, a poultry mother type in a packet, tries to put everyone together as a "family" (such as a family she has never had), and something amazing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly, everyone grows and goes. THAT is the correct point of the conspiracy, although it is stressed everywhere, unfortunately it breaks down. What? We really need a long chain with Scott Baio blowing a car full of strokes on his skateboard? Or the longest sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a wonderful soliloquy about "deception pain". Some of the discussion is quite obvious, and I did not have a great edit service at the end of the film which covers clumsily from death to wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is essentially a very sensitive story about losing tight bonds. And Jodie's face at the end speaks. If viewers are faced at the end, the movie has found this. It will not lose its tears or ask for mercy. It shows us an example of friendship and hope we understand. *** from ****
