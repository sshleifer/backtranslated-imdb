The pharmacist tries to steal biological biological weapons, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case with the death agent has been affected. Soldiers can find the case, but the terrorist makes his way to the hotel where he tries to hide. Finally it makes a place where he hides, and "cleaning" a hotel with its residents. Unfortunately it provides its body with disgust, and if you have seen the return of the dead alive, you know what happens next. Zombi 3 has been caused by critics and fans of the same zombie, as a full mess of the film. Although this is a fair assessment, it is not high. For one thing, it has many deaths of blood to make fun of hounds of happiness. There are a lot of zombies who seem to be from everywhere possible. They are in the water, the banners of the house, hide in the trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a dead brush group, just stop attacking as the heroes try to escape. There is even the head of the zombie that hides in the fridge. You see, if the area alone makes Zombi 3 is required to view IMO. It may have a terrible editing and some of the worries, especially from a doctor who will be one of the worst actors I have seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it's better to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't need anything more than your time and clear mind. Zombi 3 fits the bill, and then some. It's more fun if you open a few beers, and look at some of the intellectual friends. I give 8/10, just because you enjoy so much.
