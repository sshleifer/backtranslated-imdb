These deaths are not as blood and violence as Ricky's Story or Super Ninjas, but it shows some of the best fights to fight the history of Hong Kong. Director Chang Cheh builds what many are considered to be his masterpiece. The film launched the work of five men who are dancing. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninjas. To Chui who is Philip Kwok would go on a Ricky and Hard Boiled Story. Any fan of a soccer fan can understand this. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also done by Chang Cheh). But all socky cutting is good and this is one of the best.
