It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels and found this amazing film about two beautiful people who are attracted to the innocent and virgin person as each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 by Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 Series Series (Nicole). Gal and boy, will persuade your heart and soul and make you think deeply in your past relationships and how you want you would have tracked the terms of your heart with a guy or gal you less loved and lost track over the years. Jesse and Celine have a good conversation, and very close to the big magnetic eye between two of them. I expect SEQUEL for this film in 2004 and if you have watched this film, you will hear the same way.
