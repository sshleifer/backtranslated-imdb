I saw the film to describe it completely, how the main character was lost but more precisely about certain aspects of life than the people who mocked (his crash case) was tortured and loved to be tortured! it had this distorted side which was afraid but we were happy to see him coming out of trouble again. It was like a character of a game or a man of the river through a mine land or a enemy and we would like to look at him under a sniper attack or fire but eventually we are happy to see him living ... <br /> <br /> .
