A fascinating story, according to a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) who was accused of killing her daughter. She insists that the dingo took her baby, but the story is very amazing. The film is about the media circles that have taken place near the case, how Australians explained what was presented in the media, and the ideas of the lynch group that eventually led the woman's faith, according to any inappropriate evidence. I like films that ask the media, and also the films that look hard on how people are driving the road and the justice system. I've thought that the juries should show the 12 men who were angry before going with their work. Not so, as it has often said, the films of independence, but looking at the clinics how we as human beings interpret the most basic events about our hatred and the desire to take revenge. The cry in the dark is the clinic too. Schepisi is carefully making film at all of the melodramatic. Others can get a fascinating or dry film, but I have found it.
