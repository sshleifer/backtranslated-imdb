In my opinion of honesty, everyone should see this movie at least once. It is true to put things in perspective as I have looked at. Although it was a lie, this movie is about something that can happen to your children. It shows how two children can hide their hatred for their schools, and their plans to kill innocent students. This film would not work in any other format. They took a hand camera, perfectly. It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris, and Dylan Klebold were killed 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the next media storm. Everyone wanted to see a video of Rampart and everyone wanted to see the lowest. <br /> <br /> This movie is a false version of our full dreams. We can see the child behind the monster. Nothing wrong about this movie, is that it didn't do well on the market, and a few people even know it is. If you had one preview on one blockbuster film, everyone would go to see what a great deal was on, Zero Day. I believe this is best to deal with the shooting of the school of the few who have tried really. The call takes about ten minutes of film and a half hour long, because it focuses on Cal and Andre, and what they did to that point. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it, and watch it. I make sure that the time has been completed, you will have no words.
