This was the first movie "Walking Tall" that I saw, I think on the $ 2 movie film with Hollywood Blvd. , so I had no record of the first phase made by Joe Don Baker. I remember that I have trembled in the damaged system of McNairy County and the brutal gangneck gangs. I was very surprised by the fact that one person decided that he could not allow, and go out to do something about it. Courageous? I thought so-to-point where it sent trouble on my back. I think this movie is a good story about the American courage to stand up and do something about the system that only serves its own interests. I was beaten round about it, and I think this is still one of the best films of a hero / fight hero, which one can laugh but it includes the latest movies like "The Punisher", but even more so because it is actually a story . Recent adjustments around the "Rock" does not justify the actual fire in the story of Pusser's Buford. "Head" that I am sure will revive later.
