I really didn't have to start watching the show until it got to FX. I was bored and I had nothing to look and see that the show references were premiering so I decided to look at it. I was very angry that I did not watch the show when it started opening t.v. I loved so much show! Finally show for everyone to enjoy. I remember All the House and Family and Step by Step and were the same but not just enough. They would make dumb jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not the 70s Exhibition. That 70s shows it was hilarious, smart and so real. I think it was the best show was made and I am so sorry that it has ceased. Although I love this show, I think it should end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was incorrect, Eric was the main character and the show should be finished when his character comes out. I still love this show and I hope the TV will start making more exhibitions like this.
