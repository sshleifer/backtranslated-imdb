The second part (actually part 4-8) of the Danish TV series is a little less than the first, but it has a lot of laughing and scary too. At this time, Udo Kier has two parts, like a son of a monster and his father as a father. Other parts of this stand are Doctor Søren Pilmark's Doctor Krogshoj, who must have a terrible revenge of Dr Helmer, and once again, Mrs. Drusse is trying to solve the mystery, Miss Marple-style. It goes to the stream and follows the deaths of leading executives Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), wondering how they can do Part III, but I hope Von Trier will give it a shot. Sadly, Morten Rotne Leffers, Downs Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, died shortly, too. See Stellan Skarsgård in cameo. ***
