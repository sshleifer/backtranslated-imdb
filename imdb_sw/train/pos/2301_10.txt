Actually ... with a wonderful film that though not very popular ... very touching and almost life changing ... it was for me at least. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my popular movie list ... it's number one now ... <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting movie which All people should see .. <br /> <br /> The man Month ..... we'll just wonder. Now it's my favorite movie and I have seen it today and I would recommend it to anyone who is over 15 as long as you are mature ...... If you try to feel the feelings of the characters then you won't get the true meaning and value of this movie. ... But it's very strange .... just look at it because it will change the way other people look at life .... value seeing 5/5
