This film gives strong views about the Italian people at that time. The use of mirrors to strengthen the revelations of characters is good and I cannot mention the beauty and glory of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love both of you. Their way of interaction is good and natural that you can ask whether or not the camera is actually realistic. The man, in his short role, has also been shown well as an Italian fascist who commands his wife and children, but, in his own way, a loving father. The early events with Hitler in Piazza Venezia and Italy are all amazing and actually puts a historical film. I loved the film and I also admit that it's funny not the most popular.
