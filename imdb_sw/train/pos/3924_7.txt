This 1939 film from director John Ford and author Lamar Trotti tells the false story of the lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his experiment (literally) and his suffering. It is a beautiful film, for good reason made but cannot breathe. The release of Henry Fonda as Lincoln appears to be a mistake, because the actor had a good reputation for that part, even with several flowers with a nose and a false nose he is a very good way for faithful Abe, who was very popular. It is a good attempt from Fonda, who is not something if it is not true, but its miscasting gives us a whole film. The support is better, however, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is very respectable in his treatment of Lincoln, who has been given as a shy of the saint, and in the last movie area goes the way over.
