I was thrilled to see this film at the Rhode Island Film Festival and I was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a good writer and I'd like to see more films. If he could do what he did with the budget of this film, I am very worried to see what he can do with a big picture. Kudos by the stroke of their great performances (the little girl was gold), and for anyone who built music. The beat "Panda Banda Lako" beat me off. Very creative film around .... I hope to see it on a video or DVD because I would like to buy it for a second. If you get a chance, you should see this film completely.
