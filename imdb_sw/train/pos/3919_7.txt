While speaking to Carmen's Bizet, Choreographer Antonio aged (Antonio Gades) brings Carmen (Laura del Sol) a player to make a leading position. Antonio likes Carmen, who is a free and cheerful woman cannot accept personal love. When Carmen is related to another player, Antonio is destroyed by his jealousy as D. José in the opera original, including lies and truth. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another beautiful trilogy movie of Carlos Saura released for the Flamenco dance. The interesting story of love has been developed by the lives of artists involved, and often not known as what is happening (with players) or false (to play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet opera, which depends on the Prosper Mérimée novel. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
