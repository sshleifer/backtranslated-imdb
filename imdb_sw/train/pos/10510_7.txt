This is OK change, but it's not the same as the TV version. Employees are generally the same but I saw Jeremy Northam instead of rain as Mr Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is similar to his English voice is good but again, I prefer Emma Beckinsale's Emma. There are good performances from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> Usually the script is played very much to laugh, the book is comedy, but there is so much to put pieces here, and also the subplot of Frank Churchill is almost entirely. My greatest critic is the theme. It's very lush. The UK has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans could do this like this. Even with these complaints I enjoyed this film but would suggest the adoption of more television.
