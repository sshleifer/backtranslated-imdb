This is one of the best exhibitions of Jodie Foster out there and is largely unsuccessful due to the lack of incorrect publicity as a flick of youth. It has an amazing exhibition, especially the battlefield between Jodie and her mother, played with Sally Kellerman. Three girls who play Jodie's friends are very young but I think it's worth seeing.
