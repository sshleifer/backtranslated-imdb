This fascinating story of white love, envy and revenge was enjoyable even to see on DVD after its PBS broadcast, with a strong image and a crisper sound. My only discontent is that the plot has an impossible time and that some of Manchester's strong permits are sometimes difficult. Luckily the lack of a word here and there will not be unhappy: basic actors are lost. Robson Green brings an exciting smile, a temperament of going-to-break and physical performance for his role as a small surgeon who falls with hope to his boss's wife at the hospital where he has started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most attractive 50-ish women; his opponents of his beauty. (The experiences of these two show better than the words of how old you are about them!) Each of the support characters is given faster and efficiently as well. The combination of pithy and extra chat rooms makes this a good service. As Russell Baker explains in its introduction, you may not have the best quality to look at "Missing" - but you will have much fun. (Sequel, part of the DVD box, provides a two-hour signature still quite satisfactory. You don't want to lose if you enjoy what has come.)
