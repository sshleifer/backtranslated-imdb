Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not just a year was shot but also now. It is a film of art that has not been a short time even in the 21st century. The director emphasized the good story of the story and so made the story become thin! <br /> <br /> The movie reminds me of the future movie of the new wave: Francois Truffaut of "Femme d'cote" which is of the same theme.
