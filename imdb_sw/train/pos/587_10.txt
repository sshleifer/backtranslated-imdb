One of the things about the film that prompted my heart condition was that the dry fishing was a major part of the area. I have often done my favorite fishing moments, if I have closed my streams, and being with my brother and father we spend one day on one river or another we want to test Trout Brown lost and take a jump that has been given to them. We had such incidents that any difference between us was lost and any problem of the world was broken down to be transformed by the glory of absorbing in the activities and environment we were in. This was one of the most amazing things that have been shown to me in the film as a minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly did. For there are cultures on fishing fishing as there is a high culture about many pastimes. You can't just start throwing your line of fishing and hope for the best. You are involved in your surroundings, you have to spread the surface of the water based on how it passes and where the best steps can be flying to you, and according to your level of skill, you can even get your jump up there long enough for fish to explore and hit . The 'Fly Fishing' art was directed and well represented so that they themselves can be considered artists. The name of the film could not be selected properly, because the river had run through the life of the father and the two sons. However, this film is more widespread than family and community in Montana, and the Blackfoot River, where the film is played. It has the ability to draw you, to attract you, to send you, as a family history, a community and a time period. Story story is not just a family history, but a life story. What can be identified as the 'River of Life'?
