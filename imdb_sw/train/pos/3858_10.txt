The US car manufacturer Paul Verhoeven has a variety of quality, but many films made in his native country are a failure. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bi-sex) writer who comes in with a beautiful and wonderful woman. But the woman does not know that she is willing to meet a beautiful girlfriend. At the same time, the author stumbles with a fantastic vision - for the first time it seems like a doctrine based on the misuse of alcohol, but soon he begins to realize that he actually gets some kind of exhibition. Interesting Hitchcockian thriller, original and exciting. I love films that make them think they are about something, but then you realize it's about something quite different. This is one of those movies; excited during the first half, with a surrealist saga of religion during the second half. From a very original, original and blasphemous, it is not for children or people who attend church every Sunday. The greatest exhibition of future director of Jan de Bont. Welcome!
