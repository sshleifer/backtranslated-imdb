I read Holes in Grade 5 so when I heard they were making a film I was happy! Of course, being very busy, I did not have the opportunity to see movies in movies. Holes was on the car-out out of town but, alas, We were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen and none of them invited me! They all said it was good but I have read so many books that made private movies so I was very concerned. Suddenly the chance to see it came. It was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and I was left with babies. My sister, who is 9, and I looked at it and I really liked it! I took them to other people I was in the children's home and their children, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they are critics of the film. In general, I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family values ​​and likes to be thrown to hilarious! This movie should be on your 5 "see" list !!!!
