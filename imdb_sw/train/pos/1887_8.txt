Arthur is a middle-aged child who 'drinks' like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says anything that comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his wealth and knows that he is a broken brat. He uses money for people who do not know and find everything interesting. Arthur must be given a high-grade girl to win a great fortune but he falls in love with a poor minister Liza Minnelli (he seems very strong). This is a very amazing film. I watched this film because the famous Indian film 'Sharabee' depends on Arthur's character. Although 'Sharabee' is obviously directed by 'Arthur' I think it's two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Korny regularly. There are many amazing buttons in the film. It's not a laugh of laughter but it has a wonderful time. My favorite part is when Arthur will meet his father-in-law and continues to talk about 'moose'. Duddley Moore certainly has a comic time. He is very good in words and body language. I liked the area where he speaks standing with a couple living in a hotel on a 'small' country and keeps talking to a husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got Oscar for this film. I don't know that the actress. I don't think he did a good job but it could be if I looked at his work I could agree on later. Modern has flat buttons but not too long. look forward to a good look.
