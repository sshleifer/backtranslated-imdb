I just looked at this because it had a star Josie Lawrence, who I knew / was <br /> from His Number? I was very surprised by this heart and magical gem. It's promotion, touch, and <br /> <br /> romantic without being sappy or feeling. The characters are <br /> <br /> all true people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. See.
