At first my best friend and I sat watching this film, we watched it for Alex Winter's "Bill & Ted popularity". We didn't know what to expect than who and what was over. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over, we knew it was love first. This movie, while not quite accurate historical, was and is better than its kind. I have seen other movies showing the history of this popular season and in my opinion, not one can compare. It was made a little bit of some details, but these places did not remove the beauty and love of the story. I have seen some movies about this summer and I have seen many of them being good, but nothing interesting like this. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has painting features. The colors and settings appear to be something that can be found on the canvas, fixed and copied to the museum or on the walls of the intellectual house. Clothes were good and, although not the most beautiful clothes in the world, made me get a surprise to create that string. The whole movie was placed on Lake Geneva (where I hope to go one day because of this film) and the stability that these historical figures are available there. <br /> <br /> This picture shows, instead of the stability that was found by all the adventists of England's adverse judgment, ignorance that is surrounded by this adventure as well. Yes, there were drugs. It was a common practice at the time, while drugs were not illegal. And taking laudanum (a form of opium liquid) was a drug and entertainment. Shelley suffered from use. Mr Byron hurt the club's foot pain. It was not surprising that there would be strong drug drugs that were theirs during the summer. And they were poetry when the experience was important. There was no time for caution. Passion and experience were a great part of the romantic Era. And out of thought and discussion of science, religion and philosophy came to the creation of the story: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, we see good and free Maria Godwin (not married to Shelley at the time) played with Alice Krige talented and talented. He is the reason for control for everything that goes on until he, too, gives him to experience. But he stands his ground and experience things for his own issue. As it was the power he inherited from his mother and father. <br /> <br /> Artists and artists in this were perfect for the places they played. Music frames. The direction was taken on the essence of summer, if I have read about it. This movie was based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" and Anne Edwards. If you like this film, read the book. The author takes the story from what he could put from the actual magazines God Godwin Shelley and other participants of this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who likes history (even a little unknown from time to time) and romance and gothic, then this is your movie. It shows the birth of that generation, which even today teaches us about the "playing of God." <br /> <br /> A sure you must see the movie!
