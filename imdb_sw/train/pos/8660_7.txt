This is a color movie, but it deserves to learn and enjoy. For the first time, the origin of nature is to focus on Erbe & Dad. Including, the matter of peace goes, what is still at home about graduating from secondary school, and retired and running back waiting for a push to do something. The second time through you realize how bad the sister's husband is expelled by her friends at the backs of the blues bar. He takes, it's a thing to do these days, and when necessary passes as they talk about the weather. In the same area the blues song of a sister is a real skill of tears if you are very young and like that kind of music. His work feels like the top of the story; The story of the blues and good people being "colored people" in their element in backwoods, SC. At the same time, all white people in the movie are leading what seems to be a trivial meaning of life just for making children. That's cool, as long as you realize as a lie.
