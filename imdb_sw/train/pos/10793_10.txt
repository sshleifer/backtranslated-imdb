There are a few vendors in these comments! Contrary to the comments I have read with nativetex4u and a few others, I loved the movie and I would like to see it as a weekly series. <Br /> <br /> I am a fan of Judson Mills but it is also a great fan of Chuck Norris and when I agree that a few of the practical events might have gone a little line, the story of the story fits perfectly with another week's series now appears. The first fifteen minutes of Deke running from bad people after hitting their rockets were a full action. I can't see how many "experts" could not move to the goal of moving, but the point was obvious there with Deke, as a hero, he had to live. <br /> <br /> About comments about requiring "get a movie in capacity to fill the deadline after playoffs." This movie did not have the original CBS settings for a phone call in January and concealed the photos were completed in May 2001, four months before the terrorist attack on the US <br /> If the commentary was listening to the movie instead of trying to avoid , perhaps they could recognize the plot of the story: Rashid, bin Laden as a character, planned to put a nuclear device in the United States. The President of the President was called to find and overcome the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the author should actually check the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
