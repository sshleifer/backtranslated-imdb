This is a mixture of 4 hours of the story of Rider Haggard, with a typical female added by a small part of the Russian soldiers looking for "Stone of Power" buried with the treasure of King Solomon. It has been shot well, giving a clear impression of Africa's broad spaces, and it does very well. Patrick Swayze is the best Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody appeals to Elizabeth Maitland, who employs Quatermain to help save her father. Sidee Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of Russian troops (which are not called in the IMDb list) also did not remember. Because Hollywood cannot leave the good news alone when they pass it, this is told, unless it is too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
