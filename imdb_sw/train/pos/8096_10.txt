First of all, the only reason people who continue to talk about this film is because they cannot stand on a small part of the true story being "changed". Think about what? Peter Jackson's film was not perfect. Ranting enough. This is a very good film. Nature is beautiful and is derived from the famous Tolkein artists. The film covers half of trilogy (Gonga Cooperative and up to Helms Deep Battle in Two Towers) and goes at a good speed. The sound is a high score and many characters seem like I thought. Samwise is very bad for my taste, but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has the best features that support the film. If you love good news of fantasy but hate reading (books are better) make this film try, remember that it has been done 20 years ago. It is also a special note: Peter Jackson's Cooperative Effects follow close to the same string as Ralph Bakshi's (Jackson said as often as he liked Bakshi's efforts).
