Terry Gilliam gives a wonderful film, which I was very happy. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even a little appearance of Christover Plummer makes the movie a totally brilliant! This is the only film of Terry Gilliam that I saw, and twelve apes are evident in my top 10. I think this is one of the best four Bruce Willis movies; and the best Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt provides full performance. One of the best performers of ten actors I have ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) for very persuasiveness. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also very persuasive. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt did very well. For a brilliant story to return good performances; and backward, Terry Gilliam's best leadership.
