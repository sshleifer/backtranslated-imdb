If you like cars you like this movie! <br /> <br /> There are many popular filmmakers, especially Vinnie Jones, with its irrelevant and unpredictable character. There are only a few errors of this film. First, the poor plot, however people do not see this film for conspiracy. Second, the glory of the big robbery (car crime). However, if people believe they can steal Ferrari and stop and look at them well, hope you have a good time in jail! I first sang that Nicolas Cage was doing the main task, I thought first "... sweeet.", But then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" but finally after watching the film I realized "... even he is coming!" .. Just enjoy what he does well. I will remove this regular review by saying "If the crash of the criminals somehow lit up the general audience of the audience as a sharp end under the sudden veneer of a life of crime, and encouraged them to change their ways, then this death is associated with the legacy of nature. And the great glory should be unfortunate. You can say "Poor wrong" I say: "Poor us" <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Look very beautiful!
