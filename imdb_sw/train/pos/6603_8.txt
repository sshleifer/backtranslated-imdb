I should mention two failures for you to understand that this film has succeeded where they failed: "Darkly scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you enjoyed these two movies and you felt a passion (like me), maybe you will enjoy the Renaissance. Enters you into the world of Paris later. Not quite a dystopian. They made the animation very well that I thought it was good, but from what I can say, it was not, it was just catching the motion. Words of the face are amazing! Not since TRON I have seen the world of fantasy has been shown well in animation / diversification. The black and white center is used slowly to direct your attention to the subject area; My popular effect is what they did with the head of the head, see. The director plays with your thoughts and frustrations but is finally completed by looking for a thread that he wants to get. The overall effect is a hard and powerful world of cities filled with little surprise. <br /> <br /> The program is second, but not bad. It's black-ish. There is a backstory for many characters characters to give them detailed depth. There is weather. There are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places Paris. There is a step, and even a car drives. I will need to see this again to find everything. I also recommend very large screens to see it as a "set" is deep and credit is small.
