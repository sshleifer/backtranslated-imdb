The World's Hunting World is a powerful 3D challenge in the world. Planetoids, fragments of buildings and flat plants are spinning around in the atmosphere when the earth towards many characters is falling no place to appear. It is a world that remembers Neverending Story, when nothing came into the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, villain here is the Gobbler of the World, too. This time is a huge dragon of bones and hot eyes. The heroes are the chief fighter of taciturn yet, desperate and desperate to manage the duo entrepreneurial side and the mysterious animal. They join the youngest girl to talk in the world who, in my anger, never die of terrible pain and hope of death. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Sounds and sounds are the top frame. Mystery secret story is as simple as a person can imagine. They are going to stop the Earth's Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. Finally. No real development of character or story continues. Not those I could expect from the film and the plot. Underneath it below: it's something to watch, children will probably enjoy, but that's about it. No depth to this world (planned planned).
