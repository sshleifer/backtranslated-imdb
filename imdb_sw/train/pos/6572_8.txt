One of my favorite films for several years was "End of Action Step"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to destroy my happiness by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can't carry any film that can be supported. <br /> <br /> Adventures of Jake Speed ​​really toys and themes like the same in the Last ... Hero; so I enjoyed getting on the DVD, so I could look at these themes well. Even though the "plot of the plot" involves white bondage during the African civil war, this is not a movie of action. The program that "plot-in-conspiracy" is inside, is really about the question that the film does not intend to solve: Is Jake Speed ​​real person that is helping the heroine to save her sister from a white businessman trader; or is it really a false character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the world that really just exists in a series of pulp of the pulp)? I suggest that this is not all that is clearly stated in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are familiar with this. So the film becomes a presentation of what the audience may want from the world of stories "stories of adventure". That is a wealthy topic, most likely that is reduced by a good sense of film and hate. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses for the film - especially the cinema, which makes the film look like TV show. And pacing does not sag sometimes. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure living, however silly. And I see only interesting idea that this adventure is actually amazed at the novel. <br /> <br /> Holds down a lot of comments-show good!
