Five years from the Tenko victims return home, and from the same "Mari" of Marion. Now it's 1950: at the time of reconciliation. This group is here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and Maggie and Alice members. Revealed stories are beaut: as fully written and made, and as it leads to stimulation and moving, as the previous series. All questions left to be executed at the end of the series answer here. From the Marion family to Joss's health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything changed for the better. Domina plant trips bring many injuries and some edge of the tension to the tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, again, finally takes more with women struggling for their lives. Dominica finally shows its true colors, and there is a time of sound-and-telly festival. <br /> <br /> Vote for the Singapore movie site, and the opportunity to capture with a group of women who feel like they have been friends. It's a shame if this is really the last. I could look again. Perfection.
