I did not have many expectations from this film, but I was very surprised, for it is lighter and interesting and it has proved very well. The main trio of the deadly bike was wonderful enjoyable as they spread and clowned their way through their mid-drug trafficking Wales. Humor was gentle and prudent, in fact as those three characters (witnessed the treatment of the tenderness of a small businessman). The rural Wales Wales was fully captured, and the sound of the voice was well chosen. Carefully and carefully, very carefully in detail - I have never seen a true picture of alternative culture - I felt that I was with them. Very light in contact and full of fun - not what you can expect from a film about bikers and drugs. Happy on both sides, and hard to refuse, although I thought that the last two things were lame - the film should be finished when they left Wales. But in general, the unexpected treasure of the film.
