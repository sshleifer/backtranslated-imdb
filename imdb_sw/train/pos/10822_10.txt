I was lucky to see this film many years ago in England. I have seen hundreds of films since, but I've never forgotten this one. Although Sinatra was playing a very unpopular character, she was better in the role. Many people seem to think that did'nt really come in himself up to his position in "From Here to the Universe" but in my opinion was the greatest in Concho. Another role in my mind is William Conrad. I didn't see or hear his story before this film. Conrad has a great place in this film. I remember his deep and gray voice and he uses it to enhance the few words he says and the danger that sets the tone of his character. The best film and my only desire is that I have never had the opportunity to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the surface of the earth. I see in the names that says that the film is black and white but when I saw it was really full color, I remember the blue shirt of Sinatra.
