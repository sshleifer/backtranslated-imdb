Soldiers may have a special impact on academy or Lucas but it is obvious to me. I will not tell you what it means, I am sure you have already read the summary. This is the main problem of modern prediction / false science. Kurt Russell cannot speak too much, often looking to look or appear on his face but fit character. There are great steps to combat events; some events cannot think, but that Hollywood makes the world believe that we should avoid our normal life. I haven't seen Army 2 but this is one of my favorites. I am fortunate to have a wife who sings to a young movie; we both love this film and we recommend to anyone who likes hard movies / sci-fi.
