Garde à Vue should appear several times to understand the smaller plots. If you are used by French films, according to negotiations and war wits instead of actions, do not even try to look at them. You will only get the weight of death, and make sure that the French movies are not for you. Garde à Vue is a film with words, the basis of the dialogue (written by Audiard by way) and cruelly reduces the exhibition ferry. Why does Mainetre Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be an unfair defendant of being a child killer instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder she had a 18-year-old girl who had a sexual relationship with her 8-year-old. The only "pure and innocent" element of his sad life.
