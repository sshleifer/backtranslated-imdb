I was lucky to get a copy of the most recent DVD and now I have seen it for 2 hours. At 1 hour it was a television night in Australia over the past 20 years but I can't forget this wonderful and angry film. > <br /> Many people do not like this film completely because it is unusual - the fact that there is hardly a conversation discussed at this point - we just hear the thoughts of the characters - it's just one odd part of it. Finding a copy of this film I have found that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, not saved in any UK TV or films, which were not given on a video or DVD, that television networks worldwide became active after The title of their copyright was lost in 80 years. When it was first shown on TV in Australia there was no recording equipment for users. <br /> <br /> In a second look soon, I could see why it was not remembered. Sometimes it's too timeless and infinite claustrophobic line as a game of Harold Pinter action. Again, if anyone wants a copy of this DVD to please email me and I'm sure we can work out to prevent Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
