I have finished the first grade in the 4-dis collection (26 episodes) created in collaboration with UCLA & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (far from section 1), the quality of the image is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as I saw the first (5 years at a time) and Wally Cox is really pleasing in this role. If you are in a pleasant atmosphere that comes upon you, as opposed to hit you on the head, you will enjoy this opportunity to get all the wonderful characters you can remember from your childhood. Although some gags are a little corny, many are ingenious and well implemented ... and even corny are fun. This is a series of TVs that live up to my childhood memories.
