The sammo has 10 out of 10 for this movie if it has everything. A beautiful story, good fight, wonderful characters and great messengers. <br /> <br /> This film sees dick wei take billy chow and chong oil. sammo takes lau kar leung in casino, sammo loses a fight but is fighting is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in. <br /> <br /> The big time and touch in the film, ying ying lights climb on the cameo and is killed off - gutted. The last sequence will reach them with a restorative bond, as one of the last final battles I saw. sammo takes the burdens of young people and ends up reaching billy chow.
