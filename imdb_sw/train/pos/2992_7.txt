It seems even the director does not like this film, but for me I think he is becoming very tough on himself <br /> <br /> Certainly not perfect, but there are some atmosphere shots, and stories are good enough to keep you all interested. It is scored on what appears to be a very beautiful village that adds the atmosphere as well. If you like horror movies were hit in the UK, do go. <br /> <br /> I have just seen a trailer for these recent filmmakers 'Chairman of the Devil' which looks quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Not enough English for fear of films for me, so anyone who comes is worthy of our priority, and this is not as bad as you can think
