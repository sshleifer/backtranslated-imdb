This movie is very special. It's a very good movie. Which begins with three orphans, Sho, Shinji's brother and their friend Toshi, They are poor children, live on the street, but one day they managed to steal the purse, and then they could live, buy a home, and their lives seemed to be better. They make new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong and it becomes an enemy and it all ends up killing one another. I was negative about this film at the beginning, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer at L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, all very popular in the country Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwan singer are trying to become actors, but this is not like other singer singers. They are doing a good job, and without previous experience on movies (except Lee-Hom, who was in two movies before). <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's a little bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it's this movie that made me discover. Well, Gackt (playing the main character - Sho orphan) was part of the group that wrote the script, and he was the one who insisted that Hyde should play Sho, Vampire Kei. At that time they did not know, at least not as friends. But after the movie became a very good friend, it also shows us that they worked hard on this film and that they had good cooperation. <br /> <br /> Movie has many different sensations that drive stories, Love, Hate, sadness, bitterness, sadness, happiness and so on. I think the first time is the best, it's very good. After people die, leave Kei and every change. But it's still a good movie, it's the only movie that I've ever done, crying, so sad, but it's still good. So if you haven't seen this movie, you should. Because it is wonderful, but sad. You can't regret it. ^^
