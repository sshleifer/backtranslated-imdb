This is one of my favorites all the time. It's very simple and sweet - definitely chick flick romantic comedy. In fact I love the film full of good quotes and this hasâ€¦ one of my loved ones is when Albert Einstein says to Ed Walters "Do you think what I think" and Ed says "Now what is the situation!" amazing as you can watch it regularly and get the same amount of enjoyment from it, and for this, you can !! I also enjoyed the way of Walter M.s to show Einstein. I think all the characters are coping well with the story flowing well. There are so many times that I find an exciting one with a film and quote my favorite lines as I look! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys romantic romantic comedy regularly!
