I thought the film could be more complicated, in a psychological sense perhaps, but the action and sound of the work was a high score. Animation was a CG heavy in many cases, but it's very good there. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever films, which includes romances and Wayne's conflicts. 007 fans would like this, and so women would be a great song of the theme! Wayne was shown very well in this film, and Penquin returned to its true form, no mutant genes in it at this time! I loved the truth Robin was not much used, Tim Drake was a good player of the computer, a certain child of Indigo or the future mind. The casting hand was built by some opera soap star, beautiful talent and characters were attracted to look like voice actors as well. Kelly Ripa was a carpenter in this film. <br /> <br /> I tested this under Phantasm, Return of the Joker, and Batman against Dracula, but liked the white script better than I enjoyed the Subzero. 7/10
