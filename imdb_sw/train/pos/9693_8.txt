I was very surprised by this film. I was touched by the life that Paulie touched on her way to get "marie" a little girl separated from her. Humor was also very good and did not hurt the story as I thought it would be. I really expected "paulie wants a joke" to hurt this film but even that was done in a very exciting area that touches the time of the laboratory conference. So if you want to see a "beautiful animal" who says "film look this one out, better than DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has an amazing end at the end that is done very well too."
