Yes, I have seen "They all laughed" when they came to see what happened to Europe around 1982 and they kept an undeniable but loving memory. I have seen again on the tape, nearly twenty years after ... Bogdanovich has genuine sympathy from its characters and the compassion of mercy that is hard not to feel too. Good players and actors, all good lines and for everyone with good editing, too. I laughed at it all the time. As we all do, sometimes. Go find it.
