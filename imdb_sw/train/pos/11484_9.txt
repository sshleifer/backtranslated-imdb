I came back from the first of Montreal's Zero day ... and I wonder if hell find a negative view on the movie. Basically the blame is on Coccio to make a simple social and emerging message ... well, Mr.-I am a reviewer, is a simple critic and a player of movies and social payments. It's not that I want to disclose my life here, but I come from a small town that has a school than these do not go. Reject and ignorance in the menu. Thing is ... I understand how young children can be run to make that fear. Secondary schools have become fields of war. It is very bad eyes. You need to fight your way to be like others. It is difficult to explain, many people do not know that secondary schools are cemeteries of human minds. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and exciting about how their lives in their beautiful neighborhood are complete. The real intention of the movie is not about what it runs. It is about this neighborhood as the death of glory and everyone closes his eyes and tries to create this perfect city. Cal showed well. It's a wake-up call. Drama is everywhere and can take every shape. In this case the small games (such as Andre is called fagot for wearing the J.C Penny shirt) are building the worst of the whole city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way to describe their pain. Disease in the era in which you need more than never be like others accepted. I especially like the last events where some people are missing Andre's Cal crosses, as if with the pain they had communicated, Cal & Andre had communicated with their anger to their community, their refusal to consider the reasons for other actions. It might seem to be a mess like a movie, but Coccio is more reflective than stretching or encouraging. What Andre & Cal live is a fact ... and scary that can get other kids. Exciting Movie ... Creating a home with a strong feeling has been developed by Ben Coccio making a very tough and troublesome movie.
