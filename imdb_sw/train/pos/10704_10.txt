Are you a giraffe? ... ask John to Nadia, and he, sure to answer well, responds: yes. In this way start a conversation between a man and a woman who do not know, and at the same time, questions and doubts in the "Birthday Girl". Movies I have heard many times, but I don't know ... up to two hours of writing this. The "born baby" is a passionate movie that makes me fall, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actors (Besides she is good and intelligent) I saw. "Birthday" is the story of a single and ordinary person who looks at a woman on the Internet. A woman who gets from Russia. She seems to be that beautiful, ordinary woman, not more. One day, at his birth comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. The man, begin to discover some things. Since then, he can not be a single and ordinary person who has always been. Most of us will think that this film is only common and the plot is lost. Most of us will think that the steps and desires are sure and not a novel. But the "girl of birth" is just the opposite. This movie is filled with beautiful surprises, beautiful performances and a plot of thinking that I have never seen and thought. This romantic thriller with some strange touch is the best natural film and a lot of the same kind of movie suggestions. "The girl of birth" has some beauty and deception in its events, but at the same time, a certain nature of touch, and makes it more. <br /> <br /> "Child born" sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, it's quite satisfying. And I don't know that this is the hub. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for errors ... well, if there is.
