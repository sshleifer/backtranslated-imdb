The movie was good, except for some events with Esposito. I was pleased with how they connected each detective in a series, and were closed some programs that have not been resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was good to see Pembleton and Bayliss together for their people, and the basic people. Braugher and Secor did a good job, but as usual they were ignored. It is painful to see that this is the end of the murder. Memory, region, and return to CourtTV are not the same as watching it every Friday. But the movie did its work and did very well, giving a great example of life after the retirement, and the family relationship that was between the unit. I enjoyed this much.
