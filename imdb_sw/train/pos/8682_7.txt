I am sorry to say that I do not agree with other people during this Columbo period. Death brings hand to the fact of Columbo's fascinating variety. After a few times, I get tired and change the channel. I love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weak in this part than in others. First, Robert Culp conducts a study of Ray Milland's behavior. He hires to examine his beautiful wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is concerned. In return, Culp's character defines the wife of the deceiver who plans to open her plan for her husband to destroy her work. In anger, Culp kills him by blowing his face and strengthening the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I didn't care about this at all. Of course, Columbo finds the end. It's just a question of how.
