De Palma creates an amazing story that begins with the start of exciting and creates a confidential problem with a serious charge. The end and the conclusion is the 'night of the night' especially is the edge of your seat seat. However it is even more amazing though it is the elegance of De Palma who gives this film not only to insist but strictly the situation with the darkness itself. He is wearing a kill is also a very interesting film, but especially in a very good way. Pino Donaggio also gives you a good color of music on the film. <br /> <br /> Posted by another feature of this film. Michael Cain turns out to be sharp in mind. Angie Dickenson is as wonderful as the wife of a sick house. Nancy Allen's performance as a roadblock is strong. Keith Gordon also shows that he is a qualified assistant as a son of observation. Many are criticizing De Palma's films for having Hitchcocki items and this film was not different. But any similarities between Hitchcocks work with De Palmas can only be seen as good quality, as the call of this film 'abolition' would be destructive to good thriller. Wearing to kill you must see for all fans of movies. <br /> <br /> **** out of ****
