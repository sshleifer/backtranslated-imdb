I lost this for my child who recently received interest in 9/11. He was a Kindergartener at the time and was not aware of what happened. I loved how it was described as "document." If there was one film that I would suggest to see about 9/11, this is YES! Usually you see a film with actors who are known. This movie had no known person. Also, you see about 9/11 film, you hear about fire fighters or two lose their lives to save people. I didn't feel this was with any of it! I just lost this movie and of course I will consider adding to my collection! It's done very well! My heart comes from victims and families of the 9/11 victims!
