Of course when you read my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most popular characters. I just love the idea of ​​a damaged brat and a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. See movies and imitate characters etc. etc.. I like the event when the stone defines the mouth of Kader when eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor tells the story of Raja Babu's document on the dinner table and Govinda wearing a uniform-fashioned uniforms makes a beautiful expression. That's my favorite movie movie. 'Achcha Demand for Chalta Hoon' main is just a chemistry among two Indian actors who do the comical area without negotiations. Its beauty. It's a cat's cat's mouse. Just see these respondents helped each other and still remove the area from each other. All its entertainment. If you would like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then you should. I think RB is 6 in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precedes this film gem. 7/10.
