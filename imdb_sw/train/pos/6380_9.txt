Atlantis: The lost dollar is a better movie than I thought. I've never thought this movie will lead to my expectations. True, this film started slowly, but if the movie wore on it it became more with my love. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in the Atlantic fabled. With his grandfather's friends, he enters on his amazing wonder. On the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, faith, and more. Sound sent is beautiful. In fact they know how to carry their movies and only their talent. Music is not something special but it is worth it. Animation is not good, but it's still good. In general, this is a good family movie for all ages. I am photographing this 9/10 film.
