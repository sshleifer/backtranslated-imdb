Anyone says pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is the most beautiful. I even cry when Celebei died. I don't lose a lot! This film is an interesting thriller interesting. <br /> <br /> In the fourth phase of the pokemon, Ash and friends should stop the bad jerk to make Celebei the last weapon with his black ball. At that time, Sam and Celebei are walking in time and continue to be driven by game hunters. I love the part and the double battle with Sam has the poker apricorn (if you have played gold, silver, or glass, you know what it is.) Setting the last movie was a great idea. Pokemon in this movie lives more lives than ever.
