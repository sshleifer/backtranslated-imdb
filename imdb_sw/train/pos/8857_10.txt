Director Sidney Lumet has done art works, like the Web, Day of the Day of the Day or Serpico. But, he was not very fortunate about his recent work. Gloria (1999) was sympathetic and I found the Judgment was amazing, but it didn't try. Now, Lumet brings his best film for many years and, to my opinion, the real hub: Before the Devil knows you are dead. I think this film is like a Lumet revision. This film has a good story which, in detail, has many variables So, I think the end of the film is perfect. The exhibition is brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, good performance with him, of course, is one of the best actors of our day. my. His performance here is great. Some of the cast are also better (especially, Albert Finney's great) but these two actors bring great exhibitions that were ignored by bad Oscars. The film has a huge amount of power, part of the etc. for the display and, in part, thanks to the brilliant screen. Before the Devil Knows You are a real masterpiece and perfect orientation, great screens and excellent displays. We need more movies like this.
