I was born in 1982. Many of my childhood memories are in the 80s and 90s. I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19 years old. And I found it hilarious. <br /> For anyone who thinks that something "date" can 't be quite funny 30 years later .... think again! It's funny even if you don't have an idea of ​​70, and the pants of the bottom of the bell makes you enter. Who can compete with Bozo's clown type who reads adult books? There is plenty to laugh. The end of the last puppet show is the best.
