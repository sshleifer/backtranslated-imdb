A very good film set at the beginning of the 60th communist Yugoslavia. The five actors who are young in the middle of the story provide detailed, realistic and emotional presentations. A clear indication of how natural and naivete belief in young people can be easily distributed and thus affected their entire lives. It is highly recommended.
