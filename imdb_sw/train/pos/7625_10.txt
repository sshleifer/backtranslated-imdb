Although Kurt Russell had perhaps the closest person looked like Elvis in the business-show, many things were false in this film. First, the creators demanded Elvis to open his famous exhibition in '69 after 9 years of filming with a white run suite made in 1972. They also claimed that he sang 'a great love' which he sang in 1972 and 'wonder of you' which he first wrote in 1970. They also say that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all fans of Elvis know he got for his birth. I know all the movies in the past have been false but these things are obvious to people who love Elvis.
