First of all I saw this film without knowing anything about it I knew only that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see this in a Danish film festival called a night film film which many different films are shown after a concert that pretty much focuses on showing movies that are not shown otherwise in Danish movies. <Br /> <br /> However my friend and I went to see it and we were surprised how real it was and that it struck us with our senses, we had entered the plot without knowing how to finish the most of our book. The film is written in style that reminds me of the Danish design "95 technique" which was developed by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier (Dancer in Darkness). In conclusion the movie is very important to see it gives a different perspective on how things were in the US GI Joe from school was expected to serve their country in the long battle from home. <br /> <br /> Also Colin Farrell is unique in this movie I haven't seen before but I can't wait to see more of it.
