This will be much less. First, do not listen to critics, since it is not as bad as many say it !! Sniper uses the most common form of a movie, which many immediately reject as a film. While the sniper does not reflect the 100% reality of how our Military Snipers are working, it gives those who don't know anything about the Artist in the Sniper world. And yes, the film has many errors, but what kind of film is not good? There are many good events and good acting with Tom Berenger. I say that the 2 worst scenes at the beginning of the movie by Billy Zane in Helicopter followed by Zane in the bar of the Marine Bar. The best place in Sniper includes Berenger in the middle of the field and the power to resist has emerged !! There is also a lot of beautiful shots of jungle and some classic shots using the camera as you are looking for a riflescope way. And yes, Motto's Sniper is 'one shot, one kill'. Judge Sniper himself! <br /> <br />
