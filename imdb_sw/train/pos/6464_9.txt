Wow I loved this movie! It's about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's about things that everyone meets in life. You have to do things with enthusiasm. But some people don't appreciate your enthusiasm and they will try to stop you. There are people who find the views of others and 'neighbors think' is more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone's opinion stop you from achieving your dream and passion. I loved the fact that all actors were ordinary people, could be my family. There is no great beauty, but all people like and during the film.
