This film is the first trilogy community of trily Miikes, and trilogy kicks for a great start. The movie in the trilogy is only connected, and these themes are obvious in all its films, if you're approaching. The Shinjuku Triad Corporation is on a soldier trying to prevent his younger brother interfering with a very large member of the outside group, struggling their way up to Tokyo's top. A baby child is a lawyer, and a group of triad is increasingly needing one, as the movie continues. The movie takes place in a very bad situation, and therefore it is a good and difficult violence. Miike has done the worst, but since this is a great movie strikes you very hard. As always there is also a lot of false sex, especially homosexuality in this one. The movie is in many ways the most common gangster movie, but with a big car with real grittiness. If you have seen the best Miikes films (This is a killer, Fudoh etc.) this is worth checking because it is a kind of compromise between its high-top cruel style shown on those films and its greatest side, as shown in other films trilogy. And often with Mike, there are at least two cases in this that you will never forget (see and know for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
