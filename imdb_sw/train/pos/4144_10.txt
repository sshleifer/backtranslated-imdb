At one point I failed in a trap where I found myself looking at independent and foreign movies and lying to me that I loved them. Fatty Drives Bus is an exception. It's true. It's the best movie "bad" ever. <br /> <br /> "The evil" of this film appears to come naturally. Half of the way through the opening of Satan, the word "Hell" appears under the screen. The most interesting Bridget is a person who has no problem in clothing and clothing. It takes a female couple who keeps trying to kill each other by constantly walking down the stairs. Jesus walks in the sound of the funk sound. However, fuel provides a sense that a person has lost his reward by advising a senior film project. But it is the fidelity of how bad it makes it so wonderful. You feel the creators know that it will be bad, but you never forced it. Do not be recommended for surprises, Oil for advertising. Highly recommended.
