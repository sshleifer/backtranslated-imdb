Influenced by the popular films, the milling-milling machine to see this Halloween which I have seen over and over again, I used the opportunity to "Sentinel", hoping that it might get my juicy juices circulating again. Recall, I had just come from seeing the record of the Dark House "House on the Haunted Park" - completion and despair. Interestingly, "Sentinel" NOW! In the riviting story of the example that enters the welcome building in Brooklyn Hights, the film provided everything that I hope to find in a good film - (1) The names and best of juicy, exchange and discussion, including the return of hilaraious and Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and in particular, Martin Balsam, as a missing professor - (2) Fear of Horror! It does not give away the image, but there are instances in this film that locked me in my pancreas - (3) A wonderful Gore, awesome and wacky (if not very deserved) from Michael Winner, which flows easily with this non-treat. If you loved "Evil 2", "Dead" and "Raise" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after looking at it for the first time, jaw-dropped, go over and watch it again. Now it is one of the most popular interests. Make yourself grace and watch!
