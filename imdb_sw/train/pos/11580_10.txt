As another inspector says the Battle of Hanna is the best film about the best man, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become a Jew of Joan of Arc. Unfortunately when I came out of the opinion I do not agree that Miss Detmers as leadership is very good to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. Actually to me his performance was not accepted by its beauty but it makes it even greater in the fear of sadness as a face he faces. Maruschka Proves performance is a hero, pleasing, comes out or understandable, and is completely reliable. In other words to me "In the area." from the opening of credit. If you would like to learn about someone else's suffering for something that they believe and carefully consider the War of Hanna and Maruschka try. My hat is also closed by Ellen Burstyn as the mother of Hanna who is a famous and famous actress who could make the effort to walk with the film. It is therefore the effort of the team's perhaps two actors' but not the All About Eve.
