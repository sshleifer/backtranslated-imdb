With all the honesty, this series is like the classic (if the television goes) as the original poem is for world literature. In addition to being brilliant, it is a good and decent provision of one of the western cultural texts. I was transferred to the problem of Odysseus and his supporters; touched by the game of the fall of Troy (which seemed but does not appear); they were impressed by how the gods played with the fate of mankind. (It should be noted that the gods seen here are not CGI's ignorant creatures around their wings of the foot, or the bad models of the bikinis. As in Homer's work, they do through death agents or, rarely, is represented by a typical statuary). It is compassionate not available on DVD, especially due to low and positive changes to the Odyssey which one can find in the video stores.
