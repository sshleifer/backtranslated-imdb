After seeing all "Fear of black hats" and "This is the Wind of the Wind", I can honestly say that at the same time, both movies must see. There will be many times in the "fear" that will be with you in hysterics. It is not surprising that both films have a great service following. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Buy it if necessary, but the only way to fully enjoy this film is to have yourself.
