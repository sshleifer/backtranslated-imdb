Japanese animators have special freedom and animation, that is why they are able to come up with such movies, movies that end up on anime-fans and college students, but are completely ignored by anyone outside their country nature. Sheep is one of those films that, from the West, should have knowledge of drugs or in-depth analysis. True, it is a very surrealist journey that is very beautiful. There is no real dialogue, which makes it easier to pass other non-interested parties like subtitles. Kika and half-dead (brain-dead?) Sister travel through various themes of thought and corporate. There is a general topic of water, or its lack (perhaps because of the cat dropped at the beginning? Maybe because of the head?). There is an interesting variety of Genesis to take. There is a pig that wants to eat itself. Elephant made with water. And it is beautiful, exciting, exciting, and fun - if you don't look around with drugs that can't see anything that has been seen without comparing the journey of acid. Finally the film turns out, adding another level of personal pressure to the trial. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
