Greetings again from the darkness. Expecting, the comedy from the author / director Richard Shepard is a party that comes to Pierce Brosnan actress. The Bond Messenger has gone. This new person is nothing else! You have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was a very good boy for this role of plum, but Brosnan shows that it is a perfect Julian Noble, "Guide" ... and it's a very good thing! Do not like how exciting it is in this. If you are going, you expect the corners of the horn and the eye of all kinds of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else you can think is wrong. Brosnan takes the best script on another level with its amazing face and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (or without a button) is fun to see. Greg Kinnear is a good person for Comic Brosnan and has a lot of time and comic while making a click co. Hope Davis has a small, but very powerful role as a Kinnear wife (what is her name "Bean"?) Who happens to get a little excited when she has a supervisor in her bedroom. The photos and settings are perfect - including the bullfight village, racetrack and Denver. And how many times do we get killers and Xavier Cugat on the same sound? This is obviously not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a little facility and you enjoy the film making, it can be yours.
