This is 10 of the first 10 that I have given any film. What made this movie good for me? Regular step - no small part, acting good, writing smart. I also liked the style of photography where shakiness and different angles only made you feel like you are part of the scene. Finally, I see an action film that does not try to enjoy all public sectors (ie no romance romance). I liked the first Bourne movies, but I loved this Warning - after watching this film, you will be full of adrenaline and you might want a little quiet before driving your car!
