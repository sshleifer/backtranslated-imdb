Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men are coming to find sharks and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane likes Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men loves Jane and has decided to take her ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rarity - good who is better than nature. "Tarzan, the Ape Man of 1932 was good but he had a special tragic effect and sort of dragged. This has a more positive effect and is the most adult. There are tons of discrimination (black man being shot because of death - and nobody cares) but this was 1934. There is also a lot of blood, gore and violence (for 1934 movie) swimming under swimming! There is also an explicit sexual content with Tarzan and Jane dressed near something and (means) they sleep together and have sex - unmarried. This will not disturb anyone today but in 1934 this was very good. <br /> <br /> That aside, the movie is well-run, highly moving and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in the skimpy fabric is certainly treating with eyes and Jane's dress is pretty revealing too. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is the same. <br /> <br /> This is a simple Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. WELL worth seeing but not for kids!
