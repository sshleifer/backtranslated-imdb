The clever script from SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT of the late and beautiful performances from two men leading - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should be a roundabout way) causes exciting and exciting. Add to the appropriate direction from the old JEAN HERMAN elder and a small but effective and FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX model, it becomes easier for this film to have an infinite quality. This is a friend of a friend or a cohesion of two adult stories, both tired and tired of the world, returning, maybe from Algiers. As the other colonial powers of this time (after WW II leading in the 60's), France endeavored to keep international exhibitions. Loss Algiers was a painful blow. ADIEU L'AMI (original name) writes the actions of our two heroes (fighting) when they are fighting for their journey, after discharge. One thing happens after another, and the viewer must look, because JAPRISOT is lean and economically with his script: if it is, then there must be a reason. It should say, these two men are fighting, physically and psychologically, at the end of one week. Their activists are quite different, their goals are different - their lives are completely dependent. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON differ out - the old, certainly a good boy, and the end of the bad necklace, adds to chemistry. That effort makes a good story, which, on the other hand, makes a good film. Don't worry that there are women in this film, and in fact the way to Japrisot, they are also remembered, though not very close; say much more will lose a person's happiness in discovering their true nature. FAREWELL, MSHAMI INSTALLING UK; IMAGE OF ANAMORPHIC, 16.9 IN; IN ENGLISH English (not even the headlines of hearing hard); MINUTES TO USE 110; MONO SOUNDTRACK but the music of DE ROUBAIX has multiple punch! It is highly recommended.
