Pialat films in a state of emotional distress, usually with several violent incidents. In La Gueule open, she is dealing with a negative impact on the husband and wife of a woman dying of cancer. In A nos amours, a young girl's inquiry causes a violent race with her family. Here we have a young woman who has lost her husband to take a beautiful old girl. His inspiration is little clouds, since Loulou cannot read or discuss anything more challenging than TV shows; on the other hand, he has a good body (I wonder why Depardieu never did a film film to show that physique - he would be as good as rugby player) <br /> <br /> Giving is awesome. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give bland, excessive performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays with Loulou with all the power and charm you might want - look at the bar area, which is beaten in the gut, runs and seeking treatment, then begins again with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with these coal eyes looking at trouble, plays Nelly's husband with beauty; is a well-merged merge in Coup de foudre.
