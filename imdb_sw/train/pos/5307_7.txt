"Pecker" is a small, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes the biggest star in the public, the media and the local art gallery and its pictures depict the reality of the dirt of everyday life like dirty underwear or human tablets. It is a common topic of the independent stadium of John Waters Baltimore to show the wonderful sides of the American way of life between the political precision style and conservative backlashes for exploring the nature of the middle class of its city. Edward Furlong's "Terminator 2" popularity plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, author of the story of Patricia Hearst and Long Water Mink Stole. Although the movement of the plot becomes a big mistake sometimes and can not compete with a sudden sudden attack of the most powerful "Meri Mama", it still has a good laughter in it and some of the most unpredictable pictures as a former junkie woman who became a vegetarian The vegetable by hitting the peas from the vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a great comedy on the pride of the art area, the media hypes, the middle of the angst sex and a wonderful way of how to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
