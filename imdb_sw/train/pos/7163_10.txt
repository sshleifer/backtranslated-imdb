I loved this film very much ... I had started reading a book and I would like ... everything was created and everything had a purpose ... I think this film did very well because Louis Sachar wrote screenplay. and of course Andrew Davis led ... Shia Lebouf gives good performance to his first film ... storyline is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and strength ... it's similar to the book. it's not a little boring ... I love it so much ... and I encourage anyone to read the book completely. In all this film it is very good to put together and carefully ... stand up every way
