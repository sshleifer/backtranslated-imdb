The 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns early, and we do not allow the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who cannot look at a wonderful lady (played with Dutch Maruschka Detmers) who lives near the school. One day, he follows her, and she continues to pay. There is only one problem: He has been linked to a sketchy (Riccardo De Torrebruna) character who can do or has not done a violent crime, and if he jumps out, perhaps he will be released and executed on his hand. Also, a young woman is a little "funny in the head", and this is approved when we discover she has seen the father of a boy, who is a psychologist. Giulia's emotional stability is similar to its sexual desire. Fire, fire, fire, from word to word, with good leadership and bombing from Detmers, who loves us as yo-yo (as the boy does from the scene to the location, and insists enough to put us on the right to - and even after - end. Available in version R and X (!) Rated.
