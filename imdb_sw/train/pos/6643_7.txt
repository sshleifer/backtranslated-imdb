When I heard that this film was coming out of the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I realized it was a book, written in 1978, I had to read it before I saw the movie. I am sure that the film would be different from me if I had not read the book. The authors actually did a good job of staying true for the main plot of the book, and a small difference, usually. I think the thing that made me very despicable about the movie was Boyle with Col. I am not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that no matter what the time of the movie, he tries to use him more -plumped lips, and dark makeup-ed eyes make himself super sexy. In fact, I think that the movie was real to the real joy of the house. My favorite subplot was the family of Sheehan (which is so weird b / c baby was killed in Iraq and in the current cases there is Casey Sheehan whose mother made a huge tirade of Iraq). In the book, the war was not in Iraq, but instead, Vietnam, and when the house returned to the child video in the helicopter, I was being beaten. In general, I was fascinated by the film, since it followed this book very well.
