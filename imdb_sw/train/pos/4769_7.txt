I am sure this is no one's show is that the clan of and can think of her good; after all is located near the Baywatch Hawaii. With cast, place, leading style and its broadcasting? shows women around the beach and all that. No wonder people have wrong views and decide to look at them. It was their mistake to do so. Because after deciding to look at the show, there are actually more things going on, juicy real stories and conflicts, turn it into a really exciting look and pretty much ?? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of hotel clerks, manager, owner and their hard life of love. Also enter a guest hotel with a strong man trying to steal a hotel. It's really more exciting than shown here. I don't want to deny that dry uses but not bad that you will look away. Stories are not very strong but very good. Sound sound is very appropriate to the situation and action is at all times. I took a few parts before you had anything to happen with power to be patient. Suggestions: I really enjoy watching This. Zillion Times Better Than Expected <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br />
