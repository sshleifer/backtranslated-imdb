Two shopkeepers in a leather shop shop are kept secret as they are written under the box number. Within this simple concept and everyday environment, Lubitsch offers a good wit fabric, drama, wind and pain that has not been able to. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as ordinary couples with real feelings and tension, and some of the well-developed characters have their own plots and jokes. Although poorly restricted to Stewart's 39/40 movies (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith) this is very simple and we enjoy many types of work that do not appear in other films.
