WOW! What - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not a fan of all modern Italian directors. Usually do not like dramas. I'm not a fan of Will Smith even thinking that he is a very good actor ...... but this film! It is a very great movie consisting of the original script and good direction and good acting ... wow ... it's stunning. This movie focused on my minutes for a minute and even I did not like the "Looking for happiness" (maybe also because I did not act in Will's son who is the worst actor when children are often seen as born-born actors, I saw him too last night in "Day which the world was standing "and I confirmed my feelings that Jaden cannot do. I don't want to write vendors and so I'm not talking about stories but what I can say is that this film speaks of Love, Death and other emotions that I don't like to watch on moviesâ€¦ but this MOVIE is a very good movie. If you have a low heart rate you can't regret it
