I didn't even have to watch this film after studying the Maltin review and a rating of 1 1/2 star. I looked at the advice of my son and saw it better than I expected. I would like to give you 2 1/2 stars from the 4 star system. You are going to watch the movie immediately to understand it all. If you don't know much about religion, you will be very successful. I graduated from high school in the movie was made, so maybe I can do it well. Yes, there are some preferences in the film and it's fantastic to some extent, but that was 70s so you expect what. I can see why people don't like movies; however, I can't understand people say it's boring. The movie is nothing but boring. You could hate it or love it. If you like to be boring, perhaps you are a dead brain.
