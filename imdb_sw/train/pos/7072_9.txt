Twelve dogs are a time to travel, a star-shaped film that star Bruce Willis plays James Cole, a man who has been sent again to gather information about the devastating distress that takes place in November of 1996. Unfortunately, he has been sent again in 1990 where everyone believes it is insane. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting and has a beautiful display from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys are one of the great travel movies that I believe anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a real masterpiece <br /> 10/10
