I think this film is brilliant. These are many reasons why these are some 1) good work with Tom and Tyler 2) a brilliant gun that was a piece of beauty 3) I thought that the end was good twist because I had never been at the end at the end both for Sam Mendes.a with these 3 film film points are good too. I am a college student and we studied this film very seriously and it was one of the best movies I have seen in many years. I would like to thank you for all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say the best place in the film is a machine gun where John Rooney is killing it just as fresh in photography until John Rooney says "I'm glad you are" is much better than I think because the viewer builds the voice itself with that voice. it is quite different from just a wise viewer.
