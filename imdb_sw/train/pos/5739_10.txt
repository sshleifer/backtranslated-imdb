Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce reflect on this wonderful example of brotherly love and dedication. Hulce plays with Dominick, (Nicky) a boy with a mental disability who puts 12 minutes, younger brother, Liotta, who plays Eugene, through a medical school. It has been put in Baltimore and deals with the issue of brotherly competition, the unconditional bond of twins, child abuse and good always win over evil. It is interesting, and filled with laughter and tears. If you have never seen this film, please rent it, I promise, you will be surprised how this amazing film can go without seeing.
