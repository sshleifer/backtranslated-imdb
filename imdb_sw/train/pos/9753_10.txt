... in our homes. Like everyone else who has commented on this film, my brothers (ages 7 & 4 at the time) and I (10) could watch this film regularly. We all liked Star Wars, but we always come back to this because of the great songs and adventure. We all loved Camel and we would sing about our lungs with him during his song. There is a time of slow (when used by King Koo-Koo in his court) and we usually get tired after the song of The Knight ("The reason that I {sound effect} is because I loooooove you"), but we loved the trip The rescue Babbette and the end and all had been slightly reduced by the image of King Koo-Koo coming up to dominate the whole scope, laughing carefully at the end. Still this day I will sing "Hooray for me! Babbette of Paris gay!" close to my friends (I'm 33 now) who just look at me if I lost my mind; However, when I sing I'm 10 years old again to remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
