Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War "Jacknife" has not been delayed or even worse. It is one of the few who try to deal with the second side of the war: when after. Unlike movies like a "taxi driver" or "Rambo" which uses to show their main artists as broken heroes in the worst state after this battle this movie allows listeners to cope with a different perspective on Vietnam vets. Their development is shown very much before and especially after the war. Problems are obvious but in all this sad state there is always a feeling of hope on the basis of love and friendship. "Jacknife" could be a silent film of Vietnam forever but after nearly 15 years this is actually visible and therefore justifies. Moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not ended, yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done one of his best works but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Possibly, this was his best performance ever.
