This wow was a great movie of Italy "ZOMBIE" by Luci Fulci a good director ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD") Lucio began this film and was so ill so Bruno took up and turned amazing better than I expected turn so if you have seen "HELL OF LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you have seen "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and love both or one of the themes then this is a movie you must watch that has "ZOMBIE" wizard to do the same with "ZOMBIES" "great look" funny ZOMBIE "head fly! And "ZOMBIE" birds who spider spots for you and turn you into "ZOMBIE" (That's just happed by two people) but it is only just "poisoned ZOMBIES" such as Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or just a movie "ZOMBIE" in general than this one big Italian watch "ZOMBIE" movie!
