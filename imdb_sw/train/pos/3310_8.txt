In the Kongwon-making film he looks at a closer look at the meaning (with the general meaning) in the lives of the various Koreans; people who have no opportunity are looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the loss of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we see the destruction of various characters; we learn about their shortcomings and desires, the general difficulty set apart in human life (and still more humiliation of humanity). Although the film is slow-moving, it can be very reflective. It does not impose any ideas, but allows ideas to come upon themselves, allows the concept to manifest themselves. The film ends up and suddenly when it starts, and one understands the meaning of diversity, love is often a selfish act, and many mistakes we make. It's looking into everyday life, very well and made well. If you are looking for an action or a sharp actor, this is not a film for you. However, if you are interested in honesty, original, and meaningful movies that cannot be forced and without glitz, this is a good film to watch.
