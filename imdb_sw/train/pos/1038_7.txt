He loved the film. I loved even many actors in it. But, for me Mrs. Davis's effort to sympathize, and her hard work makes the movie as hard as possible to watch too much. Much like a modern actress played the same role as the same style as Mrs Davis would skip the screen. <br /> <br /> I think she 'made this call to'. Now if it was with Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would be more excited. <br /> <br /> I think not just 'get' Bette Davis. I have been thinking that he is an actor who appears himself regardless of his role. The possibility to occur is now Safari. I am sure most of the other critics will explain carefully (and I have a civil hope) how I am caused by this. But, I will continue to watch movies that are available because I love stories / write / help, but, I will always think of, of different actors who could do better work.
