Yes, I enjoy hearing rumors that this will eventually be released on the DVD. At that time it will happen, I don't know, but I'll take it at the opening time. <br /> <br /> In my humble view, this is an entertaining film of Errol Flynn, especially when the work of the "Jim" ring of Corbett begins in the film. Then it goes from a good film to the great man. A few people can play whispering and still come as a good person with Flynn can and this film is a perfect example of it. Reportedly, this was the favorite role of Flynn and I believe it. You can only see how happy she was here. Bond Bond also looked like he was very excited about his role to play John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, has never been better. <br /> <br /> There is only a fair right of pigs here and it is very good, too. The Corbett family enjoys watching, too, if they continue to stand at Jim's matches. At the same venue, the frequent comments of Corbett's family and screaming can get very little and very angry but they point to the correct conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking about the conclusion, the speech of Sullivan to Corbett after a great fight is very touching and a film display. Some powerful critics (Different types, for example) did not like the end nor the fact that many films are fictionalized but - duh - many films are fictionalized, like that or not. And, in this case, it is for a good story and last end. (In real life, Corbett was a true honest person who says very soft, not anything like Flynn's picture, but Flynn still makes him a good person.) watching and waiting for the DVD.
