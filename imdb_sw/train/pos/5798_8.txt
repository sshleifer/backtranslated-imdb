I first noticed this when they showed this around Easter 1993/4 and they had no idea of ​​it then, I bought this on the DVD last time when I started getting Michael Jackson (I loved his music before) and I enjoyed it more now I am old. It is a good film but it will not be this classic film like Sound Of Music, West Side Story, Wizard Of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were horrible events such as the little girl Katie was hit by gangster Frankie Lideo who played with Joe Pesci. The area that scared me when I was young is when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the film was Smooth Criminal I think was better than Thriller in my opinion.
