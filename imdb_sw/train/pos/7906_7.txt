Gus Van Sant has done the best film. I am really a fan. However, I can't help but I don't feel the edge of Tom Robbins's brain "Even Cowgirls Get Blues" is lost in translating on the big screen. Himself, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are a wonderful vision and towers of talent. Finally, this did not work. It was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive. It is only that our thoughts are so powerful when reading a book like this. We are taken at a different time and place and sometimes we think it is bad and / or better and it adds to the overall speed of the book as it opens well according to the author's accuracy. The film however can leave one and less thought and roller-coaster impressions from the general experience. This is what has happened here. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading a book!
