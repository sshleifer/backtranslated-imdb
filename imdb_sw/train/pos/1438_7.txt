Full mark for the delivery of Pacino talks on the casket of a dead child; Shakespeare's Mark Antony will be embarrassed! What is Paul Schrader or is Ken Lipper who should be praised for the wonderful conversation? They are rich and intelligent and are good at your time if you like movies and beautiful scripts. I have found the story of the story that goes well up to the top of the letter. <br /> <br /> There is a little thing to talk about in this film; even John Cusack has done better tasks than this. Interestingly, the film is a very young man - women are just links.
