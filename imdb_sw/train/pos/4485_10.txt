This is my favorite of old Tom & Jerry cartoons from 40 years. The original version by Mammy Two Shoes is on Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set, one disc, and show a great drawings of early cartoons. Gags on this is not all of Avery's style, but it is more subtle and is aimed at anyone who has ever lived at the end of watching awesome movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to the creepy radio, and Jerry decides to play several tricks. Gag nine lives have been made here, and I don't know how many times I tried to erase the scary paper when I was a child. When the owner of Tom rose and ruckus- Mammy was not a maid, it was HIS house - it gets surprising, with a loud noise. Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
