This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, carefully, should be said, the first chart to the end of World War II. Nature is not fully taken from Germany by the collapse of the hands of the Versailles contract that has helped raise Hitler's battles, but One auditor says, it must be difficult to do, in a series of 26 sections and a lot of entry. In addition to fighting voting pictures / action, there is a lot of personal, emotional and human suffering that is told to give the viewer an amazing insight, especially if it is not necessary to be violent / fan of World War. Sessions that show 'witness' and life were like the front of the house of allies / partners, UK, Germany, Japan, Russia and U.S. they were opening eyes. To show the greatest damage to the war on the front line and of course the masses of civilians, death camps etc., were very well addressed to the open. I would like to fully suggest this in any class of history for a little generation (which might be me just 47!) <br /> <br /> Other things are very strange to leave out, like the advent of a new jet, and aircraft Frank Whittle's experiments on Gloster and Gloster Meteor battles as well as Germany's Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially if V-1 seemed to make it first and there was an amazing mention of V2. This is probably a little observation, not the meaning of the mysterious and mysterious weapons that WW2 brought forward from past science. But the great series that made its mark and you have done it since you are grateful for your gratitude. A series of having a box set in historical terms, on DVD for anyone who actually happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
