Philo Vance (William Powell) helps to solve several killings among the rich after showing dogs. I usually hate the hidden content (like this) but I love this movie. It goes very fast (just 72 minutes), well-directed by Michael Curtiz (uses tons of cameras that only accelerate the story together), has a very profitable story (including an assassination of an enlarged room that was very strange) and it has thrown very well. Powell is suave and magnificent as Vance - it doesn't seem to be doing - he's Vance! Mary Astor has not been given much to do but she adds class and beauty to production. Everyone else is very good, but the best is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor and a very special voice and some of his lines were hilarious. Basically, the best of the 1930s of the best of the killing of Hollywood. Well seen. <br /> <br />
