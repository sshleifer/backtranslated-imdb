In this document we meet Roger, a rich factory manager in China that makes beads and other things sold and sold to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says the girls of the factory love their work and are grateful for the opportunities offered, but interviews with four say another story. The life of girls is given in a very different way to the extraordinary Mardi Gras itself. The movie film David Redmon should be honored for getting a good and normal picture of daily life in the factory of China, and by surveillance camera surveillance on camera and head of U.S. which imports and sells beads. The film is effectively and clearly expressed its purpose as a window in what causes the "made in China" labels.
