At first I saw this, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and I think that maybe some of the great humor was very mature for me to understand at that time. I had the same response when I watched it a second time a few months ago, and this time, it is because Felix's suicide attempt at the beginning of a movie has been a little movie. This area made some things that Oscar said and made to Felix later in the movie seem to be unfair, and their human fighting was not as exciting as they could be. If I did not know this story, I would be concerned that some of the Oscar antics for Felix could dismiss him on the edge. As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile as a television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did. Still, both for all, a good movie and has given one of the top stations on television. 7 out of 10.
