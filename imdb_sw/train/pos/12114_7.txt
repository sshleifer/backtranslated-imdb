This video is definitely the budget and has been done in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that were supposed to overcome to make this film (tempered in California and the last 60 years) were well-developed. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac massacre that was hit in Vallejo & Bay city from 1968-19? (He never caught) .Man James Olmos (Det Dave Toschi) & George Dzundza (Zodiaac - at that time believed that Arthur Leigh Allen, since being removed by DNA & fingers) to play a game of cat crime and recurring investigations, each one trying to make another one of a emotional revelation.Olmos dies from some type of terminal disease and knowing Dzundza did, he still feels completely lost to his family and has a full drunken path on the way. The ceremony was for the massacre left in his wife. Just a desire was "over the top" to finish otherwise very accurate. If you get a typical Hollywood tire or you are interested in the case of Zodiac, see.
