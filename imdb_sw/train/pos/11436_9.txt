This is the type of picture John Lassiter would be doing today, if not for the development of CGI. And that's just saying that he could forget, too, as the technology hasn't made sexy things and kewl since 1983. _Twice ..._ has found wit, imagination, and sense of real excitement that you would like to find in Flick Pixar, just implemented under restrictions c. 1983. Creative animation techniques combine with a great script and best to provide an interesting voice on multiple levels. It should be spoken in one breath by _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
