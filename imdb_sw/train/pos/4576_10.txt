I thought this was a beautiful movie that focuses on the life of Mary-Kate and Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! Both are trying to make themselves and their parents happy; unfortunately, it's not easy for them to do the truth! I thought this was a beautiful and beautiful movie and if you're a real fan of these beautiful women I am sure you will agree with me here! If you haven't seen this film I still say it is completely wrong; long, and that you should take time to see now! This movie is a true winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
