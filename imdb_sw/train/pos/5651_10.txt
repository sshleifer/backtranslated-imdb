It was wonderful and evil and I enjoyed it very much, the characters in the show were also good, and accepted another well. I would like to see it cut off. I would like to see where it would go. Lucas was afraid of losing. And I'd like to see more of him and how his behavior became. I even buy a show just enjoy, it was good for something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was a cousin of Caleb, was a great secret about where and what he meant Lucas. It is not embarrassing not yet .. or it has never ended, I would like to see what happened.
