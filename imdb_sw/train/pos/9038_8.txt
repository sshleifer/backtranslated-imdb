I loved Sky Sky. What I loved most was that music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the intermediary time. This has been done by playing songs from the last 50 years. In the second hour, the score marks takes. Music is now similar to the film's status. I just enjoy the music, I also enjoyed being beaten. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a surprise for me. He gave the first class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). I have seen this film about running life that has already been installed twice, and twice I enjoyed it.
