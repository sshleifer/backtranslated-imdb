I thought it was a very good movie and it would have been released on the first movie. It was not a big Blockbuster but it would have made a very good money. The movie has a suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do such a good job. Considering its first movie did a good job. This is a film that is good to take and watch when you don't know what you want to hire that night. It should go very well. Sent was good. So I strongly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!
