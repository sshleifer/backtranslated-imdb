This is a well-directed film from John Cromwell who was not a good director but who made some good films including the 1937 version of the 'Prizeer Zenda'. Putting London which only Hollywood can manage, the sky but nothing real, is the story of losing and losing love, from the novel and Somerset Maughan. I expected to see it on the DVD as I had never seen before and that Bette Davis's great surprise wanted to see him in the role of one of his first people. So I bought it. Well he seemed good but I am worried to say his London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the most famous, non-fictional artists, but here made one. It is impossible to take her character seriously. It was not as bad as the cocktail of Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' that is going on but around. <br /> <br /> In another great role was Leslie Howard and did very well. He was a cunning and intelligent actor. It is important to watch despite gymnastics of Mrs. Davis's voice.
