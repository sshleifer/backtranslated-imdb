The bold and worldly perspective of the beautiful world is shown in this beaten comedy and the first author / director Peter M. Cohen. The story continues as four male characters meet each week at a local dinner to give talks about their friendship problems. We meet Brad: a good-road-road player with a quick and bright sound; Zeek: a stupid, intelligent writer; Jonathan: A good boy with a mixture of sex and cotton fabrics and ignorance; and Eric: a married wife, who enjoys meeting him regularly with his special friends in hopes of misunderstanding his creation of a ban. The trials and suffering of one of the men living in New York are shown to be beautiful, reflecting the city's mirror and the new HBO's Comedy The Mind of Married Man, bringing a sensible light to scamming. The story takes as fast as the little ones that meet Mia - not playing with Amanda Peet-and they all fall for it. He contradicts each and his abnormal abilities of similarities and characteristics that indicate. When they come to realize that they all met with the fall of love with the woman, they chose her for their friendship. It is a real picture of a world of stupidity, one of which the critic did not recognize. In plain language, they were unsure. The main character here is the caricatures of real people. The spread of bitterness is cracking, combining satire with humility, and should not be taken seriously as the indifference of the defendant shows. Watch this film, you will laugh from beginning to end.
