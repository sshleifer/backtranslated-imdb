Compared to Fighting Club, Matrix, A.I, Sense of Six, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way that has never been done before. The first 30 minutes build a beautiful story of love between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. Another part of the film is, well, confused, you will take it every time you look (I've gone to the movie to see it 3 times now)
