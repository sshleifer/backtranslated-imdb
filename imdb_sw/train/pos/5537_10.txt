Maybe it was not generally good, but the second part, which was the first I said, was not so much remember I still remember today. I was a fan of Dick Francis. I would like to recommend you if you are interested in horse racing and secrets. <br /> <br /> Slang cockney of sidekick, Chico Barnes, is a lot more amusing for those who have never been around to hear Bow London Bells, but the heads are interesting and shows that they are interesting. Sid Halley was one of Francis's most spectacular characters, and the show really reduced some trouble with his hand. Surprisingly, the electrical hands of the type used in the story are obviously under-working by the user than the post-World War II.
