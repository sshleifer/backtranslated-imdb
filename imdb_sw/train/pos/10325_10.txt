I was born on Doc Savage, and I was shocked by the death of a child as a child but even now, I have found it quite enjoyable. you. "I don't know what about Doc, but always finds girls" must be the last line when you look at its sad band of men. This film is a spoof of the classic on the entire genre of the hero, and it was the way before time, should not be taken seriously, moving to the power of Austin. Ron Ely is God. It is unfortunate that this film has not been removed from the DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be carried out and punished, as I said it is a classic, it can not be done without Ron (as the work of Italy without Mini and Michael Caine). I offer 10/10.
