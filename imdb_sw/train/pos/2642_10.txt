This is really a 'heart-stirring film'. It has won the George Peobody Award, winning "Roots", so that it can tell you something of the essence of this film. I am looking at the internet to import this film since the old ex-wife, Eugene Logan, the co-author of this film has died for a few years now so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would like to have her special daughters, my daughters, see this film, and also pass this wonderful story to her grandchildren. My old daughter was seven years old when she was seen on TV with me since we had a desire to see again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I will not damage this film for you.
