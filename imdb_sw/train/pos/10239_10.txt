I disagree with anyone who didn't like this film. I like to love this film when I was young and still doing it. It's sweet, and it pleases your heart. And it proves that love and friendship cannot be destroyed. And even though he didn't have many stories, it was still better I give 10 and two thumbs up. Oh, yes and proves that you want and your deepest desires can happen. (Weeping, tears) Because it was a nice movie and I am glad to have at least some people liked it.
