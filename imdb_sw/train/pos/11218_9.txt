This animation is a must-see for fans of Evangelion. It is the original work of Anno Hideaki, but its unstable style, good style is its place. Also, those who did not like Evangelion can get this release for a little bit interesting. Gunbuster is rather sci-fi anime for it is actually based on real science. In fact, the show has several periods "Science Study" is available between describing physics behind some events in the movie. One of the biggest points in the film is the passage related to the momentum closer to the light. The series works well to deal with the horrific experience of leaving the world over six months of travel around the speed of light and returning to the world where ten years have passed. The main character remains the age of 17 or 18 in the entire series when almost all the age-old characters. Show, this show is heavy on the timing of times. It also has a couple of totally shots of breasts that I have never seen. I have found it easy to ignore skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo events, because the series is very good, but the low-end viewers might want to stay away from this. For an amazing note, Gainax, as always, managed to run the money in the last couple of events. However, they were able to use the black and white film and still drawings to implement the best decision. The latter is very little, but you left me with a very good feeling in my gut I couldn't help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful pieces of Anime almost.
