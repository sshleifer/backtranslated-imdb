I thought that this film was more beautiful than many film critics offering credit. Although it has its own parts of the conspiracy, it does not interfere with your knowledge of the film. That was said, If you open up more political political ideas, then maybe it's not a film for you. I thought all the participants in the film were excellent. Each character has their exciting time with the audience in the Tribeca Film Festival in any event. I thought satire was tad on top in a certain area, but that's deliberately done. John Cusack is correct because although it is installed in the future, it makes you see now.
