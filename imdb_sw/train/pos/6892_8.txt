I have come to see this was a piece shown on Gerard Philippe's exhibition in Paris two years ago. I had no interest in remake and I had already considered the nature of more than a century century after I was made I could only conclude that the wrong fence was intended, with the aim of a long-term goal. Hollywood was doing a real sword fight since 30 years when all of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed with foil and Errol Flynn and others so the technique was available and therefore chooses only. Over time you will see and appear in Henri Jeanson's discussion of the Zenda Prisoner, two versions. Gerard Philippe had the presence of a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martine Carol, another candidate at the time. The publication I saw was very bad and one time it completely broke the DVD version.
