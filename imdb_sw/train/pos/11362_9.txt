I believe this is the most powerful film of HBO Photo has made so far. This movie should be released on public display to see on the big screen. Available on video to make sure you watch and watch. Chris Gerolmo did a good job with patterns and screens. The show from Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn will have no meaning. Such a masterpiece.
