What can I say? This is one of the most complete films made. It is losing to glitxy, sterling the romantic comedies of the 1940s. But with a modern touch.For the screenplay burst of wit, charm, humor and compassion, cinematograpy is breathtaking (NYC never looks very good), and of course there is cast! Dudley Moore returns to the performance of his work as Love, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also a wistful and realistic. One of the best lines of the film is his poignant "Not everyone drink is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poetry." Mr. John Gielgud won the victory for Oscar for his extraordinary performance like Hobson, Arthur's valet and guardian. Although he saw it is "taking money and running a role", he brings the attitude of talent, experience and bragan of the skillful and beloved partner. The support is also based on this, from the Grandma Bass Geraldine Fitzgerald Bass for Stephen Elliott's Mafioso. It is also very unlikely and congratulates the film. The only real problem with the film is the worst shock affected was produced.
