This review has vendors for those who do not know the details of the true story in which this movie is installed. The right to be considered "Innocent to be convicted" is the fundamental right of any person in the civil society; but according to Fred Schepisi's pastor but sadly influencing the attempted murder of Australia, he had no chance of Lindy Chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. The story showing that he was not guilty of innocence (had no dingo stood), but those who say his guilt yet, and there is no solid evidence against him. But the Australian public was beaten with the possibility of his guilt, and much religious chamberlains seemed to be angry when it appeared in the media (and the media themselves, of course, were guilty in this process). So although it was explained by the first investigation, they were later judged and judged. Although Chamberlain was finally released, this only carefully followed the discovery of new evidence "to prove" their lack, nothing to defenders should produce. The 'Dark in Darkness' is good to act in, especially with Meryl Streep, who puts an impressive Australian impression (at least for the Pom's ears) and can put Lindy sympathetic (to us) when presenting how he could be a national figure. Events where he actually gets in prison is easy but breathes the heart, because we believe in real characters. Regardless of the accuracy of this story's story (something that I cannot give up on), the broader theme of this film will really be true for anyone with the best knowledge of passing to the popular UK media and his bad habit of praying directly to their minority scholars. No legal system will ever be perfect; but the current cry against asylum seekers in the modern UK tabloids comes out of the same hole of evil as voices posted by Lindy Chamberlain away. I am not a religious person, but the Bible still has verses to kill (if you forgive forgiveness). "The judge must not be judged" is one of them.
