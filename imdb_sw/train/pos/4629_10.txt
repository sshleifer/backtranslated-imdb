My father was a jailer (he is retired now) shown in this document and I grew up near the prison, so maybe my opinion would be quite different from everyone who looks at this film. I will tell you this, the filmmakers who brought us a miracle of 93 minutes are wonderful artists and better people. They were brave enough A) Show up and tell this story, B) Get into worries and hearts, and C) Do all of this carefully. The role of their art and, more importantly, is responsible for the prisoners and the staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be praised without end for this task. Taking 170 hours, that's HOURS, of photographs and cutting capabilities and narrowing up to 93 minutes of riveting is not a very short and very respectable. I saw this film under the very conditions, very few could see it. I was in prison detention. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts tied to the screen. I saw people crying on television crying in front of me and let me tell you, it was a great experience. These men have committed serious crimes in some cases, but have found ways to try to free themselves, even if they feel they cannot be judged. How many of us have the courage to do so? How many people can do what they did in such a bad situation? To see them respond to the film is an experience I have always thanked for, and I will never forget you. I thank the men who let me see this vision in their lives, thank my father for doing all this possible, and I thank Philomath Movies for taking the time to shed their blood, sweat, soul, and tears in this project. <Br /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life, and prisoners who have been in it. 'Oz' is not true, television is not true. 'Shakespeare Back to Baa' is.
