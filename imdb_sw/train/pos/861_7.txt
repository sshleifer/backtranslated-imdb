What? What would you say when you see a good French movie that tries to draw a story of concern based on the social history of the characters? The main thing is we believe in those characters and once encountered we want them to stay together. It's simple and effective. History of history is very important. Why screenplay go to the side of the half-development thriller? It helps not stuck in this rally over the French-jerkers film as do. Not very disappointed, the same: Sur mes l√®vres is the only entertainment video of French with good reputation. <br /> <br /> For all reasonable points of color in the final screen is very simple. It goes quite simple as on the back window (definitely see and definitely not a film film) but with less compelling circumstances. Where I wonder it is to see that the behavior of the trial officer has not been deleted. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we are wondering if we did not miss a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a new messenger. Wonderful and wonderful.
