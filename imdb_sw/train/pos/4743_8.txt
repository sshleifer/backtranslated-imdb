This is an amazing HK film in many ways. First, the interaction of many steps is really not very fun. The first gun battle in the film was just silly. Not too cold, or even beautiful, but not just. That is not to say there are some major acts of action, but many do not come to the level of some of the other films I have seen. On the contrary, this film has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for a bad leader, who is flat like a billiard table) and many are doing well. All characters in this film are just happy to watch. Talk is wonderful, and it doesn't seem to lose too much in translating. This film is worth seeing, but I hope that the American listeners who don't think do not think this is the best HK.
