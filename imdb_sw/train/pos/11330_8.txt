This is a good story of the guilt of guilt. Cling, for a night walk in Riga (?) Passes by a woman in the wrong side of the grade bridge. He goes without a word. Just printed in the water followed by the cry of help leads to a tent. Then it's very little and it's too late. The film writes its efforts to find out more about the woman. On the local bars, it finds its pocketbook. He fits more and more of his life together. Its change will be "changed" if its difficulty grows. He should do the same things. In an extraordinary conversation of movies and "old boyfriend partner" causes Alexej to deal with the guilt that they all feel. <br /> <br /> Huunting long takes, sound of impressive voice to impose guilt, dog dancing. Step. Good film films and delightful. Good indie is complete.
