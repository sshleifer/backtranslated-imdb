The area where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg are going to the shops to revive Sally's spirits is the only reason enough to enjoy this film, but wait! There is more! This is a good sending of the TV of the day, the stars of the film on the bottom, (and above) and the fear of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his skills, and Cathy Moriarty is a princess. The discussion is magic, and physical humor is made by permanent knowledge. This is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy the art of acting, leading, and writing.
