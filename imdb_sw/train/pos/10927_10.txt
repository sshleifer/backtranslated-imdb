This is one of my favorite kung-fu films and looks like one of the most famous Shaw Brothers from the late 70's. . The action is limited in comparison to other Chang Cheh / Venoms films but what is interesting and different kung-fu styles on display from different characters. I recommend this film to those who think both Shaw Brothers especially movie Chang Cheh are the same, his most typical films based on 10 tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflict. This film is a breath of fresh air by comparison.
