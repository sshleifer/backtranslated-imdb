When this movie first came back in 1984, Prince was one of the most hot acts around. Everyone wanted to see this film, which was not more than an extended music video. Acting was very bad, but can you expect from musicians to work on the big screen for the first time? In spite of this, it was still a very entertaining film! Morris's Day and Jerome Benton provides a regular comedy of all time, especially their "Password", which will make you think about Abbott & Costello to do "the first routine" of their baseball. The appolina (who went in the same name then) gave a good breast, so it had a short short cover. Plus, he is very interesting. And of course, the voice of the album is one of the best recorders. Prince later had a fall of Warner Bros and changed his name, but at this time in his career, he was on his game. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't rank in all the best time, but it's a good entertainment.
