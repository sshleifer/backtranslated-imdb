I experienced this series instead of an accident. After half an hour, I walked. The Gothic America was a series of dark, mysterious with Gary Cole as strange, perhaps the evil Sheriff Buck who tries to get control of his legitimate child Caleb, played by Black Lucas. I was surprised by the sheriff the sinner and Gary Cole and I was attracted to Lucas Black. The Lucas Black Caleb was able to stand against Sheriff Buck, one of the most horrible characters who ever created the TV series. I have never seen a child actor with a great presence or talent like Black Lucas. If he was not lucky to see Lucas in the Gothic American, see him in Slingblade. It was a wonderful controversial show with many secrets that were not explained in a short time.
