You know? Our spirit is the foundation of the revolution, sleeping ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Until that on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we got in the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people lost their opinion, we do not use the freedom of speech! That's the result of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think it has a few errors on the character of a certain character, but how I use it to look at Portuguese movies is quite good! I like it very much!
