It was a life change, IT really was !!! Someone In The Moon is a pleasant experience to look at. Acting was strange, the story of the story was good, and this was the perfect start for the work of Reese Witherspoon. see how anyone can't love this film. Indeed, it was not the best movie, though it was close to it, but it was very exciting to watch, and I had a great laugh at one joke, and a lot of little laugh. it was shining, and shining your day, though you have to get a little trouble from the story every time now. Watch this film if you don't have it to touch.
