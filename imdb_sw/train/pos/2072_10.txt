I was close to thirteen when this movie was found on television. It's far more in practice than many movies since. Martin Sheen is the best, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, it also gives the best support. Vic Morrow as a villain is good. When Sheen "tries to water" in its 'Ford' (COOL) on the highway is a wonderful! <br /> <br /> The end is grand. I was disappointed in this low vote received. I think young generations have more interest in a lot of junk that comes out these days. Good luck draws people away!
