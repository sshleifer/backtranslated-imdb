What? Have you ever, or have you, a beast with you thick and thin, who is missing without, and who do you love no matter what? Betcha never thought they felt the same way about you! <br /> <br /> The wonderful amazing family of the family. If you have a soft spot for animals, this is sure to grow up regardless of your age. I was watching this film all the time when I was a little child, and I see that now, with sixteen years old, I like it like I did then. I can never decide on a favorite character, and still think I can! I love all three animals. The discussion seems realistic and well-being, as a family of love, but fearful. I like space, and how at the end he says he has a last family. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this means being a family film, and it fulfills that task perfectly. Sassy has a full dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is a perfect leader / model for young people, space adventure. Animals are out of people, but of course most of the teary time is having time to interact with them (ie, save Molly, and last). Do not mention the wonderful voice that gives every time you feel more, and the feeling of heart-inflammation. I offer this 9/10. To be compared to (and even rated better than) Paties and Dogs and Babe.
