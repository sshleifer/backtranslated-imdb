For this theme, it is easy to take cheap shots. You know, the man with foot feet is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar is doing a great job of making Gerald a real person, a very caring person, and for this reason you feel his difficulty trying to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only, but like Geraldine, he looks at HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for someone else, and comes through even when they just look at the breakfast table. Even the bottom line of the story of the corporate take-up is honest, and you find yourself at the end at the end! At least I did!
