In my opinion, this is a very good skit show show. I enjoyed watching Greg Kinnear hosting. There are many reasons I have said so. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, sometimes I want that Greg Kinnear has not stopped. If you ask me, it seems that no one lives with a TV show during his flight again. However, I enjoyed seeing different armies and other people destroying fans. If you ask me, it was very good. Before I close this, I must say that I lose this show. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this show for all fans die-hard artwork to show fans. You will be very happy.
