This film is wonderful - it's like a dream. The amazing story, the dark harvest, the little insects everywhere, the idea jumps and dreams of surgery ... The great truth! People who love movies or dark films will find this wonderful. It seems a little for David Lynch's films: a wonderful story, fantastic dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire has almost no plot. Instead it is a series of cases of surgery, dreams and meetings. That's a drawback. If the film had a very interesting plot filled with tension and attractiveness, I would give 10 out of 10. Search the DVD and you will get a reward!
