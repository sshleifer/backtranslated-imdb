This movie is designed well! No errors. It's not in the format of the set, lights, sound, plot. Script is an invitation to a difficult game where your participants are in a simple message. Paxton has his ability in this role. His ways, the infections used in the voice of his voice have no rescue. Every shot has been done effectively! Surprise turns automatically when the movie is approaching its first hour. This can be the most beautiful picture of the year, but it is a very good gem. It's not for a simple mind.
