There is no litter - no where there is garbage nearby. Not natural? that's the last thing that could say "2.4 children". certainly not! Although it was a normal series for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny, and witty. I loved Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe is already well done. I would like to make the most comedy of this kind, much more of them (and show them here in Israel).
