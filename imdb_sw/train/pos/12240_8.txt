If you are the type of person who is looking for a concrete film or one of a strong and reliable plot, then this film is not for you. Nope - you hate it. However, for those who are interested, they have a good time to watch this small film. Tony Randall works for the IRS and examines the best farmer who did not recognize him. was required to return income tax. However hardly he tries to persuade them about the weight of his visit, everyone in the family is happy to have a company. They treat him and treat him as one of the family, ... and they plan to make him a prisoner with their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's true about all the plot there. But the film gets high scores for a fun script and a good acting. Curio very good from the late 1950s.
