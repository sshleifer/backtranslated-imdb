In his worst book, Lincoln in the US Memory, Merrill Peterson, called Young Mr. Lincoln to be "boring, scary, film". This incredible investigation confirms that many historians should not be critics of the best film. I work on the idea of ​​a doctor on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. As part of my preparatory writing ceremony, I made a careful analysis of this film, and the Tagagags Tag brilliant comment in his seminal book on Ford. Mr. Mr. Lincoln comes next year in the first phase of the film film Ford, 1939. In the greater years of Hollywood film, Ford described the best three, it has never been the perfect film: Drum With Mohawk, Stagecoach, and Young Mr .Lincoln. It may seem strange to say that Stakeksi does not fully appreciate it, but all anti-cheaters should realize that it is one of the Western Heads, and perhaps one of the most popular films of all time. However, what is not fully recognized is that these three films work together as a trilogy-triptych type, indeed. Ford creates a variety of American story history on the screen. Dance With Mohawk is a War of Revolution. Mr. YoungLincoln is the War of the Civil Society before the United Nations. In fact, Stagecoach is a Post Post United States. What these three films are similar is that it is a long reflection on Adam's American and "acute in the desert". Psychic and social costs of the American fate, if America struggles to build a new human city in the wilderness? Lincoln points to the trip to America, for he tries to reconcile the laws of civilization, and the freedom of the desert. Lincoln, a symbol of justice and mercy, Lincoln, a man of the desert, struggling to get civilization in himself, and become a “wonderful lawyer” of the American youth. Mr. Mr. Lincoln is not a history - like the long-term James Agee television that forgot about Lincoln, and as a biography of Sandburgs, it's an epic poem ... a very good epic poem.
