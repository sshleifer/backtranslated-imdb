I tried to rent this many times, but I always had a girl, who, as a normal rule, usually refuses the flicks and the simulation together with the comments "Uhm ... it looks good, but I don't have a feeling for the film." comes in "Modern Movie Modern"! <br /> <br /> However, I've got the Welcome To Collinwood movie very enjoyable. When it is all right to forget, it has a time of fun and a few laughs in a short time. I didn't have the usual fact that it was remake, and if the general movies watch watch try to hate the fact and look at them for their own reputation anyway. George Clooney comes quickly and in a short time as a safe horse of wheels which, for the most part he left me to ask two things ... 1. Is not all the best comedy if Mr. Clooney entered a wonderful 5-minute comeo? and 2. Do they make artificial tons that appear to be old and damaged, and are increasingly easy? Sent, all good actors themselves, put a good job, and get a feeling that they had a good time working together which is very important in a movie like this. Without saying it doesn't work as planned in this film, wise-wise and wise-wise, but it has made me look at the specific features and consider looking natural, so I think it's successful! Use this for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br/> On the other hand, voice sounds are amazing. It is good to hear far under Paolo Conte, who has won a delightful snippets of the logo long after receiving a brilliant.
