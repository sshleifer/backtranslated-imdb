Just checked the early Bugs Bunny (the first time called here) and the cartoon Elmer Fudd on ThadBlog if it is connected from YouTube. This was the first time that Chuck Jones directed "wascally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has different voices released by Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx one that we know more. In fact, according to Thad, he runs Jimmy Stewart (his "shy" type of time). However, after Elmer bought his ass, the bugs might all shock him to turn the real radio, pretending to die after his master thrust him out of his shower, saying "Turn off those lights!" every time Elmer takes the fish into his bed. Even with different sounds, bugs are definitely his bad man and I cut the blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an extra area at the end of Elmer only to give the house to Bugs after hell he passed but that perhaps considered to be very sad since she suffered a mental breakdown at the same time as well as the county ward was lost. However, I strongly recommend Elmer Pet Rabbit.
