Having seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I had a little hesitation to watch Bourne Ultimatum. Yet it was a very exciting experience and I had no problem with not understanding what was happening because of not seeing the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I loved the Ultimatum of Bourne before reaching the time! I don't think I've watched this amazing film, and interesting film, especially film action. Since I often isolate myself from practices and exciting movies, this was good news for me. It is one of the most interesting films, it attracts you from the second to the last minute before the credit score. Matt Damon was just as strange as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, a very good actor adds more to his list. I hope to see more of his movies in the future. <br /> <br /> The columns were done in fashion - each was done carefully and I was just exhausted and overthrown by this film. You did well.
