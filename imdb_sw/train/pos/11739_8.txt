"Elvira, Mrs. Giza" is a type of "Harper Valley P.T.A." for common touch. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks on her job as a television attendant after a new owner is getting clean with her. He now depends on the show of Las Vegas to take him through, but he learns that he needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things seem to have a desire to raise the money until he gets the news of his aunt's death, which takes Elvira to Massachusetts for sex education. The house requiring maintenance, dog, and cooking book is all that has been left by her aunt, and it seems again Elvira has trouble coming up with money to show Las Vegas. Older and small-minded adults make things worse by doing more difficult things for Elvira. Only the local Hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of young people will be his friend. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard), pressures to make a deal with Elvira for the book of cooking, but Elvira recently learns his strong heritage involving spellcasting, and two very beautiful casseroles. Elvira did not want to sell the cooking book to his uncle, but he decided to get his hands on him to know his strength. Elvira faces a burning in a shop on an old town of magic, and a hedge between him and his uncle. The program is very simple, but the characters and humor continue to put it at a good speed. "Elvira, Bride of Darkness" is full of good humor, heavy, slick, and cleverly made in many ways to see, puns, props, songs, and parodies. The touch of this magic film makes one of the best parodies done. It is a well-made film with a strong acting and all artists; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (the "Grease.") There are also good special effects. Many people (including me) were surprised if Elvira's behavior could carry a feature film, and the answer is fun, yes!
