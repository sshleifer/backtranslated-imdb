Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call it ballet and fist with explosions. Surely the plot has been tested and heard before, (a biologically engineered soldier that is part of the squad squad of the supermen squad that decides that the killings and the powers of stupidity are not ways to deal with everything and become a refugee, but But when he learns that his group they are trying to get a medicine that will keep them alive by taking the best police-friend is a partner- becomes a black mask.) The style in which the movie goes to, very visual, works and at least me is entertaining. I love martial arts movies that reflect. People who walk closer to the lighter than the air and recover a second split after the effect continues to speed up and stops. But that's how this film is right, showing it to Jet Li doing what she does well, and that's an amazing display of her skills, which you say at least is a high score. As with most of the immediate action of martial arts art. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung who are now present here in the country for the first time, these movies are low on the plot and up on the extraordinary physical actions. But I must say, even with big holes that came out of the plot (as we see it locked safely into his house during one occasion before he had 20 men who have no more than 15 feet from him and a sign of escape? The only area was bought in the apartment. ..... ohh well stopped by faith I think, the movie me stays interesting. It's only up to 20 minutes that the film appears to look like it would be short-lived. But still around the great film of the highest point.
