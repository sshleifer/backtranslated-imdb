Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I looked together "C'eravamo tanto says" on the eve of summer: we liked, but we didn't like it as we loved "a special day". I believe Ettore Scola is very good: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his recent films were disappointing. And so, last night, my mother and I sit on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, manual, cinematic, symbolic and productive production was wise and accurate, but what I liked most was chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Both are the best actors and play the roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to Fascist with a fan, has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a reward for a big family. Gabriele is the only anti-Fascist. They spend together on a special day, that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini. I no longer want to destroy the plot: go to this film!
