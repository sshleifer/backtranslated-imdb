This is a good movie. Others will not agree with me but, if you know anything about the Bible you know it is. I think everyone should see it !! I accept the new version of the new as good but the message is still going on. If you see this film. Do not "fear of the hell of you movie", it is true with the Bible. I think U. N. will have a great role in the world government to come. The last days are covered by the Bible. See what happened to the chip for dogs and cats that have now come to protect children from trophies. It is the size of the grain of rice. This I feel is the first player of the mark of the beast mentioned in the Bible. Without a mark you can not sell or buy, and this chip which small next time does not know how many information it can put on it.
