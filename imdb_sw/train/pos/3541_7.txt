It had a sense of the beginning that a film that Gene Kelly would be a star, but when the creators could not find him "the world's greatest actors", and the result was very good. Basically Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has trouble doing what he does well, establishing the top pieces of the dice game, because he needs $ 1000 to get to the place. In order to get the money she needs, she has $ 1,000 with an old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that can't find Sergeant Sarah Brown (the Great Golden Globe win, and BAFTA has chosen Jean Simmons) to go with her to Havana. At the same time, Nathan has a problem trying to remove a woman who wants to ask her hand, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also star Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule. Romantic romantic music, and Brando sing all his songs, and Sinatra become soft and cool. Selected for Oscars for Excellent Arts-Setting Decoration, Excellent Excellence, Best Quality Costume and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, selected BAFTA for Best Film from Any Source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Movie - Music / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was the number 43 on 100 Icons of the Best Movie Culture, Marlon Brando was the 30th in The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, was the 11th in the Great 100 Great Symbols, was the number 4 for 100 years, 100 Stars - Men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 on the World Physician, "Fortune Being Lady" was number 42 for 100 years, 100 songs for, film was number 23 in 100 Years of Music, and was number 36 in 100 Songs More. Very nice!
