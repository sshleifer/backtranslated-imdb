Born Again Limerick: <br /> <br /> If someone could rise from the dead <br /> And live in the head of a little girl! for the murder that he has met. I was born again is a very low, normal part that makes part of what was explained to X-Files before I started looking at it. I saw a few groups before the first show and I was too small to look at the parts of The Devil Devil, but I especially remember to look at this section as a 11-year-old and be completely creeped by the area where they get aggravated by death and then the area of ​​hypnosis and The little girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for a week! For this reason this section has a special hour about it now because of the shortage that I have grown to enjoy. Its enough to allow me to look at some of the obvious errors in the plot as well as why the girl had to wait until she reached 9 before her old life soul began to really take revenge. Or what he did just randomly sat then in the middle of the night. You think his parents would be worried. And maybe we were just not actually seeing that part of the story. And it had telekinesis? In addition to adding Carrie's true story to an already prepared story, she didn't have any good meaning for it. But even for his minor mistakes, in my mind this is a classic part and has little because no I don't like it. 10 out of 10.
