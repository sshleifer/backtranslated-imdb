A talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a known case of refusal and dry reason for suicide has a good reason to sue it more truthfully, a very incredible murder! <br /> <br /> In addition to the genocide of the genre goes, it is not available more than this. Due to the perpetrators of suspicion, both linked to the show of the dog and all have a very good reason to kill the victims of the injured Archer Coe, it is really difficult to think this one or bind the head of someone around but the boy, do you? It proves interesting to look forward to our presence. Even the militants, the attorney and the district attorney shows the color-colored characters, who come out and increase the level of non-expectation in this case and contribute to its "fun" experience in general. I enjoyed the comic events associated with the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who always seems to be confident and quick without interruption of the corpse or wounded men during this time. Also Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath offers a welcome, often enjoyable enjoyment at its expense, critical clarification during Vance screening. I can't think of any appropriate criticism of giving this film really unless it has never been much better. It does not stop the movie that is just fun fun though. Look and see if you can cover your head next to that person's secret. It is strongly recommended to try!
