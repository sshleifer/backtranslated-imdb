Imagine turning the lights in your home to a farm on a cold night, and then go to bed. No need to install doors. The only sound is wind wind through trees. Sometimes after the midnight car with lights off inway. Once the player puts the torch in your dark room. What makes this picture awesome is the landscape: the field of the distant farm ... at night. According to Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with B&W lights similar to the 1940 "Black Blood" films show a horrible story, especially in the first Act, as a conspiracy takes place at night and in the rain lost country road. It's a dream thing. But this is not a dream. These events were true, in 1959. Two men with a head full of fraud killed the entire Kansas family, looking for money that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used real places where real life events occurred, even the farm farm ... and its internal affairs! It makes the film not remembered, and haunting, film. All leading characters are very similar to two real killers. Robert Blake is more convincing as Perry Smith, short and full of pipe foot, who is dreaming of finding Cortez 'buried treasure. Scott Wilson is very close to Dick Hickock, an online artist chat with all American smile. After their death, the second head to Mexico. Things go there, so they come back to U.S., steal cars, suffer, and are generally worried when they come out of place. But it is a fool's life, and two ears soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film is ringing, as the rain falls, the rope is standing, and all we hear is beaten with a blowing heart. <br /> <br /> Even with the middle mid-law, "In The Blood of the patient" moves in riveting detail real life stories that still hypnotizes, almost half a century later. It is an environment that does so. What? Do you think people in the Kansas villages still leave their doors open ... night?
