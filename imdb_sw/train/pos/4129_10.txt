It is showing the competitiveness of cooking, America. It will not be a Japanese version. The show is great. I could take care of a little about cooking but this show is just entertaining look ... From the standard set into the plate with a chef to goofy chair. Really a good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can underestimate the show by having visitors like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It is enough entertainment to look and usually the winner deserves the prize. Well and I'm bitter John Besh is not a new Chef of Iron ... <br /> <br /> Eat food!
