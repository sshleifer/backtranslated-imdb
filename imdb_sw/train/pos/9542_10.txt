Do not show the people of silly name, this is one good trip! The true successor of Tetsuo of Iron Man and the Coach, this gem comes with a bang and puts a cloud on thick until the credit card. It seems that visitors are taking human bodies and changing them into war machines, which are used to fight each other in a game that arises for their amusement. The winner of the war is alive. That's for conspiracy, but who cares when the gore is this good? I don't know how many buckets of pitch used, but it's disgusting to see. There is an effective and efficient use of time to stop while moving, and the care of love is available to all creation and the effects of doing. CGI is small, but in fact it did not limit the quality of a little bit, at least for me. This was really a fun and abstract film that deserves many qualities, and has found its place in the stack of the cult classics. Find and watch, you will not be discouraged!
