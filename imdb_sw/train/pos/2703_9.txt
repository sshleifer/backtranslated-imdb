It is not a big fan of politics and politics "is very bad". However, I love this film for its fun and - believe it or not - it's innovation. One thing has a John Waters angle and is an unpleasant enthusiasm, but with other good actors and they are considered the direction that makes many slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane goes with an extraordinary expression (see the location on the bus for a book-book study on how to use the movement) and is prepared by unexpected stars. You may like this film, you may not be happy, but if you have the opportunity to look at it, then safely when you can finish the film with a confused smile on your face, and a new perspective for a great star . Highly recommended.
