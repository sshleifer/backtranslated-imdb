I realize that many people hate this film, but I must admit it is one of my favorites. I have come to be better than his predecessor and I am glad to be better than many movies. First, I think people have never given any brilliant story, such as Rudi for the next time, while Travel is hard to write, and in this film they include Time for Travel and Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were there on the best performances in this film, they looked cool, they made cool, and said cool things. <br /> <br /> The layout of this film is also good, a set is very detailed and very powerful when it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for films about two buds of young people who can't say spell. .. but not that specialist franchise whole, making these two big idiots than the characters of life that are responsible for the entire earthly world. similar as. Bill and Ted really seem cool in the Bogus Journey, where as in the beautiful Adventure they seem like, like they will put it, FAGS! <br /> Even the music in this movie is good, especially marked. There's so much I could say about this film, because I love it. But this is one of the movies I have watched and every time I have loved it more, so I can understand why people hate or think only his Bogus compared to the best adventure (which I also love through). <br /> <br /> Get down with your BAD SELF !!!!
