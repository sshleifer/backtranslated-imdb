I grew up in Brazil and was visiting and surprised the beautiful beach where the film was made. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is 150 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This movie returns to the life of the 16th century Brazil, where Europeans began to explore the beach, which was still in a normal state with a few peoples and ethnic backgrounds. French and Portuguese fought for territory and on top of the wood trade in Brazil, all the time talking to the locals, who also fought for any reason. One of the French states ("mercenary") is left to die with his own compatriots but he can escape and is put in prison with all the tribe of naked. When he is a "slave" of the chiefs, according to tribal customs, he is allowed to live in comfort for a long time for months until it is the same as being killed and killed in revenge. > <br /> What I like about this film is that it includes a deep love for the villages of the locals and their way of life (they walked naked and were young) and they asked us to recognize and accept life at that time if it was: in a beautiful garden garden, life was the aggressive, cruel, full of superstitious superstition and strange traditions. Europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including more violence and better weapons and desires. No romanticized "savages safe" or "heroic fighters" here, are just people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The movie is not very responsive nor dismissive of locals. From what I know about the subject, the picture is very accurate that adds air to the project: how many movies have you seen about the lives of Brazilian people and their original things with Europeans?
