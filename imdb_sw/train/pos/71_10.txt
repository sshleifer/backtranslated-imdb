I couldn't believe the comments made on the film. When I was reading bad news about the movie I really wondered if you were watching the same film I did. It was incredible! I think the actresses and director performed a good job in the film. I did not have the pleasure to see the original executive or I could never come back with a wonderful job that I did! I'd say his reliable movie that I have seen for a long time. What I see is why everyone has such a problem with the choice of Deanna's drug addiction in an attempt to commit suicide, given the comments made by you as a choice of choice and its stupid choice. That I do not understand, his movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how can it be the fault of artists I can see. I think it was a real trusted movie that I would see again and suggest. The view is what is so bad that most of them are very close. I hope to see any of the actors soon think that all played great roles. Busia will be the most paid one day and I hope she can laugh before everyone who accused her! You're going to Girl!
