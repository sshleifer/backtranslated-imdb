In spite of the negative views of this film have found the IMDb pages, it is still worth checking whether this is a story about life and cooperation between two different people with a different mind during a difficult mission in the Panamanian desert. Peru Director Luis Llosa sends us to look at this ambition set in Panama. The film has a good time as Beckett, an old marine, takes a new man, recently sent to try to eliminate a major head of health and head of a bribe who could be the second president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what is given to keep. Miller, a new man who came to the jungle with a military battle between military masters and drugs against infiltrated American men of intelligence, learns a valuable lesson from Beckett. Something that looks good in theory, not meant in the jungle. Tom Berenger, a non-registered actor, as he shows in this film, but in the form of a movie, he is just like a man of a few words. Billy Zane play Miller does what he can and the role that does not give him glory until the end of the key. <br /> <br /> For action movie lovers, "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action which for Little repair would make the most satisfying film.
