One of my displays of love back in '70s. When I remember I went to the air on Friday night (or maybe Saturday) on the Fourth Web (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were together. Every part of the normal area reached a peak and Kolchack should cooperate with some kind of common opponent. On their loan, the authors made an attempt to overcome the usual vampires and ghosts as much as possible. I remember one place where the enemy was the spirit of the former Indian leader who / who 'returned' as now the great electricity that started killing people in the city hospital. The last end saw Kolchack trying to rotate the 'power of the animals' during the spark of the spark and fire. Oh well .... you should be there then but it was an interesting idea. McGavin was always full of energy and enthusiasm in its responsibilities and this was one of the best. br /> <br /> Certainly you deserve a place on TV's "Hall of Fame". Naming Tony Vincenzo .... 'Kolchack is on IT' ... Or, in the case of Hall of Fame, 'IN IN'!
