If you lived through the 60's, this film can be a time of injury and sometimes it's very fun. All here but published a small in tabloids of the adaptation culture at the time. These are the roots of a revolutionary society that is still happening: "Do not talk very quickly to the wheel yet in spin, for when they are changin". While the film focuses on the nature of the LSD revolution and at the same time, it alone has contributed a great deal to intellectual reforms, and persuaded engineers, scientists and assisted in the development of computer related activities. Greetings for filmmakers from the person who was there - you have taken the best time than I have seen before.
