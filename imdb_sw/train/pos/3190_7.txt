This is your usual comedy of music from '30's, with a big plus which says some of the' 30 actors to come to the smallest of fun. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the story and basically the cinema is all about the fun and 'worry' general atmosphere, and Hal Roach usually comedy touch it. It is voluntary 'the story of Cinderella' but I certainly did not have his mind that way when I watched the movie. The story finds a lot in the story, which deals with many different characters and also a small appearance, while the main characters hit Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film's picture is when Laurel & Hardy looks and shows some of their practices. It's like watching a movie and getting Laurel & Hardy short and for free. Also Laurel & Hardy regularly Walter Long makes it appear in the order with James Finlayson (without a mustache at this time) as a short director. It is certain that all come with subplot distortion from the line of conspiracy and behavior but in this case that is not a problem, since all its way is fun and interesting to look rather than the main line of the main character and behavior normal size. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly not worse than other movies of any kind from the same time, although the logo here will show otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
