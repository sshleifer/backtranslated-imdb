I think if you need to ask more of JW if they expect miraculous treatment because of their faith, you will see they do not. I know I'm not. What you will find instead is that they believe Christ's resurrection promises. So, even when the worst happens and we die when we hold to our integrity, Jehovah can, and will help this. It comes down to a simple question: God is true to you or does all this just believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his instructions regardless of the short-term consequences. I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One of my family was scared when he saw the words "NO BLOOD" written on a large letter on my chart. I reasoned with him that if I were in a state of blood only could save my life, would it be a good time for only one anger that could return to life when it came? You did not find - God is not just enough for him. Very bad. I would like to have the comfort of solid faith offers.
