I recently lost an animated version of the Lord of the Rings on the video after seeing FANTASTIC 2001 version of the film action. Lord of the Rings lives a trilogy step directed by Peter Jackson of course better than George Lucas 'Star Wars' prequel "trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will ever be a fantasy film series of the 21st century! > <br /> I remember seeing the animation version as a child, and I did not fully understand the film's contents at the time. Since I have read books, I understand what the whole story is about. To be sure, some of these characters are very foolish, (Samwise Gangee is particularly persuasive, close to such as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode 1, (AWFUL!) But, I need to say the next book rather than close, and goes to The two book, the two Towers The good things are that the action is interesting and some animation is quite amazing at the time. The worst thing is that it is approaching half through the two Towers without any result of Frodo's efforts to destroy one ring, and animation appears to be dated compared to today's standards. It is generally not as bad as many say it is, but the version of live action for 2001 is a new symbol of the Lord of the Rings! Bakshi took the script with great weight! Peter Jackson said that the animation version persuaded him to read books, which made him make one of the great series of fantassa put on the film, so we can thank Ralph Bakshi for it! take the animation version of the Lord of the ring on the live version of Harry Potter any day! <br /> <br /> 7 out of the rate of 1-10, far less violent than the live version of 2001, but here almost as good! For careful fans of the versions of books and films of the Lord of the Rings.
