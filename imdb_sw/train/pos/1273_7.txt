A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. It has an endless cliche and prettier cliche, but, television movies have any way. Christopher Reeve does a good job as an old man. Marriage between him and the woman who works, I feel a little, but, I believe for a fixed time, that is no honest-down. <br /> Now, I've seen the 'tv' edited version, even the film's made and showed on 'tv', I see that a little bit too. But, I feel like I have seen the fullness of the piece, I would like to give more-in-probability of one rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but, still ... good work. <br /> <br /> 7/10
