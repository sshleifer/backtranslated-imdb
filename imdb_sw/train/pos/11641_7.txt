I found an incident about Brad, a cocaine offender who turned out to a street drug after a bicycling job happened as quickly as it started. I tell you that the story of his bicycle work was more frustrating than his drug addiction. This is the young man who is winning the cycling left and right and is invited to teach with the Olympic training team for two weeks, and once upon arriving Lance Armstrong, one of the many athletes who have ever lived, and is generally old and non and gentle to everyone in general. In fact, he was recently asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle and addiction and how he got his life, but what I wanted to know what was wrong with him the first place to do his act as a donkey? At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, as it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see the sketch of the pan and the sleeping in the taps and raw and even smoked cocaine. I didn't even know that it was legal to show, but why the camera staff just follow him next to the film? Do they do so in hopes that this person will encompass his life and give them material for a good TV period? At any rate, it is a reflective display, because it shows the effects of alcoholism and general control that they can take on people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you see how family and friends are very organization during the absence of an addict, though I must admit that eventually it all looks very clean. There are times during the events when bad things happen and everything seems to be lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about the heretics, everything is very little fun and after feeling the end, and I feel that that's a very common experience in real life. But yet, is it a show about people trying to help other people, and you can't never complain about something like that?
