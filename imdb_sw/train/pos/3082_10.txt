What is so sad, it shows as the Sixth and Brother Sisters and the Sisters are the true reality of the TV, not that garbage that is not more than a game of glory. I think the weakness of the land has been there for the past few years and the early cancellation of many exhibitions and subsequent worship. But with more loudspeakers to Jericho's fans (which I also enjoy) and other exhibitions, networks can begin to fix this situation. I am like others, I can't support any new exhibitions until they are given the second season. I will then be able to make a decision to watch and capture via DVD and online view. Until ABC, you have lost me as a viewer for each new show.
