This is a small film of the budget cast to the unknown and the lowest level of the trunk of the area. The Governor of the Philippines of Thailand and no one goes to Hong Kong. The shooting of the Cathay Pacific jumbo plane landing in the old airport makes a complete change. This film proves that you do not need mega budgets or head star to produce the best film. You don't have any extra gaffes and add-ons that young films often get into. A solid job from people who know all the aspects of film making and who understand the harmony between art and box office. The best piece of work!
