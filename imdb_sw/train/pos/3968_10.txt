I first saw this film as a little boy and recently bought on DVD. James Stewart brings a great deal to the role of Chip Hardesty, a FBI agent who has worked hard and dedicated. His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life, which is not all of fun. His wife (a beautiful picture of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the nature of her work, and even differs over time; The best friend of Chip and his colleagues Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) are killed in gunfight; Chip's son, Mike, joins Marines during World War II. Through it all, the family continues with courage and respect. The action plan is quite exciting and the style of the film works effectively. And music with Max Steiner says all; honesty, courage and trust. This country has a huge debt for men and women of the FBI and, in fact, by J. Edgar Hoover as well. If Mr. Hoover was cautious to consider, we could be saved 9/11, increased crime against children and many politicians of the nations that we have been considering since his crossing.
