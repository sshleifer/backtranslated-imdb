This is something new. There is a coup d'd'at with the filmmakers of the local filmmakers who are right in it. The democratically elected President who uses his power to read and write to his people and encourage them to read the constitution is being abused by private media as a dictator, a position of intelligence, a new hitler, etc. without turning from side to side The government (like, say, to stop them through bullets and other dictatorship). Oh, and still say they are stopped, of course. See how the media publishes on their own role in the fight against the TV after deleting the government with the help of rouge generals (how much stupid can you get?) and see how people Venezuela is fighting the building, putting the constitution in their hands, and strengthening their elected government. It looks like a Hollywood fairytale, but it really happened, against the clear US wishes. Documentary is a historic jewel, striking in the middle of that step, in an instant and shamelessly for the great supporters of the revolution: Good, democratic, liberal love, sympathetic USA (who still give political opponents of large amounts of money) . It is also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
