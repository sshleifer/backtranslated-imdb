I agree with another user here and say that this is one of the best movies of Kung Fu ever! I looked at it as a child and I loved it so much! Scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really plead with this person because it is recognized as a surprise. Good humor and a wonderful kung fu of this film! If you would like Kung Fu you would like this!
