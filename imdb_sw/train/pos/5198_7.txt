What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of the rap, he is the king of the level Z-flicks level, and here, he is back as his famous character, Dolemite! What? Can you dig? This film is one of the fastest run of political political, trippy kung-fu, deception, cheese, violence, and many other things that you never find in many modern movies (or any movies, actually, haha!). The program to stand on which he offers early is not to be missed! At any rate, D2 is definitely a fun way to lose one hour or more. Dolemite: "He thinks it's bad and don't have a class! I'm gon 'rock rock shot up * beep * **!"
