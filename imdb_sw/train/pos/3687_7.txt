Greetings again from the darkness. The 18 directors of 18 vignettes that are not seen about love in the city of lighting. The most unusual form that takes several parts to adjust to the viewer. We are usually the development of a character more than a 2-hour movie, it's ignoring a little weapon in order to occur in a minute of 8 minutes. It is a 18-story story of love / relationship in 18 different places of this capital. Of course, some stand better than others and others go to the comedy, while others focus on a great feeling. Other known directors are involved, including: Brothers Coen, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many known faces are also seen: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. One of the best groups includes mime, and then another mim and nerdy, still enjoys the little mimes. Also playing important roles is a coat of gown, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, child death and many other topics. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") like Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> Division groups make this interesting look, but as a film, it can not be called great. It still looks very much with a good change of the speed of the regular goer of the movie.
