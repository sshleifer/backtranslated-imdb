The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you don't need to see the original. Unfortunately this is also a great drawback. It would be nice to include a few original characters in a new story and see how their life was made. Sinclair as in the original is the best and provides the best movie comic as he tries to deal with the worst and embarrassing situation but the cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth should be grateful for the brave attempt to encourage such behavior and to create the original sequel but the film is finally drawn and inappropriate for the original temperature
