In Iran, women are officially allowed for male sports events. In June 2005, Iran's national team has an important game against Bahrain in the Azadi field for qualifying for the World Cup. The Iranian girls and lovers of soccer lovers like boys and strive to get into the field of arrest. The soccer team (and Flamengo), the beach and movies are my greatest desires; so I liked this small gem about the girls' group and their soccer enthusiasm. Director Jafar Panahi, from "Balloon of White", "Mirror" and "Circle", beat the film on the day that Iran won Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. A wonderful and amazing adventure of Iranian girls is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
