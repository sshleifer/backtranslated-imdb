The smoker's father, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found very similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who normally OVERACTS, did a very good job in this, and was able to turn a cheek on Dudley Moore on every side. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole every area. It was a "different" film, enabling the viewer to have a view in other life. We often seek to find this film on satellites. God rest on Dudley Moore; this was an enjoyable movie. Many satire with less fingers and rich snobby / rich. The close friendship between Moore and Mr. John is rather pleasant.
