Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who can apply more? The Moon provides all in one flick packed well! Gackt is not guilty - who is a friend of the Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows at a time but as old age, Kei's life breaks his heart. It does not help that both of them have love with the woman. Special effects are good to consider a small budget. It is a story of touch with human feelings. You will laugh, cry, laugh, and cry more. Even if you're not a fan of their music, see this FIL. It works well as the only Vampire's movie center. Out of 10 out of 10
