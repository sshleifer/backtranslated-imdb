Simon Pegg has a sharp player who is released from England to work for a large US magazine. Of course his way of winning makes all kinds of problems.

We know exactly why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his constant shortcomings. I loved the film. Not all of them ended up but it was a good way to stop the evening of staying in the bed watching the movie. About 7 out of 10
