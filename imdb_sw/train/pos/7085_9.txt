I bought him a DVD and I must say, (after seeing Brazil and fearing in Las Vegas) Terry again. Despite being a fan of Monty Python's movies, Terry Gilliam's skill tracks in this wonderful way, whose Bruce Willis has a wonderful role as James Cole, and also (maybe my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the illusion of Jefferey Goines. You must have a sci-fi fan, or a fan of any kind of video, because it includes doubts, sport games, actions, etc.. Every plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population is experiencing a disease that is aimed at eradicating the human race, which is provided in the past and "twelve monkeys". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is repeated in 1996 (which is when the virus was opened) to find out about the disease, so scientists can find a cure. Before going further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals dominate the world on the face of the disease that will kill mankind. whenever he is brought back to the time he is sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his instructions to the virus people. During his stay he meets Goli Jefferey (Brad Pitt) who is later involved in the cancellation of people. He also meets his psychologist (Madelein Stowe) who eventually collaborates with Bruce to save the world (as he finds it appropriate in his instructions), he is sent back from his time to the past and finally sent in 1996 where he asks himself his own sanity but later it comes through opening the last quarter of the festive movie and later builds on some amazing climax, where he tries to stop someone with the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and instead to shoot the police as the killer leaves.
