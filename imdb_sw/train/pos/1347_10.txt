Great summary, perfect and bright American movies as seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say, there is no wrong time in all of its 4 hours. Most types, intervals and directors are investigated, and discussed further from a safe view rather than modern director. For anyone even interested in American films, or movies in general. The masterpiece, and the best of the BFI century series of Cinema. <br /> <br />
