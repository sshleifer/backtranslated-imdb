This is one of the best family videos of all time. Additionally, almost all of the major rivals with this head come out the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Ghibli Studio. In particular, some great films include "My Neighborhood" and "Cookies Service." The spiritual way is very good, but it is also very interesting for the family's normal journey - ideal for both young and old. The one thing that sets "Laputa: The Castle in the Sky" away from other films with Miyazaki is that it's far beyond the tension filled adventure trip <br /> <br /> Why this beautiful film? . Because it is a perfect package: animation is very well done, and the story is really engaging and forcing <br /> <br /> Many Japanese anime is creative, but they have either dark or stupid or violent, and animation itself is often, with stylized, and young. There are no problems that beat the castle in the sky. It has burns, and the characters are recommended well, as little versions of the spread of true people. (None of the rice coat wearing posers) There is a lot of adventure, but not blood and gore. Animation is smooth, deep, and a partner of movies composed - not a lot of flat shots. The nature is amazing. <br /> <br /> The acting acting in the English version first version, mainly causes two, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is good, too. Use your voice studio, if you've got it. <br /> <br /> One of the places that I particularly enjoyed is that a large part of the story behind was left unexplained. It immediately disappears, and is now left. Why? We don't know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept others, which are easy to do because the world invented is the road so perfectly. In fact, it is fair to say that the world has fully understood more than many small characters, who in many areas are involved in stock (for example, gruff general, silk sidekick, former kooky miner, etc.). for people aged 6 to 60!
