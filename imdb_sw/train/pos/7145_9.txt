This film had a great partnership of adult participants and young players who will be on the film for a long time if there is any right. Redirecting and editing was good. I would like to look at the book that was changed from, should be great. (I liked.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Tim Blake Nelson were an explosion check! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis weren't found enough, but they were happy when they were on the screen. Children in the camp could not be better. (as I said, I loved it!)
