Larry Fessenden has been beaten with many comments on this platform. Indeed, the worst mistake, it is obvious, is the filming of the film and how the DVD would be planned. Obviously, this is not a horrible movie of the truth, at least, not people who expect anything that will be good and once satisfactory. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is essentially a film that appears to have been told from the ideas of young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the terrible world that they cannot understand. It is clear that Kim, a mother, is a psychologist, but has no indication of what's going on in her son's mind. This is also a story of divorce. It is obvious that the father, George, is a distant example, perhaps the worst, who seems to be living in a different world. "Miles's fears reach the stage of the crisis at the end of the week. This part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, unproductive trees, causes little boyfriends. The most wonderful thing in the city, it creates more doubts in his little mind. Finally, the world of Miles comes to attack him and he cannot do anything, even avoiding the spirit of Wendigo. , no matter where he is in. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to come close to a child who does not know. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, provides an internal problem in it. Miles himself take what is going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as Otis is terrible, a man who hates the world in the way he has opened. , the future audience should reach it with an open mind.
