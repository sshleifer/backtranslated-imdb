At first I saw this film, I liked it. It was different. I am a Christian (the Bible believes). I do not go with the faithful crowd of the right wing. I have left the situation. To me in their experiments of taking our government are doing what Judas tried to do. I will call it Judah's disease. Jude did not find it, though Jesus said His Kingdom was not of this world. This video actually showed some of these. I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his pupils. It was also a very good Jesus. <br /> <br /> It is a watch film and more. It is very fun.
