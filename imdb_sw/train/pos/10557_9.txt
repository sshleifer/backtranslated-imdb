Just seeing this in the Vancouver International Film Festival and it was amazing as hell and a little surreal. It is taking place in Toronto, where these two caravans live in this downtown way of the freeway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just as good as two lost who want the world to leave. Acting, discussion and text is very good, and the whole film looks good for that flick of the low budget. The Director / Author Vincenzo Natali was attending this observation, and appeared to be wise and low. This boy is an innovation and these great stories that work well within a small budget, puts a great budget for Hollywood Hollywood for shame!
