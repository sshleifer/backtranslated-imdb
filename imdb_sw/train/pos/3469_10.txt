This is one of the few movies given about "what if" that made me think. It was amazing to hear them speaking, and to remember about all the wonderful things (and not surprising) that happened among them. I really think that there is a very good possibility this happened as the movie means, and in fact they made peace with each other. That's a good memory for every fan sitting, and asking what happened between them would be selfish. What this AMAZING movie was. Comedic elements of the movie were wonderful. Thinking that they were together to connect things between them in such a way is a thought of comfort for people who want to have an opportunity to get rid of the air and someone who has not caught. Seeing John as a caring attitude, set back was returning from hearing all the garbage mentioned above ...
