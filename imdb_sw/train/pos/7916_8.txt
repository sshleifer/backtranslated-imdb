Well, well .... Roeg touched a little bold there, wasn't he? He was knowledgeable while examining the number of different characters in psychology for a few decades, but as soon as he had a bad taste to show that redemption (or even good advice) could be found in the old Catholic church, hipper-than-you alternative to The group of movie finds more violence. Still more, Theresa Russell's character - facing the experience that nothing in his sensible and definitive perspective has an explanation, is difficult to be forced to deal with that experience at another level - that of spirituality. You know, the world of the ignorant and the believer-faith, the kind of thing that cinephiles of the gallery should be high. Oh, fear ... So it gets his marriage - an idea that can be a special pledge - is confirmed by what seems to be a concern as an intervention of God. People who get this idea prima facie offensive may probably wonder why they instinctively jump in the attack mode while being challenged to take seriously the spiritual idea direction for their lives. But maybe they won't be. Of course, this film has some problems, especially Talia Shire's hottest hammers as a nun declined, the fashion model of the 1950s and all.

But, sadly, Nicolas Roeg seems to have taken a very important mauling even by asking a question as to the possible answers this film offers.
