This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the hearts of the audience, leading this beautiful picture where life is viewed through Paulie's mind and heart. We discover constantly, with the help of talented and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I can't stop my tears, although the film has a happy ending. This is good, after thousands of films I saw through my life, "Paulie" touched me very much. That is, after "Duckling Ugly", the second picture that completely inspired me.
