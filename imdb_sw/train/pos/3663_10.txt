Perhaps the last film you would expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel that this film has been installed). It's a fantasy of neorealist, a kind of oxymoron, in fact. An older woman gets a child in her cabbage patch and raises her as her own child. After a few years, the child is a little boy (called Toto) and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to orphans and, when he finally returns 18, he stops. Once, he sees that he does not have a house. Toto is hopeful, however, and will not allow anything to keep it. A man steals his savings, and instead of being angry about him, Toto becomes his friend and goes and sit with him in a small shantytown. Toto takes action and organizes the most homeless living in the area and builds the best shantytown. Recently, the landlord tries to sell this land, and a shantytown citizen defends. After a lot of experiments, the owner puts the police force to remove the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a perfect fantasy (before this was more comedic / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are so amazing and surprising that it's probably best for others to see themselves. It's very strange, and it's very funny. There are obstacles that you can add to the Miracle's plan in Milan, indeed. Fellini and Visconti were shocked when they started missing from Neorealism. I think I read this very criticized during his release. At this time, however, it is very enjoyable - I loved it very much. It can be my famous film of Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and Bicycles are coming very, very close. 10/10.
