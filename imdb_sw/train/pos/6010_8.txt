"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This was very interesting to me for a personal level, being amazed under the similarities, with their counterparts, in my life ?? The Anti-Cultural Movement in the late 60/70 years, on the university. We follow two unrelated young people in different stories, which are given together together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all endless jabber, pseudo-revolutionary at college and lunch for his school lunch, and another, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father and employer, and take "introduction" work. The film is full of the details of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) of America's views, and, confused, psychedelicrazies of self-righteousness, "we know all, we will change everything for young" better. Who is the "revolution"? What does that mean? Do you dress like one and go around talking? What? "Jump into the radar" but give the early notice of your arrival? Do you put your own plans, and go on business change, without the need for a group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "piece of the period" - full of slang, uniform, at a certain time of the surreal film (after all, this is a film with someone who gave us a wonderful "Hitting Up" of 1966), and the rest of the era but it's more. It provides an option for a cultural revolution, and goes with Antonioni (who seems to support), young people are very involved in seeing what is needed for great success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
