"Father of Beauty" was one of the most beautiful performances that unfortunately does not have a very long life. And that is very sad, especially if you think that almost all the worst shows are still available (imagine “Simple Life”) I agree that it is similar to this match with the “The Simpsons”, but despite the similarity, the show has personal features. Animation is not enough, it's not surprising, but it's good. Ideal are characters. All animals are very interesting, and even Sigfried and Roy got their time. Music was good, I loved many songs. Even if the show was not original, I think this was a great potential. As a "Mission Hill" show that is not very popular but I loved it very much, this was not appreciated which was deserved. It's a shame.
