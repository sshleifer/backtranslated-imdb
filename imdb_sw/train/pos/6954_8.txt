This movie was one of the funniest films that I saw in the years and the seats from the audience members to help me. Not since My Great Wedding Wedding Wedding (2002) has laughter has been as optional and intense. Easily has as hard as last year Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) for its use of controversy (confidence in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). The proportion of Ivan Reitman's Director between comedy and drama, among the wonderful and interesting things is great. There will never be a great shock and massive rule of comedy. At the same time, this romantic comedy predicts never lose his emotional affair even though the end is to announce in advance. Somehow, it is very obvious that it is good to see how it plays. Such as in real life, sometimes the truth is very clear that one cannot see the truth. Eighteen of the ten stars are on top with Tootsie (1982). It is possible nine (depends on how it looks for a second look).
