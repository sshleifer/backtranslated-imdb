I enjoyed this film. Many reviews have been bad, but many critics think the movie should be like a drawing of the idea. This film has little blood, but some are just fun and very entertaining. Remember about Julia Roberts being a Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful woman and there is more than just that. Emma was very excited to look at Nancy Drew's position. It's good to see a new face. I believe he will go away. Nancy Drew cannot focus on books, but stories are still good. There is also a good mix of other actors and actors to help as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - were not invited. I wonder Disney didn't give this film. Some people may not like this film because it does not have sex, abuse, and curses. This is a good family film which is common in this day at a time. So make your family, watch this film and judge for your self how good. I can't wait for the good.
