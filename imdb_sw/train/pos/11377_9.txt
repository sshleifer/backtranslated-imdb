Citizens X describe the story of Andrei Chikatilo, Rostov slope, who was killed by 52 people over the past 8 years, especially women and children. It shows how the investigation was prevented by Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult to investigate crime. It works in such a brilliant way that no one will be recognized. At first it is perhaps a slow bit of speed, but it reminds you that the story reveals. I can only say that, near the "Sheep of the Sheep", this is the best horse for the ordinary killer I have ever seen. It is very difficult to say what actor's performance is standing on others in this film. Stephen Rea is very good as an expert skills expert who is put in charge of investigation. The performance of Donald Sutherland as the chief of pride, and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him, is as good as Rea's. And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann, playing the main character? DuMann created a gentle attitude that encourages compassion instead of hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but it is also a sad example, abused and shaved by his wife, his master, his co-workers. I can only recommend this film to everyone who is attracted to the well-made docu festival, where characters are still more important than special effects. It is worth at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
