Paul Reiser is one of the most popular people in the show business. I have read all his books and I think he's good. Peter Faulk can give a punch line with their best. The combination of two is magic. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really get to know. Through the road trips the father and the child unite for the first time in their life in the middle of the family crisis. They do all the things that men and women think doing in life ... they do only later in life. The situation is very interesting, but have a sense that it can actually happen to people in real life (not to investigate on top or cartoonish). This is the first time I see Paul Reiser and fully believe every emotion expressed. Sometimes, her eyes looked sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie with good story and plot. It has a comedy and feeling but a message to strengthen ... Olympic Dukakas do great work too :)
