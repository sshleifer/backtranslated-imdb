Silverlake Life, a view from here, is a very amazing movie about AIDS and also about gay relationships. Some pictures are very hard to take, especially when someone is gay or worried about AIDS, and perhaps with anyone who is watching. It is not easy to make films about the serious disease and its effect on not just one, but two lives. This movie teaches you how to care for each other in those difficult times, but it is not very much, it still shows life at any time, reminding you that outside the theater or your room, life continues, whatever the end of some people may be. The characters are very interesting, when we look at their friendships in shots that may never be more than a severe limit, they never reveal anything personal or bad. Children should not watch this film, but adults should deal with such situations or not, they should do so, and they will not appreciate the tears they have left.
