I must admit that for the first half of an hour or so of this movie I was completely lost. There was a romantic sense of humor, but with a good level of barebones program and a general sense of uncertainty that was close to making me think that I had lost my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. There was no time for blindness to realize and there was no sudden area that took me. In fact there is nothing very exciting happening in the entire movie. It was as if I suddenly realized that the movie was meant to be largely useless - and that in its very balance it was its charm. Morgan Freeman star as an actor without a name who gets "a small project" to start his career. He is going to play the supermarket manager, and he uses the day in the supermarket of the neighborhood for the study of the role. While there he meets the buttons with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a moneymaker who wants more out of life. He helps her prepare for a job interview as she tries to play a role, when she starts a real life. It is true to look at him "(for that is how the behavior known in credit) will be harassed by the local Target's visit. Freeman and Vega were together, for a wonderful but quite kind of romantic relationship but fatherly chemistry. If you feel lost at first, close this. In the end, it becomes a lovely and interesting movie. 7/10
