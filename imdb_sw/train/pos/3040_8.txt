Gregory Peck's transparency of Douglas MacArthur from the Corregidor War in the Philippines at the beginning of the Pacific War was largely through his removal as a UN Commander during the Korean War provides a reason to believe all three of the possibilities. Indeed the US General Physician of World War II (and perhaps ever) MacArthur is given here as a man of great controversy. He says that more soldiers are looking for peace, but in fact he is glory in battle; he always refuses any political expectations, but almost everything he does is deliberately to be declared as a presidential candidate; he really believes that soldiers under his command should follow his instructions by letter, but he himself loses orders from the US President; he shows great respect for other cultures (especially in the Philippines and Japan) and is still not quite good for his country. All these things have been done equally in this film, and the latter has left to draw his decisions on that person, although one left undoubtedly that MacArthur is sincerely interested in his country, and especially the Army dedicated his life. Peck's performance was, as I said, brilliant - for sure, in fact, the shade next to everyone else in the film (which is probably appropriate, due to who shows!) and the potential discrimination of Ed Flanders. I am even looking at Harry Truman and his view of the MacArthur: sarcastic (often referring to the MacArthur as "His Kingdom,") anger, anger and ultimately fed by this great man who cannot respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also attracted to MacArhur's wife, Jean, who was dedicated to her husband (who was known as “Great,” although their relationship seems to be very happy.) I was very excited about this film, although perhaps I would like to learn more about the early MacArthur life. . I have been criticizing for MacArthur's response to Eisenhower being elected President ("He will make a good President - he was the best clerk I ever had" - which seems to consider what MacArthur thought about the position of the President should be, especially for his military commanders during the war. ) Well worth the look. 8/10
