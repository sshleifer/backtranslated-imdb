The epic dialogue of one of the biggest attempts of America comes to DVD with some of the "Extras" much better. BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added to Europe), telling the story of the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the Mormon faith (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after The tribes were killed by their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen during 1940, as America was about to enter World War II. It was a strong argument against the chief of Fox, Darryl F. Zanuck and was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, for this was the first attempt of the film to show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D'Arc, the best-recorded Motion-recorder at the University of Brigham Young in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to the DVD format in the discard version. Mr. D'Arc, who a few years ago made his doctor's writing on the film, has given one of the most comprehensive films made on DVD. He separates the truth from falsehoods and listens to the audience to understand why these films were so popular with Church leaders even though true text is run in the film. One of the bits of fun information deals with Dean Jagger, an actor who is responsible for the title. Many years after the film married Latter-saint and eventually he was converted to LDS faith. There is a lot to learn from D'Arc's skills and it's good to have this as part of DVD! There are over 100 pictures from Fox & BYU records included in the discs, with amazing photo premiere photos in seven movies in Salt Lake City. Thank you FOX for another excellent DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for your great comment!
