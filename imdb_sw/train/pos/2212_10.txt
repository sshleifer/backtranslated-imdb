E! TV is a good channel and Talk Soup is amazing, for the flash you can see the change of events. We want more scripts and funny author ever Stan Evans. $$$$ Billionaire thus left him to Billionaire. Many super stars wanted to make a film with actor Stan Evans, who has "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable} acting fashion. He should make more films. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or perhaps many talented manufacturers. We love FAME time and good luck to get. What? She has produced any surprise-U-dramas? or maybe any problem? The project about Bernie Madhoff will be a great television written by STAN EVANS. What? How much did he write? Does he under $$$$$$$$ a billion deal with Disney ?? He should get more than $ 50 million ... He can also write television movies about King POP's late Michael Jackson. We want to see more and with Stan Evans in movies and on TV. Thank you very much. Elvis has left the building!
