This is a film that should be seen by anyone who is attracted to, who comes from, or will have trouble eating. It is an amazing and sensitive picture of bulimia in the little girl, its causes and its symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most talented young artists who work in the movie today, Alison Lohman, who was later very good at 'Where the Truth False'. I would like to suggest that this film will be displayed in all schools, as you will never see the best on this issue. Alison Lohman is the best, with one wonder for his ability to show the pain of the girl who has trouble with this compulsory problem. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure and the same degree of accuracy. Its emotional form is very accurate, each area can be tested in microscopically with its effectiveness of injuries, to the level of hysteria and deficiency that reaches a failure rate. Late Winningham is a good choice to play with her mother, and it does so with great sympathy and feeling as well as well as Lohman's. Together, it makes a pair of sensitive oscillator sensitive vibrating in resonance with someone else. This film is an amazing achievement, and the director Katt Shea should be proud. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like the best natural films, this is after all animal behavior on the edge edge. Bulimia is a rigorous version of how the soul of torture can destroy its own body for the frenzy of despair. And if we cannot sympathize with people who suffer from a deep depression, then we are dead inside.
