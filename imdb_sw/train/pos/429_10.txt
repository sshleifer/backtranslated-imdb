It has been around 50 years since the movie has been made about romance and mysticism. The only two movies I can think of is "Enchanted April" (1992) and "Enchanted House" (1945). Both movies that use amazing actors are not stars. In both movies, all actors gave their beautiful romantic displays. "Enchanted April" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy during holidays. It's amazing "April Enchanted" was released in 1992. It seems to be very fun.
