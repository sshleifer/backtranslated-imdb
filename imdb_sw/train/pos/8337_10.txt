Be a great fan of romantic sex, and therefore, after seeing a large number of these films, very few people call me as unique. For that matter, it is very rare that I am gas for breath through a laugh during several scenes. The story of love is a little thin down, but I would say that maybe it's better, if this romantic comedy has a strong emphasis on "comedy", and in any case it puts the limits of a little more trust than I would like more rom rom. Four scientists offered during the funniest not only in this film, but in any film I saw for a long time. I struggled for a few moments before finally choosing "10" on "9" as a mark, because I believe that so many people use it without exception, and therefore the maximum loss of its effect. I am also a great fan of Meg Ryan, who helps, but this is one of the few films that I have seen that I would say is a huge shadow. He and Tim Robbins are thrown as heads, but for me I play the second fiddle for the antics of bumbling professionals. A truly kind of film-sounding.
