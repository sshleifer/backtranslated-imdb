I waited to see this film for a long time. It promos gave the right views on the content and when I finally noticed, I actually got it well. Many of the most popular romantic movies stay with couples to finally get married or start a happy life after marriage but there are major changes that are needed for these changes from past life to new relationships and life. That is all this film about the time that newly married couples Fardeen and Esha are married through organized marriage and start their life with their lives. Acting is actually placing him legally though I think Esha remained silent and could use some lines for himself. The story was well closed and the conversation was better. The editor and direction is also good, Meghna Gulzar did a good job here. In summary I would say it is a good game of cum romance, a true mix of what sounds can give a fresh player.
