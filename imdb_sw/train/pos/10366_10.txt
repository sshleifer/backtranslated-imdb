No one should "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie reminds you of the best of old "Hollywood". Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches the Streep line for the line, and take to take it - it's one of the best to display yet of its great talent to act and she's in her sexy and more beautiful, despite her size. This widespread films are a treat for any movie fan who likes a court game to be invited, displayed in human but trivial words. The movie - which won several top awards in Australia - is not just a superlative and director, but a wonderful and realistic Australian area. It proves that people are the same worldwide. And, after all these years, people are still thrilled to repeat the popular streep line, with all the emphasis: "Dingo ate moy baby!" Including "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld."
