I just looked at the "Last End" in the art library of my beautiful school. It's amazing, like all the items of Peter Weir, but not always as a precaution-do if I like to love it. I found myself fascinated by my ideas (because it is very well dealt with the film director Weir) but at the same time I didn't have enough motivation with them. AKA I got a little stir on advertising. The plan revolves around Aussie's lawyer who comes with some dreams that link him to the Aborigone group. <br /> <br /> It comes from a climatic sequence and has a devastating effect on the mood (especially extraordinary, "integrating" sound design) and strong direction; but he did not like me as Weir's future movies. I just like to look again though. <br /> <br /> Good movies about losing and hidden. Because, at the end, the secrets between whites and Aboriginies are very devastating. God bless you Peter Weir, though. For him alone this film is worth watching ... a very great director. As a reply to Aussie Malick! I would like to give it 7 because it has enough good ideas to overcome its terrible time.
