I am a parent of the special needs of the child and I enjoyed the film! It was love, warm and happy. I learned long ago to see humor in things. I especially thought it was good how all the characters concerned about Frankie and who could take care of her after her grandmother died. I attended a film review with other parents and relatives of special needs before the film was edited. Everyone enjoyed the film and actually led a good discussion. We talked about how our children laugh and we talked about how we are worried about them. The scribe told how he works with autistic children and other children special needs as a volunteer for several years. He put character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has given us through difficult times. I give them two movie thumbs up !!!
