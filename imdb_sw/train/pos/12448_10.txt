First off; I am a Volunteer fan, and I have been reading the music since I was a child, and I have seen original films about our unworthy hero, but where they miss, this one ROCKS! Well, here we go: Mrs. Blaise works for the casino, robbers come along with her to start gambling with her friends. If the robber is successful, he will have to tell him about himself. If he succeeds twice, one of the employees goes free. (A stupid voice, yes, well, I'm not good to say either.);) She tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about helping an older person in a refugee camp and how they are avoiding, living with natural laws. They are looking for food, and they teach him to read and fight. As they approach the civil war, and if they are taken for rebellion, they are shot by an old man who dies, which helps him to meet the city alone. Then she meets a man who is a casino who is currently working, and where the story ends. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is an amazing fight with the line is quite cool. Alexandra Staden is TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Typically as common and powerful, grace and intelligence like comic-one. Not surprisingly though, also to hear gently say a little bit broken, but it doesn't mean since the comic book can't speak loudly, but it must certainly have a certain feeling. (Not to mention that weird English everyone speaking English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> Acting is very good, even a child whose little Blaise man should have weaknesses! <br /> <br /> My favorite place should be where she rips up her kick kick kick's kick! Surprisingly! : D I can't wait until the real adventure starts on the next film! <br /> <br /> Looking at that, you will not be discouraged!
