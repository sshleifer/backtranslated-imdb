Simple comments ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a very good film that I can watch from time to time. It is obviously one of the top ten links. With a very cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wrote a complete script with Neil Simon, according to his play <br /> <br /> It is actually a life-style to be fully done. If you have a digital cable, someone gets a menu below the screen to give something available. It usually provides this film ***% star but it really deserves the **** stars. If you look at this film, one can say that it will be as beautiful and fresh a hundred years from now.
