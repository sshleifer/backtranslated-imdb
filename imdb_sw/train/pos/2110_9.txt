Highly written on the plot of the film, good performance of the acting, script, melancholy, pleasant atmosphere, good direction - can I add what? Just look at one of the most hot, well-done, poignant screens have been done. It is the Christmas night and the behavior of Frank Morgan (the shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) survives from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. If each of his staff leaves, he invites them to a Christmas meal. Each of them and each of them translates gently. They all have plans for their Christmas nights. At this point there is great sadness for this moving area. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his work and this area brings me to tears. Thanks we have good intentions for this very special place. A new employee, a young boy, is the last to leave the shop on a snowy road. Of course Mr. Matuschek is approaching this young man and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will treat him with a good Christmas dinner that this boy had never seen! The post is confused, he is also clear as alone as Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a good Christmas meal. Every time I see this place it moves me. If you manage to get a good DVD to enjoy a great trailer with Frank Morgan identifying as Mr. Matuschek and the appearance of the film director - talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is fun from beginning to end.
