It's amazing! In Story Mode, go from punk to pro. You should complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. You create your own skater and make it a name, and you can make it as stupid or true. You are with your friend Eric in the game until he takes you and prompts you on a skateboard team (you can choose a team to be on top) and then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (not part of the story while though) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can open hidden skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap, and much more. You can create the goal of the goal and write what they say. If you get bored to do this, you can make early goals in early parks. The only thing I didn't like about this game is that sometimes it was difficult to drive. 9/10.
