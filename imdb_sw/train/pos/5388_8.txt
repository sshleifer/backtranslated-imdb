I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I couldn't stop looking until it was over, even though I was kind of what I would think what would happen. Farrell was chief in his role, and everyone else did a good job. Some of these seemed to extend borders, but all in all, I loved it !! If you have the opportunity to see it, please do! I really cried on a few scenes, but then I think if you're a mother you would like. Loretta is good, and I was very surprised by the idea that their widows and mothers there, seemed before the 'time of her. I say, watch if you can, and listen to the criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I really enjoyed it!
