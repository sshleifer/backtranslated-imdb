First of all, do not enter into Revolver expects another Stock Snatch or Lock, this is a different kind of gangster film. <br /> <br /> I saw a night gala with this movie definitely split viewers. It's a kind of movie where half of the audience will stop thinking What was that? That was bad, and the other half will leave to think What was it? That was cool. Personally I love films that I don't understand, i.e.Mullholland Drive, and Common Accused, so I enjoyed Revolver. It is definitely not perfect though. I saw a big problem coming to a distance away, at least part of it, and although sometimes some of the left-out blinds are not explained is good, Revolver holds AJA of questions not explained because no one seems. Also, some events, such as animation, and the location where Sorter goes to the murder of the assault (in fact one of my favorites), though, surprising incidents of looking, seemed just because they were amazing to watch, not because they were suitable and movie. But there were so many things too. I thought that work was good from all major actors, Jason stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a good surprise). This moment really had my interest, and one, to emphasize, a full-blown act, after another. When Ray Liotta was being held under a wow .... well you see. The document was made very well, and the sound of the sound, like many Guy Ritchie films, was good. Though action under movies such as, Fighting Club, Mullholland Drive, and Typical characters, it was still amazingly fast fast, psychologically, movie action, and multiple twists and turns and tones of scenes you Recall long after the movie is over.
