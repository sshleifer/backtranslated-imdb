Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was not established. Garrison's Story and the First Lady was untrue and indifferent; The President was a cut card. And who were real criminals however? Nothing was created or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole was involved. The criminals had no name and did not build, so you did not feel involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland struggled to incorporate the real truth in the story - expulsion and struggle were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were all unpredictable in their roles, Basinger was absolutely not characterized by no way that Longoria had Agent Service Secret. This may be a very good film but somehow has lost the way, and many unanswered questions. Encouraging all of them with very good events. And did they use 'West Wing' to set up White House stations? - I continued to expect CJ or Charlie to appear!
