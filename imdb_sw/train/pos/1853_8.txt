Well, it is still a film that plays with your feelings and comes all soft against the stone film. But I am a sucker for those so I gave a good score ... acting was very good and there were many emotions. Violence is put down below which makes the change. I would like to give them 9 if not the last greeting! All in the beautiful movie and very good actors <br /> <br />
