Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the small cartoon market. This market is essentially headed by Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies shorts, coming from Warner Bros. But MGM can also open dirty gems, like "To Spring", an amazing story about a very good season of the year. In the circumstances shown here, the spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is made. And to whom? For small elves living underground. Every spring, when the snow will begin to melt, it begins to work. They start by hitting the rocky poles of the rain, then cutting them through the stem and turning it into a color color, which will be moved to the bottom and bearing grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon shows the manufacture of spring, but the second part is a little different. Old Man Winter returns again and tries to extend the winter by destroying the work of elves. So, from this point, we help the war between elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> Music you heard here is very amazing. The tracks hit the head on the head as the ink spot on the paper. The second songs are exciting and effective with action. This is just fantastico, Giorgio! The animation process is also fun. Color is a good mix and every little detail is displayed in a beautiful, epic environment. The concept itself is brilliant. The elves are interesting characters, so it is Old Man Winter, who effectively shows the cool feeling and anger of the white season. There is also a powerful message included here. The war seems to be lost to the elves at the end, until one late arrival elf jump in action and leads to victory elves over the winter. So the thing is: only one person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "For Spring" is a classic lost classic from short cartoon moments. It's the most amazing thing is that the director of this cartoon made its first here. And who is the director of "Spring"? It's William Hanna some ...
