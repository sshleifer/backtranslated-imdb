Henry Fonda takes care of what we believed for a long time Abraham Lincoln was like. It's a fool. Through the performance of Fonda led (on the face) that Abraham Lincoln was a bumpkin country. But, through his struggle with a lynch group and especially during court proceedings, you can see that under the outside is an experienced person who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to convince people around him. In this film Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to give humor. It's a matter of him lost over the years. When he tells you stories and jokes he has time to complete. There is a sequence in an attempt that was making it very difficult. He shows this gift again in Eve Lady in 1940. At the end of John Ford is quite brilliant by Henry Fonda going up the hill and by far the great storm model of the Civil War. He goes forward in history. The movie is false but insights in Lincoln is great. Certainly worth seeing again.
