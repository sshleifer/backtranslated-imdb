I liked this film very much. I have read a few other comments, and although I have compassion for those who did not understand, I agree with some of the complaints. Which, in a strange way, makes it like this more film. I agree that they have been beaten well to make a public film, it still has many levels and it is still good to watch. I also love movies, like this, which causes a lot of talk, theory, the end of the possibilities and small secrets. Congratulations to Mr., evident in my top ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. We saw this when it happened first when I was going back to Mexico, it was late at night and I had to return to my hotel and I had a great trip to paranoia! Where is the end of dreams and to start true?
