This movie is interesting, charming, and it becomes easy for those who enjoy the light entertainment. Hollywood is not a chance for a great history of history so I just accept it as it is. Bing, in his usual style, does very well as a necklace, Hank Martin, who accidentally is transported to another age, during King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is as beautiful as Alisande, or Sandy, something of Hank's suffering though he is betrothed to Sir Lancelot who is brave and terrifying, played by Henry Wilcoxon. I love the event when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Mr. Sagramore (Wm Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dressed in dirty clothes and took their highways and bags to get the first rule. King Arthur's comments, "I say, we are not alone" when giving his well-dressed dress, it is one of the best moments of the film. William Bendix's display is a great misconception, not to mention his experiments to "Olde English". The story is not long but it has done well in my opinion and I am enjoying it every time I see it. It's a great family entertainment too. <br /> <br />
