This can not be one of the best films made but in general it is a very enjoyable piece, with a heart of light that everyone involved seems to have a good time. It is recommended because of a very good feel. Okay, so "do" for Frank Sinatra leaves a lot of desirable but singing it is a great feature of redemption and songs are fully suited to the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra went on to make more films where his undoubtedly acting power had continued but in this, his first project in Hollywood, his voice, not his work, is his main contribution to this movie. I have looked at it on TV and it still raises my feelings as it was the first time I saw many years ago.
