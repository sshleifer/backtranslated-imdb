What a enjoyable movie I am is. It reminds me of a series of films made during 40 years. Common stories, hit by characters and conspiracy that are not over or very difficult. In fact it's not about anything. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - here taken for screens - reads like Jane Austen for men. We find a story that has romance in his heart, but there is also great pleasure: the events of the war (type), the escape violence, the wrong tags, the swordplay, and the funniest line I have heard for years: "Only Visitors will be announced by name in the ball held. There are many hilarity, trouble, and not the hardness of heart as St Ives tries to fight and get his way back to the family and the life he knew quite well. He / she should see Jean Marc Barr perfect in position position. Anna Friel is happy to be happy as Flora's knowledgeable and Miranda Richardson almost goes off with a movie as wise and secular, she has been there and see-all-a-Susan. Richard Grant provides a comic aid of the above order. This will not be a big movie than anyone has ever seen, but his tricks have been denied and the whole film is experiencing energy and life.
