I loved Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is so bad that Lydia Reed has decided to forget and disappear. She was the best in the show. Of course Walter Brennan was good with Tony Martínez. I loved him when he called Amos Señor Grampa.I buy I on the DVD and I can't wait to buy 2-6 times. If only there would be more displays on television like this, everything would be better. This edition was found briefly in the summer of 1999 but then lost. God bless all members who have left and please, Leddia Reed, inform them again. You are loved and respected. The Real Mc Coys will live forever.
