This film has been hit down. I liked it. It was really sweet and hearty. A family who struggles but does not make it an unemployed family that is a typical film today. The film did not make it an issue that has little money or is the Dominican Republic how Hollywood has. Instead the issue is Victor is young and needs to grow. He does, slowly, with the end of the film. He has ways to go, but it was an attempt to continue. Her grandmother is very beautiful and a place where a little boy gives us and I was laughing too long. Indie's true heart
