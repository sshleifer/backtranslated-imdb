Kudos to Cesar Montano to revive the movie of Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - has drama, action, romance, and area that will make you laugh. When the story is not original (triangular love - or making the fourth love, the Japanese victory, the rebellion, the United States as a master), its testimony is cool, especially in the original language - Filipino, nipongo in Japanese and English for America. <br /> <br /> This movie will go like one of the best Pinoy movies this year. <br /> <br /> Go look at this!
