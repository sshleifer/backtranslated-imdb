As a born-born German mother and an English father (who spent five years in prison) I come from a special place. One has to deal with various citizens on one side of the family and WW2 winners on the other. These services cannot explore every part of Hitler's psyche and should give the viewer a taste of the time and best if a person can have a Hitler mental state. In this series is very good. Carlyle is very good like O'Toole, I would like to have more information about relationships with others in the party Because Hitler did not do anything alone. He had people around him who followed him with letters often without question and certainly without question later in his work of murder. What went through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would be important to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people look for more. It can also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue with power.
