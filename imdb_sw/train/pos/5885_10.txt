This was a great surprise. I had no high expectations but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They didn't spend too much time to fix the old so that they did not rely on the success of the old TV show to carry the film. In general it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girl said that this could be a weekly set and I think I might agree with her.
