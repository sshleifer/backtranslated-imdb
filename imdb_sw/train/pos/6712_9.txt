I love Sabrina! It's one of my fave shows !! My popular events are; The one where it returns Libby to be geek, the first part, the true part of love and the rest of the first series. I think the college events are not the same as those in secondary school but they were better than the last series that was bad. Valerie was a good character because he was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in other brilliant events. Hilda and Zelda were surprised, and there was no explanation of where they went! Libby was a good character too. I have never loved Morgan or Roxy, they were not the same as his other friends.
