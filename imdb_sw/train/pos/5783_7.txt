I have read Kerching review on IMD, and in fact, I haven't seen one good inspection, even now. I really like Kerching. Kerching is on a young boy named Taj Lewis, so that he could earn £ 1,000,000 for his mother, puts a site called rudeboy. This site offers many interesting things, if only Taj, and its friends 2 - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj appear. I see this amazing show and I enjoy watching it. Acting is O.K., but it is possible to be better, characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, a friend of Taj, his ignorance is what makes him funny. and another friend of Taj Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the café'e called "Chill." We can't see him, we just hear him. The younger brother of Taj Omar, and his older Missy sister is also funny. And the best friend of Missy Kareesha. Often Taj's almost proved, almost. With comedy, the Kerching game as well as the love of life and the loss of loved ones makes this app preferable.
