I loved the film. Some of the activities of the actions were very interesting, well-off. I really liked the opening area that had a half truck in it. A very important point of action that was seen well. Some transition events were done in interesting ways such as photography time, unusual colors, or interesting corners. Also the film is funny is several parts. I also loved the way the wicked was shown. I would like to give 8 out of 10 films.
