Wow, this film had a great impact on me, moved me,. It is an amazing story about a Cambodia girl who sells a sex business. I can't stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The film is realistic, the film was the eye of the eye, I can't imagine anyone leaving them and out of wanting to help make this change with this terrible problem that is going away. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best movies I have seen this year. The girl who plays Holly does a wonderful job with her behavior. Ron Livinston gives a wonderful performance. The film has brought me tears, It describes the important message you need to hear around the world. Everyone should go to this movie. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!
