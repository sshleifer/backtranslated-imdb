There are many diseases born in the human mind given in modern times. Care or information obtained in the Pyschosis area, has developed psychology, consultants and mentors are doing enough work to last for decades. From time to time, some of these senses are discovered by those who do not know their medication or even their existence. That is the basis of the film "Night Registry." It says the story of the famous radio star Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who uses his evening to convince his audience of the good news about homosexual life. Maybe her because her show is losing a real veneer that leads Noon to accept her again. Feeling with all her partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and her best friend (Joe Morton), she wants to stay in her despair and exclusion. It is here, a wonderful night night asking for help. The day needs to feel important and reach the voices of despair which is a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). When reading a traumatized artwork that depicts the early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is struggling to help. However, things do not seem to be seen by Noon recently found in a strange and mysterious story given out of medical stress. This movie is clean Robin Williams and not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this can be comical. Instead, this may be one of William's largest exhibitions. ***
