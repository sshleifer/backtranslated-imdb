Once a year "comes" a similar movie and makes things easier for you. You don't have to think it's good, it's just the same. You enjoy it when you look at it, and it takes you home. I can't say it's perfectly, but it's close. Make - great, story-interesting and with suspension elements. It is a small family story, very good predictable, but it's not the secret itself that is important. that's the way it takes the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed by how the director expressed their deep relationship (blind girl and cousin). The only thing I didn't like was the actor who played mother, was very tough and unnecessary. Keren
