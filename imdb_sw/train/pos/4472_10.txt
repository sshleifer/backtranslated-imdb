From the beginning you can see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra makes this team extraordinary! The songs they sing are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is good and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is a child actor who I have never seen. If you like piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animation with real actors and it did so wonderfully in the number of non-forgotten drums. Of course Kelly's funniest movies.
