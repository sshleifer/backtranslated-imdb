I don't see many photos, but I love porn videos. And I love gory movies. So when I heard about the movie star star porn, I was very excited. Of course, that was many years ago and when I heard about all the problems in making and finishing the film, I didn't think I would like to see it. But I did and I am not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even for all of its errors. First, mistakes. The story has been set up in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story that seems to be about to say is about the relatives of Sawney Beane from Scotland. Why not just put it there and fly a third-grade report on the migrants of Samhain / Ireland / Halloween? Also, it breaks its rules by saying that you are safe on the road, but then the cannibal mutant just start running amok everywhere. It has never been clear how bracelets are involved. There is a great stone stone that is already visible, but no one has seen it before. The fictional films of self-offensive and hence are the perpetrators. Heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that includes the character never never MET. The latter cannot understand. <br /> <br /> Why does it work? Gore! Surely I would like more, but it was fun to see a very bad movie that was not afraid to be anything more than a movie of the year. Two killings are waay over and Taylor Hayes has a disgusting scene. Two wild killings are also given extended shots on DVD. I've always been mindful that the gore could win a stupid story with evil birth emphasized that.
