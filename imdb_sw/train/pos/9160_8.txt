In all comments of praise or destruction of Dalton's performance, I thought it was better. He doesn't like Rochester as a good, spoiled boy, but as a powerful, powerful man. I liked this version, although the bullet on the video element was sometimes bothering, and the events with Jane and St John were never quite. I offer this 8.
