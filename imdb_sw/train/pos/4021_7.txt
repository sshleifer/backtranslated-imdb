Hard stories set behind the distribution of Bharat. Faithful Muslims who rob the innocent Hindu girl, and who is taught a Hindu who burns the Muslim's harvest - but eventually ends up loving them both. The story is powerful, but the screens and flows disappear. Music genres and songs are the best. Then comes a memorable work with an old man of Urmila Matondkar. Photography takes time, violence, and delicious rural Punjab very well. Some participants did not do well, or did not have the opportunity to act. The direction is the weakest link. The characters were not developed properly. Not crisp, contrary to the "World", where even the character of the line 5 leaves a mark. The latter is very interesting. This story may have a different end - and they would all be the same.
