This movie has one of the largest exhibitions of Richard Dreyfuss, as an actor who has a dictator and does so by convincing that his mother can't see him. Also, this film is amazing, but it has a good side too. What is more interesting about this film is Madonna, who is the dictator's grandmother, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's reforms from the bride to the political leader added much to the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the movie. And the main character, who at the beginning of the movie is the strikers who are struggling with a certain amount of buffoon, is also continuing with the end of the movie that honors him. I loved this film.
