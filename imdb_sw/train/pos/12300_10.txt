This edition of Anna Christie is in Germany. Greta Garbo also has Anna Christie, but all other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were beaten back because Garbo was following in Germany. Garbo himself loved to love Anna Christie in this version on the English version. It's a good story and a must-see for fans of Garbo.
