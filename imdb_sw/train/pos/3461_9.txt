This part of Columbo is further explained by director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his first films. It should be considered for the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who kills his girlfriend by writing to maintain his life. Jack Cassidy would appear in Columbo's future. After all, Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a secret writer who plans to make a perfect killing. After his first murder, his second victim will be the owner of a terrible tragedy who could betray him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills him. It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's understanding as Columbo makes him aware after watching this section more frequently over the years. What a television today that lacks over the success of years is that people will want to look at the exhibitions regularly if they love characters. It is not about who does it, how and why, it is the Columbo clan and its merits that you love up with the audience as myself.
