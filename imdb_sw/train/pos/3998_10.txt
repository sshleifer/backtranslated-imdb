I somehow lost this film when it came out and found it late as thanks to last week for a friend's recommendations. I can honestly say that I can't remember another very close film, which makes so many things very well. Writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced, and even prevented. Exhibitions and editions are reduced but have been revealed, enabling the appearance of a visual view to rule in a strange way and create images, capture loneliness and abandon many unspecified ways. Acting is also amazing, with all the characters being real and dangerous pain in the compelling ways that the film can offer. They give their inner weakness and unsafe protection, fierce. Real victory for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team. You must see for popular movie lovers.
