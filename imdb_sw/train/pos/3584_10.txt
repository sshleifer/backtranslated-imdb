My name is Heather and I am a girl whose story this movie was based. I want to thank you all who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as bad and difficult as some of the things shown in this film, did not come even to describe how bad things were true. not mentioning everything affect my mother and sister. once again thanks to the positive views that everyone had, I care about the truth <br /> <br /> Hi everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that many years have passed since this film was made. Harder even believe that people were still looking a year ago. For any of you who have experienced the same or similar situation, please know that there are people out here on the internet who understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
