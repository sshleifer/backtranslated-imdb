The first two of Jim Thompson's reforms given in 1990 (the other being with the most popular definitions), after the score of all the Thompson symbols: women's risk, self-confidence, and characters who do not have the same as others think of, \ t or not bad. Jason Patric is as good as the old boxer that doesn't deserve to get out of the game for life from the ringing event (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire series for the outside body behind) and also -one-see Rachel Ward also provide great performance. But Bruce Dern is a secret weapon of the film: its grifter talking sweet Uncle Bud engages each of his events. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic aid in this film, so see it is ready to be sown into empty.
