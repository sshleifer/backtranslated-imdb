The story of Patty Duke on his life and coping with manic depression was like a life war. I saw myself working like him. I was so surprised by the similarity of our life together with sexual abuse that we all endured as children. I saw the movie when it started first in 1990 and I loved this movie very much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression can get a lot from this film. Never worry about whether it showed his prize or what they had. That's not an issue here. The question is how Mrs. Duke had diseases and fought to survive and win. Mrs Duke has a lot to be proud of her success and her experiments of illness that often leave many victims without hope. Unless a man has struggled with this personal disease they do not know hell should live with them. The movie to me was successful because it showed real issues and how a man who is sad and manic acts. It was true ... so, so, really. It was like looking up there on the screen. I would like to thank Mrs Patty for someone to be brave to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
