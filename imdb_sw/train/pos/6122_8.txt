This film is completely hilarious. In essence, the plot revolves around the killer of a mechanism somehow turned into a snowman striker through a b-movie movie accident. then leads to the city and begins to frighten people. her up to the local police chief and other characters to try and stop him. its made on the wee budget and shows, but the great thing about this film is knows that its trash. The maintenance of Styrofoam and the polystyrene of the giants of the snowman are the classic, and this is clearly intended - is one of the few films that have its budget as the main main point of sale. with the absence of comic there is sometimes a very pleasant moment - hearing right at the top of the voice of the father destroying his children, and the scene of the rape technician set for the film. fantastic tacky fun
