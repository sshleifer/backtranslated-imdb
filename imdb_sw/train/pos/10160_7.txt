I went to this film to think it would be the master's movie tested by b. I came out and was very surprised. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. He had a wonderful time of comedic. Jokes in this film was amazing original and really funny and joke flat one or two in the middle. The plan was enough to unite all, the woman (Eva) died on her wedding day and returns to persuade a woman who is going with her husband-to-be husband, her voice is closed but it works quite well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Total watch of his favorite movies, if it doesn't get on the DVD when it comes out.
