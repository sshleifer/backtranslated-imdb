We have not thought movies in a brother-in-relationship on Indian movies, or any language or medium. This relationship has several features that are not used in movies or novels. Usually, a sister is shown as a player who can be used for compensation at the peak. This movie takes the matter to a completely different light. It is written by George Eliot's novel "Mill on Floss". The brother is a prosaic, beautiful, blue-colored boy who is a good-looking baby and a lover of his mother. Sister is a romantic, wild and rebellious law of non-communal law. Despite this, the sister's love is a winner. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the love of two brothers who have separated from childhood and the revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also a brother's attempt to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to despise the world. Although movies and novels are placed around three centuries away in two distant countries, but those feelings are similar and still hold true.
