When you are usually watching your short film you always fear that someone who creates a film tries to throw it into it. That's not this. A good story about a little girl with enough power and other worldly attempts to help do the same things. Eric Etebari is doing a good job of representing a distorted justice spirit and helps to show the problems of the rough and wrong line. All the little girl and dad give a beautiful show in this beautiful short film, but Eric's performance is obvious to show the story in this story. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this film to be complicated, performance, and above all stories.
