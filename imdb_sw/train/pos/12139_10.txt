This movie, though more than 70 years old, is still a very moving, powerful film. Bette Davis, as a slutty, Cockney who cares for Mildred who believes completely. Watching its performance is still spellbinding. He makes the observer despise him at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as a weak, frail Phillip Carey is not strong, but I don't see how any actor can join Ms.'s performance. Davis. He looks for the environment in every place where he lives, stealing theft completely. This is the film that has sealed its title and deserved to win the Academy, but lost. It was surprising for that day what is with the theme of pregnancy without being built, many sexual partners, and the bad language of Mildred so it's somewhat, but it's still the best movie. Just to see the area where Mildred tells Phillip what he really thinks ("You cad, the dead pig ....") is still some of the greatest work I've seen on the film.
