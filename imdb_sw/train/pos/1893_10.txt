Although it is certainly not appropriate for politics to be happy with a drunk, there is such a charm to show Dudley Moore's lovely lovely, Arthur Bach one can not help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. What? You can not be happy with the infectious laughter and giggle and silliness. Although it is not Liza Minnelli's player, he was very good as Linda Marolla and I couldn't see anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. Some of the cast are also the best and the biggest tune "Arthur's Theme", wow. This fact was one of the best plans of the 1980s. The great film gets better by looking at each other and that's the way to "Arthur."
