First of all, I think the comments below are not suitable for a website like this. Certainly you have no taste and respect the taste of others. Not giving you a lesson of history but I think it needs to be done. Black artists out there are the same, if not more, they succeed as others. If you are not part of the "black color" you can not understand the quality, creativity, and vibrant art of the old movies as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High." Since it is unfortunately not black, you are not happy to feel what we feel when we look at these classrooms, so you need to keep your mouth dry and focus on your non-play. Thank you.
