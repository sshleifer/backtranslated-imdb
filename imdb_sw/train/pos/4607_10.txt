My Jackie Chan is going to be a "drunkard teacher" (1978), followed by this film since 1985, "Police Story." In this case, Chan who has a top Hong Kong squad who uses a master's crime and his gang, and was then used to protect the girl's Brigitte Lin to give evidence of the situation. As the story goes, the gangster sends his goons to send Lin, but Chan takes things into his fist and his feet, with a girlfriend Maggie Cheung. As a "drunkard teacher," "Police Story" has many stunts of signatures and more advanced martial arts / action choreography that Chan has become popular with, growing in royal battles in many shopping malls. In his role as director, Chan is increasingly becoming better, giving the charismatic and funny performance that emphasizes action. When the light on the slapstick humor of the general "drunk drunk," with the heart "Police Story" is only, the story of the police, which greatly attracts cops over the coming years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
