There are many ways that are restricted to movies and eating problems are one of them. This film shows how it is. It is not interesting for the audience to enjoy, it is shown in real truth that makes it stronger. I just saw it once and that was a few years ago but I can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is a great help for anyone who is suffering from eating illness to give them the power to stop. This is what the film should be about - should be available to help people and not ignore the wrong things.
