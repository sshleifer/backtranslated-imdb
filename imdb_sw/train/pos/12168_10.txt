"Something for Guy" might not be a classic, but certainly it's beautiful, funny comedy. The plan focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after a bachelor party without reference to Becky (Julia Stiles) lying on his bed. Before we can know what happened, she leaves Becky out of her house because Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that, as you can imagine, chaos continue. <br /> <br /> Nearly every single place in the "Something for Guy" provides great laughter. During the funniest time comes when Paul thinks what can happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a real talented player, and the worst thing about this film is that she is going without using. Although, he returns to be more funny than the character of Stiles, who really is not interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Guy's thing" is not a classic, but not bad either, 7/10.
