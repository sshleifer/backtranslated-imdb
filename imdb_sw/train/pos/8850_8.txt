Sidney Lumet's director gives us one of his most beautiful films in his historic work at this time, and ultimately a horrible story about a family that includes being impossible as one of the children. For a list of A sequences by Philip Seymour Hoffman (the work of Oscar-deserves here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has not taken up just the story of crime stories like Reservoir Dogs, but family stories such as ordinary people . Many viewers can be confused and feel defeated during the Lumet plot building. Instead of showing it through the line, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the main area of ​​theft is not wrong from the different outlooks of the outlook. I found out that this is very satisfying and I often have to think what will happen next. Script is very powerful and excellent performances between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, and between father and child Finney and Hoffman. Both characters are engaged to watch with Lumet is obviously having fun in leading fashion that is not available. To take many steps and stopped to hold the audience for two hours of running, this is an odd movie that does not 'lick for one moment.
