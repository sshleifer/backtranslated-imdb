This is a very small film about the loneliness of one person. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like amalgam of Robert de Niro in Driver Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). She is a wife but they have no clue how to attract different sex - in fact, she never knows! He has to stand up with the destruction of oil that has any hope of achieving any cooperation - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same trouble but at least makes a brave attempt to pass his extended youth (he 28 and admits he never having sex). <br /> <br /> Good shots out of Paris and Rouen, where two people work on business. They try night clubs and different parts but all are not good. My theory is that they are trying bad places - they are going to over-night-or-less 'youth' clubs; they should try a variety that has older people, more than their age. Harel is going to be alone and makes a little effort to Niro, like in Driver Driver, urging his friend / colleague to go and beat some of the bloke who has pulled a very beautiful girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> You should check.
