I did not like the self-defense and honest apocalypse. Perhaps favorite favorite Vietnam battle is Hunter Deer. Hunter Deer focused on one part of the war, and then watched life before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. Script is very free compared to Hunter Deer. The story is not made up to the point that the audience can understand and feel the characters as Deerhunter did. Vietnam restrictions are not like intervention or participation as those in Deerhunter. That's why I can just give this film between 10. <br /> However, I think that acting was good. DeNiro and Harris are very wonderful actors. They were thoroughly trained in their characters and expressed great pain to two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a half-dead drunk, who hides the guilt he has in Bobby to lose his life trying to save. I also like to be thrown. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city cannot handle vets of Vietnam very much. As many small towns, it is about being calm, humble, and considering the business of a person. Harris's character, however, can not be any of these things. It is amazing how war affects people. Some people come back quickly, while others don't.
