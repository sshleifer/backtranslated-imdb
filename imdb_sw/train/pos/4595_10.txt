Jackie Chan's name is a synonomus for the queue. This film did not help you down. The best opening of tracking location and eventually falling under the area is more dangerous than a single one, if you know the meaning of fear. But the big difference that the PROJECT A has three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film completely on his shoulders. What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his side of the respect which he has a contract with the ordinary hero of the modern hero.
