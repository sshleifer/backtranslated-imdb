Well, I will be honest: Not Sholay exactly. But you can't get Sholay every week. In fact, you can see different signatures "without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this film. However, if many "leading" films are going, this was a good solution, well taken and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exceed its hysterics, but all others are proposed. Especially about Dipti Naval: He had seen him after a long time, but he has not lost any of his grace. In fact, he has done a very good job when I saw him last time. One of the most beautiful voices that seem to grow better at age? <br /> <br /> All in all, look good.
