(No destroyers, plot details only) I can't understand such hatred for this period. Want to look at the bad part of Smallville? See Subterranean - now there is a decoration bag. Tom Welling offers good performance (I haven't said so many times), and Michael Rosenbaum is good, but it's a lot of time. The state of the universe looks realistic. Martian Manhunter, who has previously appeared in the "Static", returns and tells Clark that the doctor is the head of insane stock where they are actually a fantom from the phantom area, and if Clark wants to return to the world, he must kill him. A large period of total, with good acting and good speed.
