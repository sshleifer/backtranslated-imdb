Old People Show? I am 15 years old and I have been watching a show since I was 12 years old, enrolling in my Heavenly box + every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I liked they didn't want to cancel, they didn't have the correct deficit. But it's amazing, all these moments, I think I've seen them all, and not one comes to mind that I didn't love you and enjoy. <br /> <br /> It is a disgraceful BBC to keep swapping between Diagnosis Kill and 'Killed Written'- Never did not look at it and didn't want it. Anyways, she characters in Diagnosis Crimes are in depth, and chemistry among actors is amazing. It was a sad day when they finished this show ........
