This film has everything that makes a film worth watching - modern editing, non-promotional, bad dialogue, bad (you might even say absent) to act, unreasonable stories, long-term FAR shots. and it is perfect for the fascinating style of MST3K, not to mention "Body eats drinking water": Scribble on the form ... take a shot - Sign your name ... take a shot - Take a bad Foley edit ... take it many, many shots. The only reason I had no higher than 8 is because they are not sufficiently free and because despite their evil, it's just a hell, a film like this should be at least a minute 20-30 again!
