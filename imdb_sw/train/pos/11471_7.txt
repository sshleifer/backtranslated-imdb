I am a great fan of video veriti and I saw this film because I heard how interesting. I can honestly say that it was very interesting. The two leading actors are amazing, the film is never found, and the concept behind it (though clearly inspired by Columbine's murder and home-based movies) is very interesting. There are some weaknesses, like the last 20 minutes that hinders the truth from the original realities at first or so and the end does not make any sense. The shaky camera can sometimes be a barrier, but in a verit video that has been given. But I still think the movie is well done by the director Ben Coccio deserves a loan.
