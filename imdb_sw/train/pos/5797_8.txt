And I can't say in a bad way. I watched this film on the movie when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins ​​are magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it. Over the years, I saw this film being advertised a few times but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds that would restore the sense of magic and strengthen my heart. And I loved it that way. So I just saw this movie once and I believe it was a good decision to wait again. If I have seen it today, I know I can't help but criticize MJ's work, conspiracy (if there is one) and this and that. For me this is a childhood reference, so my feelings toward the child from the last 20 years. I see my adult man intervenes in my rating and gives 8 memories to the wonderful music. For the little child who looked at the last 20 years though, this is certainly worthy of 10.
