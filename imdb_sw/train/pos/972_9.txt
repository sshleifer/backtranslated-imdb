Wow! Enjoy so much! Probably very little to the American children, and actually it's stretching to make this child film, this movie reminded quite a bit of Time Bandits - very Terry Gilliam the whole way. While an overview is very similar in front, Miike still gives us in the LOT of surreal time and Bunuel-esquire. The first act is steadily declining from the area to the normal life of the child / grand hero, and the spirit world and evil than the next. And when the end has a sufficient element that is typical of Miike's work, the meanings and examples, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge of human folly, is very good. As a manic and fun for fun like other Miike films, just instead of suffering up with a gore, it gives us a huge amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese people organized through creativity through CG and puppetry fitted on a multi-skill adventure. F'n rad, and one of the best Miike!
