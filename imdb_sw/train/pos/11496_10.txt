Love this film too. See when it was first displayed i8n Germany in a small independent movie in Frankfurt. It was so full and it was a very ambitious environment. Movie the movie beat the audience and talk with the producer and director Moritz Boerner was always emphasizing with that. In its genre it was a passionate movie even especially when you think it is a free movie. There are not many copies of the film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or three short movies working on TV too before being a professional type. For people who want to see the film again, you can find it on the home page that is not easy to search but possible.
