I wonder that no one has said that there are two versions of the same film. The part of the image of the picture is all the same, but here's the difference: For one version (the version I have often seen on television broadcasts), a group of pastors protecting the gate includes "Brotherhood Defender", (fictional) a group of priests and brothers they were evicted "by the Church. In another version, which I have seen once on television, the door-keepers are portrayed as priests of the official Church, meaning the New Archdiocese (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the old version, in many important cases, teachers are known as "brothers" (and in some cases, you can see where the lips say "Father" so-and-so but the voice called "Brother" so-and-so. In the second edition, I believe everyone is called "Father". <br /> <br /> In any event, it appears that one of these two versions is lower or lower re-shot of another, and "All Protective Brotherhood" "re-shooting scenes like" Archdiocese "scenes, or vice versa (A kind of recall of Raymond Burr scenes in" Godzilla "). Off versions of television advertising, so no, I do not think of this. more light on the story behind these two films?
