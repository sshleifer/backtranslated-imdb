This great tragic process and a great novel guide to Stephen King shows a great exhibition between Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who sadly died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some of the major consequences of the year. Director Mary Lambert has a good sense of seeing, and will be able to do one of the few works of the King's work that is not only worth seeing, but is not really true. very similar, if what could easily have been a habit of despair caused by damage. For other horrible movies like this or the "Chain Saw of Sail Texas" killings should not be considered in the group.
