This is not Robin Williams, nor is the modern Robin Williams / insanity of recent popularity. This is a mixture of a classic concert, with a mixture of a new love with Robin's exciting. But this is not a thriller, for se. This is a secret / ceremony that Williams tries to find a sick boy and his guardian. <br /> <br /> Also star Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, This Suspense Drama looks very much like a news report, until William character approaches its goals. I must say that I was very happy, though this film fails to teach, guide, inspect, or hate. It felt more like I was looking at a boy (Williams), for he was doing the actions, from a third-party perspective. In other words, I felt real, and I was able to register on the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> For all, it is worth checking, though it is definitely not Friday / Saturday night. <Br /> <br /> Reduces 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
