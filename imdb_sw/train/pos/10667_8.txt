I watched this film after I saw it on Broadway. I love Broadway music and I love the movie. I watched the film if it was not related to the Broadway show. I am a great reader and I have seen what happens to many books when they turn into movies, so I suggested a very early philosophy. Imagine that the film will be made according to the book (or music in this case) but that when the line of the story can be the same it cannot be the same, it will be different so look for what it is / it <br /> I played for 12 years before starting The choice. I was a good player (picking chorus working in domestic production as a child etc.) but I'm not super talented. I was even super talented as a show ride. I was told by my dance teacher and my trainer (whom I spent several months in his field abroad) that I had to make a choice when I turned 14. I needed to move from four to five hours a day a week to 3 hours at a day 7 days a week. and dedicated to one or the other. So I love to play and I love this movie with many ballet movies and dance. I just decided to watch this film why, it's a good movie about the raw feeling and human cooperation. It's about the power of expectation and disappointment when you work hard to get something you want and you just haven't got it. I love the movie. I love Broadway music.
