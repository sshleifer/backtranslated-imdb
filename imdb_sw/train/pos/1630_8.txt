I may be one of the few people who kept on this film. I also saw this film when it came out, and I agreed with the last post The Up Acedemy was the way before its time. Humor in the film itself is a pure magazine of MAD. I don't see why MAD is standing behind this feature. It was also one of the early 80-year films of the killer to follow the sound and punk with the new wave wave that came from L.A. at that time. I own a voice and beat it up to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I don't think Porky being as funny as Up Academy, there's some really good laugh in the film, and joke falls on any exception or getting set. Hey, nobody said this would be Falcon's Maltese.
