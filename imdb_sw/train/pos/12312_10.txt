He cannot believe the movie that could be good in 1987 and unknown west. Not repeating other comments here. Color is very good and it moves. For it means "Dawn please never come" - when it comes to, good spirit and partner will be forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still seem to be good. I enjoyed Joel in the God of Burari Players and many Leslie movies including Good Tomorrow.
