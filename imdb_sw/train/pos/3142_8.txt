What is the most striking thing, this show faces the FOX stage. It's a kind of sitcom that grows to you. If you only see 1, you might not be very interested, but once you look at two or three- you're walking. This is because some jokes hit & others miss according to how you see them. As is the case today, the theme is very mature. Humor is usually mature as well. Often the most beautiful places are the area where mature maturity is associated with the innocent. The red (Kurtwood Smith) the former actress makes a very kind of humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this cast image too. Danny Masterson, former "child" actress is very good too. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better at the original exhibition as a natural redhead (who got the idea of ​​provoking blonde?). He shows very good and frequent talents. He looks good without doing too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best entry to FOX in the department of sitcom & is one step of survival since marriage with children
