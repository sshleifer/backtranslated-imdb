This was the best film. I don't understand why many people don't like it. There was so much to connect with, many beautiful pictures, and many sympathy in things that were not told. I was so excited, and I was left with a sense of joy, as I had finished the story of Tom Robbins. Now I have not read this book of Robbin, so I don't know how this is similar, but I can't think that this film can be very bad translation. The film is too much for you to express yourself, which is the best part of any novel Tom Robbins, dreaming of details. <br /> <br /> And all of you who said this was a very bad movie, I pity what little should be left of light dimming in your hearts. In addition to the worst film this was glorious. Live for a long time to defend.
