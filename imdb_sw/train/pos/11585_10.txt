This film is full of fearful movie traits: fear of chains, pre-meditation, ignorant woman of ignorance (of course female) who has a bad father who wear a mask because of its abolition, fear, spoon palaces, waswolves (male and female), adultery, lovers killed, mystics of Tibetani, half-man / semi-experimental experimental experiments, rob the grave, controlling mind, closed bodies, falling car on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in The weapon - lots, all hit by a very strange mark and some of the worst works of Foley have been made. <br /> <br /> Script is unknown (even with the Spanish film's Horror films) and some editing is just amazing. In one area where the evil woman of a woman visits our heroine in her bedroom for one of the dubbed bad: "That's fantastic, I don't know. Please say how this ..." movie, there is a sudden hand held beside the thighs The girl like she comes out of bed because there is no apparent at all than covering the cut in a bad scientist "Mwahaha! All your werewolfs are mine!" speech. Although it is why they went to harassment I do not know because there is a lot of flying jumping flying anywhere - even allowing pan shape and scan of newspapers noticed. <br /> <br /> The director was, according to one interview with the star, was fed up with many bullets and the film looked like that. It's an odd mess. It has been made even more by inserting pictures of awolf rampage from different film Mark's Man of the Wolf (made 4 years earlier, featuring a similar actor but playing a part with the most brutal and distinctive shirt and makes - IS there a word in Spanish language to "continue"?) and padding over another actor in the wolfman to get-up ambling on a long shot. <br /> <br /> Music is very bad different around random from full full orchestral house music, for bosannova, for a long piano with a gong recording finger. (Thinking about it, it might not be a duo. Perhaps it was a solo. Part of the piano was so easy it would have been taken in one hand when the player lost gong and another.) <Br /> <br /> This is one of the worst conditions of The trance situation attracts the worst movies of the year so far. Enjoy. The love line: "See! This evil and evil will turn against you!" It's true. Dear loved one: Dear, disclosed his beloved girlfriend, throwing a candle in a spectacular show. Put an amateur to direct there.
