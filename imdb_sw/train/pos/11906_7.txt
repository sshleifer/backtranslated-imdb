This document on sandy soils William Castle takes a few cheap shots in the 50-60-naive environment that made his characteristic work - see strange, ignorant people with ghost glasses - but also interesting and interesting, with clarity from John Waters, who was the most attentive to such things at the time, and from the daughter of Castle, who loved his father and is also a good view of how he did his job. (We do not know what happened to another generation of Fortress.) The movies were not very good, they made it clear, but its sale was brilliant, and seemed to be a good, hard work. Happy people continue to grow, like Diane Baker, who looks good, and Anne Helm, who was changed because of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman all but evaporates in giggles on the fun of working with Castle on "Tingler," and there is enough footage to give us the idea of ​​the standard of the Castle of the Castle - not too high, but very powerful. Look at the best time when the audience was very excited, and it makes you a nostalgic for the most simple days developing.
