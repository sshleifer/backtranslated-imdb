It enjoyed a wonderful film about 1945 about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is unemployed and has fallen behind her tax and has a desire to get a job. Julia reads the newsletter in London's local newspaper looking for a secretary and running out to try and get this chance. Julia gets a chance and is employed by Mrs Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who needs to be living with her employer at home and wants her to have no partners with her boyfriends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote all her time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and she has a fantastic passion for playing with knives. This was a small budget film and many photos were nearby to avoid the cost of history and environmental costs. This wonderful family all live in a large house from the Cornwall Coast of England and there are hidden doors and insist on a lot.
