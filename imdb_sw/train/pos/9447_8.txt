Playing a game of four men at the weekend of the lease under a distant river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Bobby (Ned Beatty) ignorant and good man Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are good - there is a wonderful series of banjos, an impressive entry between characters and only the most amazing movies of Vilmos Zsigmond. Then the two hills are attacking Ed and Bobby. One of them gets Bobby ... and the journey becomes hard. It is just unreliable. Good conditions are very good but this terrible violence is happening. To be true, Beatty's rape has never bothered me - I know very well that it is faked despite good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change - Ed is trying to be tested, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is broken and one of the people he mocked earlier and Drew is trying to take care of himself. Trends with John Boorman is also very sure and the sounds of the forest and the river helps the very mood. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Well the same in the lead - has been the best. Beatty is also the same - but it's his first film and he has guts to take that risky position. Cox is very good when things start to fall. And Reynolds is quite good - one of its best works. This has never been appointed for the Academy Academy award. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are also believed as a hill. It is a powerful film - not for children. Try to see an unfamiliar version - the television version is damaged. Also checking the mail-box is necessary to capture breathing images.
