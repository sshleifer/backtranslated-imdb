wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? It was certainly my year - and - my life. As the raptor graphics were not surprising, the award winners continued to use the same picture on the entire film, even when history did not match the environment. Wow, what confidence. And when the movie is full of holes (for example, the parts of the Rex species where the raptor should have one important moment where the Pappy finds the room of suffering, screams “Colin girl!” And runs) I never forget the beauty that is Raptor Planet . Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.
