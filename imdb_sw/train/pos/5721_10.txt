I do not know where all people who are involved in hate are talking about here, perhaps that some people like to deal with things. In fact, the film was not ordinary, and it may have trouble with time change, all actors who want to go where I would not go, etc. but IMHO there were other things that were more than a failure. First, I liked 'breaking the rules' a bit. YOU do not use when you leave the house of anger, the baddies leave you alone, give you time to connect, find friends, and find a wonderful kind of wonderful sign. MODA (semi-spoiler precautions) when you hide under the holes can only get you through this small opening opening. INFORMATION at the end some ghosts have been a little less because you have discovered they are not aware, or have been released, or nothing. Second, production was unique. When movies did not have special effects on carrying common bits while short were well established. It is probably not the best type of film for those who think Freddy and Jason are the last type of fear (nothing against 'em, they have their chance), but it is better for those who have started taking contracts space and who do not have trouble with time disruption.
