I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I have always enjoyed it. Certainly graphics are a little cheesy, compared to now, but back in 70 was great. I saw it in the original Spanish version and I thought it was strange. That's how I remembered my Christmas family - magical. Santa Claus was surprising and I couldn't wait to return every year. If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, give them a look at this old version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version than we used for today, but who says there is one way? It is a fun movie to watch. It teaches good and bad children. I don't know how the English version is emerging or if there is one English, but Spanish is much better. Enjoy and Happy Holiday! Feliz Navidad!
