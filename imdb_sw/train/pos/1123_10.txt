Girls agree to meet boys in Florida happily, but have problems with car and never do. One of the girls decides to go to the nearest gas station for help, the other three sit with the car. Soon one of the girls should use the bathroom, in the middle of any place there is no choice but to go to the forest. Recently she testifies if someone (March) hits a woman, for fear the girl runs the area, does not care too far, but can lose. His friends on the car are going to look for him, they also go into the forest and run to one person, one of them sees a dead woman, the man responds by hitting the head of the head, another girl runs, can return to the car where he also killed. Finally, the remaining two girls get and because they enter the gas station to be arrested.

They are treated badly by one of them being left alone to kill him in the cell, the remaining friend can escape, but not without getting a dangerous situation. This game has creative, beautiful artists, a shower area that plays Psycho, sexual abuse towards women and a strong story. Some women may feel that people who are uncomfortable and worried will not like the last, but above all, this is a small unknown movie.
