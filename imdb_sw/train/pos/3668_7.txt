I recently saw this film and I enjoyed it very much. gives insight into making indie movies and what works are important when you have a low budget still requires the name of an actor / actor to find people, any people come and see and give an exposure film. Bobby Myeres played with Modine and his girlfriend Saul - Paul Linder combines the best mix of Miachel Bates, the "NAME" group played by Alan Bates was the perfect film and movie decision. My favorite member was Sandy Ryan played with Debra Kara Unger very good and less active with her special performance again in the movie inside the movie. If you like to enjoy the time of looking at the comedy then this is for you. The low budget meets the low budget and the top content of the laugh.
