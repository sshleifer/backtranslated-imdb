A sense of time is a trap of the devil with an unintelligent mind. They are happy to think in 'what if?' kind of way. The filmmakers and journalists have been dealing with the frequent army and television as well as 'Star Trek: First Contact', trilogy 'Back to the Future', 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Day Groundhog' and Stargate Features SG1, 'Opportunity window'. All Heinlein's Zombi were written a few decades ago and still will lead people to read a short story for the first time. Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys', is difficult to set up what might be the problems of continuing the plot of the plot to make us think again of our film. Regular displays will send us to different conclusions if we remain open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, see the film for the first time, will see Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as schizophrenic. Many will see Cole as a victim of what Adams describes as 'visiting to experience' regularly visiting. Unlike travel stories sometimes, '12 dogs' are unknown if future history can be changed by running events in the past. Cole tells her psychologist, Railway (Madeleine Stowe), at that time can not be changed, but the mobile phone she makes from the airport is taken by scientists after the restoration in 1996, in its own line of time. <Br /> <br /> Even this can be called an event that was required in one world-time line, to ensure that the time line does not change ... Cole must die before the eyes of her young self to appreciate. If so, when it looks like water, it always gets its way or its way, regardless of the working power. It reminds the thought of staying on this kind of thing very much. If you can change future events that will guide the actions of those who are able to send people on time, as we see on the plane on the end of the film, then that means the future can be changed by running past events. .. or do you? The movie has probably led to a mass of addictive drugs in pubs made by physicians and mathematicians.
