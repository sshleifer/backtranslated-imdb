This movie is very good. It is true and quite low, but at the same time it's all things. The characters are easy to love and, because they have a lot of intelligence, but each of us can mention at least on. In Canada, we do not have many movies from Eastern Europe, and for a few I have seen, Loners are one of the best. It's very funny, and magic. If you want to see something new and restore, go see Loners.
