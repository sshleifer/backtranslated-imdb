"The King of the Lion" of course doubt my movie of Disney at all, so I thought maybe I should have the opportunity and I did. The king of the Lion 1 1/2 was good and had a laugh and enjoy with Timon and Pumba. The only problem, I see sometimes there is no information required because it can create holes of conspiracy and just a sense of wanting your own information. Well, I would like to strongly recommend this film to the fans of the King's lion or the night only with the family. It is a flick of fun and laughter like the first characters like the first. Therefore, hope, I will get equal to the third phase in the Lion King series. Sit back and just think No Matata! It means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
