Currently on the new METOO schedule at 4 pm week, after "Maverick" and right before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). I don't know if I ever actually saw his part when you started, but I'm very interested in that. Error, odd, surreal stories set in the West of the story. The kind of "City of Naked" Western. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (like Mexican honest), little Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (like Mexican color paint), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("World War"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a Monster from Outdoor websites") br /> <br /> Run for SEASONS NI , more than 200 episodes, from January 1959, to December, 1965. good between difficulty and clear distribution. I would vote for the President any day. (PS had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) And Clint Eastwood is very attractive as his right hand of inspiration, "Rowdy" Yates. Also, the former Western actor and the country's music figure (ever "Eyes-eyed, One-horned, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley is there as a well-organized Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the cantankerous character of the cook can apply as "Wishbone". Then there is a great theme of the theme, done by Frankie Laine that is immortal. (Between it and the "Maverick" theme, I have Western landscapes running my head every day.) \ T I collect the whole set. The best time (not a local experience) is always guaranteed, as the person standing to see if the boys will have their problems are directed before the business. Rollin ', rollin', rollin ', rollin', rollin '
