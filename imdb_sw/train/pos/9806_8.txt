I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and I loved Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was good to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector for change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he has been. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 times. I loved William Armstrong as an interesting Hudson friend in a series. When they gave this show in New York City, it was always late at night or time. The show is less than an hour long. I felt that this show would have gone for a long time but the change of throw in the second season actually did not show much. I don't care Sylvia but I lost the actor, Julia Phillips-Lane in the last season. I felt that this show got a chance and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American actors were not proud or tried to overcome their British counterparts. I also loved the fact that they tried to adopt international cast instead of making them all of Britain. I liked watching Julia Ormond in the early role. I felt that this show would have continued long. I felt sometimes that the review continued as long as the show in less than an hour. They could transfer the cast to New York City and would hit in America.
