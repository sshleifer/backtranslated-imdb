I had the opportunity to watch "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who has been prostituted with her own family and lives in a royal home in Cambodia. Patrick (American) comes into Holly's life and decides to help him. When Holly is sold again, Patrick tries to look for him. We follow you a hard journey through Cambodia with the hope of reunification. Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and used every day. Movie shows this difficult issue without crossing the line. I went to find out more about the issue of child trafficking and ask how I can help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a good story and shows the issue that we should never ignore again.
