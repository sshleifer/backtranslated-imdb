Like the TV show. It had the first restrictions I saw. I wish I was there to do with them. It touches the truth when you love someone and you think you want to spend your whole life and, then on the events that you meet someone else and that person is more than you want to have. You are in a situation you had to choose one or the other. Someone will hurt you, no stop that. Making a decision is difficult but you want to continue to be happy when you were. Why do you continue to live a life that you have thought you want or think you are doing the same thing that you all have fun. That someone will not wait for waiting time, they have a good life. Making the decision you want will be better. Doing the best of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc ... did not make you happy, have one person that you want to be with and share with.
