Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are human beings of this movie about a young man who receives answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow all return to the first level performances in their roles; Mrs Phillips has a less attractive job of trying to create a film made for TV (twenty-five years ago), by distributing "sex interest" in a non-sex film. The real star, however, is "California Kid"; The Ford of 1934, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, put it in front of the camera and given the performance that will leave the viewer of the photography, moving and focusing on the seat seat. The events are amazing, (although some conversation is a little blind) and make a good evening performances. This is how all "car movies" should be made. Try to use this in a delayed movie center; it is good to sleep.
