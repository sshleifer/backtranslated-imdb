These types of movies about young people struggling with their sexes were unique and durable and last few years ago but more and more movies like this took place over the last few years, making it difficult for movies to continue to stand true a little, away from the usual film festivals that showed this small French film, with a great celebration that always enjoys these kind of small movies about daily lessons. not often available on the film. A preview in Cannes in 2007 and actually received other awards as well. It is not quite good for others, as it actually includes new times once you've seen other similar movies like this but this doesn't really mean "Naissance des pieuvres" is bad to watch. Movie is certainly looking good, which covers its subject well and spells its story faster and therefore also efficiently, at the speed of a small amount of French cinema movies. It comes to the old movie, which focus on the life of the 3 middle-aged youth. Sexuality is a great theme within the film, which is considered well and subtle. It makes the movie and its story in general be realistic, though perhaps it is a bit of predictable, since the film does not give anything quite natural in its genre. <br /> <br /> This kind of French movie will be awesome to stop many people because of the reason they probably expect to be very arty, with deep layers and its meaning. "Naissance des pieuvres" however is a very accessible movie for everyone and really should not be in the movie of the Euro teenager to understand this film. It is a kind of sweet and secular world, because of its way and perspective. <br /> <br /> The movie is also being done by its executives, who did not have much knowledge within the film business but are looking for a real sense in their roles. Powerful characters provide a film with beautiful landscapes and a good time. <br /> <br /> Good movie on his subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
