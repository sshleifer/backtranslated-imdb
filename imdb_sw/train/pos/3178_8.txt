The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones encourages the viewer on a journey of redemption as the main character takes control of the wheel and puts his life in order. Adam Jones has found a way of thinking and restoring his behavior and promoting the most important things. These facts are clearly visible to the participants and viewers when you laugh and give them credit. Simple and interesting layouts enable you to reflect on what you will see next. You can't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this film. I can't wait for his sophomore efforts. It's a matter of time before Jones attack again. Bravo!
