I was also very surprised to see how few people voted on this film, and only HAWA write something about it, although my comments are similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I love many things about film. Good work between Mastroianni & Loren. The film has been narrated: Humanity and love continue to develop between the two outside, and varying the continuous speed of the fascist radio demonstration (which becomes a colleague of the Mastroianni part) and the supporters "go and come from the show". For me this is a very good film about what is being human. Perhaps some of you would say that the "message" to fight "fascist" is explicitly given, but for me this did not destroy the film in any way. Voting is 10/10.
