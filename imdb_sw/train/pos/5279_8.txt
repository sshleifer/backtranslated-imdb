I can't repeat all that you have already said with other viewers of this film. In my opinion this is the best film, not only as a human story of the ongoing relationship between the father and his whole son, but also as a little window on the world of Islam, for those like me who do not know much that religion. The most important thing of this story is that of the boy's relationship with the beliefs and practices of his father, and how his attitude toward religion seems to change in subtle ways as we continue their journey with them. This is a very exciting, enjoyable and well-made film that I would like to recommend to anyone with brain and heart.
