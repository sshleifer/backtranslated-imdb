This movie has a beautiful style, amazing pictures and sex scenes of fire and beautiful woman. Fails at the end as the story continues to get very strong. But all in all, I would recommend this movie because it has a good old Russian feel .. great, amazing, powerful, harsh and brutal and at the same time beautiful in culture The old beauty of awesome. PLOT: A boy who can make a shot of blade out of his hand to love (not a spoiler since they showed on the trailer) when it's really mad to you trying to have a girl. Knows that after killing one person with your sword, it's a hard kind to keep a strong relationship .... <br /> <br /> The boy's sword stands on the planet because he just doesn't know what it is. YET. <br /> <br /> Much of the dark fight street and guys unexpectedly get filtered for creativity. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. slick value watch.
