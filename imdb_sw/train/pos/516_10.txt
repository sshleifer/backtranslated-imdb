One of the best films of all time. The transition from Black to white and to Heaven's Heaven and Earth Procedures was the best quality quality <br /> <br /> Plot is very clever, the perfect film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions, and with that film war. does not discriminate. I must have seen this film more than any other, and I've never burned it. It is a film that makes you question your own deaths and beliefs about what happens after our death.
