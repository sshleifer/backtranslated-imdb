Coming from one director who has done "Candyman" and "Dear Boyfriend", I am not surprised by a good film. Surprisingly, "Papierhaus" is a movie I have never heard of so far, but it must be one of the best movies over the last 80 years - because for that reason it is under the worst film period in recent decades. (Not talking about Islamic or Swedish cinema here ...) Acting is not brilliant, but it is solid - unlike what other people here claim (they should have loved "amazing work", such as Anna). Myths are fantastic interesting which does not end through a maneuver that connects all loose goes together correctly. These unanswered questions will probably be left there for a purpose, and leave them to personal interpretation, and nothing wrong with that for this theme. "Pepperhaus" is a common combination of children's films and fears, and good use of voice and music. I love the fact that the middle behavior is not your typical-film-clich√© girl-shy-secret-secret-social, but ordinary, normal child; so much comfort. I am sick and exhausted by the authors who make their children like babies in their books and on the screen, if anyone cares again to look at or read about another unresponsive youth, if it's all like that kind of The character has a monopoly with good potential. The place where Anna and the young man was "blowing" (quite straightening) was very little - showing the impression of dirt and amusement - without considering that he was only 11 years old, but predicted that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was hit. I don't know why they didn't improve the behavior of a character or get a little actress. It was quite clear that Burke is not limited. Why do directors always give older children more than they play, so it increases the authenticity, I don't know.
