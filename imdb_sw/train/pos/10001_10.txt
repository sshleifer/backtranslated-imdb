Brilliant on the act of Lesley Ann Warren. Best lady hobo great I saw, and love scenes in the warehouse of clothes is second to none. Grass on the face is classic, beautiful as anything in Blazing Saddles. Taking for lawyers is also very good. After being charged as a young man, selling his master, and being a loyal lawyer of Pepto Bolt pressure without exception "I am a lawyer" he says. Three words of funny. Jeffrey Tambor, a loved one from the future of Larry Sanders, is amazing here too as a mad victim who wants to crush the ghetto. Her character is worse than usual. The area of ​​the hospital, and the homeless area invades the demolition site, are always gifts. Look at the area of ​​the feet and two big diggers to fight (one blood). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is very often).
