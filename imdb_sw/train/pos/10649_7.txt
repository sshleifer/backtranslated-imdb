What can I say about it? It is another Hollywood flick of the fear and the highest budget (80 million dollars). It is not quite scary, it just gives us a few publications and one true chain and bones on fire. Jones is as good as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actor. The design of Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, idols, furniture ... Delicious! However I do not like to end because it was luscious.Check this out and form your comments on it. Give me this 7 picture out of 10.
