The French edition of Robert Altman's Cuts Short, placed in the small town of Äänekoski. The events show the history of eternity, problems and feelings of human life: joy and love, deception and deficiency, lack of desire and death. I was particularly impressed by two events. The first is the story of the little hostess, who tries to stimulate the love of the workers with her: gives great pleasure to love and life. Another part provides an old man who dies at the hospital and his wife trying to help him to die in honor. Particularly surprising is the way the old couple should fight their ways against the shameless practices of hospitals and their loneliness separately from the "routines" of hospital staff (despite regular signals). Compared with the classic of the Altman, this film is probably a little professional, but it is definitely a piece of art.
