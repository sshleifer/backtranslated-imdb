I watched this film with joy of shire. This is probably one of the best-time films. It has a timeless value of time, you can get a lot from them is amazing. There are moving places, surprisingly, and just beautiful. All of the feature is spot, the storytelling is perfect, every detail is 100% true, even the Irish sub-trick. <br /> <br /> Use of low and top shots offers two views on Cristy (see that). Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is amazing. I've never seen an actor doing that, forever. It's quite amazing. It is very good to watch, flowing very well, it's probably the closest thing that can get real life experience. I love it. If you haven't seen, you should see it. Don't worry about him, there is something there for all.
