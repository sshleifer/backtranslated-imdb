Imagine that it has been greatly reduced by the bureaucracy that one person uses 8 years of his life, and has a mental breakdown trying to solve the genocide case near himself! The murder method is clear, but the government does not want to accept the truth then let the monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think my job is disturbing, I just remember the true story behind this wonderful flick. Commitment to the role of the main character was the skill shown by Rea. The comic love (and often often) between Rea and Sutherland's behavior made this one of my favorite movies 5 years ago. Infection of one of the most murderers in history I had along my seat. When it is not so close to the announcement as "The Lamb's Tranquility", the plot was like a celebration. Use or buy this movie today!
