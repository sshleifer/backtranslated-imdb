If John Thaw has never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or mentioned in "The Sweeney" and another production, he would be remembered for this amazing performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". It is greatly assisted with good performance like its co-starring (Nick Nick Robinson in its first role), and casting an unobtrusive, this beautiful novelity of Michelle Magorian's novel is a fitting reference to art her. <br /> <br /> When I read this story of the widow of the old Norfolk widow to have served a little boy from London before and during the Blitz, I have seen a clear error during the line in it, and credit should go to the creators of the film this by adjusting this error. They should also be grateful for not being more interesting to the story, and to prevent what could turn, easily, into the mushy mess. If you hold a CD or video library then you feel good. Released for TV movies must be completely incorporated.
