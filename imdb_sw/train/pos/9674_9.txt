I did not give this film the full color to be faithful in comparison with the famous artists like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai." However, this film is quite amazing, it is a real embarrassment of the mark for the deputy head of IMD. However, the IMD voter depends on geeky, and "Paulie" does not deserve it. The only obstacle that may suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not show a perfect human being. Sorry, but to ask a 6-year-old child to go out to Dustin Hoffman as a rainy begging that is impossible in making movies. Moving to these minor complaints, the film has the best film: the road to the buddy road, con-games, the hero as a friendly-animal party (a bird party?), Disney humor to young and old , etc.. Tony Shaloub is wearing his role as a pair of good jeans. That's normal for him, it seems. ("I am a Russian ... I like a long story.) I don't like mango, but almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Look at the movie and that will be meaningful. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin makes the most appropriate exhibitions in the film. however it works well, put the parrot and fight with the parrot together as a team and creates its own magic. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to get a film for you and children who have no insults or anger for either, "Paulie" It is a perfect candidate, however, I agree that when you enjoy my "Paulie" color, he was on a road trip during a great heat wave.For the weather the car died, half of the restaurants were cold (like our hotel ) and nikas stand, "let's look at the movie where it works on air-cond to apply. "So we did. So for about 100 minutes we were discovered, we were in trouble, and we got a warm experience. When I saw him recently in VCR under emotional circumstances, I realized how this movie was made well." insomnia will not regret looking.
