I saw this first film on Friday (1/19) at night in Park City for Sundance and moved very much. Sitting at the theater and hearing the first hand of the pain they were walking was closer than I could carry. Some in the audience were moved the same as when we wanted to turn, a few we could do was witness as these men and women shared their experiences with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze, and Herold Noel, all warriors in Iraq and were shown in the film, were there. While they may be at home now, you can say this battle is still in them and maybe it will always be. If you help the war or not, it is our responsibility to support the soldiers and anything else than the bumper sticker. Watch this film!
