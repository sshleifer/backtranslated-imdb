This takes about a year after events in "Primary Foundation". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. When you have sex with a soccer player as you get on the car you are going 110 kilometers / hour (don't ask) he gets off the road and ends up on Thames. He lives - does not. Police employs psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he is able to see the case. Usually he starts playing with his mind rather than killing many and following sex. <br /> <br /> This movie was punished before even opened. It took forever to be healed by the director, the script problems were common and cast was unhappy (Morrissey complained about the film often). It is not too bad. It is as much as the first - there are lush brands, beautiful places, many sex and dirt (this should have been edited for R), a trustworthy and good plot - but no effect. It feels like returning to the first. People are killed here with a leash of choker (I believe) ... as well as people were killed by ice take in first. In one minute beautiful Stone takes a pick of ice and looks at it eagerly. He also plays mind games with man and can get him involved in murder. The comparison is very clear. <br /> <br /> This is also of great value - there is a lot of open sex, the male shortage (Morrissey looks more nude than Michael Douglas), female fraud (stone still seems to be good) and some murder of blood. Acting is good at the board. The stone is just wonderful here; Morrissey looks sad but it's okay; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good in supporting tasks. So - this is not so bad but it feels like a first remake. I still recommend it. The only people attacked this because the stone did not like well and thought it was stupid to make sequel and "Primary ..." 14 years after it was made.
