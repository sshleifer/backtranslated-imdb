"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is a sure document on the life of someone who brought us movies such as "Glen or Glenda", "Mrs. Monster", and of course, "Program 9 from Outdoor". This movie more beautiful than where other documents, like "Look back at Angora" and "9 Companion Program", has failed. It surrounds its quantity, many of which have died since publishing the picture, and provides an honest investigation of Ed Wood and its work. Nostalgic to the fact that it looked back in the black corner of the old Hollywood, feeling in its treatment director (under the haunting music), this document must be quite-see for anyone who loves the director who failed in his day. Two hours a series of films with love to return to pieces with the life of Ed and sudden death of the viewer. Better at 3 o'clock in the morning when you wear a sweater of angora.
