I compete that anyone who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer of this movie is completely closed. Nobody knows I wanted to see this film according to the review, and everyone who saw it (I know) liked itâ€¦ The advertising campaign is a disgrace / disaster. It was opened at # 4 back ... <br /> <br /> # Hour-Rush, which I haven't seen, an average IMDb of 7.4. # 2-Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen an amazing film but the third week out, the average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserves me to say) The Simpsons, which I have seen, the film session but the fourth week, the average IMD score of 8.1 (slightly above in my opinion). The # 4-Stardust, the average IMDb score 8.4 (less then Bourn, but that's been our week 3) <br /> <br> If it's a poor publication or bad advertising I think that power behind this movie has increased for a long time! This should advertise as an amazing film that happens to be fantasy / fairytale and is not advertised as just another fairytale? Such a bad :( Anyways- Now that I highly pointlessly ranted on-by-on ... The amazing movie, going to see!
