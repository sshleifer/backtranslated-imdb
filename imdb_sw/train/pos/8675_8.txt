Without being one of my favorites, this is good for that change speed ... even if for a few minutes. It all starts with a great war between Tom, Jerry and Spike (called "Butch" here). They all beat each other, but suddenly the Shepherd makes the decision of the hero and good: he stops fighting and shows that all should be friends. Therefore, all sign a peace agreement and become friends ... who will not continue for long. At the same time, three are lovers, patient and kind to each other. They survive one of them at risk of life. The relationship does not go anything but better, until the very big steak looks and all become greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggle and competitions. But still ... see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends are a pleasant experience and thanks, even if for just a moment. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, as a curious reality, two songs from the "Wizard of Oz" are played here for the versions of the instruments: "We're away to see the witch" and "Somewhere on the rainbow".
