Putting all political ideas aside, Feroz Khan and 'Gandhi' of Anil Kapoor, My Father 'is a good movie that carefully examines the part of the troubled family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and fighting for his eldest son Harilal Gandhi and his family, father more than life, and most importantly demon in his head. One makes a comparison to Gandhi the father of the nation and strives for any child who can have a father / father / father. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna-strictly in the same process - add color and pathos to this heartwarming story of Harilal who cries just once and also runs with a very touching finger. Feroz Khan's leadership and the canvas production is attractive and interesting, however, the screenplay would have decreased. I had played several years ago on a video of a pirate video (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and actually it was actually inserted. Although, the background color of the movie and the time of the father and mother of the mother is only a brilliant treat. <br /> <br /> This movie can be beautiful. It's until that. It is very likely to be just a different story between a father and a child or just Gandhi or even two. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect a full epitome of feeling, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> Compare to Gandhi other well. Certainly not a general film like Gandhi of Kingsley, or abstract as Hey Ram Kamal Hassan. The film can get its place; however, one is left asking "what if ..." The value of looking. 7.5 / 10
