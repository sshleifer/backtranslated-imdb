Lupine puts off to Morocco, looking for a treasure story. His only impression is an interesting jewel in which the old man gave him. It is a distinctive area for Lupine, and desert and feel the heat of the foreign. One interesting thing about this film is that Jigen has a smaller role than usual, generally being a different place than Lupine. On the one hand their classic power together has been lost, but it changes dramatically. Plus, in this way, Lupine can focus on women ... <br /> <br /> The dominance dominates in this. In the whole aspect stimulates Lupine, and we viewers. Then there is Lara, the girl of this story, and she loves it very much. This has more than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun to have it. There is a good man who enjoys the best in this, and usually has a great battle with Goemon, with some fun scenes with Fujiko. The Zenigata expert of course is also on warpath here, for good form. Very good, this is a smooth journey with Lupine. The program is moderate and there are some slow ads, but all in this movie is all real fun. Enjoy.
