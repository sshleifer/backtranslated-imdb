This is one of those movies that are difficult to go through without giving away the plot. It is worth saying there are good things and unexpected prospects continue, more than the "Tom Cruise around and many women 's plot" as a very irritating playboy who has all - and then loses all, Diaz as an interesting but limited jilted partner, Cruz as a wonderful new girl in the area with Russell as a father of the father. The story involves romance, ethics, murder, mystery, and sci-fi and is generally a recreational journey. I need to add that the image is also the best uniform and the inclusion of different visual models is good once you know what is going on. If you like to enjoy a well-prepared film and wait, and are willing to accept Philip K Dick's resolution, then this is a must-see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
