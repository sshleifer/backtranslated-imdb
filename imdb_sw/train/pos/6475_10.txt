It is only 2 sessions in 5 game, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. That's on TV, cash screens or even in real life. As the author, it is very good to lose! If the viewer is so entertaining that I'm angry events are more than two weeks instead of Monday to Friday. It is known that all these criteria are best. I am a modern boy who turned away from a television show. In comparison with movies, television dramas were always seen to be written, completely, and well, generally mad! "Five days" has led to a television game in the 21st century, so for me at least, it's intelligent to convert. Go look.
