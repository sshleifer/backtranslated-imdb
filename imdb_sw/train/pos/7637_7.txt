I really loved this movie though I am not very thought James Belushi. In this film, you can see many names of growing, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox ie; Caine ready was very large. The program in this movie is simple; it's just like that movie Sliding Door. Yet he was told in a heart-to-hearted manner. It made me try to isolate my important time in life, for example if I took the girl for the film, and not another etc.. It tells us that people around us could take on different roles in our lives as some minutes of minutes changed. It also reminds us to be careful what we want. Life is not good on the other hand as we think; perhaps, what we have now is better for us, all things are considered.
