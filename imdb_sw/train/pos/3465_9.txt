I am looking at this film for horror and hopeless hope. I didn't think it would be possible for this film to live according to the issue. But quite made, and then some. First, we must say that Jared Harris did a wonderful job like John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was running Lennon. Effectively was not magic, and he learned through Lennon how to be beaten. Aiden Quinn was very good as McCartney, also having a remarkable resemblance to Macca, though he made a regular trip on his wife's inspiration. <br /> <br /> This false work was well written and well-directed. It was a pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur looking through a keyhole in this reunion. The roof area was particularly moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that he was worthy and important, and it could not be his fault that he was left by his parents. I also enjoyed the area in the garden where two of them played for quite a defeat at the reggae port! My single complaint would be this: I am not sure that John was like a caustic if he was shown in the film at this point in his life. He had lived in his inner condition very well, and he was known to be very friendly when he was approached by fans. Just a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first attacked by his killer for the day's autograph. More than this film ever stirred these feelings again on what might have had John had lived a little bit. I'm sure Beatles would come together at some point. And I'm sure that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Vema, VH1. I'll watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
