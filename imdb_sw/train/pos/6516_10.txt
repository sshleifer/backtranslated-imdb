hello. I watched this film earlier today for 14 times in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has so many ways with my hands. I need life. I have seen an incredible film to break back the mountain. I also saw that I looked like Lafitte's jean if she was white. Also, my favorite line in the entire movie was from Mr. Petey - "this baby can hit the chipmunk eye from 300 yards!" oh, and my very favorite movie in the movie is when the British were coming in, and one player who was very devoted to his work, and he beat hard until he died, as if that dance had ended the war .... but it could not. well, that's all I would like to say about this movie. OH, something more than..bonnie brown is insane of the world bipolar mood swinging BEEYOTCH. It's just that.
