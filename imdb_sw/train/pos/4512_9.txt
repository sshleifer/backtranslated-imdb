I saw this film today and I must say, it was much better than I expected it to be several hours before going to see it. Of course I was discriminated against his language, but it completely changed my mind. The movie was in many beautiful beautiful landscapes and great actress and actress performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. This touched me very much like a film, which depends on a true story, believe it. A new school, a great psychological leader and a young boy who is known by a new teacher, a little different than others and about fighting things even if it doesn't seem to work. It showed how small things can make big changes in a lot of things, and how different times can cause a difficult situation. I also think the actor's choice has been successful. It felt like you were someone looking at events like a visitor when it happened. Before destroying this film and features, I need to admit that there are things and situations that you did not see and feel true ... such as where the head of school beat Frits. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He was severely beaten, but the only thing that caused him, had some blood coming out of the nose as compared to the first beat, when Frits had a neck. I think every movie has its own mistakes. from the shop, it's an uncertain thing, that I take it with me.
