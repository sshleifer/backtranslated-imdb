After seeing 'Break the Leg' in Vancouver on the release party I thought it was a very enjoyable film. I had a little laugh with the stomach and some watos (Eric Roberts especially) were shouting. I've never heard a word about the exact date of release although I've heard it close. Story is simple but it is especially a car for characters and situations. The script is smooth and seamless, the plot grows hard and acting is comfortable yet fresh. This film has won only one award from all kinds of films that have been inside, which are around 10 - 15 or more. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'Break Leg'.
