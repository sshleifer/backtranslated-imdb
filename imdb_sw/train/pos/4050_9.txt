Anyone who gets this terrible film is the head of an unconscious bone who should be connected to the vehicle to track movies and romantic comedies. This film is riveting and does not have boring time. Why? Because it covers a lot of intellectual dialogue between real people in times of crisis and details of their efforts to survive the crisis. I repeat - an intelligent conversation! That's what shows almost all Rohmer films, and that's why many people don't like them. They like action. Good, let them spend all their lives looking at practical movies, while those with taste and discrimination will continue to search for this film. Rohmer has been judged to be "speaking." Well, he is, but I am complimentary, not criticized. Shakespeare was speaking, too. Is there a play of talkier than "Hamlet?" Each matter, or theme, of art works has thoughts and conflicts on ethics, must necessarily be a discussion of these ideas and values, which are largely this film refers to. Aristocracy and birth of honor vs equity; loyalty to old friends who are put to the final test when that friend takes what we believe is a bad way; the value of human life and the responsibility of saving this life, even if the person who has this life is not very good, or even despised. (Anyone who hears Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and penalty?") This is what the film says. The two leading in this film are amazing, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as his second language, is particularly brilliant. Make yourself a permit and see this riveting film. It may be the last movie with this Screen Master.
