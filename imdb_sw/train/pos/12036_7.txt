Why am I sure there is really another version of the novel film out there somewhere? I saw the film again this year if I am teaching a novel and getting a change in a bitter film - no little boy's appearance in the novel and the end has been changed. They kill him in the film but the whole point is that he is struck by events in Eel Marsh House for many years but he rejects and finally puts events behind him. Mr. Bentley is the most compassionate attitude in the novel, the film area where Kipps puts fire to the office is clearly daft, and the regular appearance of the toy soldiers grow the presence of the child is really creepy but it does not mean - Kipps is haunted by the retaliant woman, not a child. I am sure I have seen a film that is better and closer to the novel and really bad. What? Just checked?
