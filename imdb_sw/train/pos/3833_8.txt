I can't believe others considered a great perspective on all of this. God, it was a happy Cassidy root of Hop-long. It was a great tax for Western experiments of previous years. It didn't mean to have a great movie experience, unless it was. Why if it had a huge impact on bonanza. It was fun, language in the cheek, look back to the West. Man, relax and enjoy.
