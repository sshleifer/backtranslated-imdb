Open the film with Bach Toccata is a sense of aural of what's going on in this bright game. All aspects of the system Bach made it to keep its listener (and executive) fascinated and accepted for this film. There is no common sympathy among the two leading leaders and the woman who led the last place I think is right to say that she was raped even when her punishment seems to have understood that she was cad. Mamet examines the emotional investigation and differences between men but I feel that he does not know about how they congratulate others because of humor. If Mamet has ever made fun of the partnership between girls I am wondering how this work would have ended? As it is is very heavy and means spirited.
