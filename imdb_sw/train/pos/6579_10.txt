Do you explore the best version of Quo Vadis screen? made. Yes, the plot is not strong and it looks like this book, sometimes screaming and losing its discomfort among the tricks of beauty. But the film is realistic and beautiful "amazing", has a bid and style, that other versions - and R.Taylor and new from Poland - definitely lack. It has the air of Roman destruction, the beauty of the pagan decline and infant Christianity. At least I believe it has). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did their best to show their behavior. The Forrest Petronius seems to be the most successful cast (then alone Brandauer who is one of the most executives ever) and accumulates the essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's right. That's what happened, boys ...)) IMHO
