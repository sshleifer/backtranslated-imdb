With a quick overview of the incidents of people who are not worried in the park, and many pictures / pictures, and incomprehensible stories, interacting, this is a very complicated movie to follow. It looks like a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a door or guardian in the park to be near his imprisoned wife, and perhaps save him. But he is clearly mad, bound on the floor, pointing out a lot of time and fear, trouble, and chaos written on his face all the time. The filmmaker changes his opinion at times, and we see a vague image of him on the side of the baby sink, or connecting the child who is trying. He is suffering with something. When the idea of ​​opinion has changed for its people or other mad people, the film manufacturer uses misleading lenses and things like that, showing us how people see and how they respond. And that place has mad people, laughing, hiding, and in one case they play night and day. One time a man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the door is afraid and returns to his cell. Gradually the person gets into a problem that has been interrupted in another attempt to steal her, and kills the doctor and many servants, and all the time they laugh and scream. When he wakes up he is released, and it reduces the floor. Some interesting shots of Japanese, local, buildings in the 1920s.
