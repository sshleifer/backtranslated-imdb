I remember the books of Comper, but don't remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not remembered; I don't know but during my old age, here I checked this Casper very early animated short yesterday. Later, I was shocked to read the comments of the user here. What? People missed the end? I need to learn again that Casper doesn't do with other ghosts, who like to go every night and fear c - p out of everyone. "He doesn't see the future in it," according to the author here. Instead, one night he goes to the rural part of the city, without fear of scattering the other animals and can't find any friends. It brings him to tears, until the little fox hears him walk and become his friends. Two are friends but soon, fox runs his life and hunt for foxes continues. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have explained what is happening, so I'll touch it, too. Foxes are killed by the hunting dog (not shown) and Casper has tears to lose the "only friend I had." But, no one says the end of happiness for this story. "Ferdie" fox becomes a spirit of the spirit as Casper, jumps on his hat, sucks his face and the author's opinion "lived happily at all times." All parties are very happy. <br /> <br /> What is sad about it? This is a good story with a good, happy ending.
