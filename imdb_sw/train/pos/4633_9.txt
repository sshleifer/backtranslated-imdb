Here is the most beautiful in the string of the best film led by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of a star-crossed lovers (single Israel, one Palestine) in modern Tel Aviv. The success of the film comes not only from its example of ethnic conflict, but of individual and political conflicts within ethnic groups as well. For example, there is a time to tell when one of the second, female sexually active, visits the hospital with her partner who brings flowers and tries to kiss her in front of her family visit, and suddenly we see a wave of bad condition wash through the room. In fact the young man is not clear as he looks, and the family is not like accepting as he can have, when the partner is confused and rejected. A good controversial plan is short-lived. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master in incorporating emotional and psychological effectiveness efficiently in the shortest order. The film is also suitable for skeletons that show the mutual violation of Israel and Palestinians. If you do not have a heartless heart, you will cry through the last three of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so written in mind and acts that reminds us of how satisfying the melodrama can be.
