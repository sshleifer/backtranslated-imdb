Star Trek: Frontier Secret is a long-term film of the fan, made entirely by the love of the series, and you should look at the Trek fans. The quality of production is the highest quality for the fan film, although sometimes you can tell them that they are green-screenin '. This does not eliminate the general experience however. CGI ships are amazing, with space war items ... On the wrong side, I could say in earlier sessions (and even more frequently in the latest) that some actors / actors are not quite well rooted, but again, this does not eliminate the general experience of the new Star Trek. Members and staff have come up with something special here, and in general, I would highly recommend this series for fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
