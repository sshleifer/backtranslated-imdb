I think it's a good example of the difference between two cultures. It would be a great movie to show in the social class. I thought it was very good and I must say that I am a sucker for "lets the band together and get to work" device device. It seems most people don't understand that this film is not just comedy. It has a few great things in it and I think they are mixing well. In general, I give 8 strong.
