For the movie "no budget" this thing is coming. I don't know if the US would like it, but we were cutting all the way. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Not really the Web. <br /> <br /> Carriers and Music were beaten. Cars and gags have even less in your face items. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I have seen some actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've got in advertising or something. Basically it's Rock! Luckily I found a copy from a friend of one of the participants.
