After seeing this film again it seemed to be bigger than me at this time than I have looked at. Acting is very strange. The characters are very clear. Brad Pitt is as good as a guilty son who rebels. Other actors and practitioners are also equal in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period from the days of the speakeasies of the 1920s. All in all, this is one of the best films made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You must see this film! <br /> <br />
