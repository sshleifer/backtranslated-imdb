This is a good movie, but it doesn't recommend if you don't like mental movies. It's about two people who want the world to leave, and that's exactly what they get. Acting is good, the end was not possible, and really had a good story different from many movies today. People complain about the movie very simple or awesome. I think they should just be connected to the movies like Toxic Avenger (I really like the B movies) or Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. Remember one: If you are aware of this, this has the same actors from Cube except four actors. Make two statements: Wait after credit (I don't believe here). Enjoy the film.
