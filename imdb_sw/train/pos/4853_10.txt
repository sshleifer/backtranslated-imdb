I have something for old black and white movies of this kind, Will Hay and Abbot movies & Costello especially if they are my favorite. I chose this film on DVD as it had the same idea as Will Hay's "Oh Mr Porter" which is one of the best comedies made. I have finished watching this film less than ten minutes ago (the movie has been completed at 12:45 am). I see that movies of this kind, doing with Spirit Train, etc., are best seen at night and outdoor lights. In this way it gets into the story of more journalism and at night it works well with this film. One of the films on the film may seem a bit to the audience, I think this depends on the viewer. They don't dated me though. I'm 28 and though I'm not old enough to be around when this movie was first released (my father was though). I am still grateful for some of these old movies. Sitting in the front room of the TV with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night when watching these movies, not many things can hit the feeling you get when doing it. It's a escape from reality for a while. I found that one of the men in the movie (has a black mustache) looks about three-quarters of the way through the movie after the fall of his car and looks at the woman followed at the station. This person was in the classic Will Hay "Ghost of St Michaels" too. I just think I would say it out if nobody saw it. Outside the neglected facility is well seen and if there is no soul for miles in any direction, and within the center it is very cozy to look away from the storms that are outside. I felt like I would be there on the movie and cast. The atmosphere in this film is something that does not exist in most movies now. It lets you talk from when the movie starts until it is finished. We need more of this type of film in today's market. But sadly it may be on the look for movies and magic and swear by odor. This type of era of film (Spirit Style, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) to me is the golden age of movies !.
