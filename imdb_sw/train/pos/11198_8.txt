Hitchcock shows his already aware of development for pictures in this original silent film. The film program, involving two activists to fight on the girl, is a direct game without suggesting. However, the Hitchcock talent is available in its amazing use of pictures. Almost every shot is filled with a visual sign. Especially memorable is the jewelry that one box gives the girl before marriage to another farmer. He strikes his hand in a clearer way of sex and with one simple Hitch movement has shown us everything we need to know. Pigs are handled well with some interesting-of-views shots which again proves how far in front of his Hitchcock time. The film also gives insight into its future treatment of women. Any of the warriors' ambition comes from money and greed, not because of love or love. Just other women in the film are the good girls of the party who offer clear sex versions or old crones that helps to destroy happy relationships. For all, Gonga is a must for anyone who wants the first job of Hitchcock and its development as a journalist.
