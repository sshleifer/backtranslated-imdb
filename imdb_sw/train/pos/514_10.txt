Certainly one of the best British films, if not one of the best films made anywhere. Script, movies, instructions and act in class alone. This film works on many levels. Why not available on the tape, DVD. Not shown on TV? Why is it a secret when it is frequently displayed at the Theater Theater of London in London for the full house?
