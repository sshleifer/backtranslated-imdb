Another powerful chick goes around. At this time, it refers to Diana Gusman who always finds a fight at school. Instead of expulsion, he takes his anger elsewhere, with a boxing box. He teaches that the striker and there meets Adrian featherweight and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a sharp message to take your dreams and go with them even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, his father doesn't believe him). That alone makes the film worthy of price. Enjoy
