This is a good movie that everyone should see. It looks like the book of Dean Koontz. Bill Paxton's performance was better because it looks like he believes in what he says and does. I don't know why viewers should read in some form of defense for religious killings in the film. It's a lie. The latter is amazing, but lies. So? I think that's what makes this movie very good. INFORMATION should not learn more if you see MOVIE. In this movie, the viewer continues to be shocked by the behavior of Paxton's behavior, the impact on children, and how children use these terrible practices. And then the end, it turns into reality. God has put him in a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant if other viewers recommend. Indeed, it has been given that it cannot be known otherwise, but the movie goes further to show how God "takes care of Adam" through the problem of video quality and a complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not defend Christian killings, is just taking a viewer on a very unexpected journey.
