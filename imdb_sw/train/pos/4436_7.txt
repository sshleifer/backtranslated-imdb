The Tattooed child was another of B movies rarely that BBC2 tried on Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night And Brighton Overseer. In this, a man walking his dog in Central Park comes to the left car to find a dead woman inside. He was shot by the police and then tried to identify him with a tattoo just as a great clue. After being identified, the killer is discovered and shot at the end of the shot. Most of this film was shot in place and near New York, so we can see certain parts of the city we are not usually seen, especially the back roads. <br /> <br /> Most unknown is in cast, and John Miles will get the highest payment. <br /> <br /> The Tattooed Expert is worth searching. Better but not clear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
