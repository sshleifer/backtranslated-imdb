I remember this film from many years ago. Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I clearly remember the film after a long time confirms its results. It is difficult to comment on the level of exhibition because of the language barrier. But they were still very strong. This lesson continues to appeal to us even by passing for years. And it was treated efficiently here, and the correct balance of historical perspective and concern. I would like it on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Do some of the film's archive art are writing its copy?
