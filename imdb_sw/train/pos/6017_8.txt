There is no way to deal with 'Zabriskie Point' from a sensible perspective or an attempt to explain using words and assemblies you can use for other movies. This is because it's not a movie. It is the idea and feeling that the creators of the film have been somehow turned into something like white as a film. The things we see are not the events of the plot, but the sequence of events that we do not see in the film every day but just think about what happens as the history we ourselves will use when we hear about a horrible event from friends. We see it is our idea of ​​people who are not found - nobody we know, but we have certainly felt about them in a book or on TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people talking, driving, and of course, they run. The only escape is from something invisible - it is a condition with the cruelty that the majority of civilization has allowed to exist even though laziness, or ... human nature. Put in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players oppose and to deal with the isolation of the modernization of modernization. These creatures are good for slates that can show any characteristics we can make if we want to. Although the acts of being considered can be seen as criminals or irresponsible, the perpetrators are not criminals themselves. They are human beings seeking to return to the ordinary, non-traditional, who are the most common they receive every day. It is not that they are happy or sad, but they reach a kind of self-reliance when they move away from the suicide of modern life. They only have a real life in the natural world, although he is the second victim of modern existence. At the end, 'Zabriski Point' is an example of humanity having a relationship with the natural world. If even the many pieces of the world that overpower our development ideas, we lose our soul in the way of the death of the human soul.
