I was so happy "The Revolution Will Not Be Affected". He gave me again, a good feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to rule. It is unfortunate that in Venezuela twenty percent of wealthy citizens have done all of the decisions by thirty percent of the poor for decades, if not a century. However, when their revolution failed; after the short-term government canceled the Supreme Court, and the Constitution, and the Ombudsman, and the Electoral Board, and all Civil Rights, no one took the tenants behind the barn somewhere and killed them. They don't even go to jail. The main builders live in Florida, they continue. And the protection they had was "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by the majority of Venezuelans. Not just the History that activates. Democracy can give you one hell to avoid if you allow it to be free. And in Venezuela is free.
