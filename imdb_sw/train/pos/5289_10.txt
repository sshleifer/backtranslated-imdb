John Waters has made a powerful, colorful, dark, dark film, I think I've seen (maybe Fast Fast Fast Women comes closer) The vision of directors is untainted ... The story is modern, characters are personal reflection and the odds of the family and its domestic life ... The voice has never been forced or stylistically on the arch. <br /> <br /> No photo of designing, ennui, or magazine .... Martha Plimpton is amazing as sister .. Eddie furlong is inspired casting. A woman talking to Mary, a tea dress, a recycled dress, yesterday's garbage becomes the art of today - and the subject of the film is that the most important thing we can care for is the family ... and humble life.
