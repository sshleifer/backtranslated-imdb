It does not seem that this film has been popular. At first, not many seem to have seen it first (I just locked it into an accident), and then judging by the reviews and rating, of those most who weren't very happy. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I often tolerate Gere for her appearance and charm, and even though I haven't seen her a good actor, I know she can do things very well (I loved Mr Jones). But this performance is different. He is not good at this, and he is not charming. His character is quite different from anything I have seen from him to that point - old, bad, broken, deciding. And Gere, why am I now his best job ever, removes away from beauty. I think it's a sign of how the actor does his job if you can't think of someone else doing it instead - think Hopkins like Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo on Training Day. That's how good Gere was here. <br /> <br /> Some of the cast were good with me too. I think I wouldn't have hit Danes in this role, especially because I think he's very good for him. But he does a very good job, joining Gere with the highest form, which is not too small. Strickland provides easily the most helpful act, in a section that requires a great range from him. In fact I think he owns an important area with Gere and Danes, and that's quite successful. <br /> <br /> So what about the remaining movie, except good work? The story may not be very surprising, some 8mm elements, but add "old breaks in rookie" storyline to who-dunnit, and also (like Sileni's Lamb) and add a quick feeling through trying to save the girl and close retirement for the Gere character. All that is back to the development of the two main characters, since they help each other to stay in their centers in life. That's a lot to complete in 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we're about to take care of the characters and what's happening to them. <br /> <br /> Instructions and photos were available. I could do without the movement of music cameras and modern videos and cut, but then it's old age, and it's not so bad, I really think it had helped with the movie atmosphere, which if you think it, generally not happy. <br /> <br /> Should see.
