This is the most favorite of fantasy from Ralph Bakshi; after looking at it on YouTube which is. Putting in the past after the Ice Age, it's a sword-and-magic effort before lying between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Ice and Mother's mother Juliana, has put their belongings on a world-famous victory. When glaciers they destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) promises to take revenge on his people and kill the Lord Ice. At the same time, a few people of Nekron and Juliana seized King Jarol's daughter of Princess Teegra; but he can escape, and finally meets Larn, who promises to take him back to the Firekeeper; as human beings never get first. This movie made a very small box office (such as many film Ralph Bakshi), but it has become a cult of worship, in part of the quality of art, cooperation between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantaster Frank artist. Frazetta. Also, I have heard that the screenplay is written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, two men who had made coman comic stories, and the authors back with James Gurney, an example of a novel Dinotopia; although I have never read Kondani or Dinotopia. And also painter Thomas Kinkade, noted for his drawings for models, music boxes for Bradford Exchange Company instead of painting. And as Bakshi Lord of the Rings and North America, this film was taken, but the process works better in this film than it was in the past. So, in general, I think it is one of the most beautiful creatures. A wonderful movie that has been made, and an amazing cooperation between two big ideas - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. For many fantasy, sex, sex and exciting adventure.
