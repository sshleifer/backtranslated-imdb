I found this film to be interesting research of the family in the crisis. When Leo, an elder announces that he is HIV + the effect of family members alone and with each other was touching and still it's amazing. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a family that was like physical displays like this; neither is it possible to shout for each other. I did not understand why the family saw that the little one could not cope with the news but soon after it had been difficult I got this very moving film. <br /> <br />
