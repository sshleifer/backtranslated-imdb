This small film was long on my "guardian" list. What? People are aware of how women who encouraged them, men, suffering from emotional (including mental loss) were completely treated with medical profession during the century? All the great Christian eyes of the time were death to examine the emotional feelings that would allow us to accept the spirit of suffering, then let us examine the meaning of human acceptance. What? Can you think (at today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because they accepted women to have feelings and emotional responses such as mans? Think about that! The attention of this film still gets me and I lend to the director to do this through his eyes.
