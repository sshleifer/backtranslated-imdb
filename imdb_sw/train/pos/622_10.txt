When I didn't think I was a big fan of the story movies, Stardust emphasized me to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailer as a villain (especially since I would see him as Velma Von Tussle head in Hairspray). Boy, is he so influencing evil here as a witch, especially with his old preparations in the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also as a pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Welcome to all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others doing a good job here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are an ancient beauty, there are also wonderful faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as a Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we meet her first. The new player Charlie Cox is as good as Tristan who led and appeared very much like his father Dunstan as a boy who I thought had him in earlier scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many views have compared this to the Bride and when I can see the difference, the big difference is that for PB, you always knew it was just a story of thinking as told by an elder to her grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you see and hear can happen even with all the hilarity that happens. So on that note, I strongly recommended Stardust.
