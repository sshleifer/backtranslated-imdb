I have been bitter! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love. I am on Season 2, 5 disc, and I tell you that I also attached to the current characters. For anything that is going to happen will affect my lot of show. And, Michael is on my list now. To give ... I am very happy to see the 3rd season, because I was so afraid to go to the disc 6 to think it would end. I can't wait to see others now. Thanks to directors / producers / administrators of Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to sleep depressed because of my despair on television, but I say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
