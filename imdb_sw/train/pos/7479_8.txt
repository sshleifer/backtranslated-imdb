"Sweet is never worth sweet without sour." This quotation was the basis of the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise has a boy who was given everything in his life. He takes things for granted and comes around fully on this great film and losing good. This film will allow you to get into a plot and you can't improve to take a bathroom break. It is a movie that makes you back and see your life and how you live. You cannot understand the most beautiful things of life (sweet), like love, even if you get bad (sour). The theme will allow you to "open your eyes." <br /> <br /> Complaints are that the movie is greatly corrupted on points and it's hard to understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you look at it and see for yourself.
