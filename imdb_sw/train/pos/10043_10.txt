This movie wrote a movie history in every way. Nobody cares about anyone who thinks about this film, because it despises opposition. Anyway in the film easily fails with many amazing things in which the movie goes. It's a very good movie, and I am sure many of us will see something like that again. I have seen it more than I consider counting, and I still have transfixed every time, and a feeling that is hard to describe. One for years.
