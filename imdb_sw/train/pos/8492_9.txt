Gung Ho is one of those movies that I have never been tired of looking at. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, & he is quite hilarious in this movie. According to her step by step is Gedde Watanabe. They both work in amazement together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like to show how the hunt (Keaton) & Funk (Watanabe) are struggling in their roles as leaders of their groups. They both struggle very hard to keep peace, and then they finally fight (which is hysterical look). First, both are floor. Then the hunt jumps over the seat. Function jumps on the desk. Hunt is on the desk with him. The fighting comes from office to factory. I love that after being separated from employees, you can tell them that both feel bad to allow things to get it by hand. Also, there is an area where you can see the influence that Hunting has had with a role. She is at home with her master from Japan comes & says she would like to visit the factory's next day: <br /> <br /> Function: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why? Functions: Factory is closed & we can't find the key. Tell me you can't watch Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I've loved this movie because it's really funny, and it also shows how people who are quite different can not just learn from each other, but be good friends too.
