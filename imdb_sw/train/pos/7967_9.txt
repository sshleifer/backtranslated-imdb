That is obviously one of the great Disney movies made. It is a real pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and will put you in doubt. Basically, what is the home barrier that is about three household farmers who are sent to live on the farm when their owners go on vacation. They don't know what's going on, and they like to go home, they run from the field and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche entered. He gave the voice of Shadow, old, wise and wise gold retriever. Also star in this film was Sally Field to deliver the sound of Sassy, ​​cat Himalayan. But by weight, what this film is all about the Chance! Released by Michael J. Fox (my entire actor at all), Uwezo is basically what you would expect from a dog, loved, playing, strong and goofy, and every time I watch this film, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy does not end! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad sometimes. Sometimes they remind people of the times that they have been alone or lose their pets. <br /> <br /> One place that always puts me in doubt is the area where the trio tries to escape from pounds; I feel especially at the place where Chance finds his kola found in the fence and almost does not. The movie had sometimes suspenseful, but nothing to me seems more suspenseful than that. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you have enjoyed this film, you will probably enjoy sequel as well. I give you this 9 film out of 10!
