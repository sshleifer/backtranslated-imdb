This was one of the wonderful moments of T.V. that I wanted to be taken forever in VHS. Is it no longer the air? It was very creative and I remember it was revealed once a week and waiting for the next part was interesting. I want to see it again. I want to buy. I want what I can't have. Even in EBAY. So, after enough rest it was, far away, one of the best 80 best-placed series. It should be considered normal but lost in space. At least this site with Wikipedia mention it. Sob. It was very interesting, interesting, loving, and original. Maybe not like Sherlock Holmes originally, I actually think Quintin is more interesting and has a better chance with his leading wife than the hardest and Chalky Holmes ever can.
