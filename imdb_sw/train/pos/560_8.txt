Another very nice man flick thanks to the father / son's son Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often a comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that a little person takes the form of a trip or a bend. "You miss Mr. Dunston". Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the feeling he cares for himself but it is clear that he can't stop Brennan. John McIntire is best as a rule of Skagway with due respect for the right way to its reality. Another important thing is to help people and in turn they are supported by people. The lazy can not do or be injured. <br /> <br /> The above description shows that Tatum cannot live without its coffee. This nicotine medicine proves death. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now you have a DVD.
