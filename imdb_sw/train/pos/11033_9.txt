I don't think I'll understand the hatred for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most amazing movies ever. That's true, you little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know. Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former player who has 'visit' his old town when asked to help an old friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), to help save on the top of the mountain. Walker definitely returned at the right time, because the lost people are a modern team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & cooperation. have lost a lot of money they stole from U.S. government. somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and really like to return ... <br /> <br /> In fact, 'Cliffhanger' is another head of 'Die Hard'. Just trade in Nakatomi Plaza up to the mountain mount of Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes designed to show the weakness of our hero and keep him dead. Typically, that introduction is completely cut off by the recent shreds, as the behavior of Stallone prevents quite a large number of ammunition easily, and the first face slams in several rock surfaces and no apparent effects. After all, what are the other movies to do? Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting movies around it. Displays great events and stunts. One of the first stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in the movies, and when all the movie is not better available than it did at the beginning, it continues to amazing its action. The President of John Lithgow's lead is entertaining, and dude one bad. It is quite possible that one of the leading criminals to lead ever. Cliffhanger is one of the best efforts of Stallone, the best efforts of Renny Harlin, and the most exciting movie to make - 9/10
