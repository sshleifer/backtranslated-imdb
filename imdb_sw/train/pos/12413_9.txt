A murdered prisoner who has hated a prisoner who was used to kill the uninvited prisoners while waiting for revenge for the man who made him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 Viggo Mortensen is good, and acting is very good in general. Lane Smith is as bad as the administrator of guilt. Also, this film has a great year, including death and mummification of wire.
