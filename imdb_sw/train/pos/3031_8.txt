It can be better if it is directed by a more experienced person. Shumlin did not have a bad job but not a great job of cinema. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie. I have loved it since the proven streets. Graham Greene is one of my authors of the last century. Some of the worst bad movies were made from the novels and stories. (Most love "Idon fallen" but I am not among them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm thinking only fondly of the novel.) This is super cast. Charles Boyer does not, is true, comes as Spanish. But he seems to have a full character of this character - tired, caring, caring. Lauren Bacall is attracted as a British girl who falls for her. But helping players are better: Katina Paxinou is the best. His performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet with the Boyer lesson in Esperanto as a universal language, is the best - as always. And Wanda Hendrix can break the hardest heart. He comes as a young teenager. Characteristic wants to be useful. He does his best. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie very much. Not without reservations. Storage is, in particular, that is a little stolid. But stories and acting cannot be taken into account.
