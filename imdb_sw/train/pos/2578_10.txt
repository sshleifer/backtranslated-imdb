Superman and Men's Mole are the most likely of the severe adventures of Superman forever. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the most comprehensive oil house in the world. At that time, some radiation men come through oil and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other urban people are trying to remove the invading men. Can Superman change people's ways for a while to save men? Can Superman warn people about the dangers of radiation bringing people? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Mole Men are an intelligent, well-written and well-designed movie. Even though we only see the Superman jump was briefly, still makes a great adventure of Superman. Must see anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
