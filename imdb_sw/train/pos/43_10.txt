I liked this film very much. I was so impressed with how Deanna and Alicia were friends over the tragedy. Alicia was just an anxious person and Deanna was just happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint is that at first it was a kind of slow and it took a short time to get the foundation of things. Other than that was good.
