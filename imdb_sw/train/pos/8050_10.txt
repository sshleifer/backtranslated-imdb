The more fat boy in the military does it again. The first movie of Sammo which has followed the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazing Lee as in his actions and fighting. The way into the style of Bruce and then return to himself, more to learn kung fu is fun to watch and shows how to complete and change he is in his art. Dial in the humor of slapstick so little loved ones of this kind of flick with this movie that has all - comedy (some unintentional, like a guy guy guy), and some amazing combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Big beer and master movie that is worth an hour and a half time of anyone.
