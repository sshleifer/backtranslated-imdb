I think this is a good movie of the family. There are many hilarious events and moments to stimulate the film. Actors are the best and the effects are done well. Danny Glover plays with George Knox who runs the baseball team's awesome 'Angel' and is a great film. Also amazing are the actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is as good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are devastating in this film on Disney movie. Interesting and warm movie that everyone should enjoy.
