I enjoyed the Chinese movie entertainment in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older man wants to pass his art to a young man though he has no children living. The faces of actors are amazing to see. The story shows a commitment and appreciation for children who care well for them and their desire to be treated well. The media in the film reminds me of MY TRAINING, which was more modern and meaningful. The story here reminds me of the story of Dickens of the day where the children were almost chattel. The program is slightly predictable and slightly too impressed for me but well worth the time when looking for courage, humanity, and history is shown.
