This television series was one of my favorite ones when I was a child. Even though I now see through a glass of red glasses, I can still say it is a show of quality, very education but it is still amazing. I haven't seen the original version of French, only Swedish. I don't know how good dubbing was, it was too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The column of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has not taught me half of what I knew from this show. It is also locked in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy foods and do not use, and good examples in the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature tanks can attack you? : D Cartoon looks beautiful, many friendly children of course, but they have done well. The organisms, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by exciting drawing figures, looking very much at what you expect what to look like in the body. This, and the series on history (especially the scenario of horror) was an important part of my childhood. I am so happy to see you here.
