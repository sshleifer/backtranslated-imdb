Photo by Henry Fonda shows "Elegant" John Howard, an old businessman who has had a boyfriend "Eleanor" found again after a long stay in hospital has forced her to forget her payment. Deciding that she would like to do only one perfect job, she comes out of the hospital, steals back to Eleanor, and joins old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to transfer her group of prostitutes. <Br /> <br /> Fondas' good performance is an anchor of the original film that comes to the heart as efficiently as it attracts a beautiful bone in more comedic scenes. Casting superb including Robert Englund, as a new reluctant player, Susan Sarandon (who also gets a co-loan), and Dub Taylor (a delightful ham, as usual, in the most visible part of the image) very helpful. br>> <br /> The ultimate nature of enhancing the image of the image and the wind of the car carries a remarkable weight; this is a picture, which enabled you to enter into it, you can remember long after the finish. > ina The country looks just good. Put a Craig Safans music logo, it's a wonderful picture for the interesting thing. It loses a little thing in its last act (characters hit by John Byner and Austin Pendleton is a little more than an intrusions), but it still has a good thanks to good vibes for the appeal of its central characters. It is not any picture of exploitation / car-player who can expect from the head (especially his second name, "Smokey Highway"), is a film experience you enjoy who I can recommend without merit. <br /> <br /> 9/10
