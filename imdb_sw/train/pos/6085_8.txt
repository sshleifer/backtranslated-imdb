Critics are dumb. This movie is interesting and wise. I liked this film very much. Why everyone hates this film. I would like people would like this movie more than them. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real lovers and they put many work to make this movie. I don't see you people out there doing movies like them. So people should just look at it and not tell it. I would like this movie. It's all the same way. There are places that have been dumb but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would like this because this film has acting as King of Queens. But this is better than that. I can't believe this was rated very low.
