I always love this great movie of baseball! It has a good mix including two wonderful actors and two of my dear Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie is Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza, and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! Film has special effects and act from all film actors! Baseball scenes are absolutely true! Music and songwriter Randy Edelman is very good and fit the film very well! Some of the participants who reminded me of a real baseball balance. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell reminded Royce Clayton, McConaughey's attitude reminded me to Steve Finley, and the comments of Jay O. Sanders' comments in my opinion were similar to how Al Hrabosky is seen today. This is a wonderful movie for non-Baseball fans and I highly recommend this film!
