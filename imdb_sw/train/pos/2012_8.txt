This is one of the favorites at all times. Great music with some funny bits. I laugh every time in Millie, a maid pretending to be the first woman, making her dainty hankie while talking, and having intelligence furniture without being talking. I have never ever found its fragrance of French never to be in trouble if they are trying to betray her as a daughter of a boss. <br /> <br /> See Mel Torme young and very young Frank Sinatra singing is such a treat. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in the theater about the same time this movie came out. He said they could not remove "bobby-soxers" between movies (in those days you did not need to leave between the exhibitions). This movie shows how interesting and loving Frank little had and allows to appreciate his original talent as well. And Victor Borge gets a bit of his procedure, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie consisting of sweet, simple storyline. It's very enjoyable.
