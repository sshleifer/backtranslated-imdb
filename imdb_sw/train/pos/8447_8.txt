In fact, this is not really a "movie" as the last part of the end; and this I mean, if you have not followed a television series (killed: life on the road) I see that you will have a hard time following this planned film for tv. Having said that, "Killed: Movie" is still a great look. I think it says a lot about television production that everyone who has been beaten will return, many after years of absence, once again show their characters and bring to the closure of a wonderful plan. The film brings the meaning of "family", not only among the characters, but among the participants, too. It is very bitter-sweet to know that this will be the last time we will see them all under the name of HOMICIDE. The way of wisdom, I saw this film is not suitable. The charge of mayor Giardello looks exactly, and I felt his shot could be addressed within its parameters of his usual position, like Leiutenant. Also, Det. The loss of a strict Bayliss plot, left to be executed at the end of the series, has finally been resolved, but I, for one, never saw it needed; I was glad to be left with a mystery (let's remember that the first case of the first incident also went without deleting the entire series of run!). If a DEVOTED fan of a series of television series can love this film, and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS has been deleted, but I can't recommend it to anyone who didn't have a little exposure to the series. Now, if they just remove it from the DVD ...
