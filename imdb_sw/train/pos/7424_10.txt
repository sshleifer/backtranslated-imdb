I was 16 years old when I saw the movie, and it has always been a favorite of mine. Of course, you can't refuse to appeal to Kristofferson in the film - HOW ARE I MANI? Sheesh. It's still. She is a bad boy every woman wants to secretly. His work is useless. He played a drunken / addict in the way that a man had gone that way - and had - in '76 finally entered the car, so it was all true. The music is GREAT and even though in later years I thought Streisand was not a good person for it for physical beauty, I think it's more problematic for a male audience than a female. We gals just watch Kris - and usually boys are looking for female interests - my husband can not watch the movie b / c - does not like her looks. But I made him sit just by the Ferrari red scene on the road toward the end just so he could see how good it was - the work of the camera was very full and was completely in the car with him and the beat of music - you should see it on my 50 plasma "WOW And finally, the quality of transfer was a GREAT glass - amorphic and quite clear with a great color and very low noise except for dark areas that are common to all the film. My mother and I like this movie together, I bought her copy for Christmas.I would like to look at it with her last night. I can't just get to the beginning time. Look at all the pictures of the festival in '76 there was just like I lived in time. and s Ings, so far she has found even mentioning Kris or information about the scenes in the movie. His voice looks similar to that time. Look out, if you grew up in the same age as I (born in 1960) you will love it. Wendy
