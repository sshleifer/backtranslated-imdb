I loved this film, yes, I know that it was too closed, there was no way that the Shelby car could sit on the road with 540i and all traction control and other gizmos but unless the whole film was installed together. Cage was as good as usual and all the others were beaten also were very good except Bad Bad Guy, was the least "too" very uncomfortable? However, a good film, big cars and good acting. For one I made sure that my car was locked and scared in my regulated garage off that night. :)
