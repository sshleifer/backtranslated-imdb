The 1st season was amazing, any idea of ​​them fixing the island, while the secrets were being considered (and the appearance) was just wonderful; filled with doubts, tons of cliffhangers, and amazingly conspiracy. I mean, I would like the whole idea of ​​just seeing the island. And then first see the smoke monster in the first place really caught my attention. From then on, I walked the second season was the same as the first season, just better. I really liked the idea of ​​a hat and DHARMA Plan. The whole lesson and a series of season 2 were wonderful, exciting, and exciting. I loved all the doubts around others on the island, but the story of DHARMA has made an amazing second season. The 3th season was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but nevertheless, it's good. I liked to see the past stories of others, see their camp, and see more secrets to explore. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my most popular events. This season, while not good, was fun and interesting, but most of all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I was hoping for this season, and the first couple of events we're good, but really started getting boring and monotonous. I mean, I totally despise "new" rescuers such as Miles and Daniel. The plan was old after the first few events ... and AT ALL .... The 4th season was removed away from something that made the perfect LOST perfect: hidden, doubtful, comedy mixed with (Charlie had gone) and total excitement . Also, some of my dear characters have left.
