One of the best movies I saw was the Irish movie Philadelphia, Here I come. I read playing before watching the film and loving both of them. It is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to America because he can't get life in Ireland. It is the whole of the boy's perspective (which the other characters in the film can see) and the other boy representing his mindless thoughts and feelings, but who can not be seen by other characters in the film. It is a very sad film, but it faces a lot, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to reflect. I love any Irish film, or close any film about Ireland, and any film that has an Irish actor of the late Donal McCann in my vote. I will look at someone looking for gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately, I. embarrassed that he lost him very young.
