"Mother" says about a mother who was a mid-60-year-old widow (Reid) who, with her husband's death, finds herself from a sleepy life because she has a relationship with a young painter who is also a lover of her daughter. The film stays with a quiet mother, her good relationship with her son and her whole daughter, who needs silence trying to ask for a bed with her little girlfriend, and convolutions from it. A certain antiseptic drawing under the psychological footprint, "Mama" is doing a good job of dealing with anxiety issues when preventing enough emotions. You will do better with more mature viewers, perhaps women, who can better understand the behavior of the middle, needs and issues. (B +)
