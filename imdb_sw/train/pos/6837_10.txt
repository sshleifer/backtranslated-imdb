De Palma's movie is available with lots of style and some event that will bring you to your seat. The fact that this movie is the best is the most exciting, it's fashionable. It has some beautifully modified editor and some area that is a sense of confidence that will bring you to your seat. The best location from the film; The museum and elevator killings. There is a sufficient amount of playback and the speed of the film should not be quick for normal appearance to fully understand this film. So this film can be inappropriate for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also very good but it is a style that makes the movie work! It can be just for fans but also ordinary viewers should be well aware of creating tension in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a good good character displayed by good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting choice for making and Angie Dickinson does as he looks (it's not bad for 49 years!) , as its mark on another movie of De Palma, "Double Body". <br /> <br /> The great brilliant attack. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
