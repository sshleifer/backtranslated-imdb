Watching "Fox and Child" was an addiction. Positive performances, honesty of the view, and the beauty of the set and the characters leave me in the swoon of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The program is not complicated. Easy for fraud. In that humble vessel the world opens you in and lets you rest. You are laughing. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can believe for yourself - a volunteer. I say it is an act of love designed for any innocent heart. Approaching the heart of the viewer - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as seen from the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that true art attracts a viewer to the point of view in the participation of happiness in the Truth. I feel I have had the opportunity to watch - no, engage in - this film, the work of true Art.
