I have read Nabokov, and I don't know anything about chess, I could just watch "Luzhin Protection" as a movie. It works well as one of my favorite music "sports shows". Chess comes alive as a fierce competition than, say "Searching Bobby Fischer," to show how hard the mind of the game can be, it requires ideas, preparation, stamina and plans. I especially liked the special effects on the chess board as the preferred alternative. Through the female director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson and her big blue eyes gradually strengthen through her conversion relationship with John Turturro's straightforward direct guide the chess edge. Italy / Hungarian settings are good. <br /> <br /> (previously written 5/27/2001)
