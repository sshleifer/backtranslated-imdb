This is one of those movies that, after looking at it, will continue to think and return to the months after watching. Acting is amazing for two kids (I usually hate movies and a white child). Bill Paxton is amazing, its first beginning of information is better than what I expected for an actor whose most memorable line is "Game over, man! More game!" (from "Visitors" of the film). The best part of the film is the dichotomy between those events where the actors play the family, and when they do their "work". In fact it makes the film reliable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Continue on, Bill. I'll ever wait more movies I am sure to love it!
