I have seen a lot of Saura film and always found a wonderful way she meets music, dance, drama and great movies in her movies. Iberia shows the best Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and the most modern concepts of dance and music. Another thing that my call is the fact that, in this film, players and musicians, drums and music, it is important: the camera shows various aspects of music translation, examining not only technical issues but also experience emotional play. Saura's interest on the bridge between classical and modern music and dance is one more link in turning this movie perhaps more aesthetically exciting among its other actions. That's why I recommend very much to those who love good movies, good music, good dance, great art.
