I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was too scared to see this film. (I would have been destroyed by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but I was ten now). Part 1 where Blob goes to the farmer's observation rod and ingulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stay and suffer through every attack of our monster. I felt scared as Steve and his girl were leaving the doctor's office (the poor doc), and even more when Blob came into the cinema movie and destroyed a large part of the audience. . . Many actually that IT oooooozzzzzzed out the front doors, very large now to fit through just one. It seemed unlikely and endless in growth, and when it was holding Steve poor in a necklace, he appeared as a sure dinner. Saying that Blob was cool would be a modern description of the day, but finally, it is better than fear and mentally misleading young children. I remember going home in the evening with my brother Nick, trying to act bravely. He knew that I was in trouble, and when I was lying in bed at night I didn't feel only the blob into the room, but when I called the courage to look down on the apartment, there was a red blow, a dude of heart like a hungry seated, waiting for me to try and wake up and go to the bathroom . It took months to restore. I'm 57 years old now. . . I have done it. <br /> <br /> Of course Blob was not damaged.
