This movie was beautiful, awesome, but very good. For those who have heard about columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. Behind your mind you know that people are thinking about these things, but you don't know how bad they are, and this film lets you realize. It is very important. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone who is sure. I read a book about columbine killings and made me think, this movie makes me worried and sad to die. On the obstacle is like how to kill someone guide to serial killers. I recently got a threat, and I hit off without thinking anything, but after this movie I think you should take everything to weight. Some people are mad and don't really know who they are, so take them seriously and don't learn someone.
