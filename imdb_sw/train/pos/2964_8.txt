BASEketball is a very interesting movie that provides a job that usually makes a very fun film, interesting material that is more than stuck in your funny trousers, and a good plot despite the fact that it is the ethnic slackers against the rough rich guy. and the only thing that I did not like about BASEketball, is that the child was not very much needed on the film, but, if the child was not in the movie, some of the incredible events would not be there. This film.BASEketball is a good comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
