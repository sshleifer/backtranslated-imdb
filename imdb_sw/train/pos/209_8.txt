Walter Matthau and George Burns are doing very well. The Willy and Al amnesic nature of amazingly is a mixture made in heaven. The place where they meet again in the Willy flat is the gem and the final area around the film to the full. Walter Matthau gives good performance as a retired half-retired player as he can, the sound of the voices and the sound of the widespread and his general misunderstanding of what is going to create a good reputation. George Burns's situation is a story and no place is better than this film, and its stability of the answers and answers to the dry desert are remembered. Look at the area near the end when Al and his daughter ask the object of the Spanish guardian, and the al - an unimportant response.
