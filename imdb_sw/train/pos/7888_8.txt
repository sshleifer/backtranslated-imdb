Freddy Krueger explains a dream from returning to the elm road, a good actor Robert englund has come back to this 5th dream, hopeful baby dreams.I've got a number of accuracy. This has been a lot, and this is one of the best, especially for watos and Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, John depp, (who made the first dream at 84) alice cooper (singer) will see Freddy as a beaten baby, a young man who loves pain, and as a family boy (creepy) the effects are very interesting and creative, also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer (road trip) yaphet kotto (alien, living and letting die) and Amanda Donahue (the father knows better) I was one of 3 people who saw this in 3D, ending up .i love 3d movies. I missed the first 3D wave of 1953 (not yet born) the second wave was 1983.i as all Freddy movies. this stands as one of the best without first counting which was quite brilliant, Freddy became a new monster of 80 years and 90, with Jason voorhees, chucky, Micheal myers, and face face. I recommend this to all Freddy fans and doubts the same fans.that Freddy is cut as 8 out of 10.
