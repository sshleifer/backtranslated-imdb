"Green Green" is one of the best science fiction 70 years and can still persuade them even today. Although there is little desire, the touch of strife and the environment (usually at the time) still feels very sad and stimulating thoughts. The quality of this film exceeds the most modern SF's because of the cast and the most power that I personally take into account. New York's 2022 is a repressive area of ​​living, with a large number of people, unemployment, unhealthy weather and a shortage of every important food item. The only available food is made and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in good shape) plays the police investigating the murder of one of the most famous Soylent actors and is caught up on scandals and dark secrets ... it's time and not clear. The sequence of the fighting is really bad and easily one of the best moments in 70 movies. Edward G. Robinson is finally amazing in his last role and there is a great responsibility (but also common) to support Joseph's Cotton (" Blood Blood "," Bad Dhi Phibes "). This is Science-Fiction in my book: The night of the night and the inevitable is happening to humanity! No shipping space fancy and angry monsters attack our planet.
