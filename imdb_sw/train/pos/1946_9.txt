I wasn't a big fan of Star Trek up to 2-3 years ago. Thanks to the advent of Netflix video and post-2000 video technology, I can enter the previous period of Star Trek. For those who do not look at each section and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., common conventional concessions will say - "I love Generation Next" better. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were clean when the first seemed after decades of hunger Star Trek. But to be honest, I appreciate the creation of the events of Voyager more than TNG. Voyager sessions also continue at different times with TNG. What data from TNG are good but eventually find an old doctor but of Voyager - now it's creative! Instead of making an open-minded and bold mind, give the freedom to explain anything you thought. It's not just Picardo as a good actor but a basic environment for its growth, growing self, like a doctor, realizing now which is a science fiction for the best! Endgame shows him as a married wife to "organic", forming a neuro-implant for a human-machine interface, and even - in the pre-Endgame period, ignoring Captain's command and making "human" errors. Unlike DS9 which is blessed with two beautiful women from part 1, Voyager will stay on the 3rd season without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that brought them to his personality. Of course some of the voyage of Voyager's cast just flows without power, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very nature. I love Tuvoc from time to time, though it's Vulcan. Finally, I am very happy to flee from the woman's natural lady - oh, if you look at the pictures - thank God for Kate! He has grown up for seven years to be a very brave, trusted and respectful female leader. What a great job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every part, the search of possibilities of possibilities, ethics, and the cosmic area.
