You will see by the star I have given this GREAT film which '... before you see it first,' it means. I have never heard of this film and it happened all over because just this week (and last) it was a very hiring experience (not too big to come). I don't know how this film dropped behind me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is also great. However, it did. This is a wonderful example of what to do if you don't have a big budget. It had a good amount of conspiracy and discussion to make it very interesting and put the viewer in the dark; just enough. The whole film is you (the viewer) trying to think of the surrounding spots and turn. I would like to give this film 10/10, however some shots were looking good fake. I don't want that against this film very much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect mark. Lucy Liu is beautiful and wonderful (as always). I think he is very good as a great talent. Do not like its beauty (which is difficult), takes its work very seriously and can not rest on its appearance to drive it through the modern feeling of emotions. And he may seem cool even without life if needed, too. Jeremy Northam does well, for the first time, as a gray gray mouse, already run through any way to prove himself. However, if he alters all the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or others hope that James Bond will come to hate me for this, but Northam could / could achieve the bill. He offers to grow and grow. He has a great position of Bond and sound. I think it can also be cold if the situation is needed, and also underground, too. <br /> <br /> The great movie with this buff-movie definitely recommends being seen at least once if you like corporate wind films.
