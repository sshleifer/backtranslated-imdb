I read this book, when I was a little boy, then I saw that film last night. About a year ago I investigated the IMD and did not discover existing copies. I then hit the web and found a website that offers Film War, soooo happy that I, ordered copies and sat down and was able to prove why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion really enjoy the film I suggest reading a copy of the book and then watch the film. The book should no longer be but I listened to a copy down through E-bay, Alan White's author was a command / paratrooper during the second world war involved in secret secret activities and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows this fact and I believe it provides a book with the validity of the film. I did not give only ten films because of the final film, not as good as the book. There are a few lines of conspiracy that varies with the book also, which is wonderful if the book is not on the great nature of war but on the individual in battle. The film shows this very well. I have a copy of the book to allow my child to read and then the film will allow him to watch, in the same order. If you can track this book and the film is worth it and I just want it to be more easy to read and see, one of my best films, ever!
