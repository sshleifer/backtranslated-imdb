I was hoping that this would be good if a fan of the timothy dalton bond and though it was not 'his third-party bond' was a laugh. Belushi brought good humor to him and dalton finished it well, but perhaps he had no use. part of it liked the edition of jack nicholson camp in a few good people. The other brit in it was a little surprising, but the overal was a laugh.
