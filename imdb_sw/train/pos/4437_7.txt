This police system is not worse than most of its age and much better than a few. It obviously follows in the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but it happens as an enjoyable app. The best thing about it is to look at the outfit that provides in the world now for a long time have gone ... the lower class of New York's late 40 / early 50 years. Here is in all its glory of seed, from the publishers of The old school tattoo for cheap hotels on greasy teas. These former police films are similar to travelogues for the past and are very interesting for anyone who does not like the city of santized, today's weather. Also exciting is the emphasis on the scientific aspect of nuts-and-bolts crime ... in this case, the murder of a woman who was photographed found a abandoned car. Our great heroes, Tobin and Corrigan monitors, are working on foot, but without much effort and stimulation of "lab boys", they will not find anywhere. Although technology does not exist in one league, the fighters here use C.S.I. The monitor will monitor their person. The ways that other critics have written on this film, you think would have been said by Ed Wood and done extra from his movies. What bosh! I enjoyed John Miles as an ex-Marine guest turned Tobin soldiers ... he was happy to go-lucky, a simple way of a role which is a welcome change from the common history of the history of the history of that period. Patricia Barry is good and enjoyable as her perky partner who helps to solve crime. Walter Kinsella is a slick and trouble like an old detective Corrigan. I loved the chemistry of these two and has been done for a little something different from the type of robotic technique "Dragnet". The secret itself is not too deep and the last expulsion and really shooting will not put among the academic filmmakers, but in a short time, "Tattooed Stranger" more than to keep my interests.
