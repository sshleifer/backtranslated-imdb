I am a great fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me a big fan of the King. Pet Sematary is about the family of believers. They have just moved into a new home, and they seem to be happy. But there is a cemetery of pet near their home. The new neighbor of Creed Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the cemetery. This funeral tree is pure cleanness. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you surrender someone (or any type of pet) on burial ground, they will rise. The only problem, is that when they come back, they are not the same people, they are evil. Once Jud explains everything about the Petite's Pet, everything begins to go to hell. I haven't explained again because I don't want to give some of the main parts in the film. Acting that Pet Sematary was good, but it needed a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, because because it was natural and promoting. This film has a lot of recycling effects that makes the film more, and is scared. One of the main reasons for this film has been dropped back, it was the effects of restarting. There is one character in this film that is quite realistic. This character is "Zelda." This special character comes to the film about three times to be correct. Zelda is a sister of Rachel Creed who lost years before, but Rachel is still hated by her. At first Zelda looked at the film should not be because she does not talk or anything, but the second time is worse, and being honest, the second time scary life *** from me. There is nothing wrong with this film, it's almost entirely. The Semetary of the Pet provides huge drains, a very good acting, the first level of the standard, and make a good demonstration. This is one of the most awesome films of all time. 10 out of 10.
