Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I was worried about this film of the late 90s I was happy! This is the best and most perfect version of the book on the film! This version is too long to stay in one set but it is very valuable. Timothy Dalton is wonderful as Rochester. I was glad that they gave the usual actor (Zelah Clark) like Jane and not a good person. I like sets and location. For anyone who is really a fan Jane Eyre, this is the watch version! For those who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I looked at my VHS copy almost broke so I enjoyed getting it on DVD.
