I have never heard this film before I saw it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was right, but by giving me a good shot I decided to do it. He basically says Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in Red Rock City, Wyoming, looking for work, and owner of the meeting Wayne Wayne (Pleasantville of JT Walsh) is given a lot of money, has made a mistake for the beaten man to work for his faithful wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle). Then, it takes money, and may warn Suzanne, and after making a counteroffer, she decides she needs to leave. Wayne knows his real identity, expels Michael to shoot a big gun, until he goes to the car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things have been difficult when Michael knows Lyle is a sick man who had made a mistake, and he makes a quick break. Returns to Suzanne, and knowing that they all have a risk, they plan to leave the city together, adding other problems to the fall of each other. Before leaving, however, Suzanne insists to go and steal a lot of money in a safe way. Of course things will not go well, and Wayne and Lyle will reach them, and Lyle puts them in power and now has Wayne gone and earn money. Finally, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get a train to go along, but it is clear that she cares more about money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also with Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as a Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. Exhibition, apart from maybe the Boyle, who is both fine and dandy, and has got quite a good movie film feel for the black comedy thriller. Very nice!
