I went to see Hamlet because I was among work. I thought 4 hours would be good, I've been a fan of Branagh; He died again, Henry V. I was completely defeated by the direction, acting, cinema that this film was taken. If you review other 4 hours passes quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I watch this film I am trying to find a mistake, I look at the stars and I haven't seen them. How he could transfer the camera into and out of Hall and all mirrors are hidden to me. This movie was shot in 70 mil. It is embarrassing that Columbia has not provided the Widescreen version of this on VHS. I'm a DVD player, and I'd like to take this on Titanic any day. So Columbia if you listen to this film the way that should be looked at! And I don't know what happened in Oscars. This should erase the best image, the best actor, the best trends, the best movies. What film did they watch? I felt sorry for Branagh in Oscars when he made a tax for Shakespeare on screens. They should be paying taxes to Branagh for bringing us one of the largest films at all times.
