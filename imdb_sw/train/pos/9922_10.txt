This is the most recent addition to the new wave of education as "Organization" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." His clarity is clear and unstable as the style of a breathtaking film of this well-organized element. The film will put the power of how our uncertain world is as we run towards the future of the environment at the speed of electricity - when it shows us the awesome beauty in following our progress. Really the amazing effectiveness that should be seen by all concerned about the world we leave our children. Bravo! N / A NB - this is also the only film (8) on Varsity (Toronto) movies with a logo that reads ... "To arrange group settings please contact ...." ... more commitment to the popularity and importance of this gem. <br /> <br /> My bet ... the priority of professional award for best documentation. </ OB101
