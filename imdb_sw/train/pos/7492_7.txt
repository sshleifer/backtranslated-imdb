Although it is not a horrible film in the traditional sense, this small film provides products. It seems a vampire is free in a small German town that kills its victims of their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his first responsibilities, is concerned to believe a modern killer is not a vampire runs amok. The only person who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray) girl's inspector and assistant laboratory for Doctor Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who seems to be a famous scientist going with a vampire theory. People accused of Hirm Gleib weirdo, played with his usual frenzy and Dwight Frye who seems to have much fun and his role. The film has a great sense of humor that helps reduce the amount involved in all killings. One part of the funny has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Aunt Ruth Bertin, thinking that Herman's old man did not turn on the bat but inside the dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye makes a good team of comedy. This budget movie brings elements from the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and Dr. Niemann using the power of making the somnambulist make his command, from "Frankenstein" to use human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the murder is believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl being a blood worker. The best combinations of the director Frank R. Strayer with a little stroke for the comedy for good quality. Concoction works. The restored version I saw translated used to increase the spiritual condition. So try to see this version as possible.
