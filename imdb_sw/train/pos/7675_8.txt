After watching the movie last night I was left with a feeling of despair facing the organizations that tried to tackle the film show. The level of adultery seems too great because it is difficult to see how it can fail without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> However, on inspection. Although it is a black movie and this uncomfortable relationship is a very complicated film, and I would like to say now it's fun. The film was well planned for time and performance with Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played very well. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have a little more understanding why Patrick feels that he helps Holly, but maybe the reason is as simple as he explains the character of Chris Penn. I can't explain here - go to see the film. This is a good film, which stimulates good ideas. I hope you get enough width to reach the audience of the best size and get more support for the K-11 Project.
