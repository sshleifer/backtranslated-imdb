Meteorite is located in the country of a small town, bringing a creature of jelly. Older farmer is attacked by a guest in his hand, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his partner Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) took Dr T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor takes care carefully, and asks Steve to check where they saw the old man. When Steve returns, he sees a blob killing a doctor. Steve and Jane are trying to warn the police and residents, but nobody believes on them, while blob inakfs many people, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "Blob" is a cult with a classic sci-fi. It is a small movie budget, with many ham and actors (except Steve McQueen), bad effects, but also very interesting, but very interesting. This was the first time I saw this normal (I saw a 1988 record by Kevin Dillon), and I recommend it to Steve McQueen's fans and 50-year-old B-fi movies. . My vote is seven. Headline (Brazil): "Bolha" ("Blob")
