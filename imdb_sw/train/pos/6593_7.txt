I have watched this film twice and I think it's very good for small devices used to create this film. (published in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of South African Indians of the Pre-Colubia Indians on the Polynesia islands through a raft that has fallen to a large balsa tree. This document follows Dr Heyerdahl and the staff as they choose balsa trees in Equidor and float with them down the river to the pacific for Peru's collection. They launch on the 101-day adventure of the power of their old raft to survive only by the means available to the local population. See for yourself, a real adventure!
