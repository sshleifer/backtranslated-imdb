I am not usually a lover of music, but if I had to choose what I would like it would be obvious to Oliver. This film has been made well, the characters are shown well, the dress is a spot on acting is good and the songs are good, be my favorite 'Through' ' '' '' and Ron Moody who gives a beautiful picture of Fagin.I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released at the end of 60 years but my sisters were, so for the last weeks I had to involve singing songs of blood, usually 'Who will buy my beautiful roses I knew all the songs before seeing the film. It is an unapproachable music, it stands alone. It is wrong with the book and I think it would have worked well if it would have been. I think Charles Dickens will be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to describe poverty in London, orphanages, workplaces and on what the poor had to use to survive, and the film shows th is very good. For another great reason to watch this film is the Bullseye of the old English Bull terrier, see its tall long legs, this was released out of breeding many years ago, they should be able to hunt up and down in order to get the specimen such as he, and he is how the English Bull Terrier would look at Victorian times. See he has blows {which maybe makeup] his face, Bill Sykes had perhaps used him for the fighting A dog or a blow to a rat.A Bull Victor Terrier had a number of records to kill in a hole of a mouse. For a good dog in any way, with a note he did not obey Bill Sykes after he killed Nancy, he is certainly not the head of the head Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a good Music to watch if you like music, and if you don't like music trying in any way, there is something for everyone in this film.
