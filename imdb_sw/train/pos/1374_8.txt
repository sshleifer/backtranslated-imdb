French film Ester Williams would like. But swimming evenly is just a hook for three girls' stories in Paris. There is no question where Scientific compassion exists as all boys are shown as "creatures" but in fact only 3 girls focus on, and at all times, with a few adults and other young people behind. Marie is a girl's stick, is not recommended, but has decided. He wants to have swimming and engaging with Floriane (the beauty of the Renascence quality for one inspector) and also an easy friend for Anna: not unattractive, but for him, the full time of his body was short, and now he is a young man in The body of women. What is going on is an independent journey without a road map but there is a glory of three that are not natural: where talk of courage and meaningless youth? When the dhouement was taking a breath, as well as a fun with Floriane for beauty, as well as a good union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed to be unusual, the Sciamma puppets.
