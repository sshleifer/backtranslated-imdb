There is a lot to love in this very small comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even have a short space, will find that there is more than a grain of truth in the additions to Mr. Blanding.Melvyn Douglas, with a great voice of comedic, both saying and acting as a lawyer of Blandings and the sound of the reason. Myrna Loy is also very good as a very sick woman. But the best performance is Grant. He is everyone in the United States, especially important during the release of this film, while the nation was finding a shortage of housing after the end of the war. The theme is universal, lack of money, work problems, fear of loyalty. That, it is carefully closed, but you must remember that this was a time when the world was only saved from a fierce battle, and wanted a good end. It is still important today, and I have to play a poor review that I see the current preference for sleeping on the ground, outdoor cries out. The view of the film is a player, and there are some big bits of comedy well, especially towards the beginning.It may have lost some social importance, about sixty years after release, is still a gem.
