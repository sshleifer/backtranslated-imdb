Q.E.D. was a series of television and it was one of the very few schedules! I testify that in this period of TIVO and recording equipment that would be better than it did in 1982. I look forward to the availability of its access to DVD! While it is true that it has some common and other television shows as Wild, Wild West, Bearcats and Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., all of which I am a great fan of, QED had the most intelligent quality. It was not so, however, the discussion was magic and the action was high. The show ran in the UK as Mastermind, and it had something of the BBC to feel, but with the best production standards than the BBC typically had at that time. <br /> <br /> I was nineteen years old this series had previously been running, and had a lot to do in my life to do during television. I remember my dear mother, however, calls me to remind me that Q.E.D. it was up, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. Good memory. Really, Q.E.D. it is a sad loss and, if it could be done in the same quality and values ​​today, I'd like to see it will make it come back.
