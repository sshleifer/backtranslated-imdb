I know the snobs of the film blows. But if you are looking for an amazing fun journey through the B-movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". A little bit sometimes, but its joints and more places do this; for this. John Hurt (God loves him), seems to be enjoying doing his role as a white evil slaver. Nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds the direction of the film that only pro if Hurt can offer. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you are wondering why both of them agree. as a child again in the nature and nature of the nature they give to them. <br /> <br /> I have never found a film that is very fun without getting to the preaching, or closing the movie to try hard. Not every movie must be soon "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was original. So it remembers that sometimes, movies are fun.It is not a social definition or trying to beat a political audience. But just to be happy to be alive and live at a time when our hero lives in celluloid conditions.
