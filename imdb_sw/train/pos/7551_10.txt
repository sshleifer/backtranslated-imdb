The best modern animations. This film explores not only the great world of modern animation and great effects, but the branches of human mind, soul, and philosophy. The story has a cat family, where the older sister dies, the younger brother sees this and saves her body, but when she wakes she is left without her soul. Thus, the two cats of the brothers begin their journey. I have described this journey for many things. The history of the world, the Bible, life cycle, and every time I look at discovering the themes and secrets and more. If you are not so in the psychological element then you will still serve him. Animation is better, and creative events will connect the screen. For example, in the rainy season, god ate soup from the earth, a wonderful and a bit of SNM for Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is completely treating anyone. <br /> PS- Not for children, free violence includes.
