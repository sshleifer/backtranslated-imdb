As a pagan, I must say this movie has little like the importance of Magickal. It is a "fun" film and is not meant to teach us anything but that love is the most powerful Magick, and never use it through control or revenge. That's the lesson everyone needs to learn, not just the pagans. That after saying, this film is amazingly written and interesting for Kim Novak and a respectable Jimmy Stewart. Hermione Gingold offers a stellar performance like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with a lot of films to mention but as Mrs Jane Marbles of "Killed and Death") was as strange as Mrs. Novak's girl who was not able to the amazing neighborhood of Queenie. Also star Jack Lemmon (good performance) and Jim Kovacs (very witches). Witches cannot cry, why they can not shed one tears because their heart is full of Magick. Don't have time to quiet things like love. "Queenie. Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. They are hidden in the craft of those of Craft, live among other people in New York as one of them, without causing an increased effect. , together comes Pastor "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a powerful, unresponsive, a volunteer businessman who is engaged to marry an old Gillian university student. <br /> <br /> For a bad position of space, he sees himself migrating to the Gillian building and "immediately" is beaten "with delight" with its charm and grace. With the use of Magick, with little help from Pyewacket (known by Gillian, taught by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian begins to work for a good man of a new dream to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control, nor hurt, and Gillian learns that the most difficult way in the best way is not just what he has to do with what he did but he needs to deal with the Shep for his guilt. <br /> <br /> From a key point; however, the movie takes the whole side: The effects are very dated to be a clean camp. Some of the conditions seemed to be beaten under a small house, but at least the characters were quirky and happy. <br /> <br /> For personal note, Pyewacket steal the show. Great cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a reminder of Trivia, this is the root for the preferred TV sitcom. This precedes Samantha and the original Darrin. All characters of the mark are and are registered. You have to look, to see it yourself. This is one of my favorites, and I am looking at many times. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
