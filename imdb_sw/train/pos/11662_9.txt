The Kells secret is one of the most beautiful, beautiful, and animated pictures that I have seen. Before watching this film, I was sure that nothing could give Up run for its money and that it was a shoo-in win in this category, but I found Kells a great contender. Kell's secret tells the story of the orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Abbot's Kell. Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps it is very sharp and involves more to strengthen the wall around the city from the attacks coming with vikings than he who promotes the imagination of the boy. When Brother Aidan (who looks at it as Willie Nelson) shows and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on his way to the forest and meets a beautiful forest girl named Aisling who takes his wife to her (and saves her life more than once). With the help of Aisling, she tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete a mysterious book which the story can turn dark into light.
