I must say that I had no idea that I was going to sit and watch this film. I think it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between class. But, once a television movie has found my interest. More importantly Helen Hunt kept my eye. In fact I wasn't a big fan of him before this film. I really liked Twister and As Good As It Finds. But, something about this movie has made me really. Now I would feel like a big fan. This movie comes with high scores from ... me. Make a chance, it won't stop.
