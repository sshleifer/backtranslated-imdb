One of the joys of collecting the recent collection of Bela Lugosi is getting to see movies that enjoy like Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi stand in an incoming movie in meteorites and radiation and when all science is quite amazing (especially the camera camera Karloff, like Janos Rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and laughable obvious, I did not worry in leasing because The movie is very enjoyable. Side effects are done well in time, acting is good, and there is a lot of power. It reminds me of the science of sci-fi and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray rifles and ignorance science. You must watch this film!
