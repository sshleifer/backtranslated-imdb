This movie was the best movie I ever seen. Being a LDS I strongly recommend this movie because you are able to feel more about Joseph Smith's life. Although movies have not been made by the most qualified actors are a wonderful and lively movie that can be appreciated and respected by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can witness that we all have had a change of heart. This movie allows people to understand how difficult life was for the prophet and what problems he had. After seeing this film, he did not have one dry eye in the room around. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have never been right since I saw it. I strongly recommend this film to everyone.
