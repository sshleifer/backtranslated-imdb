I was surprised when I saw this film being hit down ... I understand why some of you don't like this movie. His motion is slow, the character of Japanese films. However, if you are locked in a film like me, you will find this not quite a problem. I must say this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Will we?" is often considered to be the center of Japanese games. It's very different from the Web, e.g. Austin's or Horror Movies, which gag has been verified every few minutes. Rather, it is a strong heart, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes you feel "real". The program is direct but interesting. I was happy to see that Sugiyama (the main role) has discovered the meaning of life in play. Before watching the film I was a little saddened by the hard work of the school. I felt lost. However, this film has made me think of the bright side of life. I believed that I was in one of the Sugiyama boats; if he could find himself in his hobby, why can't I? It reminds me to "explore my future" and discover happiness in my daily life. It is important to note that artists are not professional players. While some of you can find play events are not perfect as you expect, I like it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to play as the film continues. Most of all, this film encourages the heart of the heart. As a comedy, it works perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. And yes Aoki is funny :-D
