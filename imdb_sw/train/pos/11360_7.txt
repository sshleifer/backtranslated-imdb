Chris Gerolmo kept not only to give us a kind of 'Jack-the-stripper' of the list of people killed: he described the psychological characteristics and the impact of the influence. Perhaps more due to the best performance of Stephen Rea playing against Donald Sutherland and good pity for both. Was it playing for these two parts? over all ?? which has made this film nothing more than just a bad news of the history of the Rostov butcher. Supporting executives, especially Max von Sydow, did their part well. Directly directed. Photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was closed to generate several events, but, in fact, due to the depth of information and clarity, we can completely forget these small trivialia. <br /> At once, made for the TV film from HBO has come to the trumps. Recommended, especially if you would like to analyze the features of the art and forget some of the morbid events? which, I am accelerating, is never available.
