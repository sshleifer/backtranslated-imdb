I show this film to university students in negotiations with the media rules because its subjects are insufficient: Why speak about injustice is important and can bring about the changes that have been made by those who have been oppressed. Why freedom of the media and freedom of speech are important for democracy. This is a necessary story to see how racism was explained to the world through Steven Biko's activism and Donald Woods journalism. It also provides an important subject of free speech: "You can blow the candle, but you can't blow the fire. In the fire it starts to catch, the wind will blow it up." (From Biko to Peter Gabriel, on a trembling tree).
