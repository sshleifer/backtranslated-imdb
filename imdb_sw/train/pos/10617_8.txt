Bach Barbara Bach enjoys Jennifer Fast, a television writer who travels with his staff (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to close the Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen and every hotel in the city is complete. They therefore move from town to remote area and take advantage of Ernest Keller's kind of friendly friend (Sydney Lassick). Do you not know, Ernest's lover and swift Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide the great secret in their cellar: sadness, demolition, wearing "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in a wonderful performance) that ultimately scares girls. Lassick is not a very large monster with a real monster in this exciting awesome movie. It builds slowly but surely with a sharp / peak fight, giving fear in small doses until the last hour. The park and the intervention jail - great echoes of "Psycho" here - are good settings. Above all, the plot of evil involves interfering with patricide, allowing the movie to take the quality of the real darkness. And yet it becomes poignant if we recognize Junior is no-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as a very victim like girls. The last shot is especially sad. It 's not visible "is a powerful flick of the most required of the discovery. <br /> <br /> 8/10
