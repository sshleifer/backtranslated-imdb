Fay Grim is a true example of what is called a completed puzzle puzzle. It has all the pieces of acting, leadership, story, and entertainment value. They are all connected together with the time done so to build the hub, Fay Grim. This film follows a mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son so that she does not become a father who ran away with the law and never lost it. Recent communication of CIA Fay to follow the desire to get 8 papers of her husband Henry. These journals were filled with overtime in CIA and its involvement with the country and their government actions. Fay is sent to get this newsletter, to return his brother to prison, and to be sent to a cat-and-mouse run around Europe to save these papers and learn the secrets of her husbands who never knew. Parker Posey was ready to become an actor who I loved after looking at OH in Ohio and Best in Show. He brought the welfare of these two comedic tasks, but Fay Grim was a completely different role with two other movies. Posey made me believe what is happening on the screen, I heard him, buried him for him, and I wanted to know more. He reminds you when he is screwed and when he is away you can not stop thinking about what is happening to him. I haven't seen any other original work with the author / director Hal Hartley but I believe I will look at some of his original films if it's a good half as Fay Grim was. If you decide to make a new movie choice when you decide to rent a movie or a DVD purchase I would like to encourage you to choose Fay Grim. If you have a common sense about how the film should be you will enjoy this film very much.
