Acting is very good, but for the people of this area up to 80 years and is now the engineers of Detroit cars, this is a good movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier to make this film even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno was showing her age last night on Show Tonight! He looks good here ... 17 years ago. The opening part, and the race of drag on what appears to be Woodward Ave was good. Leno also owns bad cars ** now, it would be good to see a review of this and its modern collection. I am sure Vette that was hit in the opening area was his own car. <br /> <br /> Normal 80s Style. Watch and enjoy. No computers are generated!
