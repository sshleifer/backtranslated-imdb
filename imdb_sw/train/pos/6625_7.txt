If you have ever seen the trailer of the film "The Recruit" by Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never see the film. Unfortunately, Renaissance has been the manufacturers of tractors such as revelatory. <br /> <br /> The story of Renaissance is about investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The layout is the future of Paris, and elements of false science include all around. A special thing about the Renaissance, though, is its fashionable view, and not its story. Renaissance is a 3D animation, like the Last Fantasy, but it is made very much in black and white colors with different variations. As a result it seems strange (though the 3D animation problems of humans still appear from the time of stopping: a little movement of robots, small wood acting, etc.) As a very popular film proposed, the Renaissance succeeds with wonderful listeners, especially visually. Stories and writing, however, are not the same as the standard of quality as illustrations. It's not a bad story (and maybe, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was to me). But it's a story that is not very natural, and villages in corny. A few discussion articles were a good pain, and writing to be seen as the first initiatives. <br /> <br /> I'll assure you the Renaissance for friends. It is different from anything I have seen before, with eyes, and I believe that its nature alone makes valuable experience. Also the story of watching, even if it can't.
