I was watching several days of this summer movie film, the last season was just two events on the film. The area was Sylvan Lake in Black Hills. Bring the car, stop the car etc.. So the young people of Dakota expected to see the film and were not discouraged. The domestic pigs were beaten and the bullets were real. (that's Doris, animals hurt when photography) I think the end was missed by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great western / social message from 50 years. This should be in the same class as the Noon's top western game or used as social information like Blackboard Jungle or Rebellion without reason for 50 young people.
