This is the best performance of John Thaw where he succeeds in eliminating any behavior of the Morse Auditor's character and brings the perfect efficiency of Tom from the book pages on the TV screen. This is a well-developed production that continues his family to look at the vibe despite a special age of maturity as the second world war and physical abuse suffered by the child. It is the relationship between Tom and Willie's little heart and spirit of this story. It is a touch and good to see this bond between a little boy saved from London by an old grumpy man who has survived to develop - a true relationship with grandparents. It is a pity that this story was not made by a big budget and a more established director like on a large screen, not displayed once or twice every 10 years on Sunday afternoon. Based on proper guidance, John Thaw would be celebrated around the world and awarded many awards for his good performance in this film. A good actor and a great responsibility that should be respected than it was then.
