The story of Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark News of the Religious Spirit, apart from being one of the most popular wuxia pian films made, is a beautiful story of love and romance with a very popular martial arts film that should be in every colleague The film. Hong Kong starring Leslie Cheung has a tax collector who uses the night at the haunted temple. As he sat in the temple, he met with the colored characters that included Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Devil of the Tree, and the beautiful Lit Sin, who played with Joey Wong. To redeem him from the edge of the Evil Black, he must wake up his body and travel down to win the most powerful demon. Most things cannot say about this film. Planning is perfect, with a great mix of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the end fiverishly paced should leave with little chance of breathing. Chemistry between Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung is a shocking surprise (whose last job ended most recently) allows the viewer to feel both. Indeed working for all is very bad and life-giving, I would say this is one of the most fun experiences I have ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in its amazing Swordsman Yin exhibition. Her persona on top of the surprise of the casting of the hell that has lost evil causes a good time of humor and traditional HK. Wonderful color, eye-colored film, and well-designed pieces of Ching Siu Tung all around this amazing film. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
