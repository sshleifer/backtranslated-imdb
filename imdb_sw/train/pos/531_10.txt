This film has a very good sequence to open. I have seen this movie for the first time last week, since then every day I see the opening and all the time I feel as happy as I felt the first time I heard David Niven speaking the eternal words from Sir Walter Raleigh Pilgrimage: Give me a stool for a quiet seat My staff of faith walk up, My joy of joy, an everlasting food, my bottle of salvation, my glorious gown, the true gage of hope; And so I'll take my trip (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be truism to say the life of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressurgurger is the right to have an amazing solution? Because they had already been accepted in the Paradise of Witches long before making this film. <br /> <br /> I think two of them are faced with an attempt at Doomsday and saying to unchalantly to God anger: I beg your pardon, sir. So, do you want to know what we have done during our lifetime? Well, you will see: We have written and directed: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes? What? you think that Mr. enough? It is clear that these two great artists had already fulfilled their obligations with God, Nature Muse or Anything you can call during the Life and Death Problems. The fact that the lives of others will be correct for their actions can not be obvious to everyone, however I feel my life would mean I have never done anything else to see this movie. Of course the old people will be tempted to say: They have no movies like this again. They'll be a little wrong; did not make movies like this in the past or. <br /> <br /> I have been a keats here, but I predict his words: Something of beauty is eternal happiness.
