I recently got a copy of 5 dollars on a video store, and wiped it out. While music and (open) graphics are not on my favorite levels of series, More Mind Mind, it is still entranced to one place: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice". Music is brilliant, and the feeling feels real. The site of the site of the Odyssey website has no stories or music, unfortunately.
