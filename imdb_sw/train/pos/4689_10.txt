I fully agree with the comments so far. I remember this document as one of the most amazing and the knowledge I have ever seen. As mentioned earlier, I remember that I started looking, I think it was just another natural study - interesting, not special, but I was wrong. Not just the story of a wonderful colony, but I remember music as a great part of the appeal. If I remember correctly, it was a natural American pipe (similar to the end of One Flew on the Cookoo nest). I, too, have been looking for a copy. This is needed to look for anyone, but especially school. It should be restored again.
