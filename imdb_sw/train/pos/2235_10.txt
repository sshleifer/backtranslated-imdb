I loved this film because it is a true story set in Amazon, part of the world that is always interesting. I believe the refined form of the book was published in the "Digest Reader" after a true event occurred. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "child of the boomer," the character and the executive is of my day, and for this reason I associated with the film. I also believe that the movie is important for teaching the survival skills as the observer considers the behavior of river crossing and coastal settlements where he can get help, along with other survival methods. The most important thing was his desire to live and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers learn something from them, in addition to seeing it for entertainment. I would like a movie to be opened on VHS and DVD just as I would like to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown more often in satellite movie stations.
