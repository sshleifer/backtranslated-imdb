I didn't watch the film yet, but I can't wait to see it! It looks very interesting and powerful. It was one of the most fascinating tricks I have ever seen: the questions that happened have prevented me from really making me think, the only way of boxing game as an example of "war within" ... thank God man is hitting another angle with something of boxing. This movie seems to be clean and wise. And the actor is very hot. I was very excited about a short piece of film with an actress from Rocky, very clever movies. I thought that the topic of the selected-winning topic was the problems of childhood-time, and God knows many people need. You bring.
