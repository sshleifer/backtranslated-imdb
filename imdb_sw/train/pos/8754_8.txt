I watched this film 11 years ago and my company and my best friend. I was given my teeth of judgment so that I would not feel very well. I ended up enjoying a lot of time. It is a hard look if you take an account that deals with friendships, unnecessary betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking, and the worst situation that is involved in living outside the prison. <br /> <br /> Acting is on the first level. Two women I love many stars and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as beautiful and charming as always when Kate Beckinsale has a very hot and will give good performance. Bill Pullman is also good and reflects its history. <br /> <br /> There are many conspiracy that comes from digging and making it an interesting experience. Plus shows hard times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is a supported movie. Not many films like this have come in recent history. Should make you more accessible ...
