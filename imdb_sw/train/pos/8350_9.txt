Like the film we are looking for implausible if you always dedicate the adventures of 2 shooting characters. But when C + J tries to sex for a girly trip back to childhood, this pair happens in their condition even even to detect homoeroticism. Most of the sex they get from anxiety or unintentional and, however, despite their deep PC behaviors, everyone emerges exciting. Like C + G, in this way all remain innocent, rebellious against modern, bourgeois, barrier. If someone else has said, I do not want to know these 2 and it is a little miracle that their journey brings scenes of many comedy and a very little catastrophe (and what there is that he can not put under their door) and so for that reason, it has left me deceived but with sweet taste in the mouth. I say that only French can stop the film like this. And that's part of their thinking.
