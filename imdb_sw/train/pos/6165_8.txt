Yes, other plots are very hard to follow, and Bill has a tendency to get violent, but it's actually showing, trying to miss. Most of these events are exciting and long, and acting is very good, although I miss miss Taylor Taylor as Gina Gold Inspector and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer past events in recent times, and it is embarrassing that this program is now after water, as I found it easy to see when it was 8.00 hours. However, why I love Bill this is because it is not just interfering, but supporters at the end make the next section impossible. It is true though, that it is more spiritual than it was, but I like this program as a program that does not attempt to concentrate very seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
