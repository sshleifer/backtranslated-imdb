I, as many fans of fear, have had a strong federal budget big budget remake Hollywood and MTV high school trasher tripe for the last 20 years. Here, finally, it's a movie of a kind of horror of nature that affects all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actor, want vampires, want cool weapons, want cool cars and want blood, lots of lots, and bucket load - you have found. To fight against the fight and the role of helping from the king of fear of the hammer Stephanie Beacham, this is a very strange thing. Although it is a low budget, to decide to use 35 mm stocks and to increase the impact of CG better in combination, director James Eaves has created something that is much more sensitive. <br /> <br /> Must be afraid of old school fans.
