I couldn't take my eyes away from this film when it showed on the cable. Talk and dress are of the quality associated with ease and porn-based. In this case a suitable plot is used as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings and nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Hindi TV, however.) Once Brigitte Nielsen did business in its future pastor (so mayor!) For the top fade we recall from Beverly Hills Cop II I made a good ID on it. This game will not be unlikely to enjoy anyone who loved the early 90s player or Paul Verhoeven song. What? Can we add a "bad-is-good" label?
