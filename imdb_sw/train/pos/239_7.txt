I watched this with my girlfriend at the time and I can say I didn't have a really good time because I didn't know about Ned Kelly or her story. <br /> <br /> But since this is biopic, it is important at least to know what to expect from behavior. I don't know how these events are told to be true, or if everything is false. But the way Ned Kelly is shown as a hero and a fighter warrior actually makes me believe everything is true. I don't think he is shown as a criminal or thief, but that's my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a strong Western movie for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is good as always with sexy watts Naomi loves screenshots. <br /> <br /> Make this film possible if it climbs on the cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could suggest.
