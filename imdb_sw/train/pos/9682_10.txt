I really liked this movie! It was very good! This movie is told by the parrot, the views of Paulie. Paulie is given a little girl Marie, as now. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and become best friends. But Paulie telling Marie to fly, it falls and the birds are sent. At that time the adventure begins. Paulie goes in many ways to find her way back to Marie. This movie is sweet, pleasant, touching, sad, and more. As I watched this film first, it made me cry. A brave flight and encourage to go and find Marie at all times, was very touching. I must say that the end is sweet and sad, but you will need to look to find out how it goes. In the end, the host tries to help her, after hearing her story. Will he find Maria lost for a long time or not? Find out when you look at this beautiful, hot film. You'll have to touch your heart.
