Nina Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 movie of the night and also star Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film is facing. It can be standing to be fifteen minutes good for half an hour again. When I was growing, Foch was put on television, playing a neurotic woman, wife and husband of cheating, nervous decline. He was one of the main teachers of the work in Los Angeles. Here, he is a very good ingenuity to play the title of the title. Julia responds to the secretary and is immediately employed by Ms Hughes and her son Ralph. Does she know little - though we learn once - that the agency agent is ahead, set up to find a good woman just for this job, a single woman and no partner. <br /> <br /> It is alive - in the state; once Julia comes home, she is a doctor, and when she wakes up, she said it is Mrs. Hughes and she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. The low but still entertainment budget - other things, especially at the end, happens very quickly, that's why I said that movie is too short. However, I recommend.
