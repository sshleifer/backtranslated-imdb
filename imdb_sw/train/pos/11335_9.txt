Jake's clothing has the emotional capabilities of Kramer against Kramer with the thought of the Labyrinth of the Pan. Even the beginning special effects appears to give the nod to the Labyrinth of the Pan. But this is a story taking place in modern times, not in the war sixty years ago and through it has more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, a child alone, by alone alone summer vacation, with his family falling. It's a horrible movie like Others with Sense's Sixth, awesome movie for someone who thinks. If you are looking for a slasher film, this will not be your cup of tea but if you are looking for a whole story that touches and insists on a good acting, this is a film for you. In the observations I saw, I swear there is one time that all the listeners were crying. I strongly recommend catching this film.
