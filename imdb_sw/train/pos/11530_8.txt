A group of friends decides to take a camping trip to the desert-and find themselves being taken and killed by a wonderful killer in a black pick-up truck. "Mirage" is clearly led to "Duel" and "Craven" of Spielberg and "The Hills Have Eyes" However, the fence of the slasher provides a lot of violence and violence. and the tree and then his feet are broken when the chain comes out of the truck. is also a bit of doubt and some exciting stalk-and-slash system. Acting is good disabling and the script is quite weak, but the film is fast-paced and amazing.BGSteers who play the villain are threatening the right.The desert areas provide a certain situation and the gore is rather powerful. The bottom budget gives this one out of 10.
