It is interesting how the research train can intervene. I began to look at the article about the Christian "Gates" in Central Park. The article said Maysles were the writers of the Christian film for years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their work. I believe one of them has gone but another still plays Cristo and Jean Claude movies in their creation stage. Gray Gardens seemed very interesting. Video Center, in Boulder CO, is a place to look for to hide or offbeat and of course they had stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women living in the past, and oh what was the greatest in the past. Edith had lived well, born Bouvier, married well, had several good relationships and became a singer when she was in forty years. Her daughter Edie was the beginning, fashion style and had many fibers. She was never married and at some time in thirty years she had gone home to return. She seems to have a neurological condition. He is very surprised about things. It's a shadow of the world living in though, because Jackie O. came and produced a place so her aunt and cousin would not be expelled. It is the house of the room 28 which is worn and exhausted. But, in the film you will see a clean color on the walls. If you are looking carefully at the newspaper you see it was a very bad mess. Edie dress comes with a very cunning and creative. The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to go nude, but she has no movie. Edith was very good and you can see the shadow of her beauty yet as she sings "Tea for two". Edie was also beautifully in her day and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat runs behind Edith's portait says, "at least one does what they want"!
