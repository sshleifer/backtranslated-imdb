Adam Jones has a good sense of humor. Nothing I liked about this film. The Eyed Cross was shot well. Adam does a great job, not only to develop the main characters, but also the small characters. Eyed Cross gives hope on the low-budget film out there. That you don't need to use a lot to create something to watch. There is something to love for everyone. If you have a good partner. if you ever took a dork at high school. if you rides anywhere in the city. if you have any kind of humor you will always like this film. This is a kind of film that will be around for a long time and regenerated after Adam make a big name. I expect Adam's future projects.
