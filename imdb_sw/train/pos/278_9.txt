When I say, Clive Barker's immunity is the best game you have ever done. I have played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the evil games of the Dead and Castlevania but none of them has taken the glee in which this game holds its terrible things. Barker is good for what he does, which connects fear to our world, and shows whether his hand is open everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is located in the game as one of the main characters. With a beautiful picture and a sufficient atmosphere to shake the stick, Undying is a game to beat in my books as the best head of awesome. I just want this to be done with the console system but not the best sales of the PC has led to one in the bud.
