Okay, here is my personal list of top Nicktoons that show it today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Increased / Spongebob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My Life Like a Young Robot <br / > <br /> 3. The Player of the Game <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> See the word and letter only? That means this is Nick's show I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon, and Waffles - who get in a strange and realistic situation, due to trying to join a sleepy party Human Kimberely for root beer to save the planet of slugs from the evil space. This is one of the Nick's show that you will have your quick bone or later! The theme of the theme is interesting and memorable. Voice vendors - including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield" franchise - brings characters into a new life with very much quirky creatures. Stories are fun (the events of the fans will be "King of All Roots" and "Gordon's Claw Claw"). And all humor has been done in a certain style of Jimmy Earthworm. In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the series of Nicktoons, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very popular all over the world for just 3 or less seasons.
