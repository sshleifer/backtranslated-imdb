This is my most popular movie of all time. That is because they are not afraid to enter into a particular political subject (such as the commitment of women and female obedience) that some of the most popular films are very worried to touch. Nothing seems to be a barrier to this film as an independent director without any stories given because it can mislead the viewer. However, I don't think anything was done here because of the value of shock or to attack anyone. Sean Young returns for better performance and courage. Most business managers could not take this position or would ask for a major change of script before accepting. Other members organized to do good work as well. <br /> <br /> What! Did you see that this film has not been seen on the pay cable since it should run for a short time after entering the movie? What? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it is not appropriate for the political situation today. It seems very strange that some premium ways now carry porn-soft (that's close to and hardcore porn) but it won't take a common movie like "Love Crime". Sadly, although this film is only 11 years old, perhaps it is not available today. <br /> <br />
