I never met one person (out of hundreds) who hated this film. Bet that anyone voting is a minor fraud, or a victim of one. This film has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go see "Laputa". It is not my favorite movie, but my favorite IS dominated by one person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this is the top five of my top five. And I found LOT of the movies.
