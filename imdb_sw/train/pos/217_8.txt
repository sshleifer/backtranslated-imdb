SUNSHINE BOYS was a 1975 mirror player for Neil Simon's play for the retired vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who were very broken and were asked to reunite another time with a special television or something like that . The problem is that the two still hate each other and do not want to do anything for each other. Richard Benjamin looks like Matthau's nephew, an exhibition agent who has been given a great responsibility to make this reconciliation a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a beautiful valentine and a kind of entertainment that has forgotten ... vaudeville and works especially for one of the best Neil Simon screens and the best works of Matthau, Burns, and Benjamin. Burns won Oscar The best Assistant for this, but I think Matthau is walking away with this film and its improper performance like Willy Clark. Matthau was elected to the Best Actor but did not have a chance to oppose Nicholson for NCHI in CUCKOO; however, in another year, this was the performance of Oscar. Matthau commands screens and no false information in this good time performance. The area where he tries to explore the chip chip commercial and can not find the name of the right product is classic. SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm comedy and winning Neil Simon which shines thanks to the impossible chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
