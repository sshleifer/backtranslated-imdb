As romantic comedies go, this was good and winning. I thought that writing might have the power to build the last relationship a bit more, but that's not a big step to stimulate. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf provide the best performances and are as charming as they are. These are two of my dear partners, and I was just happy to see them moved as a romantic guide. I hope to see them running more projects soon. Overall, this film will not change your life, but it's sweet, warm and winning. It's not a bad thing to be at all.
