The first 50 minutes of this film were boring. It focused on personal problems Doyle was, including his sick wife, death threats and fans, the pushy publisher and feelings of guilt about his sick father. Although these studies had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more interested in the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were better. Finally we appeared in the head of Doyle, how he made Holmes and why he had 'killed' Holmes. Actors are the best. Including an exciting Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, the role of compulsory by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as an 'example model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Places are good, especially on the TV film and the camera function is good. If the first 50 minutes was the last 40 minutes this would be a little hub.
