This movie, when it appears to be the basis of a similar film in 1951 released by MGM and the star of Janet Leigh, is still a good film. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox, under the manager of his fortune to his baseball, for life. For this film being "taken", how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his step experience experience and shows through his displays on screen, good actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from Sun), Brenda Fricker ( Interesting and good Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes even he is good at this film), Matthew McConaughey (stole a show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be important in this film, but he got an exposure), Adrien Brody ( what I said about Matthew McConaughey may be similar to Adrien, but part of Dazed and Mixing), other character actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) ) and an old veteran in one of his final exhibitions, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels), and all others are doing a good job, with a great story that raises good to anyone, I don't care what a mistake is the depression you have. I loved this film as a child, and brings memories when I look at it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend to any parent who wants something that their children have not seen, and everyone else, for that.
