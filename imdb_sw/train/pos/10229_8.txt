YETI deserves a rating of 8 stars because it is one of the worst movies made. I saw it at midnight observation at L.A. and people were screaming and cheerful in frustration - this film is one of those movie trainwrecks where you think you can't find any guest and then it doesn't! Millionaire who financially donates Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman all poured into a patient fit suits - a guy playing scientist is one of the worst actors ever seen on the screen - and yes, there is a boy silence (who sorta looks like a girl) and he silenced since he survived the plane crash and killed both his parents (hmmm- maybe a cure for a child?). Then this Italian hottie girl seen by Yeti (once she thaws - which takes forever) - and she is once in her love - what is one of the hysterical things about the film is that this giant yeti make "closet closet" at her - it's like a great Barry White trying to stretch a groupie. In fact, once a big Yeti takes a hottie and has it against his chest - he accidentally touches the nipples Yeti and yes, the film takes time to show the big gray nipples to get it! Yikes of all YIKES! Plus there is a dog collie in it because Italian manufacturers must have heard that American viewers like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get Lassie - there is also this insane area where Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the bones of big fish and using it hairy Italian hair "Gee, thanks Yeti - now my hair is soft and smells like a dead river." You are much better. "This film is more amazing than what Ed Wood could pick up. If you are a fan of an old cinema - look for this baby out."
