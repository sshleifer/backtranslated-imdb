It's been a time since I watched this film, and the series, but now I'm enjoying my memory! This was a very interesting movie according to the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were a few together. Bo and Luke Duke helped Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg causes Dukes away from his farm, Bo and Luke move around the construction area of ​​Hogg and get coal samples. Recently they know that Mr. Hogg will hit my flat-cut Hazzard, unless Dukes can stop him, with the help of their good cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds was not correct for part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was a very bad way. Other than that, I strongly recommend DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
