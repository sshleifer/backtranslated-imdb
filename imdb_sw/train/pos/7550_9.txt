Wow. The amazing 'journey' that has tons of super-surreal pictures, dark and black, a wonderful sense of how the cartoon animals should see the world. It has been a group of very distant characters who beat and talk to the history. As with all the fantasy, the plot of the lost is secondary to visual images and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister when they meet death, flood, water elephants, fish fish and pigs that fish. I have never heard, but now I love it - perhaps because it reminds me of the work of the American pencil; Bill Plympton. It is a good pleasure for fans of unusual things, strange and have been glued on the screens for fear I would like to miss something amazing. Simply put, it's 'Hello Kitty' without 'o'.
