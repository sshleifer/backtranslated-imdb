Let's do the first things directly: Zombies are not so the film manufacturer can have them WALK, RUN, Hell even FLY if he wants to. That's what makes this original movie of Zombie very good. Everything they did was very natural. I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think zombies should grow just like Romero's usual film, sometimes the zombies are not so the film manufacturer can make a movie of zombies if he wants. The zombies in this film all look very nice but usually not a decay crop since they had lost! They are a good mixture though and full of cut-blood faces. One of the most cool cases is a half-cat cat. It seemed to be so true my daughter cried when she saw it. This movie got a very good review at Fangoria and Rue Morgue to make me go to see. I am glad I listened. They are always right when you come to a fan of a real fan. 10 out of 10! Go hire!
