For all the districts who think 1.This was the television 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve the Oscars. This was one of the best Academy awards because 1. It was the time of history to have a "black" actress awards for the best actress of our black sisters overlooked by the academy for many years. Being honest I was leaving the academic rewards because of the lack of distinction between the players or the electorate. The university had a lot of opportunity to vote black artists who were brilliant in movies such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but did not have 2.Berry eligible to have Oscar no university competition under the pressure of voting for a long time that worthy actors should be neglected by many academy who are white voters yes yes Nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge! but it was when black people were accommodated in these awards shows. For Washington Washington academy he had his time after losing justice to MalcomX. It is all you who think running is not a matter "perhaps white people" in the film industry, too. most of the talented talented talented talents have been reduced to the size of the stereo made by white people who do what they think is black or do not exist "Angela basset". I don't expect many white people to understand any of this because they didn't have to deal with anything.
