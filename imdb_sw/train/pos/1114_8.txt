By the time I remember being completely surprised and amused with this movie. I called it a very important movie I saw in ten years, and I found myself to be people who said things like that. Bernhard has a common diagnostic notebook. And he has created the kind of bitterness that we all had, in the view of the adult world. Both together offers an amazing combination that can be too edgy to a particular audience. (Hi Skip.I wish you were not my brother so I could ****!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bernhards find yourself after returning LA from New York, the results of trying to immersive people The range (all of which is appropriate for the wrong) for our amusement, but for a sufficient number of them involve the rejection of the system of "black color" which the actual barometer of its transfer is like black culture agrees. (It's been a little time Nina Simone comes to mind and has a beautiful black girl who loved the movie). The black black girl attends the exhibition, and seems to be approving Sandra's delays, but eventually she rejects. As Catholics consider themselves fortunate to suffer for Christ, here Sandra presents herself as a suffering in black culture where she desires a place; if he loves his eligibility and his refusal. It is the only value system involved in the film world, out of the ground mix of Bernhards. For a nation whose main issues are discrimination and money, it is a pleasure to see one of the 2 topics conducted at the atypical way.
