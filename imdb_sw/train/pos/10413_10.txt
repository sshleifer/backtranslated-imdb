I grew up with this as my favorite movie all the time. Special effects are wonderful for the era, and won the prize. I can remember the conversation if I would like to hear yesterday. It's just a great adventure, timeless. Music is Miklos Rosza, who is the best movie history. Sabu is a thief. Conrad Veidt is a great villain. I have a copy that can reach, for the next trip under memory memory. Who there! Rex Ingram wants out of his genii bottle!
