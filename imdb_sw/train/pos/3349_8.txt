Someone with Guns is forgotten very much now, but led to a small media storm back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned both Jett Rink into the Giant (which actually written for him and which finally reworked) by Charles Laughton's target version of Dirty and The dead make it instead. In spite of obvious production problems and severe lighting that often makes Mitch and Jan Sterling in uncomfortable tones, it is the western western which most of the stands and compares its original blood to the Moon as its 'city' sets sets in the city that had no chance to grow before running with local badmen before turning? probably? be as close as bad as the people they send. Surely his way of dealing with the news of death in the family? burn the bottom saloon and lead his manager in trying to kill him? does not obey much courage in its stability. With a beautiful script and amazingly amazing surprising size from the irritating irregularity but here it has hit Henry Hull, it also has an amazing early score of Alex North, which also includes early workout for one of its emotional emotional cues which later turn into Spartacus.
