The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that would be used to do the best and direction (or at least music!). However, with Walt Whitman's success, it is worth 10. The previous view calls for a movie, however, I think it's a simple case of not seeing a forest for trees. The creators of the movies seemed more interested in getting the story out there than having a film shiny film. And for this, I praise you - the fact that it is not normal to show Whitman's life as well. This film is more documentary than to act. In order to be fascinated by such stories, when you hear a few times about these kinds of stories that create the current mental health day, it is the most important thing. I found it very enjoyable history.
