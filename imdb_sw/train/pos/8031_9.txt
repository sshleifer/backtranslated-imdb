This is one military concert that I love so much! Tom Berenger plays the defense defender Thomas Beckett. This marine is not sluggish, in your face, and no questions asked someone of the kind who gets a job. There is Billy Zane ("Phantom" and others) who play Richard Miller, a former SWAT D.C., who works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs bureaucracy office? I am not! When these two are arranged, sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches the boy's office on how it works. When the other sniper blows, it wits against wits, cats against the mouse, gunman vs gunman. And while the season sniper is caught, it's on Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when it is similar to Beckett, took orders from anyone but himself, plays with the law and not the book, and mutual respect is given outside politics. Movie was hit automatically. See. Vote 4 out of 5 stars.
