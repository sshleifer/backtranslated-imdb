If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This film has sweet tunes, MJ like a robot, and a crazy plot, assisted. I remember, many nights, using this high-quality film at the university, and reflecting on anyone who decided to have green light this piece of ignorance. There are many songs. Lots of play. There are many songs during play. MJ kills as you expect when it comes to this issue. But there is more than this film. There is soil. There are children with oil (soil). There is anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael jackson fights in the dance off (open soil too). There is Joe Pesci too (not soil). RIP - We love you Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.
