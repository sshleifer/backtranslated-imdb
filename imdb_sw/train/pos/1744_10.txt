Several years ago many studios of serial films were shown on movie movies between the actual features and Newsreel of current events, with cartoons, especially Saturday afternoon. (The parents loved it) "The return of Chandu" was part of the 12th where Chandu, (Bela Lugosi), "Mr. Wong", 34 is a magician of natural nature and travel to the island of Lemuria to save the Egyptian king, (Nadji) Maria Alba, "Emergency House of Anger", '43. Princess Nadji has been taken captive by the magic ritual of Ubasti, who believe that she is a reincarnation of their old dead god Ossana. The 12-year serial comes back on time and is well fed, considering we are talking about 1934!
