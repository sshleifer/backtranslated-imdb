Anyone who has lived for years of Nerds and Girlpower revenge will enjoy this film. It is one of the films that provide everything you want in the "movie break" PLUS enjoys a kind of college film. It is funny, it has been killed by Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophia Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Author / Actor Rachel Dratch is a comic specialist and Sophie Monk is a very good villain. Wilson Phillips! MY GOD! (I just repeat it now ...) It will be alive with girls who like Miranda July but they feel like eating ice cream and pretending is dumb.
