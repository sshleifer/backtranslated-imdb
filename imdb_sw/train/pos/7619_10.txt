It's amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Explosion. Complex. Epic. Words that touch only the tip of the ice in the shape of the main story that is told. <br /> <br /> From acting under the normal visual effects, LOST is an important show on television for science fans access, fantasy, action, adventure, and lots and lots of secrets. Every member who has been beaten has been chosen well, and is good in their roles, that you may hate them, or hate them, or they want to be dead. <br /> <br /> Vision to see, when used (which is common) is actually quite done based on the normal production of exhibitions. That is "monster smoke", for polar bears, LOST is reliable in terms of candy-eye. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story goes, nothing can compare with this great controversy this show has made viewers like I endure. From the end, proceeding is very close, the characters are created, and the progressive story provides the answers to many of his favorite questions. <br /> <br /> Total, nothing wrong in LOST. It makes for a great television / sci-fi what the demonstration of the demonstration performed by the comedy: it has set a bar. I highly recommend those who are patient, educated, and dear every time of the journey, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this show.
