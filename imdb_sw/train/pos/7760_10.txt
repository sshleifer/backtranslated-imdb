Douglas director Sirk marks again with this, the mistress of all non-working family members. This sushi, a saga soup is a jewel, which combines all the elements of Sirk's soap and strategically strategically on one movie. "Written in the Wind" is very clear for the series of the 1980s "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is a common feature of the future nightclub. Lauren Bacall, mysteriously and secretly, plays Lucy Moore, secretary of New York City who is oil oil, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Neither do they know for both, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) also likes and calm secretary, but of sexy. They all return to the family home of Kyle in Texas where we meet with her white slut-of-sister sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone on Oscar side). Give it! Sparks begin to fly - from romances to fight, this is a camping trip. Not only Mitch should fight the feelings of his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can't have her true love who is Mitch. Above all, Kyle is learning that she is not capable, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is a clean soap and clean melodramatic entertainment. What? Can't love it? This film features one of the most popular Universal films and one of Sirk's best works. Some of the discussions are the most dramatic and visible examples that are healed in every way - the wind theme is better. Sent is good, although Bacall is not used even though receiving bills on the back of Hudson. The lack of Oscar's stack was reported to be destructive. He thought this his best performance and it seems to be no fun to lose. And he did a good job as a drunkard. What a wonderful movie! This film proves what I have been investigating for many years - Sirk is a master of ordinary melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
