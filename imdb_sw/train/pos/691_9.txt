I'll come clean. The only reason I got even about this DVD is because Dominic Monaghan is a good actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it would be ... different, maybe in a very good way. But I was wrong. After reading a few outdoor reviews, I was very excited about seeing it. I sent for my copy quickly and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I had no desire. The film follows Jack, a scholar who is often beaten by the conditions that cause him to doubt the truth, and what is on his head. I will not give you what is happening, but I will tell you that sometimes the film may be afraid of the originality. <br /> <br /> Redirect is fantastic, taking into account what is important for stories without letting you lose any entertainment or time caused by thought. All of them, I give this great 9 out of 10 films, by going beyond what I thought that any short could reach.
