The Castle of Man is a good example of the Pre-Code film. It involves true events and characters who enjoy and imperfect. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free spirit without a dime in his pocket. He is doing a job of unusual work and traveling to a new city when he gets tired of his surroundings. One night, she meets Trina, the beauty at any rate that is cool and alone. He has refused to decide to commit adultery so he does not eat for several days, but the two are taken very well and form a relationship. His free spirit causes him to leave, so life is stone, but there is a true spark between the two, even if they live in the river and the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the biggest actors of cash screens. Its characters are amazing and interesting. We can see his thoughts on his face, and make him easy to recognize, even if we believe he has a bad habit. Teenagers are great in pre-code films. Her character is very good but it can't be perfect, it makes her better. <br /> <br /> Code items include skin entry, pre-marriage, and crime.
