Doctor Mordrid is one of the films that have never been under the radar, but it is absolutely essential. It is true to remind me of the past periods from 30 and 40 years. Unfortunately, due to the sacrifice of the sacrifice that is so many of the family audience - which is unfortunate, because without this this could be Harry Potter-style magicfest that children would eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are the best - I didn't know if Mrs Nipar had no desire for A-picture on this film, she was very trusted. No, seriously! Otherwise - it's a shame they did not have bucks to license Dr Strange, because I think this might be a kiddie total of phenomenon.
