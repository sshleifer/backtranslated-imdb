I saw the trailer of this movie in 70 years when I was rare 16 when I watched another film. Oh !!!! how exciting I and my best friends were. we couldn't wait a month or so until it came. I saw this film 17 times that year on the playground. I love, love, love. Kris is perfect for film. She is bright and kinda trashy but also embarrassed and sure to Babs and it's very pleasant to look at again. While they are singing every time on the label and she has a very different raspy voice and full details from her but I always thought this was one of the best pictures in the film. The way to look at him is very proud. I was able to watch this film every day. We tried to wear as an est-she I even had a long sweater with a cap that was like that wore. this came on television when I got my daughters to look at they were young and liked it. Maybe it's just right that I had been caught in it when everything was unknown. It is always there I am in tears even today.
