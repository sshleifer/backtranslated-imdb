It is not a film taken seriously, but a small film however. It is definitely not a piece of fluff. Acting, IMO, is the best. One of these films you can't go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes near the cable. As an old friend. Really worth seeing if you get a chance. - - - - - - - - - -
