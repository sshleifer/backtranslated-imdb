indeed, I first took Ranma 1/2 when I was about twelve. I was in the library and was searched for something good to read. Then, I went to the Comic / Manga section and I found this book. In my first few read through the chapters I did not know what was going on, but I knew that I WAS. I even took home for a few more lessons. In fact, I haven't been anywhere. And then, as five months (I'm 16 now) changed my friend was watching a series of anime and I remembered about this Manga. I couldn't remember what was called, but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Inu Yasha. I walked, and then I made a decision to stop watching all the sessions. No anime made me laugh hard and repeat again, look again. I was watching 45 events in a day. I don't know how I did ... but I couldn't stop. Finally, after two days, I grew up. I even dreamed - like things like this looks - about looking Ranma. I have never enjoyed a series of fun, so it's amazing, and very interesting. To date 161 pieces are not enough to maintain me satisfied. In fact the end of the cliffhanger was enough to make me go out, but the only series was enough to make me keep reading. Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his father Genma Saotome. During the military artists. They are very strong, that they went on the basis of old training in China and became 'cursed'. Areas full of fountains of fountains, and if you come into one, you take the shape of anything that was burned there when you enter the cold water. For Genma, that was PANDA, and for Ranma was ... girl! It is a story of a very cunning love. Additionally, Genma has promised his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to do an active dojo. In fact, he gets along with his hatred and feelings. Obviously they begin to love each other, but both ways of being stubbornly accept. But Genma has a history to do so. He promised Ranma for many girls. I don't believe. It's worth checking. It's exciting, hearty and amazing.
