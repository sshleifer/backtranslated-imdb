This movie is the same if you like an unreasonable action, a corny, and a very small plot! Specific effects are of honor based on this film from the "Watching Event" director. Dress is like something from a big shadow film .It is not one of the soldiers talking, so others tell them what to do. Finally ended up as a great movie of shoot'em and explosions everywhere. I personally loved Russell better in the "cucumber and money" "escape from the new / new york" and "chief decision". You must see this movie leave your mind at the door of no false science fiction!
