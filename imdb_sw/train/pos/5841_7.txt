The story of peacekeepers and city dwellers are fighting against land, water, law and order, and respect and hold for long-term livestock and their hired guns have been done better than before (Shane) and perhaps the best films. There are some good incidents of practice and the overall layout of the story, excluding the end of despair, takes place well. Laws and procedures and religions have established roots in the city, but the old livestock system, cows, and gunslingers are still close. Two clashes occur in an area that has emerged where the city's people are climbing a trap. Granger, a former weapons weapon, plays with a boy who is blocked by local people who need his skills for guns.
