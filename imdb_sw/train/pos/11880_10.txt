"Scarface" has the next major service even now, 22 years after being released. <br /> <br /> It has also been criticized too much to have too much tacky, not done, over-top and all that has been hit! These are the people who compare Scarface with the Godfather movies. It is true that the presence of technical, (movies, movies, trends, etc.) Scarface is a way back to 'Godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it is also true, that what Scarface has with the other gangster video lack, it's raw, odd methods of groups. Latino bandits in this movie seem to be more dangerous and more realistic than any Italian or Irish police group from other gangster classics as 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the great points of winning Scarface and I am very sure that this fact is written as "unqualified" by many critics! I've seen the nature of 1932 Scarface, and I must say that all these movies are very different from the other and they should be seen as two different movies instead of natural praise on "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has criticized that over-top and top in this movie. But how about considering that that's how the filmmakers wanted the character of Tony Montana to be! He is the angry guy who takes quick decisions and thrown to match every other minute! He is not calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very brave, uneducated person who doesn't think so much and gets angry all the time! It is obviously very 80s feel for this film. Sounds sound is 80s! I like some songs, including 'Gina and Elvira' themes, 'Push to limit' and song of the title. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautiful series, including a popular chain area, Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony to visit her mother. <br /> <br /> About the exhibition: Al Pacino is a brilliant as a Cuban refugee. He said that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana more in all his work. And it really looks like he is quite happy in all its events! Someone wondered what "Scarface" would like without Pacino. I can't imagine anyone else showing Tony Montana and for all the possibilities, the film can not be effective without him! Steven Bauer shines as a friend of Tony Manny. Robert Loggia is amazing as Tony's boss, Lopez. So it is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. Then there is an eye candy in the manner of Elvira playing with Michelle Pfeiffer. He looks good and is sufficient in his role. <br /> <br /> The director is moving slowly at a certain place at the peak. Without revealing anything, I would just say that this is the only place that faces the wrong care. Scarface "Scarface" is one of the most fun and one of the best bandster movies. out. Enjoy why it is: the raw exhibition of Drug users and their gangland!
