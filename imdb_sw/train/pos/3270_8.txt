Perry authors and Randy Howze crafted a very busy story in "Chances." By using the concept of a born again man who happens to return home to his former wife many years later, the plot takes an unexpected, delightful turn / knife! , Jr. renders a pleasant performance, ably assisted by Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This three has just the correct chemistry for this caper, playing off someone else with graceful style. I've been watching this film several times on tv, and every time it found it more enjoyable.
