The man in the white suit is one of those happy players that Ealing studies were done well in the 40th and 50th years. This plan follows a person who is wearing a fabric that does not get dirty or rest. Of course, this is a great efficiency in the world of clothing. However, things are not as simple as the fabric threatens the lives of many people, including fabric manufacturers, textile works, and even the old woman she chooses each week. The man in white suit is a film about scientific development, and a way that they do not always help; as the old woman says one time in the movie, "Why do scientists just leave things alone?" As a great mix of Ealing, this one star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is an amazing actress; has the ability to unlock the screen with its presence (and does in this film, real), but also can show its characters down to the world with a reliable way. He is very good at this film, and takes just the right environment for his behavior; a wise and wise scientist, but a little. With Guinness, the Man in the White Match also includes Joan Greenwood, a well-known actor with Guinness in just the "Heart and Coronets Styles" by Michael Gough, a man who would continue to find Alfred's role in the Batman film. Acting in the film is not always good, but it is always respectful, and it resembles a film. <br /> <br /> Man in White Suit is a comedy mind, stirring and witch with values. Comedy is not always clear, and it does not work all the time, but the film is not suitable for a movie that causes the abdomen of the stomach, so that is to be forgiven. I recommend this film, basically, to anyone who is a fan of movies.
