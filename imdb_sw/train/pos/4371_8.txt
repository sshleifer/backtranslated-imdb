When Braveheart first came out, I was happy, and it was one of the most powerful fans of the film. When Rob Roy went out, I was surprised, and although I enjoyed the film I didn't think it was a good film. However, as time has passed, thanks to Rob Roy has grown, and my passion for Braveheart has decreased. Braveheart is a good entertainment, to be sure, but there are mistakes too. More importantly, from my point of view, is the invisible image of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the great king of Scotland. Another is the historical accuracy of the film, which eliminates the film according to historical distortions. I think I am also confused by the fact that you were in this film, just seeing me (at least with me) by going back, that the beginning of Mel Gibson's presence can be seen for the first time. On the other hand, Rob Roy has grown to me over the years. Because because it significantly avoids the mistakes I have seen in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, growing more mature and hard with each look.
