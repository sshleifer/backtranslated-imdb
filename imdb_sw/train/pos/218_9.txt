Taking the responsibilities that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on the Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns played the former Vaudeville youth team, Joe Smith's team and Charles Dale who seem to have a different view of life. <Br /> <br /> Walter Matthau cannot stop working, someone has never learned to relax, take time and smell of roses. He is an old pastor who his best day is behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is getting less and less work for him. What hurt him so much is that 15 years before his girlfriend George Burns decided to retire and spend time with his family. Employees like Matthau cannot understand and take a personal decision on Burns. Benjamin falls into the storm of the brain, reuniting the boys and doing on a special national television. Something happening here is very good. Sunshine Boys is also a sad, sad story about age. Tales are on the screen for many films, but it's Burns who got the udos in the Oscar manner at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> brings a bit of individual to this film as well. As we all know that he was a direct person of the wonderful comedy team of Burns & Allen whose Monty Python group was borrowed much from. In 1958 due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George went on to the age of 100. Or at least pretty close as an executive of work. Sunshine Boys are based on Smith & Dale's team yet and if you like Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend seeing two Broadway Ticketes by looking at a pair of people who were the American public entertainment at the end of the century changed. A doctor's diagram that Matthau and Burns makes it directly from their devices. <br /> And I think you will love Sunshine Boys.
