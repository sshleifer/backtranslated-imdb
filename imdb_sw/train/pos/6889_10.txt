Anyone who does not like this film is someone who is afraid to explore his own spirits. This film makes the artist not worried sometimes, but that's his intention. It asks you to look at your own life and deal with headaches as well as Lou finally does. It asks you to be afraid of the view and to whom it brings. Bret Carr holds the mirror contrary to any film manufacturer. The intention and the message are clear and clear. The fear of the people about this film is based solely on their own uncertainty. An open viewer takes this inspiring message and runs with it. Sometimes the realization of life changes DOES come to the flash - light bulb goes. This story is real and changes lives as its audience in a real way.
