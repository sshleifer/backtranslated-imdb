The development of good behavior in a cool climate. Since it is a male, I probably do not have a good sense of understanding, but they do a good job of setting up a scenario for Victorian from the beginning. It is not as angry as it was and the treatment of women was perhaps even more. What makes this a good chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has a "something" that they are competing with. Once they occur in the rain and break out the webs of spiders, they begin to cooperate and slowly lose their sense of wonder. I enjoyed about this movie that it did not go to the cheap comedy when it could be. It didn't try to give us a lesson in us. People who seem to be totally unpredictable are truly human beings who see the light. I had a little problem with Alfred Molina's behavior with such a quick epiphany, but, in this world, it had to happen. Good to do everywhere and something positive is happening in the lives of other good people.
