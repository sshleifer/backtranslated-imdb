I love this film, but it is a fact, that you can't understand it, unless it comes from the former Yugoslavia. Many of the executives are now dead and those were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I am grateful that this film is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. All this was the former Yugoslavia, a sailing pot of Balcan states. It may be that a dream country, like Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other citizens will not be able to hurt the national ideas for their patients' thoughts.
