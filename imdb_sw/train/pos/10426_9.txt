I love it because of my recent experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is few. The participants in the company did not enjoy their "real life", but they enjoyed themselves, that is what they were. The movie did a good job to make this day easy memory. Good memories include only romantic feelings about a good visitor and a beautiful European city, but it is evident on a deep discussion on their values. Many movies are like this for discussion of life or love definition or relationship or current problems in life or some kind of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a good way, which makes the pause viewer and think and adjust the breath and go to watch the film. Before Sunrise does not try to insert special ideas into your head. It only encouraged you to think about certain issues in everyday life and give you an alternative position. This has led to dialogue between the characters, not just the applause of the applause or the idea that came out. You would still think about these issues yourself and know about the second line of the story. Finally it was not very important after all. You can find something and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies should enjoy. This is an enjoyable movie and your time value to watch it. I'm also going. Some movie somehow represented some of my part and answered some of my questions.
