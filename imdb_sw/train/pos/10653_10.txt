I know it's a fashion now hate this film. I have seen thousands of spoon films including her original 1963 Haunting and many hammer films. This film is not saved and it is not good for all that is why many modern viewers were unloved. However many viewers can accept films as Scream because the killers of the knife are much easier to believe in more people than demons or ghosts. This film really had many beautiful pictures and acting and special effects. I've seen 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made several interesting and stylish films and was not trying a kind of sense of sense. Perhaps this film can appeal to fans of John Carpenter but more of the plot structure. The old haunting was also a good film since 1963. It was more awesome. See both and also innocent and The Legend of Hell House by Pamela Franklin.
