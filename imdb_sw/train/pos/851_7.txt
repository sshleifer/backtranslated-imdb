Pierce Brosnan has gone to his last Martini's return, in a self-interest, as a former elder old elder Julian Noble, who enjoys a lot of young girls, dresses and clothes. At work in Mexico City he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a businessman of the town of Denver, a single-year-old, who is in town to make his life time, in a hotel bar. Despite their distinctive behavior and unintelligible Julian words, they become friends. Overall done by Pierce Brosnan's exhibitions and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard noted that he did not write film and Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can't think of this without him. He proves to have a real talent to play and may be more than James Bond or the fighters. The area where two of them meet at the hotel of a sudden hotel (amazing sets and photographs) is really a piece of practical skill. The area is about fifteen minutes, and maybe perhaps it is written, two actors significantly improve, but they are very successful! Almost feels like a new level on the screen screen. Consider Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS to improve and add one less subtle under the most clich√©s and typical of the practitioners themselves (Brosnan of James Bond especially), and you have one of the most fun pairs in recent Hollywood. Unfortunately, the stories wear thin over time. After an hour, the film begins out of steam. However, and I can't put my finger on it, I was very happy with this. It only feels pure and original, and other uses of thinking of sets and lights, and some ideas of Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Those other characters are not given much to do, but this film offers something new, in such a way that it is almost without success to combine all the common forms in a totally spoof of entertainment. Very much. Cameras Obscura --- 7/10
