"The World War Zone" and Timothy Hines are a very entertaining film that comes with great effort and length to remain faithful to the book of G. Wells' classic. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who stood my film with me, accepted the fact that it was not the usual standard, predicted for Hollywood that comes every year, e.g. The version of Spielberg and Tom Cruise which had little resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks at different things in the film. Those who think of themselves as the "critics" are just looking to criticize everything they can. Others are filing on the most basic grounds, as interesting, that is why many people disagree with "critics". We enjoyed Mr. Hines's efforts in being faithful to the novel of H.G. Wells' classic, and we found it very entertaining. This has made it easier to see that "critics" feel that it is its limitations.
