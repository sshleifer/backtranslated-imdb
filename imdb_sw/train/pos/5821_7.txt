I was quite surprised to read some comments on this work, honestly. Other people were looking for a plot? Well, this video came out over the past decade, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a film. It has no plot, no central story. It's an artistic anthology of many long-term videos, both rather than smartly or creatively done. Michael Jackson can be considered free at this time, but, after all, this is the person who gave us the Thriller (considered by many to be a great music video of all time) and put a trend with Billie Jean and beat. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who had collaborated with him also took his musical and dance moves to create good entertainment items, including soil, special effects, live performance pictures, and even self-centered Badder "). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out just before the name of the household, and it was one of his memorable films. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (choreographed part) carries something else Michael Jackson made to that point!
