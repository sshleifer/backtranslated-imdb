Listen to many romantic and interesting comments made on this film ..... just put, related to the ninja movies, these friends are about as well as they get! Yes it's silly, yes acting and the script is admittedly quite angry, but with gomam - it's a lot of fun blood! In fact, as is the case with B-Movies, embarrassing 'act' (which for the movie in question, is actually among the worst I have been happy to see!) And the plot 'plot' really just used to raise the level of ten enjoyment. It is clear that fighting events are a major attraction in this though and for the most part I am glad to say, they are very well choreographed, especially the last minute (which we witness that the ninja are not considered by the common law of gravity ....) <br /> <br /> I don't believe in this, if it's a fan of ninja movies and you have never seen Sakura Killers, then you're really missing on what in my opinion, one of the real instruments in the crown the genre.
