Another head of Aussie, this comes into an unknown and odd world, and it does it very well. It does not mean the great effects of the growing of the American flicks, focusing on the emotional impact. Very simple plan that Rebecca Gibney & Co brings. Following the story of a couple who buy an old house that was home to an old woman who never went out, and whose husband was lost in a strange past century. Wonderful things begin to happen inside the house, and John Adam begins to turn into someone who has lost, who was actually a mass murderer. It is highly recommended. 8/10
