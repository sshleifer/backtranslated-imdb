This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series is more accurate than those in the United States, but this time the authors have hit the goal of creating a better working mix. Edel & Starck is good, it has all: good conspiracy, smart, witches, always delivered hands, amazing displays of exhibitions displayed by all stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most attractive city in the world. It is entertainment to see how things work in the field of justice in other countries than the United States and at once “feel” the ancient European way of coping with life. Kudos for all employees and staff for a good comedy which will be necessary to see in the coming years.
