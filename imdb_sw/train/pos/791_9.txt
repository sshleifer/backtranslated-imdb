Since they do not know this film before seeing it on the Rialto Channel I found it a lively, interesting and interesting film. <br /> <br /> Search was better. I loved all the characters, they were very few in places, (this is the film). The way that seemed happy and giddy climbs the main character took it until it turned wrong, as real life can and do. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was good. I was keen to watch this film once it started because people often laugh on its ability to work (I see this is wierd because she is always a strong actor in my opinion). I liked a bit at the end where Andy's behavior said "sometimes I feel that he was not here" etc., it was exactly how it was in such a situation (which I can personally identify with), then there is this modern piece "Nocturne" I think and Chopin, which was a good way to finish (bar the light actor at the end, which was not needed). I say "well" for filmmakers - I've seen 1,000 s of the worst films!
