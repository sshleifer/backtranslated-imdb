I was not sure if this would be just one of those of the idiotic detergent of the night that seems to merge when the principal but, as shown, this is a good show (no small thanks for giving us talents). Four female friends with different backgrounds get together and share every week of their love life. A long-term plan follows each of them through their regular trips to find love and does it without being boring or trite. Sharon Small "Trudi" is a man who pretends to be a housewife (claims to be a widow after September 11) who finds little preaching and annoys her friends (who may be a little player and more creative in their efforts). It is advisable to see the Red Red, because he was the greatest in the secrets of "Inspector Lynley". Chick can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, lawyer) is perhaps destroyed but still very sympathetic to women, since he struggles with his own but a man who is engaged in Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") in his desire to have a child with him, without caring for its needs. The last two members of the house are Jess hosted (Shellie Conn), the incumbent who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, sex is not special, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish) a sick doctor who is sick AND her son has sent her work to love life out of control. That said, I have stumbled now and I hope that the BBC develops this series because it is good, it is different and well beaten.
