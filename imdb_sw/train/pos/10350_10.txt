I believe they were telling the truth all the time ... Nor did they trust anything in the wild ... They families went through hell. The poorest poor also understand what is going on around them. But they still have to deal with rumors. With dealing with losing their little sister. I can't believe that the case went on for a long time. It seems like the jury could not see the truth, even if it called it on the donkey. I don't know what they used, I don't even know. After watching this film, I had tears, and I was looking at my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should look at this.
