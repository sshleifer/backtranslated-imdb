Enchanted April is a voice poem, painting paintings, brilliant sending of messages in a few words. It has become one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I keep waiting, even a bit of patience, for the film coming out of DVD format. It seems, I am not alone. <br /> <br /> If the list of the Amazon list lists is correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy and this is beaten with this script. Many people want to keep a copy of this film in their library. Sent is amazing, movies and unintended recipes. Film is a surety guardian. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
