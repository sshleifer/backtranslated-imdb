After having an important eye for the film, and the love of good movies, I went to see the Fisher Antonia and my breath done for example. When I am an exciting fan of Denzel Washington - all his skills as an actor and his public; I am a sufficient fan of agreeing (very rarely) when you have no mark on a film or two. And I could be bad about those - after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different - Denzel could expand his work experience, and lead, a film of one of the most sensitive topics known to man - child abuse. As its first beginning, not down. And developing a film to show that it will win a person's victory. I didn't need to worry. <br /> <br /> I was not. What I saw was a film full of promises that were linked to a wide range of audience, and they gave the inexperienced ones a little, but honest in the life of a young man whose childhood was a life of hell, but who won despite all. This film did - and the appearance of a dry eye of any color in the theater showed. It takes someone to know the topic in this film to know when the fact has been presented. It takes a skilled filmmaker to tell you a story that is persuasive when you are not experienced. And if he could more draw a local audience, causing the audience to respond emotionally, mercilessly, the film manufacturer has done his job. In any film. White, white, purple or polka beaten. That's what makes good movies. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and above all, Antione Fisher - actually won.
