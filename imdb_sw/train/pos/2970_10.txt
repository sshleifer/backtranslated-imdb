I thought that Baseketball was one of the funniest films I saw! It is a wonderful humor that makes me a whole way, and the fact that Trey and Matt are more advanced, enhances the comedy of the film. I've been buying Baseketball on a DVD with just one of those movies where you can never despair to look at it. I have a very short thought and I think this film has any funny bits that make me enjoy. Humorous Quotes are memorable, and can make me laugh for hours if I remember later. In general I think that Baseketball is a brilliant film that everyone should go to see, especially if you are as young as me as it will continue to laugh for a long time later. <br /> <br /> P.s Does anyone think it's weird for me to love them both? hehe
