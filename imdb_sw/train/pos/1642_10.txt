Not seen the film since it was first released, but it doesn't remember. The Rip Torn Show and Conchata Farrell were superb, photographing the best, moving story line and everything else about it was the highest level. Yet it seems to have been forgotten very well / it is probably because the UK is an unfamiliar market but I haven't seen a film on TV or video, which is sad. Has it been a great success in the United States where it would seem to be a very accurate historical game? Always count that 50% of the best film is music and though I do not think the theme of the head was really simple but moving to "What a friend we have in Jesus". The film continued to oppose it! Is it right or wrong?
