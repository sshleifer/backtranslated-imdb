This was a great movie. The real music feel-good when you need one. The story is lighter (this is not going to the wind) but sometimes, one needs this type of plot. Beautiful and warm characters, wonderful characters and beautiful / wardrobe. Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show of ER) is ONLY in this role. She is definitely a new star shining for Hollywood. All should look at him, he will be the future BIG. <br /> <br /> Also amazing was the sound of this movie. A good mix of modern and Indian tunes. I was playing in many movies. It is highly recommended as an enjoyable movie what you need.
