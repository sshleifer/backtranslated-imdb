The good efforts of Warner Bros star Errol Flynn in one of its best screen displays. It is often referred to as the best, and I cannot judge it fully until I see its "Dawn Patrol". However, his work in "died with their boots" takes beaten. I am a great fan of Flynn (who is my famous actor after James Mason - also helps that he is Aussie) and I think he is very strange, the great presence of the screen and also a good actress. He is the center of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary striker and a sketch of the concept, but also supported by the learning, warm and amazing script, and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh film I have seen never lost its stripes, in fact it was a born-born film. Walsh directs the ring scenes well, as he does in the lighter and that poignant time, the last major area between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to the good quality of production ("Gay Nineties" was never seen better!) And a good interest in the beautiful and very good entertainment. Alan Hale has often played Flynn's match, but here's his father, and it's still all work. Alexis Smith is the love of Flynn. The two are head on the heels with love and fight each other.
