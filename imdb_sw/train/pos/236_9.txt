It's a common event when I want to see the movie again. "Amati Girls" is the same movie. In the old cinema movies I would have put more displays. Was this autobiographical story for the author / director? It has an hour of truth. All the stars that have been presented present their characters in fact and sympathetically. Who did not want Mercedes Ruehl to be a great sister? I have loved his work since "To Roseanna". For many movies, one stops faith because we know it is the work of executives, producers, operators, sound professionals, etc.. It was difficult to leave the belief in "Girls of the Movement". Someone feels that part of this family! I had come to protect Dolores when his family revealed his emotional life. And he wanted to enjoy Lee Grant as he level resistance in the color of Cloris Leachman's hair. The humor in it is not the stomach that laughs with humor, but rather it has a good feel-good quality that is much more productive than the crop as well. The love shown in this cinema family is considered and deserved. It is no coincidence that the family name, Amati, has been translated from the Italian 'dear'.
