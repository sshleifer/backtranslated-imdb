"Day" is a regular family festival and a little catch - you must relate to the feelings of every kind of possible way so that you can really appreciate the show. Spoilers as possible for those who are unknown to Show] Stories, for example, for all people who have watched the show, is the world of Cooper Day, a middle child family. He writes his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his investigation. His family includes mother, father, perfect sister, and younger brother. The first period, which will hear stupid since John Scott Shepard has created this situation - a sister and mother gets pregnant. That is the first case the writer blows. Then the father leaves his job in the law firm. The little child gets a panic attack. The middle child gets a battle with the sister's partner. This is all working on the day. </ Spoilers [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I am amazed at this show. I don't know. It's very little but I love it. First I thought that the camera function was chaotic but I got to use it and started to do it. I loved a quiet conversation under the light of darkness. I liked the closest feeling of the show. I loved the lowest style of budget. I liked acting. I enjoy the story. Then I find myself needing the second season. I gradually became a fan of it as part of the 6th beat ABC ended. It's a very good show and not like OC. The two do not have the same thing. So I hope the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can contact Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will be like this show. Much.
