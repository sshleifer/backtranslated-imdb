In what should be one of the most bloody films at any time, the farmer kills people in New York, and the answer to everything might not be the people who judge. One can see how Brian DePalma influences from Hitchcock with camera angles and objects. Michael Caine has a tendency to stimulate thinking, while Angie Dickinson is basically a wealthy woman tired of bad hair. Keith Gordon (who later made a star in "Christine") is probably a very interesting character in the film. But you can't understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may not know whom you trust. Also star Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
