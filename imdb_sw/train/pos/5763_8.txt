I need to agree to enjoy bad movies. I love them all. Fear exactly. My friends and I are gathering after a hard week at school and work, renting mad zones, making pizza and getting an explosion. One of what we got on the Hollywood video, was this, the destruction of the blood of the Zombie. He had a big box, so I expected less than usual. The story is about a house project being built on a nuclear facility that had high layers of land, and other underground layers are covered only. Residents of this neighborhood find a covered center when some children fall into a hole in the cave. This wakes some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's the city of chunk. Effect of impact and action does not stop until the final document is made. Well, it's not a good art, but this, as well as a shocking conversation with the top things that were hurt was evening. Actually, it was one of the best "party zones" that I have been happy to watch. And you can say that it has been made without money, and a group of mad people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has come) and is just a wild trip.
