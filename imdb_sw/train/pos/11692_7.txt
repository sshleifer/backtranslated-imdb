I do not say that as a fan of Chris Rock, I say this as a person who had low prospects coming into this film and proved it wrong. The first one was everything that was completed that everyone saw coming. Flaw number two I found that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed to be fake. Finally acting in this film was small, and the best actor to be Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw the back of the mistake and saw a strong comedy. In the title of the head, see heaven can wait rather, it's better. So for all fans of Chris Rock out there, SEE this MOVIE, you will enjoy it. He stands well in this film. Overall: 7 out of 10
