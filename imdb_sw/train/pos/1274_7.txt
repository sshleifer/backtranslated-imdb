Note that all those who did not like and enjoyed this film commented that it was not the same as the book or that it was different from the book. I don't understand this type of resistance. Books and films are different media. While books have an hour and hour to develop characters and story lines, the film has 120 minutes. However the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: see, sounds, and ideas. I don't care if the film is good or, in fact, resembles a basic book. Who cares? I judge them for what. <br /> <br /> This television movie was charming. The old and often fiction stories, with images, would be easy to be ashamed. However, Riffen and Reeves remove it. One inspector received Riffen away from the past. I would never think he had 40 when he made this film. It is on its loan as an actor that played well 23-24 years of surprisingly good. Also I think it's about the best thing Reeves has ever done. Stories can be established, and I accept playing screens can be used to "enhance." However, it is good to watch; obviously not a powerful story of love, but rather, the love of love that will leave you to ridicule that love is a strong feeling and a good victory over evil. And it is good to see a "love story" without the word f # $%, honeycombs, or catching hours. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music score is the best.
