This film is very inspiring for two main characters. I hit it on my laptop without even reading the lid (let's just comment) and I was attracted to two solid hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds. Sexual tension caused between the secretary and the offender is close and even without physical contact. To reach the end I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and heroine overcome their caper or just to strengthen their enthusiasm. RML would have made without a curious concept and 100 minutes of tradition would have been many. I'm nitpicking though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and the local library makes this movie retain my trust in the large text of the film.
