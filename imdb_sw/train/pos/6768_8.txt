One of my favorite shows in 80 years. After the first season, it began to descend when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to watch him with the character of Ernest Borgnine going to each other. The last time he happened was one of your favorites for the second season. Unfortunately in those days, blacks did not have a long time on television programs. Some events in the second season where the same but the third season was more about human characters than Airwolf and was not shown until almost at the end of the show. When you went to USA, it was an abomination !!!
