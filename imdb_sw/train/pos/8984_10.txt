I saw this film for the first time when I was passing through films through my parents DirecTV. It was in the Sundance center and it just started. I love music, especially in the late 60's and this is what BJM looks like (Dandys is the same). Everything about the murder of Brian Jonestown stressed me from music, by Anton and Joel's legacy, for the use of improper drugs. It was funny because I was looking at the first place of the party when everyone made the lines my parents walked and decided to look (look at their faces were very valuable). Anyway this is definitely one of my movies that likes because it showed me to the murder of Brian Jonestown who is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> look at ... for weight
