This movie impressed me. Other things were "few" and other technologies reminding the movie "Enemies of the State" surrounding Will Smith. But for the most part of entertainment - a good mix with Jamie Foxx and Mike Epps and 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (giving some comic aid). This is a film that you can look at again - saying ... Wednesday night when nothing else is going on. I paid 9 for the value of entertainment.
