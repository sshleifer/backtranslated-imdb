Fleet was released in 1936 in the middle of depression when people had a difficult time in the world looking for work or even looking for food to put on the table. In Europe Hitler had increased, with other national / elite whackjobs. In the United States Cartel seeds planted by the Federal Conservation Act and the restructuring of income tax (16) began to bear fruit for financial retired affiliates related to their privacy. To the boy and girl average, times were hard. Enter Hollywood and at least the most optimistic images? I don't think we can call propaganda to this point, although this special film refers to the practice of war preparation. The real issue for boys and girls then, as it is now, was how to focus on one of the right, leading a decent life, having good children, and the beauty of grace and beauty. The restrictions were small. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For my full review of this film and for other film shows and please, visit my CoffeeCoaster.com website. <br /> <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
