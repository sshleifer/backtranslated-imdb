Just another review of this film as of this date shows the real star and movie itself. I often like to read the comments of the user giving me an idea of ​​what to expect from films that I don't know a lot. It is unfortunate that there is no more comment on a certain tile, because there is only one check and you distort the movie and despair, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before looking at this title and I do not know where all the toxins of this film and stars come out. Douglas and Blondell were talented and impressive people who often provided, even when the material was not great. I have found a film with fun and fun performances. It is not one of the most common monuments, but the most beautiful and wonderful-much more fun than you can hope in most more films. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be discouraged.
