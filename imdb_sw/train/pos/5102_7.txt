don't worry the sound of the voice, which is played and now. <br /> <br /> Still, Winger's Debra is always interesting and this time was the original responsibility for him, he is very good like Cissy, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in the trailer with Bud, (Travolta), just transformed for a while with the city slicker Madolyn Smith as an opponent. I agree with the review earlier about Scott Glenn, he is used for just a plot, cast to the mix to include; The story is predictable and released. <br /> <br /> Also, though I am from the east, most of us did not like "Saturday Saturday", when it had time, the constant concern is more than resistance to this point. <br /> <br /> You should see for Winger Debra; he is still very happy, and he has never had the same Hollywood we are under so many actors today. 7/10
