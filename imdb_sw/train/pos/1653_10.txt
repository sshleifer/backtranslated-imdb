I agree with everyone who says that this series was better than the 'spy' type. My husband and I were asked this when it first appeared in the United States and looked at every part. I tried that time to buy a series (I made it all) but was told by the WGBH that it was not found. I also thought to write to Ian Holm to see if she could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read a series of Deighton (part of a complex understanding). Definition of Ian Holm's concern but confident Bernard Samson was wonderful. (He's always wonderful.)
