this was a special Christmas Special that I would like to release on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM has been lost, and any cassettes I have made also gone away. It is not John the great Denver fan but was very surprised by the music, which was a traditional supplement to the poppin spin (esp Little St. Nick!). It was done at the end of the '70's ​​show this was a timeless feeling for it. He hopes to get a copy soon !!!
