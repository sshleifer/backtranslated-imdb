You saw this film twice in community surveys and liked it very much. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the film has taken the true nature and community taste - grit, decision, happiness, creativity, in your situation and the measure of despair. Writing, discussion and acting is strong and I have found myself in the story of a young woman Raya struggling to follow her goals and not to lose in the process. The great drum system is not only the bodies that move smoothly and electronically but the camera goes to great purity and mind too. All characters are of many types - no good or bad and women's characters are very powerful. This is a film that has a strong heartbeat and celebrates an improper spirit of young people, hip hop and society like Jane Finch.
