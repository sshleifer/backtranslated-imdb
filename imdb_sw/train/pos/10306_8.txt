As a person living near Buffalo, New York, this film scored with me before I saw it, because the story was put here. There are some small pieces with real life-TV news of anchor people from Buffalo .. and, at once, does not knock the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Wisdom-wise, puh-leeze !!! God still does look and think as human beings ... and, of course, be a little bit of freedom. Being a lighter comedy is, it's not something that should win any prize but it's still a fun and it's a good way to kill 102. minutes. - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this rather than a few laughs, as well as prayer should really all over. Kudos for authors at least get the correct theology and give a good message. Overall, it's a beautiful heart video that should harm a very few.
