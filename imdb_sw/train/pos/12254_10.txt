I saw this film after watching the Paltrow version. I have found that one is very good, and I thought this could not be good ... but I was still fainting: the British version was much better and interesting! I saw Jeremy Northam more "good" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Power has taken the best Knightley to Austen. Also, two versions are good, but anyone who likes Austen's books, should watch this film.
