I scored the anticipated bar to be a hot beer on Texas's day but was very surprised. After suffering through the "Night of the Saturday night" we had no desire to renew in some of northern Texas .... and I did not. John Revolta was as good as the redneck of jealousy, Scott Glenn was healed well as former thuggie, and Debra Winger was, as always, happy. * The woman's love * Plus, the sound of the voice was dynamite [and this comes from someone who cannot stand the music of the country music]. An enjoyable film all the way.
