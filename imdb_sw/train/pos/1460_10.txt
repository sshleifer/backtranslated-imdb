A good film that shows how people are connected and taken to a small, common column of Mardi Gras. The film is more than a high definition of globalization. In fact, humanizes workers in China, the owner of the factory, the division of fiber in New Orleans, and even journalists in New Orleans. What is more common is the ability of the director to tell a problem story with difficult details in a simple and cheat way. Its amazing access to the factory is another interesting feature and I just want to know how it entered. It is a good story without feeling or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion gives hope without leaving people to hear that they are divorced.
