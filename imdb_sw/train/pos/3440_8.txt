Love Rosario Dawson, I think he is one of the best artists of modern era. Descent seems to be more about independent ability than anything else. It sounds under everything in the film. Talk is flat, the characters seem to deliberately bland with one side. Special capacity is the representation of independent capacity for the characters and the trip to Rosario from personal empowerment to lose capacity and return again. <br /> <br /> Entering this as classic rape is wrong, and that is probably why many people are not happy with the film. A typical 'rape' viewer did not like this particular film, and maybe that's something? The movie asks more questions than answers, and it faces the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compulsory connection between the audience and the target audience and when the film is not suitable for the audience in the face and the confidence of private rights is shared with the viewer for what it may or may not be, all negative reasons. <Br /> <br /> Deficiency is a good film that IMHO is very affected.
