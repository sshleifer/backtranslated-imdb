The Black Foley quality in this full and intense film looks "perfectly" together. Shot for the shot, silk and silk, the film emerges itself next to the oppressed striker to discover his own purpose (or lack thereof). Other views around this may indicate a lack of interest in the pulp, but I personally think this is a shared part of the movies!
