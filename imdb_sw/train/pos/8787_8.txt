This film strengthened my views of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn is better known for his knowledge and sprezzatura (throwing it in several high-quality words of Europe!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (except a little bit) as an actor, as he plays an amazing social player with a great ego The feeling of courage to match. Support support is better; everyone seems to be well chosen for their responsibilities. The story goes quickly and, when it is not very important (missing, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to provide social clarity on the massive distribution of non-timely revenue), surely it entails and meets. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also believed in history. I also loved a beautiful 1880 year old San Francisco. All in all, there is little to dislike about this film ... very good value when looking at it.
