I wasn't a fan of seeing this film completely, but when my gf called me and said he had a free surveillance that was put together with just for seeing eva longoria and laughing at the luxury of biggs jason. It was generally better and what I expected but not so much. this was like a diversification of how to lose a person in 10 days and like heaven. The most common romantic comedy and its time I think. The movie was very small (about 85 min.) but it was enough to describe the whole story, creating character development and having a good end to the end. any idea of ​​the spirit that hated her former husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping sarcasm and paul rudd and all others to help cast (especially jason biggs) kept laughs coming at a slow speed. Overall I liked the movie just because it had a good amount of laughing to put me otherwise otherwise I would give this movie a minimum. hey chick her flick and I'm through this movie from the guy's perspective well, it will be more fight right if women requested this movie and give there thought about it.
