Rookie put me exciting from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played a role in perfection. The little boy who plays his son was wonderful. Made this movie-movie movie to remember. The message is good. Follow your dreams. Failure to execute is the same as long as we try. The excitement is interesting. I believe this movie will be classic.
