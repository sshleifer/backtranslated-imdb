Indeed, history in this film was "Hollywoodized" - but it is far from being just a bit of history restored to civilians. Lafitte collaborated with Americans because she felt a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of any patriotism for a nation that took New Orleans just a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to fraud, which led to Galveston's ship; he was more than a breaker and less than a hero * or * swashbuckler. But who cares? This is one movie which is worldly entertainment - and it faces it, all of us wanted Jean to go to the wench of the feist rather than the wise governor of the governor. Brynner has grown once again on the beautiful text to provide interesting performance.
