This movie should be my favorite all the time. His should not be a conspiracy, because his creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) believe it was a real film of fire. This was an exercise in visual effect, and was not cut when the action occurred as every other film does. Nowadays films are now on sound effects, leaving the photos done by computers make it easier to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who can't find artificial blood to be seen as a real thing. There is no rape area because it was not a point of making a film. Have you seen mountains with 2 eyes? Part of rape was rather amazing than surprising. Although I am sure there are some film makers who have tried to marry porn with fear. But since you probably suck in the film, they probably won't be able to remove it. The film "Baise Moi" has a rape scene because movie actors are actually photographic stars and show everything even though the whole film takes. It is too bad that the film cannot be made without thinking of the money item everything, especially when talking about AO or NC-17 level. I am sure Eli Roth has the ability to perform his series of Hostel films better, but he has also destroyed it to get R ... Checking Death or More Screens if you don't want real video frills (accidents and crime / footage scenes). Do not forget that this film took place in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand against the most decently presented these days says much about this film. That would be like someone saying 8bit Super Mario Brothers jumps because PS3 has excellent graphics.
