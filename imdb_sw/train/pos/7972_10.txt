I watch this film all the time. I have looked at it from 3 to 87 years, and everyone is in the middle; They all liked it. It shows a really good dog has, and love and trust available from animals. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is good for thoes who love comedy movies, tears, or even pets. <br /> <br /> Music is wonderful, fascinating animals, events really thought out, and perfect characters. I loved on characters are true and mixed features: Shadow (Elder, Golden Retriever) He is wise, filled with wisdom and imagination of any dog, Possibly (American Bulldog puppy) is primarily a puppy side of magic, a characteristic comical; And Sassy (Cat Hymilayan) She is a real cat that shows what a real cat will do to their owner, a real girly one.
