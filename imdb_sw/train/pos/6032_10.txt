Antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he made this movie made. He went to America working under a contract from the most attractive studio (MGM) and made a picture of the most devastating American society I ever saw. After seeing the first hand this is the most appropriate picture of a city full of people, motivated and non-personal. If only Antonon had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> Subsequent funerals and studios are understandable, after the second investment and possible return. It is unfortunate that people cannot see this film again if I believe Antonioni is justified. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is more interested in what comes into their pockets and an unlimited expansion of living space in an unfavorable desert (good) and more. Would I like to see interest in this reconstructed film and release the free DVD. <br /> <br /> I urge people to watch the feature of Zabriskie with open mind and open heart. We have a unique exclusive film about a step in the history of the most powerful nation in the world, and we have forgotten about it. An unexpected Gem.
