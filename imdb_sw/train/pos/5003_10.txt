I'm not going to watch this show. But, I'm glad I did. Critics of this is not just getting! It is one of the funniest and most entertaining things at the T.V at the moment! Although, during the interview was conducted with ordinary people perhaps seemed useless; but, keep the mouth of animals and insects, and is a laugh of laughter. I laughed very much, I had tears in my eyes. Pigs and babies and their mother are very valuable. The husband's wife and wife are talking about health problems, and the male bird takes the crocodile after the wife tells him he has already been executed. The comfort of the creature is a show of more thinking that I've ever seen! We hope, it will return next summer when this run is completed.
