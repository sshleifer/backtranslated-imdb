About the Scottish artist's documentary Andy Goldsworthy, whose work has many parts of ephemeral sculptures made from nature. His work is done with rocks, grass, grass, ice, etc., which is beaten off when the wave comes to the beach or the wind blows into the field. Thus, many of Goldsworthy jobs do not end, except as a picture or film of what they were. Now, one can say that Goldsworthy's work is a reflection of death, or the words of that effect, but it's not easy to say that what he is doing is just good art. And while the artists' performances are that they are bitter, prudent, often quiet people who live in urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a good, uncomfortable person, who loves nature and lives in a small village there Scotland (of course, I am sure it is another reason that he restrains with other people in the world of art who got his or her waterworks or high).
