When I heard Patrick Swayze finally returned to his work with King SOLOMON'S MINES I was very happy. I expected Indiana Jones to sort of action. I was an hour 4 hours (with advertising) epic which was very slow. The second and third hour would have fallen completely and the story did not suffer for it. The latter was good (no damage here) but I was left with more want. All young people can make it a prey that Swayze makes "RoadHouse 2" so that he can return to a kind of action that has made him popular. Until it became like a fan of the King Solomon of Solomon rather than reading a book or looking at the 1985 edition by Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone which is also not very good but only its time and forty hours of your life except for 4 hours.
