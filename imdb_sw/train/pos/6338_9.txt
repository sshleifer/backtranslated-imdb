I loved this film I saw the original classic rarely but can not remember any details. I think this movie is better than its cartoon is not black and white as it is. I really liked how they made the drawing of the perfect character and give a reason why he was the way he had, the villain in this movie is not a real Grinch but Messenger, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect in all the great films made for children and adults alike.
