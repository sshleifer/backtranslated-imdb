I think this has the potential to be the best series of Star Trek yet, I say POTENTIAL. For those who have not seen it. Without being angry "PRIME DIRECTIVE" around their heads every time they meet with the community it can be cool. FULL 10 ... loses all the opportunities of other series. I hope this goes over 7 years ...
