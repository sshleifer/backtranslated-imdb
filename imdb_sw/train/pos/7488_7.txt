The person (or, anything.) Leaves enough marks for the victims of blood and blood keepers to the dead. Police investigator Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, before departure for a variety of fear of the film B for a great length) stood for whom ... or what .. after this bad crime. The village is defeated by hysteria and Karl depends on its medical expert, Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, in another role of an effective scientist) to comment on what might cause deaths for innocent people. He also fears the safety of his beloved Ruth (Fay Wray who has a third time with Atwill after "Doctor X" & "The Secret of the Wax Museum") who is a helper for Niemann. Dwight Frye steals the film as a village village village that collects bats and carries a good track wherever he goes ... it's easy to see why he becomes a suspect as a local paranoia is in a fever state. Maude Eburne provides a humorous film as a very sick person (and affected) a patient of the Niemann patient who believes she has a disease she reads about books near the laboratory where she works. He is recommended and often von von Niemann only makes him feel with the false diseases he feels. Lionel Belmore returns again as BÃ¼rgermeister another fearful, faithful. <br /> <br /> Creaky, static, but rather entertaining yet thanks to the cast. The film is clear as a low budget as it comes, but this does not hurt the film very much since it installed well with the director Frank R Strayer and its employees. I am sure the films have seen the best day, though. This is a B-horror item that you can find packaged with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty programmers. Citizens of the film ... and its intention to feed biological organisms of synthetically ... undoubtedly it takes to take a difference in the form of Frankenstein. Many may be disappointed with the final results if the film stops being a real odd story about a real vampire killer and resulting in murder.
