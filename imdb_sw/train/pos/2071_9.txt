For our Baby Boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us the way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> Cluster is simple enough: a cool hood meets a small sherifi city and hell, but nuts and bolts of this movie attracts nut car we all. No, this is not Casablanca, nor is a great Literature, but it's a great movie about cars, insurgency, and skills that are Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate why, and why Martin will be. I loved this movie to grow as a boy in 70 years, and you too.
