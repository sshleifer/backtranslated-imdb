Providing classy from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('Horse Pavillions' etc.) turns into a group of "classic" of mind with a strong mind (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt etc.) all offer stylish exhibition, despite the low budget that causes 'non-special effects'. The best contribution, however, is the Chloe Franks 7-year-old who returns to a very powerful account of its part which makes the blood of a man run cold. Just destroyed by the name of the lurid wanted film and its supplier, this underrated release, cut on the run-of-mill 'blood' n 'guts' movie shocker, is for those who appreciate little ideas and fear them.
