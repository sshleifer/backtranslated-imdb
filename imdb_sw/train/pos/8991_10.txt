DIG! it is exciting, fun, exciting, interesting, delicate, and doing very well. Knowing that it was made on such a budget decline over 7 years is amazing that the story can be told, especially with style and such items. If you are a fan of a music or a fan of this document you must see it. Considering Brian Jonestown Masssacre and Dandy Warhols over the years are a brilliant way to show the difference between the beautiful band that meets the usual success through patience and the ability to influence the singer's leader of the position. The courage supported by various characters who lose their success through drugs, alcohol, and sex. If I didn't know that this is a picture of real people, I would like to swear a very well written and written piece. Stories are compelling, briefly, and simply amazing.
