Sports movies have never been my business, but a few are working for me. Ideal are those who concentrate on games and more on character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is the first beginning of Karyn Kusama, with the best performance of Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels realistic and involving them, that's enough to make the film not remembered. <br /> <br /> The plan is enough before. Diana Guzman, her fourth year of high school, but because of her fight in the hallway she is close to expulsion. As a possible way to erase his anger, he points to Boxing lessons at the club where his brother learns (for the father's wishes there). Within ninety minutes, we viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost real change from the girl to the woman. We see it in his body with his character, especially when one of the boys in the club finds himself recommended, and he enters into it. There is no bad place or time that has appeared / organized in the film. The only mistake I could say could be corrected is that one of the lower plans ends up on what feels like unlocked logo. Apart from this, Girlfight is a good movie.
