SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - All-time TV Show Sopranos has become a cultural and world-recognized thing as one of the major television shows of all time. James Gandolfini has a master of New Jersey crime, Tony Soprano, led by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is as good as a worried, loving middle-aged mother; Tony Sirico is as big as a fool, the pride of pride which is often very interesting. When the exhibitions are often criticized for inappropriate Italian-American discrimination, as well as this can not fail, I can see many more from the show. To show strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; What? can this be in a coarse show on gangsters? Yes. In addition, other hot issues are discussed as terrorism, social equity and injustice, homosexuality, drug etc. This is not very clear, very gentle about the tough guys and abuse. It has a lot more. Many of the issues we see in the show are real. The scriptures that have been very much interrupted the current issues of success and have made them into the lives of the characters, which makes the whole thing more interesting. Credit should go to David Chase who has created the best television and James Gandolfini treasures, based on the most complex and powerful television. <br /> <br /> Only unique. <br /> <br /> 10/10
