This deserves 12 out of 10. The most enjoyable exercise with real characters and real stories. This show needs to come back, I have seen every part and this is true quality. <br /> <br /> display stations near a New York couple, plays close to the concept of six degrees of isolation and with a clever strategy that links their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so Caseman enjoys. The strange situation is amazing and clothes are beautiful. We need more displays like this that make viewers feel like they are intellectual people of drones. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't come back, six degrees will be seriously damaged.
