I gave a score of 8 stars. This story may have decreased over 3/4 of the way to the photo but the show remained very strong. "Men of Honor" were changed from "Navy Diver" for such understanding. Anyone who has served at any branch of the weapon perhaps feels that "Respect" is a suitable word in the title.
