I was fascinated by this film when I saw its preview on Oscar night. As I read about Kay Pollak, I walked. We Americans are suckers for the child to return. I understand that this film was a great column in Sweden. If North America is too much I can reflect on the reason. Perhaps it is because of the terrible joke that Lena's behavior makes at the beginning of the film and other social views but perhaps because of the central message I believe you have the same appeal everywhere in the developed communities. The message of this film to me is similar to the Titanic of the film. Life is short and even anyone knows the truth is all we have. It can be taken at any time. So is it not pity that we spend a lot of time behind the walls that separates us from others because we are afraid to hurt? Breaking the walls is painful but it feels false on the other side of those terrible walls. Feeling alive should take risks. Give and you will receive. So start start now. Many people criticize this film for lack of reputation and other errors. I say you are a pseudo-modern. Find poor people, for example, fable for us who are rich wealthy wealth but their souls are in great poverty. So join a choir or band or help build a house or distribute food for those who are less fortunate than you. Spreading joy and making the world a better place when you leave and talk to your partner. Writing checks is not enough. We are a social type through. Even the humble ones of your fellow humans can influence you in ways that they have not thought possible. Personal glory has its place but has increased more.
