I had no expectations; I would never hear about Jamie Foxx; all that I knew is that the film has a strong character in it. I thought it was so entertaining; it was fun. The plan was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interests. For me, Foxx is original. David Morse is strong (actually, this is not his best responsibility). I thought the expulsion and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and it was done well. I didn't expect too much and I was surprised with joy.
