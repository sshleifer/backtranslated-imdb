I am sick of people complaining about Ewoks! True, they are not the best thing that has ever happened to Star Wars, but they did happen, so use it! Besides, they are good, and I don't care if they are suppliers. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The latter can not be better. I am happy with the risk of Phantom because it will suddenly give us the goal of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I like how he was revealed at the end - it would also have not been allowed any other way. So those who complain that the Vader hat is removed, make time to think about it. Very good. Vader, a man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, has finally been revealed as a sick person. He is not quite a machine - can be infected. I don't know how the director gave what happened to take such good actors in A New Hope. They all do very well. They are loyal characters. Hamill works best with its great character development. Fishers do a good job as a female model (I mean, come! He killed Jabba even though many others have failed!). Harrison Ford - I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Music has also been very good. It's very touching and useful when you can choose the character of the character in different parts of the film. The best time is when Luke screams "NOOO!" and jumps to fight with his father in the final battle. John Williams is not short of knowledge! What an amazing person! Already, the film means more to me because of the Period. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
