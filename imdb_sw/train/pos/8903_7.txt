Indeed, it's 50 to drive a special car, but don't let that fool. In my little book, there is a lot of touch mind and unexpected dollops of humor. Get Miss Porter, who is worthy to keep an eye on doc position. He not only steals the area, but tries to close the entire film. And where the indie producers came to the film with color, the wise decision, since the blob was not found well in b & w. Yes, the results are stacked aside as the goof number shows. But except for a few young people, a non-Hollywood cast does well. Then also, playing between fire-rodders and cops comes as alive and entertaining. Pretty get better with several more directors at home in the pulpit than with the sound action. Apparently, they wanted to show the youth to light when the screens were filled with "bad guys". Then again, 27-year-old McQueen can't succeed in the old age department, but can control fire behavior. The movie was hit at that time, helped together, of course, with an interesting tune title that got a lot of radio play. And except for the ultimate effects of unfortunate, the movie is still a lot of fun, driving or no car. At the same time, I am waiting for the return of the blob now that polar icecap turns, will we say, the refrigerator water.
