At the end of the season it was sent to a mixed message, I felt the feeling of happiness, and also the feeling of being led and deceived. Roseanne tells all her audience that the whole nine season was false because her husband, Dan, died. He also admits that the family did not win the lottery, and the 9th season was just a lie as he liked or wanted to be. I'm still confused about when he said Becky finished with David, and Darlene and Mark because Becky and Mark agree to be pregnant. So I believe that's how he wanted to be, but it wasn't. So the season was good, but it sent a mixed sense. I always have a fan of show. :)
