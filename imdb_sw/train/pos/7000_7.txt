When I saw the first name I had taken on the topic of the film - it was clear that he had no reference to the UK currency, so it was to be Shakespearian and the amount of body pounds - to take them, or to give them. Will Smith is an actor to feel, so the fatal killers were out. It is only possible for the person who gives it, so it must be on a charge in some way. I destroyed the whole thing by observing and knowing the story before seeing, as the beauty of the built-in way is part of the history of the main character being provided to gradually shine the audience as to who he is and why he does what he does. It is very difficult to do just because it is very worried and sad, which is not the basis of encouragement when you are hoping to drive a car - you know it is not good. I can't say a movie promoting suicide; comes in a very strict form of volunteer - murder of faith. It is also a brimming and symbolic everywhere, which is a sure sign of the certainty that the writing has been thought to be tricky in the deepest and driving sense in the most sense and deep sense of reflection. The most popular theme that he beat me was that he did not just give him a loving and romantic girl, but he had given her physically as a great gift he could. He decided to die, but his plan is faced with the fall of love - the next thing is what it is. Ideally. <br /> <br /> Yes it is very slow, but I don't know if it would be better reduced in a short time. I did not feel the problem with his terrible internal problems as I could, but maybe that's the only one I used myself before. Saying all of this, it is a very moving and natural film that is a great tragedy and a stimulus that will be worth the reward.
