The most intimate and sensitive world of emotional and emotional experience of a young 18-year-old specialist, which makes his first experience in his gay love for another boy, during the holidays and part of his family. <br /> <br /> I loved this film because of its clear and interesting details, and all of these "Sound-close-ups" and during the quiet wich was full of great moods. <br /> <br />
