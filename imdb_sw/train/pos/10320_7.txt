*** Destroyers of the *** *** Ron Ely is just the same as Doc. Cool, quiet, almost always in control (and with constant penetration into his eye). What? What can someone else ask for? I have never read the Sawa Sawa book, so I do not know if you are faithful to the source but I enjoyed the tone of voice and play. Many people have compared this film to the Lote Boxers, which I don't think is right. The difference in the budget is surprising (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not work in the area that the Raiders have. Special effects are also low but come to people, stories are a lot of fun and humor is just the same. Sousa's music is interesting (love the theme of the theme - Every time I see a film, I'm going to tell the story for a day). The best way to achieve this film is just RELAX and enjoy it. The highlights include an exciting opening chain where five amazing and Doc expels the Indian sniper on the New York roofs with a very funny fight series between Doc and Captain Seas. It's not a good fool who sleeps in a big chair (actually!). In general the great movie to watch the rainy day. I give 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you Lord is here!
