Robin Williams is doing a good job of combining comedy with pathos, but it comes off a bit. Donald Moffat also writes as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is better though as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, making a film through many bad parts. Fills time well, but it's a little more than that.
