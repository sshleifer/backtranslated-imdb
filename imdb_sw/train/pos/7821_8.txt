Denzil Washington rarely makes a bad movie and comes to his thinking that goes to Kevin Kline and in this case, this should count as one of their best films. It is more about films about how strong friendships can be more than the story of Steve Biko though we get an understanding of what a person had how far a writer and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the name of mans and let the world be a ruin, what was lost in Africa South was. The trend is better from David Attenborough as it was with Gandhi if there is any opposition being planned that could be in the length of the film. Two and a half hours are long staying through the historical movie. It's amazing how he can control all things. Thousands of people in both films. This film does not open your eyes to what happened before you broke the Aparthiet and you can't fail it. 8 out of 10.
