I enjoyed the "Nemesis" of Albert Pyun for his cheesy act with a hard script. Many people complain about the "frustration" plot of the first film, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a dumb like the most successful rocky plot to be taken through. This gives the name of the first movie hero, Alex, for the female female hippo that sent him back to save later. He is raised by the tribe in Africa. The best part of the film has a conversation in an African language without a subject, which I liked because it made it seem true (how many times the movies try to do it?). It is not worth long for bad cyborgs for a moment to go back to seek him and try to kill him. Do not make a mistake, this is a piece of skin (not first that it was a big thing). There are sanctions involving African political chaos, treasure hunting, and ethnic violence. The pictures are very short on the mind, so none of these things get good treatment. Images are essentially derived from fighting some of the chaos that explodes under the muscle-babe vs cyborg. It has the value of entertainment, does not expect quality, or anything of the first movie.
