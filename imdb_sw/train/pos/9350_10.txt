let me say that I love Adam Sandler, looking at the rule over me I was really listening to his actor <br /> while raising his voice, I am a wrong help but I think gilmore's fun playing on a golf ball, then I like back as Adam Sandler takes me into < br /> <br /> Lead on me is a good film, a movie that comes from the first and you expect a feeling in every zone <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a good job and there is no exception here with some very nice and worthy lines. Oscar in any movie that makes something worth it! but I can remember a great thrill in many parts of this film / txt / support Help was also good with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. The beautiful NYC drama the best player and the new honors found by the Sandler Adam if you always doubt or assure how big Don Cheadle is
