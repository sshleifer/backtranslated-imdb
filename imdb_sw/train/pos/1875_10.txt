Wonderful film of high quality. It looks like realistic events which, as defined, has a clear horn on it, this movie has many emotions and is deeply moving. The child who is used and abused is often going out as an adult, as one of the failures of life, being a gangster, addicted to drugs or a burden to society. <br /> <br /> Antone Fisher as a young adult in navy, is worried. He is on the edge of being strong. He is advised on treatment and psychologist and it is the relationship that takes the center stage in play. <br /> <br /> In return-return and the cure and treatment for Antwones angst is revealed. <br /> <br>> The best displays from the whole cast. Stories affect the family's tragedy and emotional and physical suffering. All actors provide full displays of blood and faith and originality. One message from the film is the importance of talking children properly. The real Antona is supposed to succeed. Having endured evil as a child but raising it, it shows a very good character. And for all those outside who have endured these suffering but have been saved and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
