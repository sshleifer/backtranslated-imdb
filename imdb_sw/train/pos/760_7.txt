I haven't seen this film since '80 years' and I decided to take VHS version. The program is very slow, and participants seem close to the robotic in this flick flick. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. Departure is actually better in this movie than "Breakin" ", but it should say" Breakin '1 & 2 "bear energy and excitement on the screen better. It's a movie I will put in my library, but it's not a movie that I can look at, only once in the blue month.
