The old story of Jane Jane looks very popular these days. I have lost a number of circles. Probably the reason is that its "ruts" are our "ruts" even when this comes. This mini-TV series gives you the right direction for the novel. Head, Emma views is a beautiful girl "modern" when you think about it, although the ambience of the world of Jane Austen may seem to be a fake tad to us today. If you have not seen EMMA, I will only say that Emma can get enough to come to her. It's worth watching to know how. Honorable here goes to women: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They can almost have a mental relationship with Jane of the past!
