This is a very interesting project that would be very talented. Collect 11 prominent international directors and share each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and chapter 1 to create a part of their choice; every short exploring international reverberations of 9/11. Without using any trophies, I would say that a piece of Ken Loach is a stone in the crown, and a short of Mira Nair (section "India"), according to a true story, deserves a complete film. Man also knows, looking at the moment, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today? he is a middle teacher, who also has a great understanding of the issue. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are also done. Youssef Chahine, in his part "Egypt", considers the Arab state of self-guilt, which the piece may be more attractive. He fails with sadness. The short Chahine is an improper text and has been badly beaten, at least enough to stand between others, the best image of the film. Despite the exceptional quality, I would like to give you a 7/10 film for the concept, if not implemented.
