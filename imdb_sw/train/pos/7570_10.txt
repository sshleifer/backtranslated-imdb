I recently bought a very helpful Dreamcast and went to the city to find games to use. I bought the Soul Calibur (A classic) and then passed the Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have a bad Resident 1 and 2, and I have played many times with Res Evil 3, and I have been fascinated by all, especially no.1 which descends in history has classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them comes anywhere near the dream of Gory's Brilliant Gameplay. If it's just for buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every time of your time and effort, I've never been very interesting on a computer game in this way it has hit me. However, the story continues from the story 2 which Claire Redfield is looking for his brother (Chris - from the story 1), who thinks he is lost under the plot of an umbrella organization. Little is known about this organization except the fact that you though you have destroyed 3 times in the original story. <br /> By helping Claire, as well as a super brat Steve assistant, you must open the truth of your brother's location. CD 2 lets you control Chris, ifs if you manage to reach off without entering the room for fear. <br /> <br /> Control is very slow and the movement of the characters is very strange, while the scenarios of dangerous events, he / she faces the direction you are coming from. GENIUS KURE !! <br /> <br /> Overall I gave this game 10/10 because it's just a game of the game, a ten-year game with the best game in the full stop of the world !! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
