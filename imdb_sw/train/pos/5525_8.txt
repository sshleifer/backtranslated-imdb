Any problem many people have with this film is that they seem to think that the story would be more entertaining (ignoring it depends on a true story) or running against a film that glorifies Che (which is not really true). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's biography of the Head of Che and receives the correct story. Soderburgh has a good job of imposing an unexpected emergency view that was the Che Adventure of Bolivia. In fact it gets a sense of discomfort and confusion of Bolvia supporters for revolutionary ideas or problems that her men are faced with hunger and land. Sorry to pay attention to the film fan out there but that's what happened. So do not enter this film you expect to shoot Rambo em, its true story!
