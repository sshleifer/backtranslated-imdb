Movie movie-I liked it. Extensive editing and sound use. It gets a real sense of Indian life, but we can all involve it. The best choice was made by some characters. The movie promotes all the characters in order to care about them all and you will feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and dance in some of the soccer events is good and the direction works for everyone really coming as true and natural. You can not only help but strengthen Jess in this film! Acting was very good, even the physical walk and the body's position of the two leading women is very persuasive as a man who played many soccer.
