Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. The head of the shot and beautifully, Harem Suare is a bold film that faces a ethnic romance, which is a taboo in Hollywood. Women of each copper, size, and color, form a film. Cut off from the outside world, women are sharing in telling stories about folly, contests and jealousy within their ranks.
