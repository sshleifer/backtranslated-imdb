It is fully suited to its elegant selection of Hollywood, this is a small gem of entertainment with lots of pizazz and some good surprises. The most amazing exhibitions include a hilarious shot (and a shooting shot) of the WW1 line area with Australian Clyde Cook player as a client of hope and bad McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman Member? all under the beady eye of the Anguish of Ralph Sanford's happy cheerful. The lost McDoakes led and led again by Jack Carson's amazingly similar; assistant director Chandler enjoying the role of McDoakes: "I'll be the director!" <br /> <br /> Ace of comedy O'Hanlon has two roles, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Of course, Richard L. Bare who is engaged in one or more part in a series, has left that position here. In real life, Bare is the appearance of six-year-old Rock Hudson, but here he was taken by an old actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
