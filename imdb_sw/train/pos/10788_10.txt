Big rock candy candy is amazing. I watched it when I was young, and still doing today. (senior secondary school). if I could think in heaven, it was seen. I would like to live in a great mountain of candy where candy will grow on trees. Zach Hyman is profs, and my best friend. Little Bunny foo foo is someone. it is fuzzy and the color that I dreamed about it at night. In fact, my friend who is 18 recently looked at it for the first time and loved it. I recommend that people of all ages see this film. I have a big party this weekend with all my friends watching this amazing film. we will order pizza and look at teddy bears. I always see myself looking at the clouds and I want to be a little girl to visit. thanks. bye.
