Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that may have any damages). Just watch this wonderful movie without knowing anything about it - and you will have a very great experience. If you would like to see an intellectual, misleading story: Go, get a DVD and you won't have a desire. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi film, beyond the psychological excitement set in the global business environment. It is about the company's secrets, how big companies spy on all research departments and methods used by them. Actors make good performance and the overall image of the movie provides a perfect cool state. Cypher is deep, more complicated and - what is the story and the end - too, more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali other movies "Cube" and "No". The truth is one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something that doesn't really say about every five flick made well). Sorry, can't tell you anything more about this film without harming your experience. Give us a chance. ; -) \ t
