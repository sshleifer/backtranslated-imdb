Certainly no of my favorite Austen novels, and Paltrow is not my favorite actor, but I have seen the film really enjoyable. Paltrow works fine, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays 'Miss Bates' are all very strong. Time information is not sharing; The feel of the movie is just the same, really. But really 'get' is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. He could not have more reflection, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but I found it very strange to man and man in the film. It looks good to Northam and exciting eyes are not a hindrance to happiness, either! It is highly recommended. AnaR
