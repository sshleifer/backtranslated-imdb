I missed the whole season of the show and started watching it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I am quite mad on the show. I think the whole cast is better. It's one of my most popular show. I just looked at the ABC program for this fall and didn't see it on schedule. That's really sad. I hope they will return ... maybe they wait until Bridget Moynahan has her son? Or is it just my opinion? I read some comments sent about the show and saw many interesting words, like mine. I certainly hope that ABC will investigate its decision or hopefully another facility will take.
