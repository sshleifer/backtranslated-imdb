The 700 club offers a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as concern or anxiety. I get a plan to have information and mobilization. It is common for many to throw mud on a plan that has proved to be very successful. There are a few exhibitions that can describe a 40-year track record of success in the media of the TV and the Club of 700 is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may be wrong to say that a person should be killed, I find it strange that many people will push themselves to run on the resistance bandwagon. I have indeed said foolish things in my life. I undoubtedly will be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he puts a great show.
