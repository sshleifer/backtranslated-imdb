Author / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones has gone to great things. That's what I had after seeing his film "Cross Eyed". Often an independent film leaves a good feeling like he did. Carefully and carefully written, "Cross Eyed" lets you share from beginning to end. Adam Jones cannot be named yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "executives called" will be the box office box. I think it still has a chance to be seen by the main audience of the stream if one film distributor takes time to work on this film. No matter where the end is, if you get a chance to see it you will not be discouraged.
