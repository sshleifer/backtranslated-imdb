I've got a lot of touch like Spike and Heaton to stay together all the way through this film without saying that there is no little betrayal on the way. I thought the expulsion was put aside the relationship between the two was before I think. I was already thinking that there was a homosexual interest in Heaton's part. My favorite place was a little where Heaton and Spike had run away from the rock and Spike runs away I thought that Spike didn't come again. I must say that if it is not for our lessons of film teacher who likes to watch this I'd never see it. In general I thought this film was good and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of British films made.
