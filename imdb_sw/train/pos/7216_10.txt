No one can destroy this work! Modern amazing! It is written by the expertise of Ira Levin and is shown by the best performance of Christopher Reeve and one of the best of Caine, this is very good. I would like to get a version made somewhere ... maybe someday I'll come. I hope that this unpopular, ignored film has not been too hard to find because it is 'must' for any Hitchcocki, Agatha-phile or a movie partner. One of the few movies I could not solve or predict and get a second or third value, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and gets every quarter. We need and deserve more movies like this!
