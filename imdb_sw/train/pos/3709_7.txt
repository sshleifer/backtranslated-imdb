Any print screen of John Grisham's story deserves a popular Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is about the last director I would like to go to take anything. But this south-dried pot is very good. While not among the best of Altman, it's certainly not one of the films he has made that leaves you with your head and wondering what he thought. <br /> Altman had closed his hat with a secret excitement and black heads before, in his 1973 film "Good long." "Gingerbread man" is not close to the film, but it holds well for himself. Kenneth Branagh is a role-playing lawyer who finds himself in custody for a post-collaboration with client (Embeth Davidtz) who has supported his support to protect him from his cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The film has been set up in Savannah, Georgia during the tropical storm, which makes the film so hard that I have loved so much. It continues to turn toward the end of the film clunkier and clunkier, and Altman assures that not all are suitable for photography, but generally the film is not the worst for the Altman canon. <br /> <br /> Also star Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
