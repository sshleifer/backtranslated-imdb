The section Meg visits the mosque and says - "Does the piston give you a short time?" (The meaning of sexual gender on the part of his wife) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as in this amazing film. Very dear and very intelligent. His words of rage you want him to be yours. The hero performs the mechanical work of the garage for a good physics change. Einstein had a romantic partner for her psyche? Round the puzzle in front of the media and the audience done well. It is very deserving and worth it to try. It loses one vote for meditating a very simple theory made by the US Govt. I don't see why it doesn't appear on the top 20 romantic comedies. Best Movie, has a presidential seal of approval on it!
