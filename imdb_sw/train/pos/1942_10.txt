I consider myself a great buff of the movie. I was sick on the bed and I hit it in this film. From the opening to the end I was looking at these chief executives, I'd like to see, say a great word. The explanation was good. It was just what I needed. I hope this message is heard on any negative comments written by others. The director has a heart and beat with all its actors. Thanku to make a film like this. Just amazing wonder, the characters of the best kind who are wrong with grace every time. Just beautiful. I cannot present this without 10 lines in total so I will continue to say that I would like more from this director, more from all participants in this film and more from the author. I didn't want you to remove it. Finally
