I must admit that I had not read the original M R James story although I have read many other wonderful stories. I have also seen more of the BBC's previous Christmas stories and this, in my opinion, exceeds most of them, compared with Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can't be guilty A View From Hill - direction and 'mood' is perfect, such as acting, lights and, of course, stories and writing. I am very pleased with this and I can only hope for this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC's plan to do more (not the basis of M R James's stories) is so promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
