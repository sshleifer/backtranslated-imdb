Walking to tightrope between comedy and concert is one of the most powerful acts in movies. What? How do you laugh out of other people's troubles and don't start hearing bad when it goes on for a long time? Well, this small gem of this movie will give you a great big panic, beautiful surroundings, and quite a good buzz too. I especially like the idea that the trick of history made legally since the white Europeans liked it, and legitimate marijuana, because 'those other communities' used it ... of course it is true and shows the color side of marital law so that it can be openly exposed to people in the world around. <br /> <br /> A wonderful description of "DVD Extra" ... in fact, two of them ... they run all the films with all actors, then again with the authors. I continued to see things that I was certainly not on the first movie, but then realize how easy to lose the comedy of the first trick to take. It's hoot! Don't miss it! Star 9/10
