At the Disney World Day celebration has given the film "World". Stopping away from any messages of darkness and punishment, we are recognized by the most beautiful pictures of animals in their homes without feeling very bad about ourselves. The stars of the show are a group of elephants, a family of polar bears and whales and calves. The story begins in the North Pole and continues south until we reach the tropics, all the time being brought to the residents of the various weather areas they have traveled. Temperature Wind is mentioned when we see a walking polar bear; The details have been made by the ice islands that have declined in recent years. We cannot see any crop cuttings, but the search for the purpose of the father for food causes a dangerous solution. The sky caribou shots migrating around the tundra are one of the most amazing wildlife shots he saw; and another migratory aircraft is enough to pay the import price to see them on the big screen. One of the aspirations I felt was that the worst shots of white sharks take seals were done in the course of the process. Never had any sense of one kind of wild animal; Their amazing speed. The way to slow down the film to convey massive animation I think it started with (or at least the first I remember to see) the television show "Kung Fu" during the early seven years. The interesting view is that if the credit scores at the end show several of the filming methods used are disclosed. There is enough, exciting and educational time for this film to make a good choice of natural buffs. Perhaps because of the choice of choice (giving them, as it were, from the grisly end of the animal-animal) and the fact that this image was released in 2007 and available on DVD is a solid film for its own right. And you can take your kids! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
