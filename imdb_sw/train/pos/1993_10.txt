This is the music change of "Oliver Twist" of Dicken. For the most part, the original story has been taken, though with a small flow of some films (such as the summer he used again and half brother) was not released. The main difference in the film and the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin relies on - a different end to this music film. <br /> <br /> This is one of the kind of music - a person whose style and scope was not done before or since. It's not just songs that are often seen and unapproachable, but the film choreography is seen to see. Although in most songs a few people or maybe a small group play, here the numbers often go to hundreds or perhaps more. In fact it is a sight to see and I was lucky to see in the playground when it started and is one of my earliest memories. After seeing a few times ago, I would like to say that the film has been better than time. Great sets, good acting and singing - this is a special treat that is difficult to dislike. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the film again tonight, I was surprised and how high and female Singing to Mark Lester there was a film. In fact, according to IMD, her singing was a girl and this would be obvious because of her voice.
