EA has shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you an excuse in the world of 60. Photo game is excellent and also record sound is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after release), and I'm still fascinated by this game. It is embarrassing that EA will no longer make games 007. I would like to recommend this game to anyone aged 13 and older. The only thing I didn't like in the game is the Russian boat level, it was very pressure. In general I love the game LOT!
