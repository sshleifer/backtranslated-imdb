You saw the first time in 1975 at the German TV station and used immediately, and later I saw this film about 12 times in the movie and today I have a videotape that I look at once a year - this movie is the best in every feature (leadership, acting, ward , color symbols ...). Seti is the best and most surprising, the idea of ​​a world-bound immortality since the last thirty years seems to be a prophecy of the 1936 film, the "Everytown" dictator is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just a beautiful, reliable and indeed cast as "hero". Send the best to technology and development is quite enjoyable and today it is usually the desire level - especially the completion area that brings tears or two eyes, even after watching the film often. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV but it has been done with great screens, so if you have the opportunity to see it on the movie. please do, it's very big.
