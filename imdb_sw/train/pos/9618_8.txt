I recently bought this film and did not listen to anything I really enjoy having this film to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took film less than a month and spent EUR 1 million to produce this great film. This proves that it is not just a great production that makes good movies. <br /> <br /> This movie name is perfectly suitable. In computer language BUG means a software error that causes the effect on computer work. Our effects can cause these negative effects, but also a good time of beauty. The events that occurred in this film start with the death of BUG. The person who testifies "crime" on the other side of the road ... From then on everything becomes harder ... okay.
