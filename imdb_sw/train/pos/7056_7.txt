The story of Cinderella's most famous story was to remind me of some of what they did with one of the Beauty & Animal movies. That's three short stories connected to 1. <br /> <br /> Okay, the mouse is good (I love Gus! He is very good!), And Lucifer is amazing (as usual). I liked some of the new characters also, (Pom Pom was interesting and I did it as Prudence.). However, the story was small, but still very good. So, I voted 7/10.
