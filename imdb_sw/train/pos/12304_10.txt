this is a good movie. I like to climb down to get his ink, and bones dismiss him, but fortunately he blocked them, opened the window, and did not even see them. xiao qian is very good too. & when he stuck the needle on the Wu's butt, its hysterical. and when he says love is the world's greatest thing when standing between the two swords is also great. then also the part that eats his buns while watching that person killing many people. then you see him reading poems as he ran away from the wolf. The love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and Ning look cute together. add time to comic, great language, and be afraid, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention special special effects for 90 years.
