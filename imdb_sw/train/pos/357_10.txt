The film is very enjoyable and beautiful, and the best trends of James Eves. The movie is entertaining and very charismatic performance from Stephanie Beecham and everyone is fully cast. James Eves has a good eye to make and lead as a conductor to know at any time of action, fall and then increase the peak. He does this with a sense of humor, a lot of losing, exciting and blood. This is the return of an old vampire movie, with heavy loads of blood, blood and noise. The movie works at great speed with the characters taking you on a bad adventure, but what works is that the film does not take itself very seriously with a lot of language at the point of cheek.
