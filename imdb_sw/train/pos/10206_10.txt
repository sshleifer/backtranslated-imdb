In my years of attending film festivals, I have seen many small films like this that are not available for distribution of exhibitions, and they reach up to $ 3 in WalMart. I got only a DVD of Yank tanks there, a great doc, but it's sad for you to complete as a rock-bottom salon. I like this film, I wanted to see it on the movie everything. I would prefer that the New Yorker Movies have changed the name directly. It is good for Americans to stretch a little. If the film's head helps the US audience to explore random confusion, it is all appropriate. Cinema imitates life & visa versa. Also, I have found that it convinces them that the lower heads hit prices for dollars. Come! Euro is not difficult to think, make the audience of gringo do math. To see the film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have a damaged effect to be reminded: I am an American watch movie and they translate the Euro to the dollar for me. <br /> <br /> Looks to see more of these actors and more from the author & director as well.
