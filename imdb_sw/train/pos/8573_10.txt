In 1996 "Dalmatians 101", Cruella De Vil was arrested by the city police of London (God bless them) by trying to steal and kill newborns 101 - dalmatians. All covered with mud and grass, spent the next 4 years in "tin". Now, 4 years later, he, unfortunately, was released from prison. I say, that's 28 years - in dog years !!!!! So, in 2000, Disney decided to release the client to a lifetime version of the classic film and is here named "102 Dalmatians." In it, there is a dalmatian of 102 added to the family (Oddball is a name, I think, I must know this since this was shown on TV soon), and the puppy did not have any advertising !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again motivated by Glenn Close) has run away again, he wanted a bigger and better coat - made again from youth !! <br /> <br /> I liked the theme of the theme - I am sure everyone likes the "Atomic Dog" song from 70s or so. And now, we hear a little in this film !!!!! "102 Dalmatians" is a very good film that I am wondering - WHAT ISAWA "DALMATIANS 103"? ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
