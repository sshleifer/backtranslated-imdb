This film was just amazing. It was a very sensitive issue and the film was very good. This film did not create any strife in India (as I knew) and its broadcast was also put down. I really thought that this film would only waste time since many of India's directors and producers changed to change even though it is very sensitive and increases the story of love in the original story and destroys everything ... many Indian audience will agree on this topic if you remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc .. It has been a lot of movies in India that would be a big step or mega affects if a part of love stories cannot be added. <br /> <br> But its treatment is the same as the Pinjar movie (it must also look at). If I count then I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a big film.
