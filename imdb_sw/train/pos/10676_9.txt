The film was hit in the gardens of Gerard in Liverpool, and it was a British response to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film manages the time test very well, and all moral stories still (or even more) are relevant today. This feature of the film works well from the British actors like David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays with Liverpool soldiers for youth responsibilities, and it is certain that if you catch children at a young age, they will end up being an adult. The most popular titles in this film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow are playing with brothers and sisters (they are true brothers and sisters) who are found on human internet. Tsai Chin is still working and can be seen in the recent film Nicole Kidman 'The Interpretor'. Battlefields include a guns in school, so it is impossible to show on TV following similar events in Scotland / Russia. I lived in Gerard gardens where the film was shot (although it was not born at the time), and has records of the area. I have recently completed a document on the Gerard garden which includes a couple of 'Playground Games', with a small British film 'Coast and Coast' which star Lenny Henry and Pete Posttarite. The houses were destroyed in 1987 and films go somehow to preserve records. There were some complaints from residents when the film was released, as the film showed the area with a bad light. Time has helped to heal the wounds. <br /> <br /> Gem of the film, I'd like to recommend this out
