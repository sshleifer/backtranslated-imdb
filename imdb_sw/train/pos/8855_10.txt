Sydney Lumet, though it is one of the oldest directors, still has the game! A few years ago he shot "Find me guilty", evidence for everyone that the Vine diesel can actually act, if he gets a chance with a good director. If he had retired after this movie (the true center in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he still continues to be strong, his next movie has already been announced for 2009. But let's have this movie here. The cast list is wonderful, the highest level of their performance. The small light in their exhibitions, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that are transformed into all movies are amazing. The films (time) of the film, which you have fingers at all times, connect the lines of time so that it can separate, that editing appears to be normal / non-emotional. The story has increased so, although even in the form of "normal" time, it would have at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only recommend, others are up to you! : o)
