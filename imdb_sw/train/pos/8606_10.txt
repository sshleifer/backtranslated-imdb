It seems no foundation in the middle of this film! Many occur in dreams and, as many dreams, are often ignorant and legitimate. It is also a good production and other great songs and excellent performances, especially for our angels. Jeanette's ambition, insulting and other insults of faux pas in the dream reception is hilarious, and its jitterbug and Binnie Barnes are a surprise and joy. At one time, it gets a snippet singing from Carmen, followed by the last trio of the Faust (with lapdog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - great entertainment as you can get into the groove.
