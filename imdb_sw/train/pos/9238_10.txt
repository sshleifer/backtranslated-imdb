Although some have said that this video is the last version of the two shows: "Fire in space" and "Living Text", if you're looking at nature it shows you will get conversations from this scheduled video version. I've found this version of the best video because events and lines were added. I would like to say if you want to see a show in its original version, see video versions on VHS. They have more to give a fan than previous events provided on the DVD now. Another good video is Winning the World, which had more events from Galactica 1980 than real advertising. In general, I measure this as 10 because it gives you more enjoyment than the networks wanted to show in the slot time they gave to producers.
