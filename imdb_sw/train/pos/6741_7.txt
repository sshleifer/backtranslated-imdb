The sequence of the head shows the characteristics recorded on the rainy road with rain as people run; The music is provided by the person who plays the film "Street Scene" of Alfred Newman. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: boy on the right side of the law. But he is very good for a good man. After several complaints about his people who refuse, his master, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), asked him. Foley tells him he is a good person, but he needs to get his head straight and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who has only developed. At the same time, Tommy Scale (Gary Merrill, with very good performance) has a legitimate legal game and looks to make sucker from rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), who was brought by Ken Paine (Craig) Stevens and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). He says his pastor is too late to use him as a decoy, and Paine attacks him when he refuses to play. The ignorant Morrison intervenes but Paine takes away the cold. That seems to be worse, but later it turns into a dead person; and Paine seems to be guilty. But this will not be Paine's story. Soon Dixon has fallen in love with Morgan ?? but not before losing anger again and doing a terrible act that he is trying to cover. Morgan's father, a taxi driver around technology (Tom Tully), can take a rap for it. It's on Dixon trying to push the blame on Scale. Otto Preminger leads the script for Ben Hecht and three others from the "Night Cry" novel by William L. Stuart. This is the black film of the film with the best pictures and all the shadows and good values ​​we expect from this kind. It holds until the end of the wall, which looks like something label has fun to enjoy the censors. Of course, the classic black led by Preminger and stars Andrews and Tierney are "Laura." You will be happy this, but you can't miss it.
