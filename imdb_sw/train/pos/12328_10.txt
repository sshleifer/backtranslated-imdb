"Bread" reduces the massive filming of the horrible films and "Dead Dead Dead" in special and regular. Production ethics is a little bad sometimes (it's a student film, after all), but never loses its interesting goal. Hey - George Romero liked that it was enough to insert it into the video "Dead" video tape, laserdisc and DVD ... which should tell you something.
