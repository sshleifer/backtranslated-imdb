These are one of the movies that do not require any brain or thinking, it's a wonderful time that you have forgotten one or more hours. I was so surprised by John Abraham's acting as usual to play a gangster as a character with an impressionable face, so from playing full play and doing it effectively, by managing to shine between comic skills such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also surprised for the 3 Akshaye girls because there are responsibilities that will not require many talent but to complain about the failure of Akshaye (for other girls) I was surprised as they could set up with real and can distinguish between them a good thing, too many songs it's beautiful, it's color and fun so evening boring this evening will surely reduce your heart.
