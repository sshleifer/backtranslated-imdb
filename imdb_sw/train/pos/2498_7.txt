I chose on the 'Risks After Darkness' box, and just looked at it because of my interest in Hyde and Gackt's performance. I expected a horror film of a corny which was a great fighter and very bad conversation. Which exactly what would have been done in the US. Instead I was surprised by the positive development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) comes through the movie as a person. The two-star masterpiece was amazing, because it is not academic practitioners, and the director did a wonderful job with all of it, putting it in place instead of flying cars and holographic banners. On the other hand, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very awesome. The only film I saw was war Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be quite the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is a bright, happy and hyper, serving as a kind of comic aid and its antics. Shogo was a very tough boy on the island who was killed without thinking anything. So, look at his performance, if you know and fight Royale, you will be amazed at him. <br /> But don't get lost in the back of the box, because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a real reality and what's going on, and you love the last place. It is a picture of moving to a certain point, the picture is very good. Obviously something to take next time is on Blockbuster.
