I saw this film first in France in one or more years ago. It came and went with a little fanfare, but I enjoyed the beauty of photographs and pictures of wildlife. (Story, good time, it's true. If you have really thought about it, there is no way more than what happens can happen in real life.) I have seen again tonight, here in the country, on DVD. Again, I collect it with very little distribution. The people of Blockbusters had only one copy, and I do not remember that you have ever played in the art gallery in Cleveland. Seeing on my TV, the picture is not interesting, although it's still very good. The wildlife footage still attracts. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old and the fox is even less tempting next time, when you know where it is run. However, as I said, the story is normal. It's a good film to watch, and if you like wildlife pictures, you should find this interesting.
