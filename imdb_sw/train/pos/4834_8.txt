For anyone who wants to get a sense of the Soviet view of the Russian history of this modern film is a treasure. The story begins at the end of the 1900s in the yellow color of the old sepia of the old image that improves the black and white in the middle of the century and with the full color when the story is approaching modern times (ie 1960s) > The story focuses on a young man in a remote village of Siberia, who is a mark of arrival and arrest of anarchist during the Islamic era. He later joins Bolsheviks after the coup and brings Soviet Communism into his village. His son, with inner beauty, fights with the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil sector takes off and we are dealt with in the Soviet economic situation. <br /> <br /> This film is long and slow, but quite logical and well done. It can be seen in three parts.
