I like the way that this game can make you completely jump out of your seat when you play. The way in which the screen comes and shines when you hit, it is very realistic at the same time you should remember that its only game and not really there. Sound effects and sounds are amazing. There are many weapons and different spells of cast and you can even choose which spells do power or not. You get this stone that can knock back enemies when you return manna to hit your enemies with more magic. The best part is that the whole time you play is the one that is very scared of what can go around the next corner or what can fly behind you. If you want to get full experience, try playing with the headphones on.
