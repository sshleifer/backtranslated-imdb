Adopting the opening of the opening opening is a good man with a fantastic dream, all of the truth too. Installing in its dystopic 2054 Paris, the film begins to follow the woman in the grungy club, where she and the Slavic bartender meets out on the deck. They shout for each other to the effect that he has given him more debt though he believes he will earn it all. Another woman prevents sexual violence, only to have a bitter fight with a woman herself. The first woman is dropping, and she has been robbed. The Renaissance of the Christian Volckman appears to be another in the line of recent photo-animated sci-fi science, but in spite of whether it is true or true, it tells a well-planned spelling story that prevents us from the darkness in its minute The opening, even when introducing Karas, a hard-boiling officer we know from the beginning as someone waking up from a bad dream. All films of an old films of the film are all affected without any change of anthronistic, for all purposes and purposes. It is in the hardness of the monochrome which the Volckman's French excited did not follow the example. For filmmakers, who have never had any physical lighting problems that can usually be prone to, they have started with a completely black shape, and thoroughly prove white-white according to action on the screen.

Typically, films try new developments in animation that enable their technical development upstage other components of production. The city of Sin, for example, the left substance to deal with the beautiful screens from its natural resources needed. It can be angry, it may have its own story collection and its voice over just having enough, but the Renaissance, made for $ 19 million more than six years, not just looks like real black rather than severely written legacy, but also not secondary to all visible innovation, which is played as it happens. One stops thinking about how cold it is when Karas avoids shooting through the village of a crowded parish of Parisians, but more about his thoughts of life and death, how life's tragedy, like death, makes life more meaningful.
