Climb this to a dark night with a storm and prepare yourself to be misled, angry and frightened. The old top of the phantom train which is said to run through the English country alone at night can be implausible, but it is very fun. There are some old pictures like "ACCIDENT" which citizens can remember but they will not talk about. But basically the movie is a player of Arthur Askey's car to show his punches of a humidity between the awesome bits. Askey's comic humor is not the most trendy these days, but if you allow the washing on you you can have fun. This is probably the best of Askey movies.
