The first review I saw of what he said "what madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say?". Will he say something that determines? The best thing about Page 3 is not recommended on either side. No any propaganda. This is the most popular film of the issue (I do not know what I call "issue" here) and yet if any non-standard film has not been a solution. I was surprised when I realized that the film had stopped as such as it started. <br /> <br /> The movie defines most characters who are completely different with different situations and different situations and are still all part of the system that is more interesting. I would like to say more but there will be more damage. So see Page 3 if you want to see one of the most mature movies in recent times.
