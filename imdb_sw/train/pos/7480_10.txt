This film is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. He takes the attention of the audience and his role of David Aames. His behavior may involve us in some way. The story line is very clever and puts the audience on the entire film. I've never watched Cruise movies before but after seeing this it shows me its real talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end where all comes to a great conclusion and he finds the truth. If you haven't seen this you should still try it. It is one of the films that you start looking at you should see to the end or will continue to think and feel sad. My opinion must go only to buy and take the risk of what I did and became one of my favorite movies of all time. It's * 10/10 I have promised once you will look at it, it will hold you and you will love it forever.
