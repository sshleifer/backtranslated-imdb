About 30 years later I remember this original PBS film as interesting. From time to time, I look here at IMDb with hope that someone has had a good sense of buying right and putting it on a DVD. It is September 2004, and I continue to hope - very exciting. One of the two leading administrators continued a small task in the evening soap; The other, Frances Lee McCain, appeared in small responsibilities here and there for a few years. But nothing they did before or after comparing this small film that was released, if I remember, in a short PBS series that showed the original picture play for the new and above play and coming. I looked at it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the VCR era, so I didn't come with its record, except in my eye mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 Additionally: Happy New Year, women! This beautiful film is finally available on DVD on ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVD is provided on the personal copy of the author.
