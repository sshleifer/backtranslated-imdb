This is an old movie, an amazing movie of children and certainly a good witch of novice ever. Unlike many modern stories that appear to be clear in the black magic, this is just a magical story of hocus hats which are beautiful, lighter, and charming. The story returns back in 1940 in the English Peppering Eyeland, where three of Cockney's children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are saved out of danger from War City II. They are taken to live in the price of Eglantine, who learns through the course of communication being a teacher of learning. Eglantine and three children use a bed of magic to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they meet with Emilius Browne, the chief executive of the Miss School magic training fraud school. Miss price puts on working on the planned stories to bring in non-life items. At the same time, they should also deal with shady behavior called Bookman and colleague, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is really very interesting as a female witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson has Mr. Browne, head of the magic school of destruction, who has now turned the street witch. The actress was previously taken as the father of children in the Mary Poppins film. In fact, this film is the most memorable story of the early Mary Poppins, all the wonderful stories for children. Perhaps this movie does not have the most memorable music like Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts a few small voices. Some have been important, but the movie has very special effects. All in all, the story is good for family entertainment. It is a pity if modern children also have modern and interesting stories, which should appeal to all of us.
