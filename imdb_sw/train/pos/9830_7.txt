No one knows the logic behind the calculations of the zombie-flicks of Italy, but? honesty ?? why are we bothering? Each single film in Zombi - "series" provides great fun, nasty gore and free wounds and "Zombi 3" is not different from this, despite all the production problems that occurred when shooting. The film started as a spectacular project for Lucio Fulci, who had more clarity on his successes of "Zombi 2", but it became a common product of Bruno Mattei with more errors and the stolen ideas from previous films. Screenplay is not ignorant and ignores all types of continuity, any idea of ​​considering "Night of the Dead of Living" and "Crazies" of George A. Romero is constantly repeat here and work shows are really sad and bitter to watch. Yet all of this has not been sad for one time because of the above-top high compensation for everything! On the basis of the secret army in Phillipines, scientists finished the bacterial virus "Death One" and preparing for transport. After an attempt to steal the virus, the deadly deadly dead body has been cut off and the zombie ashes are affecting all residents of the nearby tourist village. The final group of survivors has to fight against strong and non-physical zombies as well as soldiers in white packages that have received instructions to kill everything that goes into the dirty area. This movie compares to the "Nightmare City" of Umberto Lenzi. In fact it is bad ... but a wonderful entertainment and order of quick action and several instances of zombie-mad creation. The undead airplanes were original, for example, and a whole series of zombie births in the left hospital was too good. The head of the head of the fly is not as bad as it has been made perfectly in this cheesy and impressive Italian army. Recommended for fans; do not worry negative reviews.
