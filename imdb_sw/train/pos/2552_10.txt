A bad mistake is a very good movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart, and David Lewis are in the film. The movie lost all that did well. Robert Wagner played his good role. The relationship between Saboto Jr and Turner was good. There is probably a big difference in that age but it is only a few. Two characters worked together well. Music in the film is very good with Ron Ramin and it is very well suited. There is a group of things that happens in a film that you don't know what's going on and what will happen next and this movie lets you start from beginning to end. If you would like Robert Wagner, Antonio Saber Jr., and Janine Turner then watch this best movie!
