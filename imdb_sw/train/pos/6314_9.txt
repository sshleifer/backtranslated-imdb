I went to the movies with my two friends, and I took this movie out of the hat, without knowing exactly what to expect. And it is very enjoyable, a pleasant experience to die! It is the best movie and unexpected stories, very good conversation and humor of things. All characters are obviously made in the "Alan Ford" (the Italian style of Siriric), but it has not bothered the second. In fact this kind of lost-speed line made the film unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and influential position, Willian Macy also, Clooney unknown and brilliant. But the real stars are actually Guzman. He made the role of his life in this movie! The incident when his character Cosimo dies in the film, it is hilarious that has made me stimulate and almost die with him! It is highly recommended for all fans of "Alan Ford"!
