Baghdad's thief is one of my ten-time movies. It is exciting without gore, it is well closed and the art of art is free. Provision could not be better. Rex Ingram made me pregnant. And the destruction of evil is actually captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar on very high. I look at this film at least twice a year ... and never take it out. This film is an adventure for all the years..no-one too old to enjoy. Bahgdad's thief tries my memory for the most innocent time ... I was ten years old when I saw it with U.S. it was about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was a very good actor that was able to continue with the "evil" base for a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda collaborated, I believe, and Justin and Dupree again in the "four furrows" .... The great making of the film!
