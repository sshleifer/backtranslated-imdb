For anyone who has seen only the Disney Productions version of the beauty of 'Beauty & The Beast', or even the vision of the fairy tale of Jean Cocteau will be completely defeated by this 1975 French (but with the director from Poland). The program involves a French family of fallen aristocracy which drives in the well to make a family of English. The main thing is that the bride has an old curse on the family. The film also includes multiple flashback cycles (possibilities) to describe this family curse. From the opening of the opening, to the end, it is an almost non-stop travel, and some sexually explicit and sexually explicit content (therefore, the X film rating in U.S. runs at that time, which is currently not included). The movie seems very bad in the class of administration perhaps reminding one of the Bunuel airplanes in the same area. If you have a fantastic taste, and you are not offended by "taboo" material, then this film can only remove itch for you.
