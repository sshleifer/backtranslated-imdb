Chloe has been saved from Dr. Caselli, a damaged doctor responsible for transferring capable patients from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and the second part Clark comes. He sees that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and they meet in Kent Farm. When Bart gets to Lex during a break at LuthorCorp center, Clark finds that the Red Cursus also employs Bart (a.k.a. Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to explore Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join a trio to save Bart and invite Chloe to share their message. "Right" is the best place to date of this 6th season. During this period, the Justice League begins its saga with the participation of five heroes: Clark, Red Cursor, Flash ("Impulse" ), Aquaman and Cyborg. Participation for Chloe is amazing, completing an important organization for cooperation. In the end, Oliver crosses with Lois according to the importance of fighting off the criminals and the secret laboratory of Lex around the world. Voting for me is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Right")
