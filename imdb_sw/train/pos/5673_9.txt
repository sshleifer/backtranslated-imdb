I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best one of the series. <br /> <br /> Actuelly events are all amazing, personal I really like part with 'France's invasion', but one and the tradition-makers, in 'MACBETH' is also interesting, the way Rowan keeps playing with them is true (English) Humor at a high level. Pastors: 'Never say again, always call Scottish Try; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say to Scottish? Staff: Yes Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Rowan and I have a lot of work, but I think made a series of Blackadder especially nice. <Br /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his good style, but I think we can trust him, because he is already working on the 2 Beans Movie, which will happen this year, I can't wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this Blackadder 3 of 9 out of 10 Rating.
