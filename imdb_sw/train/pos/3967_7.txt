This is not among the best films of Jimmy Stewart - it is quick to accept that. However, while others see his film as clean propaganda, I wonder what is wrong with that? Yes, indeed, as the TV show of the FBI, this is the obvious case of the Bureau to make some PR work to try to call help. But, if the entertainment goes, it works fine. More, surprisingly enough for the time done, the film focuses more on crime than the wind and "Commies". Instead, it is a fictional of one of the first agents and the chosen job. Now considering the agent plays with Jimmy Stewart, then it is certain that acting with the text were good - if this was a real budget movie with a label who did not lose a star in the flick of the third level. In general, it is worth seeing but not too big.
