I have the interest of interest and the ghetto culture, I am white and like a classic rock, however, did not prevent me from appreciating this amazing comedy. Its very good way of This is the Wind Ring for that is one movie, just on the rap instead of the rock. However it is hilarious. There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat. All characters are very funny and are believed. I just watched because it caused me to laugh at 3 a.m., and any movie that could make it permits at least a test examination. One of the reasons why these movies were so interesting is that it laughs rap from different. Rap today deals with bad things and get to the studio noise and little talent. This movie comes out when the recipients deserve more credit. In general, it's a fun movie with a lot of jokes about racism, sex and music between the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of this is the Spinal Pipe. They are basically one movie, next to a different world, and yes, the same joke works in both movies.
