Von Trier immediately explained how he made such a great involvement from the viewer and his movies by placing his world film in the center of the real world and the world you think of. So if viewers think we are looking at the "true" story when we are actually being used well, it is often up to the movie that works to bother (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, Dogme's films did just like a car for this theory (instead of creating enough attention on Von Trier). Stories are common to Von Trier: Our hero is idealistic, it seems to balance his relationship with everyone else, but soon becomes a victim of the problems that others have created in the past. The idealist inevitably should reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes a terrorist. Man has been destroyed by purity only causes damage (self). (These things were also very similar to the Wave Wave and the Dark Player.) The movie is also full of confusion (even humorous) under the role of Germans and Americans in Germany after the war. <br /> <br /> If a successful technical movie is done amazing: shift and spread contaminated colors, screens, screens steps (as soon as the mayor's most interesting). In this film we can see how good Von Trier handle the film as a technical medium. In his later career he seems to be declining from this (as if he no longer cares for technical achievements because they find it very easy).
