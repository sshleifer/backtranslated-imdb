This recreational PM is preparing with enough shot to make John Woo say, "Ready already!" Of course, it's not so close as Woo can give but it takes a good job at 90 minutes. When his wife is put in place to kill the Governor for the use of a watch-like cyborg, it is for Eric to cancel his name. Wilson gets the duty of Van Damme as he leads the leader of the hero and his bad doppelganger of cyborg. Why the Academy has failed to identify it more. Being a PM production, there are tons of car run, hitting cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shooting out. I loved the car that was moving before it reached even near the truck. My little bit involved with the neighbor's girl came up to the full karate in the simulator of Don. It is just a chance to show some of the LAWNMOWER MAN scenery effects circa 1995.
