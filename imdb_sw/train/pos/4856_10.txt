I first saw these years of film and I have seen it several times a year when I have a chance. It is on my list of proposed movies with some scholars. What? Anyone who tells you is stupid or lost, don't ignore itâ€¦ this film is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. Playing is not important in this film as in other movies of Astaire movies so comedy and acting shine through. See this movie as you can, it can be light but it is still quite exciting. So I know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies can't be funny, this movie should make them change their mind. No one I know can watch this film without being at least amused silence. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without playing. He can be a good singer and a talented singer but not just interesting and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy gets a little cliche but sometimes the vaudevillesque exhibition of G burns and G Allen is just perfect for a piece and can pick up anyone looking for easy laughs. Make this film even if you don't like old movies, this film can appeal to any ignorance.
