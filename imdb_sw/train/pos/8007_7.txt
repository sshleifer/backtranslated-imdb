This game is very addictive, I continued to play for one hour until midnight but also the fact that you can not save the game when you are in the space provided by this, sometimes I just had to play for the order not necessarily open any game data. Yes / No Yes, "Freelancer" prohibits but also quite solid. Also for example, something that was very worried is that you can't fly any cutting area with results that sometimes you have to look for a short-time mining area. It's a great opportunity for me to look at my email or talk to my friends and other things like that, when I had to wait for the reception area to be ready. <br /> <br /> Story begins promising but more get all the ignorance gets. Also the game is quite close, at least you did it to me. It is obvious that they beat the next game. I don't know if the client is at work at this time but I'm sure I will take it immediately once it will be released. <br /> <br /> Gameplay is very simple! Even for those who do not know the flight games. To put it boldly, all the fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and require a lot of effort. It took 1-2 weeks to complete this game which can be very short. But thank God for the choice of the most player! It lets you continue to play short missions, as one player's game once you have finished through. Even though a lot of service is the same, it remains just a cold in the midst of other big dog dogs. <br /> <br /> Images are beautiful but not anything of revolution or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game but beware of his mistakes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
