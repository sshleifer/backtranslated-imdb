I've tried to find out about this series for years! Thank you, IMD! I saw this as a child and I have never been able to remove my thoughts. As a 6-year-old, of course, I was particularly attracted to part of the cyclops, which was quite horrible (I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of the model of a plastic cave, which I still have) I also remembered, though , it was the atmosphere, which was common from the beginning - strange, unusual, and very real. When I read it many years later I felt the same feeling. It's a very difficult thing to catch - and maybe not possible in Hollywood. Every 'Odyssey' I have seen since now has been widely allowed. The characters in this series seemed real, real people - the ancient Greek people - and not the Hollywood stars in clothing. This is a real jewel! But - Why is not well known? And why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I would just have the opportunity to see again!
