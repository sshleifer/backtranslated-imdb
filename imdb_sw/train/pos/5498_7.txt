This document has been revealed on the RTE and the BBC in the last number of months. After seeing it twice I would like to recommend to anyone with interest in the media and text. <br /> <br /> This document had the meaning of the political life of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Irish workers left with these goals. What happens when they come to Venezuela are amazed when they preach the first hand they tried to be overturned by rebel groups (particularly fat in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government. What we viewers are witnessing is how the media uses the situation and actually returns the revolution of Chavez by undermining the events that occur as the revolution increases. It is really a good documentary with a wonderful piece of work with two novice filmmakers. <br /> <br />
