Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. In secret, he was attracted to his usual neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). He gives a spell on the Shep which makes him do his girlfriend and fall for him. Things go well until Gillian knows he cares so much for this person. He decides to tell her the secret. But how will Shep deal when he finds that "dropped" to fall in love with Gillian? In addition to the bonds of the 1950s, Bell and Candle's book are good, but nothing is interesting. It's looking enjoyable enough and should appeal to almost anyone sitting down. It's not just going to the film you expect a great thing since the bread has been dried. The movie is cute, funny sometimes, and the last touch. Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing good work with real chemistry. Novak (if others said) seems very strange in the form of the lowest way. Help support with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester often laugh sounds and steal a lot of appearance from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that the Book of Bell and Candle cannot determine what kind of movie it wants to be. What is the comedy of comedy? What is a romantic comedy? What is the odd comedy? He had a director Richard Quine with only one technique, the movie could be much better and more memorable.
