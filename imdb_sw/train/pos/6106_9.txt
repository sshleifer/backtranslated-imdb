When it comes to modernization, I am lucky to go through the first 20 minutes of the plot without lifting or looking at something else to watch. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Do Not Touch Me) explained two very powerful administrators of Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this exciting stimulation. Kira is a lobby as "Kim" a good writer of innocent romance who gets caught on Doug Jeffery's fraudulent "Man" guest. Kira loses control of his obstacles in the role, and as an actor, giving what can be just T and deep and faith. I believe that its best performance remains. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for growing.
