Other comments on IMD have compared Dog Dog Dogs and Catac III's classic 90s, but of course it is brutal, violent and very low, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not a real evil , sufficient or sufficient consultants to get a comparison. However, it still comes a punch that makes it worth watching, especially as pastoral, hard-planned action is your thing. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian man hit-someone who goes to Hong Kong to kill the judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, a fighter fighter who has decided to follow him down, whatever cost. With Wai installing his goal, Pang leaves everything to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, a good legitimate immigrant who needs his help to avoid his violent life. <br /> <br /> The concert and beautiful performances, the amazing sound structure, the haunting mark, and a strong exhibition from Chen and Lee (with the Pei Pei guest as the love of Pang), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans the hard fight against Asian violence (think with Chan-wook revenge lines of revenge). Stabbings, shootings, stripes and sympathy: all occur frequently in this film and are found free of charge and Cheang director. In fact, this is a kind of story that should be the end of happiness for all involved, and indeed, every good person in this film dies (death of death). Unfortunately, there is a narrow line between the epidemic and (unintentional) comedy, and in its last time, Dog Bite Dog crosses: in the last mysterious area of ​​Pang and Wai is locked in war as Yue emerged. Finally, after all three had serious injuries to decoration during the fracas, the injured Pang makes Ceasare of DIY on (now dead) Yue, giving their children the time before his death. When this film may not be a 'classic' bonus of Hong Kong, and its OTT actions proposed by stylish images, it's still worth searching.
