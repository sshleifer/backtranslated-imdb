"Jake Speed" is a good movie with good news. It has its errors. Sometimes it's a little slower. Launches his villain too far in the story. The action is facing the heart rate of the snail. It has Z tablets (though I have always accepted Karen Kopins's work, who looks very good at Sandra Bullock). But for all these contradictions, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, due to a delightful script by Wayne Crawford (who is responsible for title) and Andrew Lane. Why do I see it so inspiring? Because it says to me "Hey, why don't you try to be a good person." The story is essentially "a stranger in a strange country" Cluster, that's a good-and-hero Jake Speed ​​is placed in a real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is over Scout Boy. He is more than a knight in weapons to shine. Jake speed is a holy hope of hope in a dirty, meaningful and evil world. Because of this "Jake Speed" is needed to be hit. It has a good message that you should have come to Hollywood and then to the whole world. Think about the film industry that has found itself to show good and respectable people. I don't say that we should watch Waltons in every reminder on cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" could get a chance. ("From the South," a TV show about Canada's Mountie, it is a good comparison of what can be done to make fun of American entertainment.) , but the general message is that if you try hard to be a good person, you will beat the power of evil every time. 10/14/99
