Robert Duvall is a direct member of the General Confederate Robert E. Lee, according to the movie's IMDb.com movie. After seeing this film, you can imagine the appearance of Duvall is the regeneration of the best. One of my favorite films. I like the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or there was a voice of sound available. Wonderful scenery and music with "all-real-to-life," especially for those of us living, or migrated, South. This is "real time in time." Life goes on, slowly, but "aliens do not remain."
