I had already reached thirteen when I saw this series first and look again, on DVD, over thirty years later. Photos on opening credit has not been left to me. It has affected my views of the world and people in it. My parents had me long enough to see the series with me, and we always discuss the future plan. He loved me the love of reading history and the highest score I got in the public school exams! Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and the eternal offer is not available and it is perfect. I feel that people who lived in this way will feel that this is the history of World War II. I can't imagine ever looking. Perhaps this series of Cold War can now reflect, although who can replace Sir Laurence as difficult to think. <br /> <br /> Buy!
