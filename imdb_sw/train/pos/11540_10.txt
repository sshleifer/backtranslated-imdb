This is the work of Neil Simon who has earned a lot of praise! "Unusual marriage" is one of the beautiful gem that sits inside. Una Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); sand, fine sand, and the head of his partner, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); The total slob. These men have a great job though. Felix is ​​a journalist, and Oscar is a sports writer. All these men are divorced, Felix's wife is close, while Oscar is on the other side of U.S. West Coast. Well, what can you say? Two men living in one roof together without driving mad, it is impossible as much as possible. It's a lot of laugh and a lot of fun. I liked the place where these two British couples are talking to two dignitaries, and after Oscar fled Felix, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to eat with them the previous night. It's about the time Felix needed to strengthen. I think every good neat-relief to strengthen. They can be fussy, but they should also be patient too. Very enjoyable movie, and classic nuevo. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a must see a classic movie. STARS 5!
