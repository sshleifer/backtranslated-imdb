In the traditional G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street And Name, now comes the FBI Story one of those films carefully film which showed the Federal Federation of Investigation in the best light. Although it is the 48-year-old director of Ed Edgar Hoover, it would be displayed in any kind of light. Don Whitehead's book which this film is based on the direct history of the office from the founder in 1907 until approximately when the FBI Story film came out. It is sometimes necessary to remember there was a FBI before J. Edgar Hoover led it. Some of these are covered in the film as well. But Warner Brothers did not make a document to give the flesh and blood of the FBI's false character 'Chip' Hardesty was created. Trusted by James Stewart is a FBI student who graduated from law school and instead of going into practice took a job with an office in the early years of 20 years. <br /> <br /> In real life Bureau led by William J Burns Burns Private Detective Agency. It was really a political operation as shown in the film. Burns was in the input of the rule of Harding. When Hoover was selected in 1924 in order to bring about the implementation of academic laws and high levels of power, he did just that. For the Hardest family which Stewart and Vera Miles wife we ​​see the history of the FBI to open. In addition we see the history of their own family that is closely linked to the FBI story itself. Stewart and Miles are absolutely sure all the American couple. We will follow the FBI through some of the Stewart cases that they do, arresting members Klux Klan, conspiracy of fat burners Indians, bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties, their participation and arrest Nazi supporters in World War II and against Communist spying in war cool. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of introductory parts where Stewart explains the class in the FBI Academy before going into the history of institutions as intertwines and its ones. It involves a bomb installed on a plane and a child who bought a lot of life insurance for his mother before running. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the characters and stories are the most sad today. <br /> <br /> Of course if FBI Story were written and produced today it will reflect something different and not all of the US. The FBI still has a story and it's in any one negative way. <br /> <br /> FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best film, but it's the first one I've seen for my favorite actor in it so it has special love for me. If the whole FBI was created Jimmy Stewarts, I'd like to feel better about it. There is also a good performance with Murray Hamilton as his friend and colleagues who are killed in shootout with Baby Face Nelson <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not just marry Stewart., He actually married FBI as the film shows. It is written more, but still has a beautiful and interesting story to tell.
