I have to admit completely, not a big fan of "family" films these days. Many of them, IMHO, are a sentimental crap. But this, like TOY STORY, the original film from Pixar, is a lot of fun. The two leading actors were perhaps a little bland (especially compared to two directions in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but some of the films than they did. Animation seemed good, humor, though broad, was very good (I loved the hopper line "If I have never promised a mother to her death bed that I will not kill you, I would kill you!"), And executives make sounds, except two directions, both were awesome (Denis Leary doing movie animation, it's a concept). And like everyone else, I loved him out! I hope the video has new.
