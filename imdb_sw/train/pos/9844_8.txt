There are very few movies that are funny like this. I was fortunate to watch this film on the "saved" movie for the flower of the film like me, so it is not embarrassing to sit there while I laugh until my jaw comes out completely and the sleeves of all my shirt were raining from my eyes ... < another story was a little "slow", but this is perhaps the best - a bit of rest between the squares (I almost fell out of chair ...) was more welcome.
