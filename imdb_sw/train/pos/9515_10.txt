One of my proposed movies, and the end of nostalgic. The movie is about the family of Sullivan, to clear Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer says so, and one expert. One of the children wants to know the work of his father (a big mistake), so he hides his father's car and well, seeing Tom Hanks working by saying that. The Mafia does not have a '' '', '' Mafia is not successful, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone who works on the mafia and the big house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but doing the wrong work, or doing something "your master" does not want it, and you turn it down, and be killed. You can see what I say on the film, Sullivan Jr. he sees something that he did not need to see, and well, almost all his family is killed by "bad thing" his son made. The movie is really entertaining, you can see how Sullivan live after the expulsion of the mafia, or the kinda of it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sad kinda, it shows us about revenge, those who work dirt people do, almost everything you like. Hope that the boy reads these comments does not work for the mafia, and if you work for the mafia to have permission and take you out of the country before you are killed by your boss and their staff. <br /> This movie gets: 10/10
