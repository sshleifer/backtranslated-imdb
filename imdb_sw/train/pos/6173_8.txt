Good movies. Acting - from a doctor to a stone artist to a great prostitute, and a very small difference, was strange; I thought razdan soni (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the little known characters. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who can be charged to be more powerful, presented a reliable and common character. Another great thing is the work of the camera - and how it builds the energy of the bombay roads, the gustad stability saying his prayers and life within small rooms. I liked the story of the wall that becomes shrine and then breaks - and the philosophers take. It is best to see good movies on Indian themes.
