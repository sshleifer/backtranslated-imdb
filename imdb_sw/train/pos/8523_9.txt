I was a fan of the book since the third grade, so of course I had watched the movie, read the series, then I watched the television show. It was a good show itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only problem is that it did not follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so desperate that I opened it. But that comes from a girl who owns the first book. But after a while I decided to try it again and ignore the book (such as what you do with Harry Potter movies). I got a wonderful series! It was a clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, enough enough to make everyone go. It's really enjoyable! Clean and wonderful!
