This movie, to me, is about family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not for himself, but for his family. I can't start to tell you how I could tell a little girl that my father was going to Kansas City for Priest Holmes and the Kansas City. He would think it was more cool, like Morris's son did. Living dreams and family are what this refers to. I think only the father who has a close relationship with his family can really know what Jimmy Morris did.
