Eddie Murphy is one of the most funniest ever - probably funniest. Delirious is the best comedy stand I ever seen and it must have anyone who likes good laugh! I have watched these films often and when I see them - I'm still happy to split the side. This is definitely one for your video library. I assure you that you will need to look several times to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing too much - that you will lose half of them! Delirious is hilarious! Although there are many wonderful comedians out there - after watching this comedy stand, most of them will appear as class-class citizens. If you have never seen - find, look - and you'll love it! It will make you preach !!! : -) \ t
