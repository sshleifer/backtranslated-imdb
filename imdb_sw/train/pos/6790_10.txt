This game is one of the best RPG. The fist, in fact is more exciting than any other because of the war system (harms the enemy according to how you try to attack, you can change into the dragoon, special attacks, magic ...). Script is very good. All behaviors are good and you don't have a long conversation to support, as happened in several games of the last Fintasy series. I got bored for these talks over the past, when you just want to continue the story of the game. Transfer is a jewel on this game, combines the fantasy of the middle age with the fiction of future science. It is amazing that the effects of animation are so amazing, I love them more than others in other modern games (we can't remember that the Dragoon Legend is 8 years now). Then, Map is great, there are all types of enemies sites. Finally, Music is not the best player I heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
