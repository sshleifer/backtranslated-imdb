For God, it has been a long time since I saw this. Probably 18 years ago? Movie tells us (children) all about human blood and circulation system. Very professionally put together - drawings of Disney-style, with human actors - led by Frank Capra, for the ring! <br /> <br /> Type of overkill. I wonder if the very high value of production is worth the value of the film-line information on the human body? But the boy will look at these children: even now I can remember clearly. Baxter has a challenge with Hemo himself in his name what is similar to human blood, which Doctor answers immediately "sea water."
