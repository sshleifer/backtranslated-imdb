Polanski returns to the theme of selfishness and madness which he learned with great effect on the Child of Repulsion and Rosemary, in the Planner. <br /> <br /> The sky is a trademark Polanski - dark, fills, does not know - but there is something awkward on this film and I don't know if it's not deliberately. Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of the best films of Bergman, does not know his right here. If his name was one of the things that attracted me to this film, I had been a little disappointed in how a few of the incredible realistic movies were on the film. The only thing that allows the movie down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but it seems to have refused more than he can chew with a difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some cast is better, especially Melvyn Douglas as a landlord and Shelley Winters as concierge, but others are weak and miscast. It is also difficult to adopt the fact that all these so-called Muslims have American accents. <br /> <br /> Before you expect, there is a good time of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who saw the Vampire killers are not afraid that Polanski is a good comedic comic. However, there is a time when you are in danger of becoming a parody. The Trelkovsky pump (and some non-defined) 'change' is more likely to add smaller than the fingers, which prevents you from what might be a bright time on his psychological journey. All, The Planner is a fun and amazing experience, if the little also feels for his own benefit. There are a few that are very interesting and uncomfortable and surprising but this film, at that time is very good, does not hit the score as efficiently as it could. Alas, at the end of that day, the 'good' movie of the Polanski film is still better than other 'good' movies. Certainly the value of watch, not just expect to be beaten off.
