Each of the major labels left one jazzy-reelers in thirty-thirty (with Universal to take control). While many seemed as cheap on the screen if they had to do, Warner Bros. (which suddenly ceased to do in 1946) was often known for their camera angles, mirrors and eye effects, thanks to other creative directors like Jean Negulesco. It should be the best of this kind should come from this studio. What is happening "Jammin 'Blues" away from an existing pack is that it is more compatible with an avant-garde attempt than Hollywood. Published in July 1944, converts a regular jam session to a "trippy" dream-of-the-war problem, shown by the "On The Sunny Side Of The Street" tune. Gjon Mili and Cameraman Robert Burkes (later working with Hitchcock) were allowed great artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio could take care of how little he and his song were presented. The printer of the eyes is used well, and many images of the same actor appear immediately. (Norman McLaren actually did this process two decades later in the "Pas De Deux", when the team of Linwood Dunn got a different effect in "Citizen Kane".) The main emphasis on silhouettes and lit lit cigarettes was also in front of its time; somehow, this was the first sixty years of psychedelic, but for three years of the film's normal film.
