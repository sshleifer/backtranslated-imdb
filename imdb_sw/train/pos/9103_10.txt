In life, we first arrange stones (Piedras in Spanish) as work, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we will find a space between these to integrate small stones, our small needs. If you act in an inverse way, you won't have enough space for large stones. The five characters in this film are women who could not prepare "great" stones in their lives. Ramon Salazar, director of the Spanish motion picture defines the first stone stones in this way. The film describes a series of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky) Again, 1954 -) All are struggling to remove stones that continue to appear in their way, or worse, in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new place in life. The best stories of these five Cinderellas are that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also star in "20 centimeters," "Busco," "Crimen Ferpecto," "Entre Vivir y Sonar," "Hongos," and "Octavia."
