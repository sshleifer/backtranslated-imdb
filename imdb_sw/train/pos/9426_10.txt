This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed until my sides separated and around the floor. If only the person could be released in America. Region 0 or 1 - Sio PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it's released in the UK but that's the Region 2 and PAL instead! Let's give this series a shake with the right. America must know this series. Moffat is a professional. I loved Tracie Bennett, an interesting role in this. Of course I loved Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Give this show in America! or Show again in PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please delete us, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
