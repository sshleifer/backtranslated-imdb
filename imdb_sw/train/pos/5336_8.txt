I loved this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like these are not available at the moment. I must say this is one of the best movies ever, which describes the difference between the people of Hong Kong, and the Chinese continent. It shows that there is a disruption between these two, but it can only get better if HK learn Mandarin. It also showed me how the Chinese rock land is located in China, and that the Chinese people know how to beat the guitar and get funking the house! Anyone who says China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is quite good, and his pure and pleasant voice, acting trust, and magnetic chick. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about the purified Asian people from the most common Western species, and people who love Chinese / Asian movies as myself. Look out!
