> Contrary to many reviews I have read, I did not feel this track of any rock film ("Spinal Tap", etc.) The story was more unique, although I feel many people want to see "sex, drugs & rock and roll" evil that band continued . <br /> <br />> Like America, I knew a few of the participants - Spall, Connelly & Rea. Surprised to know "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi (<sp?) Classic "Romeo & Juliet". I think I will be forced to hire next. "FARMER" - My wife, who comes from Mexico, did not follow English / UK well, missed some joke (which I explained gently) but cried her eyes at the concert area . He likes a song now. <br /> <br />> Funny that Amazon.com has a sound voice of $ 30 + usd when I bought a DVD in a bargain bin in Wal-Mart for $ 5.50usd. Non-understandable price, I first noticed this on the night's cable and have died to find it since then.
