Atlantis was better than I expected. Somehow it had a much better story than coming to other high-quality films. Although this film required a great time of caution. It was a good film for all ages. I saw some little audience expected comedy but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parade of strict parodies. Many of these children have not seen anything but parodies. After a short time everyone appeared too much to look at Atlantis.
