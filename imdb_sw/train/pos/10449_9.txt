I have never heard of this film a few weeks ago, but his idea of ​​me loved me when I heard: an American man meets a European woman last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It made my mind, but I did not expect to be this great thing. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it is also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, he was quite uncomfortable in the 1990s. It is impossible to talk very much about it, for there is no real plot, to say (although there are so many interesting things that you can talk about, it's kind of Food and Andre Food. , where there is a discussion, but not a dialogue that is relevant, but I would just say, see. SEE IT!
