I first saw a song from this DVD on a hifi show in 2006 in London (I wasn't in the cream until now !!) It was through the final Arcam system, it looked good with dts. It needed to get this DVD and I'll tell you this is off DVD The exciting musical I've ever seen. The performance of Cream at their age was just the sound of the beat and the quality of the sound I heard on the music DVD. It doesn't matter what kind of music you like, this will definitely grow on you. It is a great beauty of their performance that will make you look at it regularly. For some new musicians they don't have a mustard cut these days, if these old singers do.
