I have read many bad reviews of this film and eventually got the chance to see it on DVD. Be honest I don't know what the trouble is. It is a good passion for the genocide, shown from a different perspective, from the seat of the most common killers / suspects who have bad drugs, including the king of porn, late John Holmes . Please read the synopsis of the plot for the exact description of the film program - I would like to contribute more to the inspection than the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many viewers went now to give this movie their low rating because of abuse but surely I don't see. Most modern movies were worse - Save Ryan's privacy was finally more violent than this movie, which often depends on the effects of blood than the actual brutal killings (the killings shown in this film were made by bullets, after all) <br> /> <br /> I was proposed by both half of the movie - first showing John Holmes as a financial offender who was hungry for drugs, and the second half to show his side as a little human in bloodless blood. The movie has a good acting, though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little out of place in his biker-esque man and goatee'ed the bad personality of a young man. <br /> <br /> Sound sound was also amazing - a wonderful mix of B-side 70 with a hidden mouse, it spreads over a few hours in all right places of Ala Boogie Nights.
