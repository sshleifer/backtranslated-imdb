Bug's life is a very good feature. This movie is for young children, but it is also a good movie for people of my age. The story is about an ant called Flik. He brought havoc on his colony when he destroyed the food that was a high animal. She gets banned and must be given a large bug to fix the mess. This movie is classic because it is a good movie and is a Pixar movie. Animation is especially brilliant in the 90s. The story is good, but more details will be enough. Sound work is as good as many animations. Music is good to listen. No special, but it got a selection for one of the music groups. In general, this film has hit me as awesome. This is a good movie for all families. I am filing this 10/10 film.
