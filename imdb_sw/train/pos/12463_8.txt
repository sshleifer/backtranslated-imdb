Nora is a mother of two who still wants to live a little artist's life in the 1970s, such as her friends, a group of writers, musicians and actors. Free benefits of love 'is not out of the system? and Nora did not count the fall of love, especially for the junkie. Hazlehurst won his first two AFI awards for four years to show him the amazing Nora, who makes sure he is doing the right thing for his children, but he likes for Javo's Frifels. Garner ?? who would later vote in films such as PENDA AND IN ZINA and STRANGE PLANET ?? it is well cast as the original daughter of Nora, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for her role as host of the HOT HOTEL program in 2000 ???) looks like a beard painter. Initial efforts by Cameron's director is a winner; he continued to make the award winning MY BROTHER JACK Awards among his future projects. But it is a wonderful delivery of Hazlehurst which brings mental life, finding a script, according to a novel winning Helen Garner award.
