This movie, though it is about one of the most popular topics of Mexican producers: extreme life in our cities, has a way to make it on screen. The most important Mexican reporters, of the end times, the history of our city system has been developed in a variety of literature as it can be farce or satire, which gives us a more explicit film in our country, but he explained in a very different way that provides a clean tone. <br /> <br /> For the participants a little less familiar, but that translates a very good way to their paper, each of the directors reflects in its story capabilities for that we've been discovered anywhere in the world, that the ability to laugh pain and make a sad celebration. Perhaps for most people in our country film is not recommended, but I think that people of other countries can get interesting and share the Mexican victory.
