Zentropa is the first movie I saw in years. If you like a special show that has been affected by film films, then this is just the right medicine for all winter's winter winters. Von Trier Monitoring as Breaking Waves has gained more credibility, but this is his best job. It's flashy without worrying and gives a perfect mix of humor and humor of darkness. It's too bad decided on mobile phones were a wave of the future. It is hard to say who told him away from the style he showed here, but it is everyone's loss that he entered in his great direction of teaching doctrine instead.
