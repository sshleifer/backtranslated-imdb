The movie has a very feel to play right from the beginning - I think it will do better than the movie because you put it and drama to make movie movie appear also too fake. But, still, it happens well, and the story & especially the discussion is interesting. They have taken a lot of conversations like the real play. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw games. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds & with a wonderful flavor, and the act of Helena Bonham Carter makes a good job here. Her fiancee, Serges, is also a very cartoonish when she is really supposed to be a very good figure dashing. His parents are happy.
