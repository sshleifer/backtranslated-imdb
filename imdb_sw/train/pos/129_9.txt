With amazing movies and thread of Kafkaesque ignorance, this movie was with me from an easy location still interesting opening. The movie has a lot like a dream, and I think this might be why people either hate or love it. The characters are given largely and the story itself is a little and perhaps a little. But these are the failures of the film but the choice of consciousness. The film does not attempt to work as history, but it is the building of the 1940 war movies. This is one of the most popular movies ever, and there are wild ideas in its style. I can understand why people would like it, but I give 9/10.
