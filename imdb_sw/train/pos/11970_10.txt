The perfect house came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing again the run of the American Video of Funniest Home and Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me that she was also in a show called House Full. One day, I was lucky to catch a part of the family visit. It didn't seem to be interesting for the first time, but as I looked more and more, any night at 9:00, I just want to be that. <br /> <br /> This show makes you want to be there yourself, depend on girls, go with them, and maybe even join their small family "sing together". What I love most about Full House is that it is a great show for children and adults of all ages. There will be areas that are more for adults, then the parts for children, so that the whole family will benefit. No matter how cheesy can be, it's still a great show, and I of course recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
