This movie is not good, but it's nice and enjoyable. It feels like an indie film released out of the script to play. Morgan Freeman basically struggles himself, though the director vows that the script was not written for him. And there is a small irony actress that goes into the supermarket to do research for the film that he is not interested in yet. I mean, he really made a film at the end and we're looking at it :) <br /> <br /> I got a little too good conversation for my taste, but it would never fail yet. This is a film that encourages the viewer to look at their lives and choose the direction to go. Very little emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. Underneath down: a small film, released in two weeks, and two participants basically with extra bonus, a conversation driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
