I finished watching the movie and wanted to comment (and right) for the film. First of all, to get the same things, this film does not make it anything except a strong movie comedy. It does not aim to overturn the film industry and decorate the basic features and does not want to look like one. If you want to enjoy this film in full, I give you your lost ideas and your desire for a good plot because you can't get here. So firm, let's continue on the film. I had the lowest expectations of this film just because it had no strong plot (Yes, film players, I stood this movie too), but I've never expected to enjoy this film very much. I was much happier than Stephen Chow flicks (which I get Kung Fu Hustle to have his best efforts and would have reviewed 9 too). The action is solid and epic when the play goes to the right places. <br /> <br /> Viewer of SPOILERS, I think Steps might be untrue, but why would you like to watch any basketball anyways? There are many movies (drama) that has already done well, why create another? SPOILERS NOTES / / <br /> I don't even know why you read this. Continue and watch. Just remember, don't think - just look, enjoy, smile, laugh, and / or <br /> Every time they (the film industry) builds things like Pulp Fiction or Godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies that are better in a bunch of dump. I can't say Kung Fu Dunk deserves to recognize that original models, and again, if we talk about Stephen Chow-ish actor, this is the top ten. It is highly recommended if you love: -in-the-movie movies and a very good step -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy-what it finds, see this. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you designated Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
