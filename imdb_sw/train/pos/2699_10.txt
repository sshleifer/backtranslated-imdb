There are other comments here so I don't need to say how big or what about ... My quotation is: I've heard about this old movie, before it was displayed. I can't even remember HOW, I just know it's through the Internet. Distributors went down before the fall! For months I beat and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to this film and the only location is shown by VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use the Babelfish of Alta Vista to translate. I know it's the structure of PAL and changed the text on the screen for Germany and there is a bit of the original notes that has also been the name of the German, but like hilarious and campy as this film is, really just make funnier! If you want to see this film and you have a place close to which changes are very important! It costs twenty dollars or so go to U.S. from Germany. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to use on the film, but if you're in the fry of the corny you will be blowing money left and right to get the conversion to your friends!
