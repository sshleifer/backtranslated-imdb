Marty's bad Marty (Simon Scuddamore) gets burned from the brutal day of April Fool's brutal passing very badly. The front level for ten years with those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known for fans of fear for his return in Maniac, Faceless & The Last Horror Film) in prank is psyched for upcoming 10 years secondary reunion not knowing that the jester-masked killer court has hidden the school (now closed) and out of revenge. This Chaulk to be a pleasure of guilt, I knew it was a bad film. It has all the same features. But there is only something about it that makes me not obliged to look at it regularly (preferably with beer in hand). I even intend to reject the end of the end (which I must say, I hate) I think I love it because it has a pleasant atmosphere about it and some cool kill. Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager all get on candy / candy eye (for women): Simon Scuddamore cock at the beginning of the film <br /> <br>> My bridge: B-<br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: optional optional option; trailer for this film; and trailers for my Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dancing Dirty
