If you have a clue about the production of Jane Austen, you will now repeat the same in each of her stories: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made from his novels are a bit frightening, but I love Austen characters, because they all have some personality and common words they like to repeat as well as in Emma. What makes Emma is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her role in leading. Also the fact that each of the characters in the film is not supposed to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and recently married makes the film a hilarious.
