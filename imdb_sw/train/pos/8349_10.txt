Depardieu's most notable film is this (1974) of land from Bertrand Blier. It shows a lot of gender cases showing the level of X, including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot version of the 1970s of Jules and Jim threeage three and three hippies of French (Depardieu and Deware). There is nothing like a holy place in this film; everything is a good game. It is not surprising that Americans do not like this film very much when many French people who have met and consider it to be classic. Something about it goes contrary to what Americans are planned to "like." <br /> <br /> Gerard and Patrick Deware late are two-hitting-hitting, hippy drifters and many sexual worries, going around women severely and making small crimes. They are out for cutting and anti-capitalist, Euro-commie, slacker 'freedom.' Blier satirizes the spiritual out of these two at the same time making the bourgeois community itself looking at the end finally beyond ignorance. Best of all, it is the way of the amazing Stephane Grappelli that uses the unstable soul of drifters, low awareness of understanding or 'better' which encourages all follies they enter.
