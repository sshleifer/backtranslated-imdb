This film is exactly what its head describes - an attempt to buy it in what the authors should give. First, it's kinda happy to see the Toronto style of 1996 I remember with all her hair hair, sunglasses, clothes, and perspective. In fact it has not changed any; is a good, safe, affordable, urban water city that makes a great opportunity to meet international films! It is also exciting to see the head of Kenny and Spenny for LA and to know it is Toronto again, just for the incredible destruction of beach bums, musicians, lucky speakers, and other uppity films. I don't see a vaccine like a fun movie; not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's expectations. I take asphalt as a warning that power and money are actually held by the execs labs and home production. Journalists, musicians, and actors are still few when they reach Great Time. So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy or do not, but the message is still there.
