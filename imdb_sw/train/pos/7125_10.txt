Goodnight Mr. Tom is very good closed and found well. Not very faithful to the book, but it must be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerizing as Tom Oakley. The change from careful to caring was very good, making it more reliable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Morse Inspector, this is the best hour of Thaw. He was likened to the young Nick Robinson, who gave a reliable picture of the failed evacuee and the violence of his mother. Script and music made it worth buying, and also you see Thaw play link. Amazing! The most moving area, Willie knew about the death of Zak, and Tom told him about his deceased family who died to scarlatina. Buy this, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
