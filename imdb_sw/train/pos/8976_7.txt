Starlift is a delightful and fascinating spectacle for all the star music pictures that each studio was producing during World War II. When you have a star like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in films and people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are offering music, it's easy to take a film. And the plot is not good on the way. It is a program that involves two Air Air men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet Warner Brothers star Janice Rule using as a gimmick fact that all come from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy's father was a doctor of The teeth of the Rule as well as half of the city. The program works well as Louella Parsons soon puts them as something in its rows. Yes, Louella also in the film too. He should have loved Warner Brothers or Jack Warner served more than other studio operators because he also used this studio to advertise his radio program of Hollywood Hotel behind the day. But the rest of the conspiracy is also touching on the real efforts of Ruth Rumi also struggling to find her studios and others to show in the Air Force bases for servicemen and women to go to Korea. Some of the names I said and others sing and perform at the Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this film was shot. The one special number was hit by the talent of Phil Harris who sing / say ballad Look Out, I am a Texas medical assistant and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper seems like he had a very good time playing his image. This is the oldest of the clich√©s when you say they don't get this again, but they don't have because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under the contract. That's one thing about the destruction of the old label system can mourn.
