Let's talk about it: the last season (# 8) was the worst season in any show I found (especially, I never had a dry spell for the entire season). But if you judge this show for the last season, of course it will come down. That is an unfair assessment - because "That 'of 70s Shows" was, his day, a brilliant and hammer on the past and how people who lived there were not much different than we are here in modern times. In fact ... ignoring Season 8. <br /> <br /> Star Topher Grace as Eric Forman, a horny geek of a loving young man of Donna (Laura Prepon), a girl girl near the door. Playing for their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) offers amazing displays in (almost) each section. The best is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is like a minded shepherd when they get. What is the country? Try to think! In another form of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are as wonderful as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is awesome and sweet, kind like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red is especially scared to poetry from everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well as Donna's parents, Bob's Chauvinistic but pleasant and Midge's air. Tommy Chong has a regular exhibition like Leo, a midfielder who acts like Hyde's father. <br /> <br /> In addition to the irregularities that are constantly generated by advanced studies that sometimes come (and the last season of pain), '' 70s' is a strong show and write amazing, spot-top trend , and the vibe feel good to lose every part.
