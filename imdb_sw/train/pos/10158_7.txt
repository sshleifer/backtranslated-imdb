Johnny and June Carter Cash helped this film which is a traditional delivery of Gospel stories. Music is good, you get a real sense of what Jesus' world looked like (I have also been), and June enters Mary Magdalene's part and passion. Money story is also good. But it is worth it. 2. There is no edge to the story as Money puts it in some of its music base of faith. 3. Because it is uncertain, I am sure we will see this divided again. I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
