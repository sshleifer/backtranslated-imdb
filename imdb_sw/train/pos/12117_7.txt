Although the film has put Davis on the map due to its excellent performance as a child-born provider and studying Mildred Rogers, this film is an exciting experience for me in general. Acting is quite true in every respect. What I cannot understand my life is how or why Phillip, a wise young man, who will take the frequent abuse this time loses his attention: I see his infallibility for some reason. Yes, I know he is a sensitive-feet club, introverted mind. But Davis is a very evil witch that no one who promoted fruit could tolerate his attitude or practice and make it believe. Davis is amazed at his role: yes, he can go over his history regularly and now, but it is a creative picture that shows every way you look. Too bad he did not play moll gangster. His behavior would have been completely trusted as a slope among the low life!
