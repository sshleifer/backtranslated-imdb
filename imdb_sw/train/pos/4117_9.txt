"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first movie of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly not about samurai, ronins, warlords or war. It is in the poorest community in Tokyo, where residents are homeless, applicants, bans, tortured women, lost. I don't know why Kurosawa chose this bad theme and setting the color setting, but in fact it's a sad story, some broken heart. I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that has dreamed by their own home and built them; The story of the lost boy who believes that he is driving; the story of a man who raises five children as their sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman who was captured by her father. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden ?? Life Way")
