This is my favorite at all Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film. The dialogue between the two is good and wonderful and very clever. Never mention this film has some of the best modified songs and two; if I put all my eggs in one basket and let's look at music and dance. If I remember correctly, this is the film that has taught me to Fred Astaire so I think because that always takes place in my heart (sorry for sentimental cr * p but I am a woman so getting on it) all in this film gets 8/10 from me. Choreography was good and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more amazing.
