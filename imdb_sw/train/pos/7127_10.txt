The incredible film also deals with trials and persecution of the World War 11 England. What makes this film so beautiful is the touch of the human element. This film is evident in such a classic classic British style as "Ms Miniver" and "Hope and Glory." Like this film, we see the desperation of people during the war. Exercise is best here especially with John Thaw's excitement, given a child who has been removed from London bombs. We see why this baby climbs his bed. He comes from a mother who has treated him very much. The old man takes the child and brings joy to his sad life. When a child is brought back to his mother, an old man goes to London and seeks him out to get a disaster. He snatches the boy and can persuade him that the child is more interested in him than being in the boy's house. It is very good because it deals with and builds good relationships.
