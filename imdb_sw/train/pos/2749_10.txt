Beautiful pictures are worth all words. This film has a place of poetry that has been mentioned about people with Down syndrome. I will not destroy you by telling you. You will need to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not need to understand one word which he meant to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its own magic. After watching I understood more that we put great value on success and not enough for people we love. Passion and humility are all we need.
