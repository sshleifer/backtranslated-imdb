The GOODNIGHT MR TOM program on the paper makes it seem to us to a great dose of maudlin, a feeling of disease. with the best productions and leading exhibitions. For one of the best, if not the best television films of the 1990s that would probably have been more successful if it were given on the movie. The transfer of children to cities and villages of cities in World War II was normal, but in the case of a young boy here it was important because of the poor home life in the British capital. The fear of war on the front house is not made, though, and the construction of the film until the end of the throat, the end of evil puts us in a sense of hope despite what happened before. (1946) all, classic modern.
