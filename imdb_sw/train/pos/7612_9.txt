Well I will be honest, when I saw the first trailer of the program, I thought it was an advertisement for another product of the sunscreen. With all the people around the beach. Despite this I decided to look at it, I think it would be a new show that I could laugh. But I was very surprised. From the first 10 seconds of the app I was enduring, why he slept on the trees, why he lost the birds etc. etc.. It is not every day that the show comes that combines the mind, humor, action and suspension. But 'Lost' could all this. By casting good workers, beautiful places, and special effects, 'Lost' will catch anyone who uses, and must have anyone who has a bed of cheesy and a real TV crappy. Lost is Tuesday at 10:00 on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
