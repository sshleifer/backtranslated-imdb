I voted for only 10 out of 10 because it was a good story of animation that I could see at a certain time. Animation is amazing. The diagram of each area and environment was good. From color to lighting to the standard level of art. I was surprised. Moving beyond the screens on the screen, you are included in the story story which is once unavailable and at the same time is clean. The development of behavior is still short while this touch is especially needed to show the viewer what and why and how the behavior has come to where they stand. I am fascinated by the whole thing and I think this must look at the whole family.
