Design of the film appears to be alpha and omega of some of the major issues in the country (U.S.). We see all relationships in the university environment for film. Appropriately, definitely the students of v. the teacher is there. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v. black, and v. personal. community. But most importantly and with direct relationships with all other relationships is v. yourself. I was surprised how the view of the director's perspective was to show the competition on the campus. Many films show the rights of one side while showing another suffering. This film showed injustice and suffering on both sides. It does not attempt to show how it was similar, although I would say the leather heads were shown a great crueler and block (quite clear towards the end). Film also discusses sex and rape. It is amazing that this is the right which in some way brings two communities together, for a while. Lawrence Fishburne does a high-top job as Professor Fipps. He breaks the idea of ​​favortism of running and instead reflects the parallels of the lazy and grassy and strong and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives a beautiful picture of young people confused with irritating anger who wants to be accepted. Tyra Banks makes its film start and confirm the supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> Learning Top finds its name in the university display as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would like to say that the film is almost satire in displaying students' relationship with each other, rather than a dry book, as a real education at the university. It is a process of learning life, not text. I think you will find "Teaching Top" faces the most important issues in many universities and even life in general. 8/10
