I love this anime! I was laughing at my head with all the jokes and violence (especially from the uncomfortable pastor of Akane Ranma) so it is a slapstick however Ranma deserves but she struggles very hard to make the revision ... significantly. The main character Ranma goes to China to teach only to fall into Jusenkkyo Spring curse and turns into a girl when splashed with cold water. Since then there is a chaos after another. Among the outside position is the brothers and sisters of the pride of the here and the Kodachi, a good Shampoo, Happosai deviant causes trouble for our hero / heroine. However it is the father of Ranma of Genma's genius who claims to be a very aggressive shepherd. If someone wants an anime that is wonderful, this is one. It is a cuter with the best and Japanese dub.
