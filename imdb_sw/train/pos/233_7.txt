In fact I've got this movie 'interesting'; finally someone has the value of my time to check and lease. It is true ... some of the events were high above emotional, shouting, etc., but what film does not work for its agenda, type or "grinding axis"? Welcome No! What surprised is that I read a review elsewhere done by S.Fran the reviewer on another site review, but found its negative views rather the most accurate explanation of "own" review of the movie; not the movie completely. Anyone who watches this film will find it good to recommend to family and friends; no car runs, yes! Being "in" the Italian family myself, I can fully understand the scenario shown on the screen. Film has its own parts of tears too. What a real life can be in such a situation. Good movie.
