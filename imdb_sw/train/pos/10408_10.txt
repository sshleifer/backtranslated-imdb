I saw this film first when I was a little child and I liked it once. The set is taking a breath and some of the script is damn correct hilarious: "You have a thousand fleas". Every time shown on TV at night or early morning I woke up at 3:00 am and just once started. TV companies need to show more respect and put it at first on Sunday so everyone can get a chance to see this beautiful work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
