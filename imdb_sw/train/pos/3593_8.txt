Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school scowl of rebellious and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. He is ready to fight with anyone, especially his father who pays for his brother's boxing lessons. Diana decides that boxing will be a good way to consider her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is the best. See how their feelings for each other are made up of a square circle.
