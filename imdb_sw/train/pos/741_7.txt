I was too young for this, but I was seeing it. There are some of the best music, which many people have mentioned, but no one seems to be very visible to "Angel", which is now unknown but once a music song. They wear their white cloth clothes, blowing "20th century dirt", and it seems they are all trying to enter the field of camera vision. Keyboard Keyboard Gregg Giuffria keeps the band to show, and it never looks a lot of haircut, ever! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) begins a short, but well-known job here, and never remembered with Jodie Foster, and others. (Its over 3-D events in "Parasites", and its visual UFO, in "Wavelength" took us all to watch him in time). It is not a jewel, but it protects the interval of time, for all expectation, and surprise.
