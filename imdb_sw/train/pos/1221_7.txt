For a long time, I loved this film better than the original Bears Bears movie. Last summer, I watched them both and decided I was missing. The first is the best movie of Bears Bears (if you might have thought if you read my opinion to it). This is not a BAD film, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. Very good, as a few people have mentioned, it completely quits any movie of the first movie. I can't think of another good man who is opposed to the first so clearly (especially with men of certain characters and how they all met). When I was young and I looked at this, I was completely harassed and disturbed. I felt the same way to look at it as an adult! <br /> <br /> On the grounds that the movie is very good (If you distribute it from the first film). I can't imagine another movie for small children with DEMON if it's villan! Now it is not a moment to suggest that evil spirits who want to steal the souls of aliens and Bears Care are good, I see it's cool that there is so much evil being in the movie for young children! It's like bizzare "Santa Clause vs Satan" movie from Mexico you hear about sometimes. <br /> <br /> However, the name of the demon is Darkheart and wants this chick to help him get Bears Care for his return to give him a special power. Very dark for flick kiddy eh? And did I say that Darkheart looks for a girl as often as WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY ??? Freaky! At the same time some of the other children are in Care-a-Lot looking after BABY CARE BEARS! Oh, man! Demoni and child care bears in MOVIE SAME !!!!! Of course, everything is given at the end (but not before we will see the Darkheart grip of the heart of Care Bears in this horrible thing of not mentioning in one [awesome] scene. But I am left with the question of this film has found the audience of the ritual very appropriate. I might just look again.
