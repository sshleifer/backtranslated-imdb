Walter Matthau and George Burns were a popular act of comedy vaudeville, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken more than 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took himself and has been hostile since then. That's the Column of Neil Simon hilarious play made that movie. Of course, what makes it very good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Mtthau's nephew and agent. There are even old stars of the real golden era to take you to the film area, and the character of the character Fritz Feld begins with "pop." Rosetta LaNoire, who started at 30 on the playground with Orson Welles and later was a Bride on "Family Affairs," is good in a small role. The only problem I have (and maybe M is also bright and / or bad) is how Matthau makes Burns when they first meet. In fact, he has had a lot of hatred over all these years, but some of the things he does will be considered bad or just bad habits taken out of the environment. Also, I have been seeing Matthau that way in other movies, but not for George Burns. And, the fruit of Matthau tends to get younger. <br /> <br /> For all, if you need a regular film of funny to help and forget your problems, put "Sunshine Boys." They will raise your spirits and make you think of a simple time and way of life. Benjamin: "You're going to beat them." Mattea: "Stand up, wait. I think you should do it."
