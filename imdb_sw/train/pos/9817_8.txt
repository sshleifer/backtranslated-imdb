I remember this film. Strong to 11 years old. Good editing, I felt bad for St.. Bernard. I would like to see it again if it was revealed, but the sign passes Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. His work view. I'm just happy that I didn't live in the neighborhood. Oh those 70. What are ten years. If they change it, it will become violent and blood. So what are they waiting for? Modern best for old boys pubescent. It was very intense. I think it was done in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi NJ. The shot by St Bernard was a much better picture and very clear from the film ... and then left the carcass on the loop. Poor children.
