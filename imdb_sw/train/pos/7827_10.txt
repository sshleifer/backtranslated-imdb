This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The movie is beautiful, good acting and a very breathing story. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who felt so independent until he saw the truth of racism. Kevin Kline is quite persuasive - so that Donald Woods appeared on TV after several years, I recognized him from Kline. Denzel Washington also turns to good performance, as it is. <br /> <br /> I encourage you to look at this. It's a long time, but it's your patience because it tells a story like that. Remember, people, this happened really.
