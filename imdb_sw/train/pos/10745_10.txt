I would get a bad way first, James Hanlon is quite frightening to try to do his notes of going on with rookie training and day events. The truth is in a sharp contract for other fire fighters without the prospect of doing which is common in their delivery. That is a wonderful film that is impossible to look without tears in my eyes. I am an English boy from London but I love New York and I have visited many times before and after September 11. It is a second home to me and I can't help but feel a waste of life but also destruction of a very strange city. This is a real deal, with fire fighters and everything falling around them. I am very happy with the picture available to show people how it was day. It is a shame that they did not use any photographs of people to fly from buildings because friends who were there tell me this is a great part of their memory, it must be shared and showing future generations as it was. <br /> <br /> Theorists plot can go to hell through.
