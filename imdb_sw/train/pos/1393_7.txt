Perhaps the modern phase of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has ups and downs it; a certain part comes very long and others are easily reduced, but one cannot refuse to throw everything but a kitchen sink makes it a part of recreation. Kirk and staff seem to have found a perfect planet for the departure of the beach after an extended expedition of responsibility has left everyone on the board in need of rest, relaxing and so on. It looks for all the goals and purposes that the Earth does not live in a beautiful, environmentally friendly environment. The first signs that things can go a little awry is when McCoy, leading the early team, advertising Alice (from Wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing vest. Kirk takes down and finds others filling events with a wonderful race. One thing that they all have in common is that each member of the staff was thinking about the person / place / thing they found right before they got it. This does not interfere with Kirk or anyone else. More cautious, including the appearance of Don Juan, the Siberian tiger, the WW2 flight, etc.; Kirk meets Ruth, a good old girl (of course) and a swindler from her school days, Finnegan. The fight / fight against Finnegan goes for a very long time but at the same time, McCoy runs for lance and knight on the horse and seems to be killed. Finally, an old man looks and explains what is happening. The planet is a futuristic 'park park' where visitors think only what is visible. There is nothing permanent; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to import the beach to everyone after all. Despite the 'end of the dream', the end of 'Shore Leave' stands as the first part of the first Star Trek season.
