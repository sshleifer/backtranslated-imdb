... do not read any plot of the plot because in words the plot may seem insignificant, the brain-dead and meaningless. The film is the best, acting with Denzel and Dakota (going up to heaven, he believes me on that) is very strange, and the plot is a vicious mind. True "fabulous" is a small word to use for talented actors. The film is based on real facts and other characters are not false, a fact that adds to the shock I had when and after the film. If you are interested in the experience of all the participants and some of the films, you have never seen your favorite one yet ... The movie is amazing, it sees, calls, buys or whatever ... don't miss it
