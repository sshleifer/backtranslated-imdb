I was living in Rawlins when this movie was found and I was lucky enough to do that job. All as an extra and Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was a pleasure to see all the things behind the work of the area, from Barbedwi to come alive to the electric chairman through the district office. It was also a great pleasure to get to meet all actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was fired on the prison wall for the movie was still called "Disney Gate" and locals. If anyone is fascinated and becomes Rawlins, many movies are still going on and can be seen during a guided tour. It was a great pleasure to work with R. Harlin and I wanted to have a chance to do it again.
