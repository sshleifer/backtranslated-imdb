When I heard this film led by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. The Taiwan Director began to succeed with the "Wedding Festival" and "Eat Drinking Woman Woman" a few years ago and then moved to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he returns his mind to another American icon - Civil War <br /> <br /> This story is being held in Missouri, the state of the Union and South sympathy. These did not join the Confederate army. Instead, they formed illegal groups, called "bushwhackers", grew long hair, and sometimes wore uniforms that wore their usual outfits. <br /> <br /> Movie shows their moral problem, a high-quality game, and their aid to the murder of shop and farmers who supported the Union. There is no star in this film, except when you look at the "Jewel" singer, he is healed as a young widow that includes as a star. Tobey Macquire is beaten as a young German farming man who has laughed for his legacy because the Germans were required to become Union activists. This young man is a very good actor, full of young people who are struggling with the performance of his strange and subtle directions as he said for fear of war. <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a free slave who travels with observers because of his loyalty to a young man who bought his freedom. It gives the effectiveness and efficiency. Some of those acting, however, are timber, especially in the long conversations they have about ethics. And their clothes are very new. With the "pastor of the south" theme of character and hat-spread and concern for women comes up as little as a bit - especially because they are doing the point of killing all men who are struggling from their hands of women, then burn shops and houses. When I do not think that this will fall as one of Lee Lee's "Movies" movies, I was surprised at this, despite a small part and its height of 140 minutes. each of the characters who all met the real and imperfect people who have found in the history of history. <br /> <br /> Not as many stages as a typical movie battle, but it was still proposed - especially for gems of civil war. <br /> <br />
