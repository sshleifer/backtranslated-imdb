well I was a boy when I saw a film ... songs were hit big but an elite class hit movies to go back to the back then coz watch the movies to govinda and karishma (aka karizma) was not something to 'class' but anyways most people like like movies these hit out of 90 through outward and many of them were successful ... these days I was looking again after a long time and I remembered, there were long people with the chaos they created when the song came to the screen .... dresses and karishma was a gift for each other (the worst duo at the time) well in the late 90's but the govinda still has been very faithful to his creator as the meaning of his dress is still the same ... but behind all of these mixed up was good. everything worked with a slow class of scholars who realized what was missing and then ..... there was no look back on this joke as it was going on etc. make the Indians a succession and few but loved by citizens. If you are looking for a good time without hiring or looking at a TV I don't think you will regret ... but remember it's worse than good. <br /> <br /> I still watch those movies when I get time I do not laugh ... so I say go ahead and have a good time if there are times when we all love folly and especially when it was done by kings of their time certainly looks ... I recommend to all movie lovers ...
