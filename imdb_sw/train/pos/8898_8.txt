The 60 is a good movie (I saw it quite one night) about the hippy movement at the end of 60 years. Though the head shows otherwise 5 years of 60 years is not very good in this film. The main character of the movie is Michael, a political activist who goes to the United States against Vietnam. There he meets his partner, Sarah's brother, Michael, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (it's a surprise!) Returns from the battle to change in "Tom Cruise Born on July 4th" to look like and then into the father Hippy.His is a war of Vietnam (surprise! !!) The sister of Michael Kate gets pregnant from Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during summer love. The end is very bad (the father is free and everyone is happy), but I allow this to slip away with my vote (some of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> Exhibitions and actors are good and the sound of the movie is quite brilliant. All the major events of the sixty years are in the film, like the murder of JFK and Martin Luther King aswell as a massive hippy protest, summer love and Woodstock! Look closely for the Wavy "Speaker of Woodstock" Gravy (What we have in mind is breakfast in 400,000 bed!) As the first worker at the Woodstock Festival! At the end, 60 is a good movie about a decade! 10/10
