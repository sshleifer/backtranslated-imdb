Very slift, the Pre-Hays Code very, and still very sassy. I would like to highly recommend this film, even if it is not a fan of Stynwyck. She is funny, she's sexy, she is a hard work - and love that she gets! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is amazing as Doozie's floozy who lifts up the world, perfectly displayed by the bank building. John Wayne (in the suit!) Has one of his first victory. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are reduced, but sets, lines, all clothes add to one of the movie about vertical climbing in a horizontal position.
