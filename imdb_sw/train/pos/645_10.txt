I love many French movies for a long time, but my favorite movie of all time is the most durable movie and the French worth of all. I saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it fell. But finally I saw again in 1999, and fell in love again. What is surprising is that it feels like every day as fresh as it was 25 years ago. If you haven't seen, don't miss your chance!
