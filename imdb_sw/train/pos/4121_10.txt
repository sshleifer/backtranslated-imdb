This tends to be reduced by many critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I thought it was strange. It is a study of the diversity of the poorest people of Tokyo, who live in a garbage city. Although it looks like a A-only bomb dropped, the film has a kind of appreciation for the beauty of serene for the use of Technicolor glory. The title comes from the voice of a mad man who gives a trolley car that thinks through slum. All the characters were wonderful and all stories included, but perhaps the most saddened man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When they do not follow the food, they spend their extra time using their imagination to build their dream house. An exciting and beautiful film.
