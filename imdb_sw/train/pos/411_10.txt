This film has been done so many times that I am afraid that the logo is as small as (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) as of this text). This movie has a special impressive effect, a real epic story, a good interaction of character, and a battle of mind-blowing - they should seem to believe! The complaints I have are headlines on the HK DVD version (some lines are not translated - ???). I don't know when I read & hear from a variety of sources: "it has a conspiracy." From the first time I watched this film, I understood it, I followed, I knew why the characters were there, and I liked it so much! I have checked it 8 times already and every time it is good fun. This, and this is not just my opinion, because I have shown this video to many other Americans (people who have never seen a HK film before) feel the same way. None of them failed to follow the story and everyone announced their love for this film. O man, why can't we have things like Hollywood? Of course the Lord of the Rings had a good marriage of special effects, character development, and story. This is not from the Asian movie partner again. I have an extensive library of Asian films and I must say this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you look at it you will be hit by the unique and sensitive effects of this film. You will be attracted to this fantastic world and you don't want to leave! I have seen the 1983 and 2001 edition (both held by Tsui Hark), and 2001 are better for comparison IMO. In addition to the subheadings, I have an additional complaint about this movie: I did not want to end .... I ask you Mr. Hark - can we be good?
