I've been a fan of this film for years and years. Because of the Teri callers move forward, I had to take a film on the shelf and watch it. Why did people back in 1991 did not see how this movie was more beautiful than me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are more fabulous. Although I have never looked at the daylight service, this movie kills me every time I look at it. Acting is the second for no comedy and writing is very smart. I strongly recommend that you look at this if you are not ready. You will see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher ... mention a few ... all of them offer royal fairs.
