Laurence Fishburne is a good actor, and she deserves the honor to try this, but she is not in class with big Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and continues around Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always brilliant, is quite clear. Olivier realized the potential of its production, and threw Iago with someone who knew he could strengthen. I didn't almost know the potential of Iago behavior, Shakespeare worst, but Branagh shows us the depth. Good to see the views of Venice, too.
