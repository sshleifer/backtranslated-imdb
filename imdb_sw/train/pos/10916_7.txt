The comic flag between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the secret of this massacre, which has one of the most bizarre and impossible squares forever. Powell is probably more than 30 years, and Arthur has a unique voice that often looks like a series of small tinkly bells. They are very happy to see, so do the courage of the plot for the grain of salt and rejoice to see the emergence. Eric Blore also has a comic turn as a Powell pastor. Powell and MGM contract included a clause that allowed him to refuse to be borrowed from another studio, but wanted to work again with Arthur and liked the script, so he acknowledged the work. They had worked together in two 1929 films, the Canary Deaths and the Greene Survey, both in Philo Vance series.
