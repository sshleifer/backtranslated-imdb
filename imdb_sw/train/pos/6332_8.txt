This movie is good for TV. I love it because I am a fan of a movie film though this is a family film. The accuracy of the film from the book is half and half. The police officer went to the police station for security. and in Dan and his friend both 12 years old. All I can think of. In general this was a good movie though it could be more appropriate to the book. What? Do you know this book was based on the true story of a series of tornadoes in the small town of Nebraska in 1980?
