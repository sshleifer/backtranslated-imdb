It is not a very bad film made, the artists have not exaggerated and the script and the director are not at all. It is not the best film done, the artists are not the best and the script and the director is not quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. Fun somewhere. It's beautiful, well-built somewhere. No need to say "don't take it seriously" or "very bad" or "not terrible". None of these comments are appropriate. Reject the sky. It is a very special case, and one of the original elements of the movie, which is the soul that makes the film, for me.
