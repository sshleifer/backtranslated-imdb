It's good to have a whole family movies can look together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who have been married in real life) are playing a couple who loses Las Vegas for an error and then don't just have to break the news to their children but then try to try their own pregnancy (each has two boys and two girls) in family of cooperation. What passes when the group, which comprises four young people, two young children and two young children, makes an incredible one if there is a real pleasure for Carrie and Jim. The struggle between children (and one thing of love between two) makes it wonderful if everyone can unite. More interesting than Brady's Bongo, what is this fun way to spend a couple of hours. It is recommended as a good film to feel for all ages.
