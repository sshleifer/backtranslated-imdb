The Best Times is one of the greatest audience of all time. Uninstallation of your taxes, promotions are consistent, many relationships are introduced with love, gags and all bits and functions are all funny. There's a lot of emotions. Kurt Russell play Reno Power puts in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams play Jack Dundee is sure-footed as ever. Release also includes many many followers. Jack's wife plays with Jack Palance's daughter, who is good, as Reno's wife, who is a good player. I can't tell you how many times I have watched this film, how often I have loved it and how often I would like many people to see it.
