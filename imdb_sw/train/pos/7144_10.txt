I have seen the holes of films and say that they have to be the best movie every year. It gives the child to everyone. I mean who will come up with the idea of ​​having the boys who are stinging holes like their punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book it was still very good. For example Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be one big there. The weight of wisdom and prudent height but ZigZag / Ricky was tall and Armpit / Theodore was much greater. Also Ray-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the young boys but he was not. The only thing I didn't like about movies is that a few had a long and long influence. I would like to see more than the past but that's just my opinion. I especially like the work of boys though. Like Squid / Alan who was played by Jake M.Smith had to be a strong and tough child. Jake M.Smith did just that and did a great job like it did almost all the characters in Holes. So I would like to say if you come to see Holes you still have to be aware of when you come out again or you will be losing your fun lottery.
