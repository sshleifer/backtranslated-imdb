This movie is better than the original Jerk. I would strongly recommend to anyone who likes the quirky humor. We have imported a very close line from this film to our day-to-day discussion like us from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> card game with hobos and then with Mr. suicide. Location in the dinner table with its barrier soup. The original Jerk was also choreographed ans made. When I love Steve Martin, he seemed like he was trying hard. Jerk Too is spoof and it will enjoy with anyone. Jerk Too is a friendly family with the original Jerk.
