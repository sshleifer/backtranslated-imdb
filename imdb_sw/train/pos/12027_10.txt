I have seen & I love Melissa playing well. It was really reliable. My brother saw with my sister & i and telling my sister that I forgot that it was a true story (I have seen a few years ago) because she just because of her life you think is true & all my sister & I would have been so so I was if anyone knows what the killing was or whether he was actually involved it because I want to prove to him. I love the movies of life especially those that are true, or are those who teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something over the last week but I don't remember where any help will be known.
