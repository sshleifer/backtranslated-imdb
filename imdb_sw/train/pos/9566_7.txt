Tribal investigation from Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Right now, he reminded me of "Run and Kill" of Billy Tang, although it was not as much as it was. However, it is something that is happening, that has emerged on the Cambodia cycle, Pang (Edison Chen), who came to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the area, he kills an ally of Sam Sam, who, in addition to a shocking shock, is in the middle of dealing with his dead father, so Sam begins insane, a powerful man with Pang that is close to a dozen dead and violent. It should be something new soon because I've never seen so many people diving out of each other as I was soon. This is bad, bad things, that's why I'm not part of it, and I enjoy its life of vibe. It seems arrest and sound design is very unique. Surprisingly, everything goes down to every character when he finds himself or herself in a world of pain. The congestion involving Pang and the girl's sexual harassment increases the depth of the story and provides a surprise for the fourth act that has a good quest for amazing surgery.
