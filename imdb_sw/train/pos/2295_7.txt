There is very cautious humor in this film, which is compatible with payments to executives. However, over time it seems only a fashion practice (regardless of many talents like Balasko going on part of Dussolier, and acting very well for all involved) and I was wondering why Blier made this film. It is all revealed in the end, when Blier, pointing to Claude Brasseur, gets a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and gets a chance to say how much he misses. Emotional emotional and intellectual force from the heart. But there is no great tension or emotional involvement to keep the entire film attractive at all times of flight. Some good events and successes, however, and anyone who likes these 'sacr√©s' films of French movies should get the right amount of enjoyment out of this film.
