I loved the film. it is good to analyze the Italian community of gender, how 70-year-old scholars have left all their values ​​and come up with a plan of happiness that they do not want to be confused. For example, the psychoanalyst patient who is jealous of his own son, and does not want to be reminded of his youth more. It has long wanted to buy a video after watching a movie several times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to be completely lost from the market, even in Italy no one in the bookstore knew about the film. great mercy. <br /> <br /> One part of sex, which everyone seems to go on, does not harm the film.
