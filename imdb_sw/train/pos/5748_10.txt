This film was good - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and the Ray Liotta exhibition brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this film came at the end of 1988, instead of the Rainy Rain, Hulce would undoubtedly have been nominated for Oscar Best Best. Certainly must-look!
