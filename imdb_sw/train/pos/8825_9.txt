This Oscar nominee of 2004 is a very small film of b / w in Spanish. The young woman comes into coffee, gets coffee, and the advertisements of a few musicians stand quietly for their instruments. All employees do not decline, like mannequins. One boy, however, appears very well and gets into a song about what is going on at 7:35 am. There is one time surprising after another until the end is completely, well, wonderful. People, place, everything seems normal. And as a piece of music "Bolero", something is going to build until the peak. For its structure, theme, movement and wit, it's a 8-minute jewel.
