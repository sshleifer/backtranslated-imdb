True, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is a kind of Mr. Smith goes to Washington kind of movie, with different differences but the same premise. I have copied this film off the past cable years because I had a great crash on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is impossible for some dinner to have a key job in the government simply because he has survived a large shot. It made me laugh and make me mad at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found was embarrassing, I was laughing. (INFORMATION COMPANY). It made me mad to think that our government will establish ordinary citizens in the way it started. And the speech he made last ... good. People are not too bad to avoid as well as in real life.
