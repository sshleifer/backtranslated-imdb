Spoiler !!! This movie depends on the concept of What? Of course Mr Destiny will be able to answer this question. The protagonist goes on a bad day, as most of us, and asks this question. The theory of chaos says the butterfly in China may have an impact on someone more here because of the chain reaction. The aim of this movie comes from a single event during a baseball game. This event puts you at the End of Man's End; Such as Ashton in the "Butterfly effect" except Mr. Destiny uses comedy on the drama. The result makes a new, original film. If the philosophy of man is in the "Butterfly Edition" one will have the pleasure of Mr. Destiny. I give 7 out of 10. Surprisingly I saw the first half of this film 3 times, and finally I watched the end of TBS.
