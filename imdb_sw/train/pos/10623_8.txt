Michael Kallio gives a strong and fascinating performance like Eric Seaver, a concerned young man who had been seriously injured as a young boy and his old father, an abuser, a Barry drinker (a truly scary example and Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a passionate heart (sweetness played by Tracee Newberry) and the task of writing autopsy reports on local morgue. He was interested in his old, colored, painted Jack, demon (Michael Michael Brandon), and taken away by his recent death of his mother, Eric goes off into the brutal killing. Capably headed by Kallio (who also wrote a strong, intelligent script), doing well with an unnamed voice (Jeff Steiger is very good as Eric's wannabe assistant Michael Michael), rather bad, but the general film by George Lieber, a real-life-trusted actors, hit a sudden, horrible, non-violent, symbolic shadow, spiritual and Dan Kolton, the end of a sharp decline, Detroit area, Michigan areas, very bad sound , and taut, a good explanation that develops in a sufficient way, this very powerful psychological stimulation makes the constant exploitation and disturbing sight. A real sleeper.
