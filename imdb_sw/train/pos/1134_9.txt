The only part of this movie is part of Shue as a daughter who wants to follow the footsteps of "Aunt" as a day's soap star. Otherwise it would be perfect 10. <br /> It seems that every actor enjoyed their part and confusion in order to fulfill their pleasures along with the script - I wonder if a little lib'ing advertisement was done. It was well healed and there are classic lines that will be with you. It is a wonderful movie everyone should see at least once. I would recommend not to drink anything that could blow your nose. You will definitely want to watch the last location around, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret that she didn't want to share with you. If you like day-to-day detergent or degradation, this step enjoys everywhere.
