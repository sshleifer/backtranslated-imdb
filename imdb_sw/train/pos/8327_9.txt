This was a good romantic comedy! Wrong history (Einstein did not have a pastor or intellectual as described elsewhere on IMD) but made a great match. He brought together two very good people who played with two best actors. Assistant (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all emphasized the screen and made it a great experience to watch. The fact that he drove the car around it seems to be contrary to all these pictures and banners riding around. And he wore socks in one place ... he was reported, the professor was not wearing socks! (Two new features for the IMDb section of goofs.) Historical and uneven distinctions, this was a great movie to watch for a cast. I offer 8!
