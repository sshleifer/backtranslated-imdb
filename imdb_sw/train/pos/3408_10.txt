I give this film A + to the camping camp! As the daughter of Dietrich Maria Riva wrote in a book about her mother, "If a man sees the Garden of Allah in a camping environment, it can be very exciting." And how! I laughed and enjoyed the color of the destruction and wonder, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialog. Viewers who have read the Boyer toupe accounts (continued to return to the temperature) will take every time it appears. Dietrich and Boyer are not always available when giving their lines - instead they look away, maybe their faces can be photographed and the best light (if you are fighting with Turkey you can also look good!). Dietrich's clothing is not from the world. As Riva writes in his book, Dietrich was able to steal the Travis Banton of Paramount and make him a lot of divine coatings, such as beige & cape clothing. <br /> <br /> I fully agree with other investigators who are about about Technicolor. In fact it is hard to believe that the film took place in 1936 - the color is amazing. In short, if you look at the Garden of God with a good attitude and agree with his life, you can't help but enjoy it.
