Certainly one of my favorite movies. Stories are good, act is good, all the technologies (especially cinema movies) are bright and script is clever. Heath Ledger is as strong as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He comes as illegal, and is used well by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All step-by-step systems are in action / seat. One of my favorite films from the last story of Heath Ledger, who has become the color of every film he entered. And not recommended error here. <br /> <br /> The best film on all sides.
