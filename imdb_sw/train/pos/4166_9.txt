Before Cujo, there was a Lucky dog ​​devil. In 1978, the night of Halloween movie "Dog Devil, Hound of Hell" began. Family stories to get a new puppy (from a farmer who only happens in the neighbor to sell fruit and vegetables) because their Skipper dog was killed. Everyone likes a new dog, but there is something strange about it. Not long before father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to recognize. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where Your Boys, Jail Jackson Jail, Snowbeast) are different from her children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Mountain The Magician and the Wonderful Vourage by Kim Richards, Mount Witches, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Dog has something to do with it? He has decided to find and do whatever is needed to save his family. This movie is good because Ike and Kim are playing in the darker than what we have seen on the witch of the witch. This is one of the 70 TV's awesome movies for TVs that were scary movie trailers. Music was interesting and even the end I will not tell you think. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a star Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who couldn't stay away from the devil's movies remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It is worth checking.
