And this person is me. And not just me, if I can see here on the IMD or when you leave the theater. Why did people like it? Obviously: Everyone knows the zombies at the moment (at least the Horror fans with the heart and others through the "Dawn of the Dead" movies or Resident Evil movies etc.) Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that's until this movie when it came. And you will see the zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horrible movie, though it contains other violence, but it is comedy. Satire to be correct. And never comes steam! That is why I was so high. The wise pacing is amazing, acting is good and the script does not mistake (definitely) ... quite the opposite: It's gem and if you're just a little interested in zombies you should see! And even if you don't like them, look! Because it's a great (delightful) movie!
