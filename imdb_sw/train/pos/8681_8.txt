This cartoon is short on the plot, but it is a piece of amazing work. There will be very little attackers: <br /> <br /> This short time has a "story" which is a small underground gnomes associated with the return of spring every year, but still has to cope with the winter yet not ready to give. Both gnomes and storms have their own songs. That's a good plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot - it's about color and animation. These displays are unique. Back in 1936, this bright color was still a product of innovation and there was some revival work here. My favorite short time around the motion of the painted through the pipes. For more than one step, there is a series of consecutive series of pipes, from short to longest and the color passes through pipes and music track makes it look like a line is a pipe tool. The warfare between the stream that emerged and the winter storm that refuses to leave silence has been sent properly. These short types are the items that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are recognized, but perhaps also helped to overcome their MGM departure, because this cartoon continues to pass on the budget and MGM finally decided that they could control the cost if the animation department was managed by The most expensive person than Harman and Ising were. <br /> <br /> This is really a good cartoon and it's good to see. Available on DVD's' 30s Character Attack. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
