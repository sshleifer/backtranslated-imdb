Many people can say that if a person could use on Saturday night watching the film, you must be very tired. True, I had just come out of the house and turned on the TV and there it was, "Paulie". I missed the opening credit, so I did not know his name but I saw it had Cheech Marin in it, so I thought I had found the "Eastern L.A. When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I had dismissed this as a flop film show at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> Happy to say, it was better than that. As you know, if you do not have Paulie already disappears and try to return to its original owner. It seems to be taken years to find him. What? The advantages of Paulie should be the benefit of the way. People get a learning outlet and all who see it a way to make money or benefit themselves. Cheech Marin's character "is" to make money from him, it does not mean to him. Drums and parrots are something that children will find cute, I have seen them amusing. Paulie, who is naive ', learns quickly that not all people are good people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man is sleeping saying he will help her to find the owner for as long as he helps in her animal survey. Paulie is now stuck but he decides to make a fool out of the person with a show for some of Paulie's voice. In the film Paulie tells her story to the service providers who finish opening her, several. The other animals have to find the place of the owner of Paulie. It's a touch of touch. Out of 10 out of 10, the wing area should be taken and not displayed. This part can pull small children. Otherwise, it is a good movie for older children and adults who are a child of the heart.
