A new version of the story changed in 1938 the UK (Return of Frog) related to the police tracking of the big criminal known as the Frog because of the frog as a lift (eyes of eyes) etc. he dresses. One of the best films of Wallace since the 1960s is a little entertainment. It is clearly affected by (or made this influence) to re-introduce Dr Mabuse's films, Frog seems to be worse than the thief. While not the best of Wallace films, it is worth watching. It would make an interesting feature with the original original film. <br /> <br /> Out of 6 and 7 out of 10.
