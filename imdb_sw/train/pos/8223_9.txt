When I saw this first film, in London, in 1958, I was locked up. I have never seen a film like this before. It had an amazing, sensory effect, quite different from the films I had seen earlier and had left a lasting effect. I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady is a sister, if not twins. Indeed cooperation is wonderful in its ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this has been converted to a DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the native French language, I'd like to hear about it and where it can be purchased.
