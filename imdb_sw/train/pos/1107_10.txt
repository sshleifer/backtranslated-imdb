In the classic sense of four humors (which is not specified for the concept of funny or even entertaining), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." makes all of humor, and really in the most interesting, entertaining ways. There is Phlegm, as a man of the slow behavior of Lauren Bacall, who keeps, and protects Esther Brill, who is a life message appears to be on the appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and more beauty than her welfare. There is a doctor of Paul Dooley, Gil Gainey, who is like a fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal) around the wind, saying and urging the crowd to join his spirit. Melancholy of Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell scores Shakespeare's copper and fair - even makes soliloquy or two. And let us not forget the behavior of Henry Gibson of Bile, Bobby Hammer ("The chest that gives the child the law in the world"). Then there are characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), ordinary characters struggling to find some kind of balance between colleagues and many players who have met with H.E.A.L.T.H. - a global business organization known for H.E.A.L.T.H., which says nothing but health. This is the Altman in the best of the session.
