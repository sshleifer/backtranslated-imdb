I didn't expect too much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl? Ah ... but the story went on, it is revealed in a film with a beautiful and proposed picture. I was surprised and enjoyed this true story (basically). I did it to read more about this fascinating behavior, which means, the director accomplished its purpose, and the film was successful!
