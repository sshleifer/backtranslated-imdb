My sister and I lost this film because we had a sense of something and not the need to look. However the film was too much of my low expectations. <br /> <br /> It is much more than a century representation. It has a real picture of the characters in it and many of the actors perform amazing work. Different stories are cooked with real pictures from the time you give it very touching. As I watched it I felt that it was about what had happened to the characters. I would also like to give a much of praise to Julia Stiles at her presentation to Katie, she was good in a way that stood out! <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to anyone.
