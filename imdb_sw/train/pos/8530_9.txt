I don't know why it is not recommended Peoria, it seems, but this is very funny and clever UK. Installed at the end of "sixty years". Peter Sellars is wonderful as rich, forty-something series series. Goldie Hawn is the most beautiful, a 19-year-old American girl in London, the beginning, "Selking" the first day. But the urbane television feeder cannot control the fall of white white blond. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, good displays from heads and support. It is a good film, and a good gag is the very last line. Try it, you will love it.
