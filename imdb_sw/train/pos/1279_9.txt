This movie is an exciting and exciting view of pop culture and its producers. I was fascinated by photography which had a clear color and spin doctored settings, especially when you think this is the first great attempt of Zukovic. One warning, do not take the film seriously. Not for bulk use (and that's not gratitude). The mission is post-university, a neophyte view of the community. I enjoyed the basic line of the 'zine editor editor for the words of the 90-year-old mobocracy.
