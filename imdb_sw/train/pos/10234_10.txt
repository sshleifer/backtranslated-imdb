The “Burning Paradise” is a mix of Word-Shaw Brothers action and the ringo Lam of urbanization. When a person looks at the film, they may feel that fighting is not just natural but it does not matter, it is a view and situation that counts. This beautiful film has all !! He always tries to be different from the people of his day, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in the "Lost Store". However, these are not the nature of the comedic heart that you can see in Jet Li's movie. Instead these guys fight death and brutal consequences. What makes the film better is that anyone can die at any time, no hold. Unfortunately, they do not have this film more often.
