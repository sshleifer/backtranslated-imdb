I just watched this film, by mistake. What a little gem. This 1956 film was seen, and it sounds, like a seven-year movie. And in fact it is better, it is more restricted than, say, the Blue Army. Environment, anthropology is the way forward of its time. The video hit down is very good and has quite realistic. More than Dances and Wolves, the last hunter can show the appearance and feel of the unicorns "killing of farms" in late 1800s. The movie was hit during the legal forest-headed pigs, so the animals you see is actually shot, the bones are real. In the end, the western mainstream was struck down, which was done very well, directed and shot.
