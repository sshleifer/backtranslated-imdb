The main actors, the actor's oscar actor, the wonderful scenario, a good story story and more laughing than you can get into my new bag (and that is too big). This film was brilliant. It had been well done in the most important events and the time of good were. .well, side split. I have never heard the audience of movies laughing loudly, and tears were running down my cheeks during 'stone stones' in the shop area. It has done well for the British film industry and Craig Ferguson whose magic spheres have ensured that this is one of my favorite movies of the year, if not at all.
