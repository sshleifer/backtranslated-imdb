I have never read the Kurt Vonnegut book released from, but I know other work and I was interested in seeing how it would be interpreted on the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful change of Vonnegut novels. It deals with the story of US living in Germany who are employed as a US spy. His job is to indulge himself to a high position on Nazi and send a secret message to the United States through his weekly radio show. But when the war ends, he is judged as a war offender but he runs to New York, where the most unusual twin of events are waiting. As Mother Night has trouble it tends to get very little times. But for many films schmaltz is taken to a minimum and a very strange plot is done with knowledge and aplomb. And there is a wonderful time of the black comedy involving three right-based Christian Christian and Nazi mainstream space in the prison cell. Highly recommended.
