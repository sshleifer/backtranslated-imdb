What is taboo about love? People seem to have major and previous problems. <br /> <br /> The name of this movie did not touch my eye. It was a sand shoot about 4 minutes on the movie what made me stop stopping the station. I couldn't believe how amazing this film was. It touches many levels of human emotions that have never been able to move me in some way. It's one of the best films I have ever seen. I did not see these characters as sex, just human. I would recommend to anyone who likes movies. Especially independent film. Praise all filmmakers who are not afraid!
