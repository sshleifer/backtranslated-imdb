Let's move forward: My two children participated in this film. It has its mistakes from an adult perspective, but to buy some of the jelly worms and enjoy it. And the girl of Pepsi was the best! And Kimberly Williams was good-found, although she is not in the film very much, so don't get excited there. It's not a bad thing, but it's a kind of movie you want just once. Don't give a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the father.)
