Small movies can be viewed nearly 60 years later, but they still have as much as this. Technology development did not write this love story. Special effects used to wonder for the 1946 movie. Acting is very good. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey are doing their best. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years so few people even know its existence. It's my most popular movie. Waiting and hope for the release of the DVD for this film for many years is, itself, "Life and Death".
