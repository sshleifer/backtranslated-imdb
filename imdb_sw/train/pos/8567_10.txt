I enjoyed the film and I propose to anyone outside the best time. Do not take the film seriously because the note is Disney and it is counted G. It is very good though some parts can be recognized by adults but children can never recognize, especially the "triangles" between Cruella, Le Pelt, and the honest Cruella valet Alonso . Glenn Close is really amazing and has actually made its own Cruella and it is really scared even when she is "healed" of her furry ways, she can scare them to the audience and its products that tremble at all. (I found myself sitting on my chair when he gets in amazement with his 'bipolarity' as a dog likes Ella.) In all I will go to see again in the movie, I am very happy.
