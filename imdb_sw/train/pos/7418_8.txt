"Shower" is a story about honesty, on the premature failures of the modern world for the effects of traditional and human means. One had to choose between his successful career in the business, his life of the capital, his wife, and his lost brother. The eternal question of what we want to do and what we should do. China's modern antique. Public baths and collecting him, cricket battles against shopping centers and skyscraper. Many of the men and women of old who do not need again. China, one country, two systems, like Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills another. Tender, moving, full-time, and bitter-sweet.The sensitive ones will cry and laugh the same. The actors are very large, especially the role of the lost boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, simple, easy, letting the story flow through itself. My rate: 8/10
