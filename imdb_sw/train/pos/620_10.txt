The good story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (author of MirrorMask) and is a very good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Bride or fan of the 10th Kingdom and it is still very special and stands on its own. And I feel that the film change of this story has more than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not destroy you. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of man and the slave of the reserved and fake faerie in the faerie area. The story begins in a city near the wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a star falling Tristan promises to get it for a girl being beaten. She does not know that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. The three great witches who want to use his heart to be young again, and other chiefs speaking. It is a very good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and illustrations. It is alive and I feel it can be looked at by children and adults of all ages. It's just a magical. It is a true story of the story, which loves which I have not seen in movies since the 1980s.
