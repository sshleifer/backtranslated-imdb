I always wondered what happened to that kind of magic that the old Slovenian films were seen to be ... Well, for a while I tried as if that feeling was just pride. Or did that "feeling" decided to put his bags and say "wages" somewhere in the middle of our movie history, and then did not come again? Or do you? Because to me, it was the first time I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was the age of man again. <br /> <br /> There are three attributes of this movie that makes it unique and enjoy if it is a look - a smooth flow of story, a color of color and, what I have accepted more - a lack of extensive use of voice communication (something that most (not only) Slovenian writers should consider at least). No use of words, when you can relate to each other (yes, or better) in other ways that are used. Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. So, in so many words, that's why I would suggest "Experts, Experts" to all of you, as a compulsory film to see Slovenian, no matter what you can hear in Slovenian film (if you ever heard something nothing, that's a ...) <br /> <br /> Oh, and area, which Bakovic plays on Vivaldi music ... Atibu. <br /> <br /> Use yourself. See.
