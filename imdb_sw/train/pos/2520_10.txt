Despite what others said (* cough), this is my most popular movie. I don't know when I was waiting to see how long, but once I did, I immediately liked it. Indeed, it is wonderful, but that gives only more exciting taste. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first Gackt and Hyde movies. They don't have too much, maybe 3 or 4 on each other. Therefore, give them credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first either. I believe that it gives us an unusual situation there, but I look up to get the best points of this movie, the emotion displayed by what. So, I have given, and always give, this 10 out of 10 films.
