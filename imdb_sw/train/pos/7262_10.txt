My daughter, her friends and I have watched this film several times. I bought twice with other young friends who lost. Later, I spent a lot of time. It never gets old! Blockbuster is no longer in their list again and I have tried to buy, find, lease for more than 5 years. Of course, this is and is my most popular movie of the childhood of my daughter ... it has all! We were surprised, we cried, we discussed the real life and how children are most vulnerable in the world. There is nothing pretending about this film. We are related to each verse of the verse and each verse! Thank you millions for restoring our faith in human nature. With honesty, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge if a rich woman loves a poor person; or a loving person chooses to raise a child who is not his. It may not be mine or your life. Not only reliable, it happens every day. Thank you God! It puts my trust in human nature alive !!! celebrate !!
