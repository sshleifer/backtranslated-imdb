Bird theory is a study of the behavior of an artist (Branagh) who wants to break free and tolerance, and a sick patient (Bonham-Carter) in the last stages of ASL, sitting on a wheelchair, who wishes to make love to man before dying . Helena Bonham-Carter tries to have feelings, resistance, and independence as an ASL patient who relies on people around her to take care of her. Kenneth Branagh, was convicted for community service involved in caring for him, strengthens the charm of Helena for the desperate despair, and creating a delightful story of love, in which two people try to help each other find a happy way, before of time.
