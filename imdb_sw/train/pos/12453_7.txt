Unfortunately many users write a review to IMDb to compare low budget and not good. Whatever else this is needed, the budget is not part of it. Big set and lots of special effects would turn into another movie of Lara Croft. We have here two or two more better than that. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden is not known very interesting as an amazing simplicity, and this is important for this movie to work. Its smiles of wisdom and visuals are awesome, and you find yourself wanting to have a camera can not eliminate its face. It makes it clear that the evil man Nikolai, played and also very little (in the U.S. at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau can take the common interest of the brain in it, something of humility can use. He can turn his rape into a mere shooting and spitting "out of my time!" then it breaks out among its armed men but suddenly. Making such an area is not seen by accident. Probably the biggest problem I have with Staden's playing Modesty is simply not believed to go hand in hand with an athlete and a player like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. He is not just Peta Wilson or a Hilary Swank actress who has been able to give a punch punch. Coaster-Waldau allow himself to be strong and Staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his younger sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not a true film action, this is not a big mistake. I just hope to do better on that if and when they do sequels.
