There are good details in Bug Life. Everything is covered. The movie looks good and animation sometimes decreases. The film is not very good, it is essentially taking the modern sized seven, just with bugs. I enjoyed the interaction of the character however, and the bad guys in this film seemed to be bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their people bad copies of the wrong carbon. Witches are afraid of Hopper, the worst evil, was a brilliant creation. Check out this.
