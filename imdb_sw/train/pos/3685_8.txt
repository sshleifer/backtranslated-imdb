It is such a pleasure to look at this fascinating project. So you comfort and educate. Not only for the film manufacturer, who can learn what can be found in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as listeners, who might not be very willing for a lot of love for such a short time. A short film about love in Paris is all unique, but some of them, as expected, are standing. I thought part of Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best, though mimes made a smile in the same way. <br /> <br /> I clicked the "vendor" option for these comments then ... what read is a spoiler enough. Just watch. Don't read what I write, but look at the film instead. <br /> <br /> With a smile.
