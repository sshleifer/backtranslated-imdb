Talk about the opening of the opening, "Trampa Infernal" has loans to open more cool! Guided by tons of music that are probably guided by the story of "Friday 13th" theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the leading players appear on the screen are divided into big weapons. Suspend the intro of the surprise of the Mexican / backwoods of life and it becomes just cool and every minute passes. Two enemies of anti-competitive competition and testosterone protested the challenge for final destruction in the strict bar. According to the newspaper, there is a savage basin in the nearby forest and has already killed many of the hunters who tried to make it. The challenge is that anyone who wants to carry a witness will be eyewitness and the end of the balls. After arriving, however, it becomes clear that it does not fight with a butt, but a strong and powerful old man with a lot of weapons of arms in his reserve and many anti-sleeve techniques. After a decade of desire and US lights produced, this first Mexican effort appears and it feels very well and transparent. The form is simple but effective, leading characters emerge and build on the fight with the killer of the sadist is a reason to emphasize. The wizard must be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, since he uses self-defense and knives connected to a white mask to cover his face. These killings are very positive and political, which I was hoping for starting since the opening of the amazing surprises above, and losing a lot of free blood. Forest plants and especially the booby traps are the most fun. "Trampa Internal" is a hit of the victory / life of a sleepy sleep that comes with advice for fans of that kind.
