If Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS, and Kubrick and CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman gives an effective film on the side of the Person's Violence in DELIVERANCE, of course it is an awesome movie of the 1970s. Ronny Cox depicts four Atlanta traders who decide to take a trip to the sea under the Cahulawassee Wild River in northern Georgia before being destroyed by what Reynolds calls "a great, dead sea." But> the people of the local mountain take a very negative view of these "city boys" playing through their trees. And the next day, proceeding with the river, Beatty and Wind increased and sexually assaulted (a series of "SQUEAL!" Of the film) and two men of the whole mountain (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So, what started as anything more than a lark through Appalachians has now become a dream where our four characters come to see a narrow line that exists between what we consider as civilization and what we consider to be barbarism. <Br> James Dickey has interpreted screens from his best selling book, and the result is often the promotion and disturbance shocker. Often known for its "SQUEAL"! and "Banjos Illustration", DELIVERANCE is also a problem of blowing, and the leading men involved in their roles, and McKinney and Coward makes two of the most frightening killings all the time. A must-see film for those wanting to take place.
