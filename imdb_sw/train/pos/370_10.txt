I found this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time I was still FELT. <br /> <br /> The story itself was wonderful but came alive with Spielberg expertise and fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved the Oscar selection for her short but powerful Nettie. You will get everyone's experience when you skip this film. I laughed, cried, and was angry. As the largest movie was seen by the Academy and the selection army but no success. But this film, of course, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
