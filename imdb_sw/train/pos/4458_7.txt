This has the most beautiful parts but the length of the film cannot develop a narrow plot of access. It's the other sea on the film leave, zippier than 'Follow the Fleet' of Astaire but it's not as good as 'On the Town'. Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra works together. They 'If the Knew Number Susie' is hilarious when they form a song as they sing. 'I prayed for him' is also fun with Sinatra to show how he was starring. Sinatra's solo songs are lighter and seem to be inserted to show off his singing instead of the story. Fortunately there are potential executives like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and Jose are a potential but unattainable, with one look. <br /> <br /> Kelly is a film star, though the third paid and is interesting to see it interacting with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell has a child who wants to be in navy and latches on Kelly character. It also visits a school that leads to telling children the fictional story of her life in the Pomeranian navy (!) Which leads to her amazing dance with Jerry Mouse with animation. In another area he plays a beautiful concept of Mexican Hat Dance and a small tomb when he met a little girl, Sharon McManus, which enters with sweet. Very good then but for a very long time. The best music player to come.
