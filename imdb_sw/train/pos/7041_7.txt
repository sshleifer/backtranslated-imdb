WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) hit-by-miss-21 "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who wrote the script by Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser ?? star as a jaded man named Brand Hauser who has been burnt but he decides to follow one final job for the Middle-Eastern oil minister Omar Sharif (yes, not Omar Sharif but you get a drop here from this misfire for laughter) used and the former Vice-President of the USA (Aykroyd, the former "Grosse Pointe Blank" of Cusack, making the meaning of Dick Cheney manqu√© back here), requesting Brand to perform the act under the Business Illustration Show Producer in the story of Turaqistan ( read: Iraq / Afghanistan for a private American company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). At the time of delivery Brand is experiencing a time of clarification when it comes to a non-confident journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and finally loves her. At the same time Tamerlane assures the possible unity of the youth of Eastern Europe Yonica Babyyeah (Duff's amazing effort to the language-through-cheerleader) and the leader of the country's leader. <br /> <br /> Next is the attempt of the comedy of the 21st century black for "DR STRANGELOVE" but for all purposes and purposes there are more emotions than hits in this comprehensive attempt to laugh with political messages ( Unfair war When you are misled by the American ethnicity, look!!) / Crisis! When Cusack rejects Martin from the "Pointe" mentioned above, he adds a good touch to his black man (he does Tabasco sauce take on the far edge), the rest are beaten (except the sister Joan who is a friction as a campus on the Hauser regional assistant and has one of the most enjoyable films of the film: "My multimedia skills eventually pay") for the most part . <br /> <br /> Cusack visited Iraq's war earlier this year in 180 "Grace Is Gone" and here allows her political opinion to wear on her sleeve; all the time of the thrill of film and dancing is very far away thanks to the first film player Joshua Seftel made his first text here (and apparently) except perhaps the banning war Hauser is associated with the child's Idiotic concerns. /> <br /> Good quiz still failed miserable; maybe the next time Cusack will not try too much and let the idiocy of war speak itself rather than lift it alone.
