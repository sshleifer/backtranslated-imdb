I had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi (Vendors, Hey Good Lookin '), one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I didn't see anything ethnic (I am not stupid), I accept the behavior of the character is little and unknown today, but I think it is satire and many very old stories of the old story of Uncle Remus which are of the American American culture, are created under the main characters and nod open to "Baby Tar" and "Patch Briar." These are not a great story, committed, but cultural icons created by Americans Americans, and I have a white woman to read and love these stories. And I also got a glimpse of a beautiful time on black culture in Harlem, New York at the end of 70 years. <br /> <br /> Well, to get a nitty-fritty of this film: this film is a live-film / animated , which begins at the stage of living with a colleague named Sampson (Barry White) and preacher (Charles Gordone) rushed to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to get out of prison, but they were stopped by the road and wind on the shooting by the police. While waiting for them, Randy does not listen to listening to the Pappy (Scatman Crothers), who starts to tell Randy the story of Brother Rabbit's animation, a new metropolis who rises quickly from careful control of all Harlem; you know, to the Rabbit, Bear and Fox are the animals of Randy, Sampson and Ecclesiastes. Juxtaposition abnormal stylized animation and live images, the film is a clear satire and moral judgment spread in the 70's? color, ethnic, and otherwise. <br /> <br /> So, it's another movie GOOD Bakshi; and we should erase the film like this under the rug? pretend they are never? hmmm ... I think that would be embarrassing; I think we should watch these films, and learn about what's going on back, just how we come since then.
