There are many films relating to WW2, but Mama Night is very different from them: In this film, we are brought to Howard Campbell (Nolte), US hostel in Berlin and married to Germany, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of the spy : In addition, CIA Major Wirtanen (Goodman) employs Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the echelons on Hitler's regime. However, the initiative is that the US Government is never aware of the role of Campbell in the war for national security reasons, and so Campbell becomes a hated figure in the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but behind it comes back and offensive. His "friend" alone is Wirtanen, but he can't even do much for events that happen at Campbell's poor ... The story is touching deeply, when we look at the Campbell epidemic who though a great patriot, is treated and ignored by everyone around it. Not only, but also gradually knows that even people who are closer to him, have many secrets of themselves. Vonnegut gives us a state of moving, and desperate for Campbell to create and almost stimulate the viewer. Nolte is responsible for his life, in my opinion; he is better than "Torture", although in two roles he plays a bad figure who is destined for personal destruction. Sheryl Lee is also the best, and the same can be mentioned generally generally cast. I don't read the book, so I can't see how the movie compares it. In any case, this is something of importance here: My counselor is on film for se, and the film is wholeheartedly worthy of 9/10.
