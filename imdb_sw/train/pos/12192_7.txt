This 1947 film stars were directed and written by Orson Welles (with Irish funky impressions) and star Rita Hayworth beautiful and very fragrant hair. So, I've had a hangout with Orson before the touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Person etc. but this was my first friend of Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went smoothly, doing a very good job playing Elsha fearful / cagey, married a lawyer with a disability loan. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall to each other. He wants to run away, he doesn't know if he can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his wife and bite, such as papa Mike explains to attack and his preaching prove that it is also true. Twists and it turns out to follow this mystery of murder when we get to the peak in the house of happiness. (Consider the last shot in Man and Gold Guns, heavily borrowed from this area). I didn't know who was the killer until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a shrimp in onion and lemon. Bowl stations on the sea, are tricky, angry, and angry, all affected. These can not be the best shrimp, clean, but the best shrimp from Costco. Scent sauce adds to the nature of the red shrimp when filling the health, but filling the supplement with the most common, normal fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
