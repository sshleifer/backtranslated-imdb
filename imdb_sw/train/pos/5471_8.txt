During 1933 this film had been reduced to being taken from them because it was much higher for the story of the story and the fact that Lily Powers, (Barbara Stanwyck) could do anything to get enormous wealth and power. Lily's father has oppressed her daughter in prostitution at the age of 14 and grew up in the city's iron colony with her poor people and her father ran away to speakeasy that brought her home to all sorts of male characters who had an eye for Lily. As the story goes, Lily meets a man after someone and finally finds someone who has everything and is a president of the playboy bank. It is good to see little John Wayne, (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 years old when photograph this was released by Jimmy did not even get the first foundation with Lily, even for lunch. George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) very well with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave the best performances. This is a good 1933 film that was released by Darryl F. Zanuck and closed for the error for many years and recently shown on the cash screens. This film is thin compared to what we look at in Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very difficult to watch this kind of film. Enjoy
