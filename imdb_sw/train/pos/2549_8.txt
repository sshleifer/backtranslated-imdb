Ronald Coleman's best urbane is shown here as in his few films. He is real in every area and this lovely movie remains fresh because of it, not despite it. She is very good, intelligent and very clever here in front of her walk, a beautiful wife - played well with Anna Lee. The movie depends on playing French and brings all the best features of that farce. Most of the cast is well known, at least for the face if it is not a name ... and it is absolutely perfect for this very interesting film. Wonderful writer Coleman is a mix of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he keeps step ahead of other characters. His many talents can be accepted more in "Lost Plans" which each buff film should see.
