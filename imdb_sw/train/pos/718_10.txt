Rock 'n' Roll was one of the best movies made! I think the only reason was surprising was because of Ramones! You can't make the film and put something like Sex Pistoli, or Clash instead of Ramones, it couldn't be the same. The young, few, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and the hall administrators, added only to the movie. The whole movie is about Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed Rock 'n' Roll High School as a big fan of real PUNK. It's not sissy new crap ... but loud, and fast. The only kind of Ramones can do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
