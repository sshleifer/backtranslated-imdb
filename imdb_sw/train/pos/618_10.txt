This film is amazing. I had an 'enchanted', I must say, and be surprised because the only thing that happened. Sent, sequencing, impact ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a story of love, yes, but what made it better from others is that it was told through entertainment, good. <br /> <br /> For me, it is a representation of the modern fairy story. It's like a modern pan of peter ... just awesome <br /> <br /> I certainly would buy a copy of this when you enter the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is twice you want to make one ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
