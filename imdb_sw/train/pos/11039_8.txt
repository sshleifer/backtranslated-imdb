Now this is what I called a good scope. For spiritual / common fraud, this beautiful French budget found my ideas from the first place. This proves you need a FX wild or a lot of a year to make a more effective movie. The plan involves around 4 imprisoned, and each of these characters (with their intentions) slowly more interesting, as the movie adds tension to finale. Many steps we see through Carrere's eyes, who has just been in prison and are required to live with those other prisoners. There are several errors though: FX is not good, but is used effectively; The plot leaves some secrets opened; and things that combine to the end, but Malefique saves himself when it is over. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
