I cannot accept the negative views of other consultants. They are very important, perhaps because they are found in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen a Primary Institute 1, maybe a very young person? I left the idea of ​​the movies that I have not been hit by IMDb consultants. 14 hours later I still try to find fault in the plot but I can't think of anything big. My advice to everyone sees yourself and makes your own mind. <br /> <br /> Looking for a similar example to Primary Foundation 1 but the plot was not met. It still left me surprised at the end but in the most satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and wearing her 48 years very well; this remains his elaborate position. David Morrisey was satisfied even though it's not Michael Douglas. Among the most I loved David Thewlis as a police investigator.
