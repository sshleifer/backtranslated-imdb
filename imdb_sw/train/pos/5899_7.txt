Good view ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherited a small ward of Lampidorra. The country, which was not even in North America, was given 49 ... (of course, there were only 48 states at that time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda goes to the country of inheritance, and we follow her together and she is trying to imagine what to do with this wonderful country and her ignorant people. At the same time, he sings a song which he claims to be from his people Navajo, and finds it there in silly .... even though Yolande Donlan and smile and omni-now are not available. There are other songs selected out as citizens are singing to welcome their new princess. Published in the British edition of the technicolor, or some of the same, about just the big name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British subject Tony Craig, a supplier of cheese. Bogarde made a great splash in the British film industry after serving in the war, and even was hit by QE II. Craig and "new princess" continues to compete, and their adventures overlap with the financial problems of Lampidorra ... Enjoy the little farce .... along the lines of Marx Brothers. Also note that later Donlan married Val Guest, the author and director of our limited project, and remained married for 50 years! The visitor was more known for writing and leading sci-fi flicks, in the UK and the United States.
