It did not come from the left field, and in fact it is not what you expect. But I love them. The most popular film training is due to surprise, if you ask me. If you are not taken away from the "secret" thing that makes these brothers very common ... you're in a treat. It has been sent in a wonderful way, but it is not very widespread. Specific effects come from anywhere (seriously, it is like an odd dark comedy until they do - then WOW) and they're good. The overall picture is simple in the eyes, editing and sound is a very good quality, and a distorted story opens without clich√©s. While none of these things make it a blockbuster, "what is hell?" The reason ALONE makes the treasure of the film. <br /> <br /> People who hit this movie are useless. It is one of the most frequently ignored flicks of 90 years that you have never heard of, or love to jump to mention its name. <br /> <br /> I am in the last group.
