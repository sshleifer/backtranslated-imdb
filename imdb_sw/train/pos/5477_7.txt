The original publication of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress, and has been shown in several well-known movies around the world in 2005. According to the current review I have found on the Internet, the nature of all prestigious discussions and inappropriate documents; later they were removed or canceled again by the label before the original release, in order to adopt the censors of the New York government. I also read that the DVD "is expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we are fortunate, it will include comparison between two versions. Remember that the reflection version was found in the Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck Act!
