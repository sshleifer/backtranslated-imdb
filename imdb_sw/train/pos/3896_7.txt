Some people liked "Righteous" and others hated it, often walking in the middle. Recommendations for Eddie Izzard should not be extreme - if you can deal with a partner (who says he loves girls) and has a vocabulary you do, we will say, enough use of the word "f" which his program will be one long beep presented on television . Most of Izzard's fans have devoted themselves even to any fault in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was more frequent than the chest of Izzard but also more often than not funny and, in advertising, very hilarious. He has a way of linking references from the process at the beginning of the show up to his future ways. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joke. He is not fantastic fantastic as Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, which some work with some of which - the mechanism and car of San Francisco and Alcatraz, for example - do not want to. He has a way, however, to move to beauty through beaten routines and extend those who connect. I gave this performance 7 and could be sure to raise it to 8. But 10? No.
