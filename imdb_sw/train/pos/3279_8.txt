I'm glad that this is available on DVD now. This film is a good example of the victory of content and style on empty triggers and sound sounds. In fact, if you have a short-time or thoughtless and thoughtful experience and a literary story you cannot love this film. The reasons for this are very simple, but unfortunately not very much: Matthew Jacobs has done a wonderful work of adopting the story of Catherine Storr 'Marianne Dreams' successfully on the screen. Unsupported work if anyone who has seen a book of the book will certainly know. <br /> <br /> Giving is the best, allowing director Bernard Rose to use administrators in a way that doesn't appear now; get into the trick of acting! I know, I know, executives are doing their work and working instead of getting into mind in the lens of the camera asking for the carid of the drive expulsion, explosion and fire fighting coming out around them are actually treated, but it really happens in this film. This brings me to the last reason that this is a film for thinking of thinking & not a spoon of a spoon produced by a spoon - In addition to a solid script, leadership and action, it depends on the atmosphere, fear of charge and speech. If it is a community as fear then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more than a socket range than Tobe Hooper. In conclusion, if you like a lot of noise, explosions, frequently reduced, & bright colors you would be better to see 'Transformers', but if you would like a story of doubt that passes through the use of skills and animation without your understanding of The power give you a bright solution then this can be your only thing.
