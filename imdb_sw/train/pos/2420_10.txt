If you enjoy the trick (yes, I said the trick) the actions and impressions of John Candy, you can't help but like this film (known "fillum" and Salvatore DiPasquale). Anonymous viewer (and unknown) always saw Candy as a broader actor - a great buffoon. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, given the opportunity, he can be a ruddy and very subtle. It's too bad he was thrown in many roles that only showed his broader side, because we won't see more of the other. Oh, yes, movie. One can check "Go to Berserk" regularly (I know I'm) and rotate "Caddyshack." It's just beautiful. The plan, though reduced, is quite real to this type of detail. It allows candy and often under rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to eliminate Candy ... and hitting HARD. Surely the value of perception for anyone who enjoyed another SCTV or Candy work.
