I love this film. My friend Marcus and I were hacking local hastings because we had a desire to hire something that we had never seen before and fell on this beautiful film. We didn't know what was about, but it became interesting. 2 thumbs up. I loved how the film was hit, and the actors were playing too much. If you are looking for a favorite film that also makes you think I recommend you quickly run to your local video store and get this film. I would like to tell you some of my favorite parts but that could damage the film to you so I can't. This movie is definitely on my top list of beautiful movies. Do you think anything is bouncy?
