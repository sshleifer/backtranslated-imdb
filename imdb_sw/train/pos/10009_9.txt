When I first read the story Armistead Maupins I considered the human drama shown by Gabriel No one and those who cares and likes. What we have said, we have now been given a good version of a good story and we are expected to see more of Hollywood's Hollywood ... With a huge amount of restraint Robin Williams takes Gabriel's fragile essence and enables us to see his struggle with loyalty issues in the lives of his employees (Jess) and the surrounding world (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we are brought to players in this game we remember that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event could change our life irrevocably. The request to revise a book written by a young man turns to a life-changing event that helps Gabriel gain power within himself to continue. It is bad that most people will avoid this film. I just say that because the average US probably think "Robin Williams in a great role? That hasn't worked before!" SEARCH TO MOVIE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all should get through and through ourselves to become better people. As his movie One Hour Photo he has grown as an actor and made a piece of art quality. <br /> <br /> Oh and before you forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess savings every area she has. the 1940 leading man is looking at the presence of screens. This is a hack view that can carry its movie right now! S /
