When you read a review from another user, saying it is a terrible game, I couldn't stand without working and doing something! Well, this game is good, from video videos (with two real people, full of sense of humor and trust!), for the story, I see it very good! I just complain about the enemy start around when they die, until they disappear; and other horrible situations on the LEILA VR message, while running a bicycle, here and there ... ... I recommend! Indeed! It can be old, but still enjoy! At least, on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
