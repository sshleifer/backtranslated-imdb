I've found this film to be worried around and going. When Miss Stanwyck begins her story it's just a few minutes until you realize that the problem is coming. Left spaces, lock at the gas station of the left gas station, everything puts you in wait ... here comes. At first you think it will be on a young boy, but very quickly when you start to keep your breath watching the wave. I have seen this film to be very stressful, although I had looked at it before and I'm ready for the bridge. Now a film that can put you in doubt even when you have seen it before you deserve some kind of special rating, maybe a white prize?
