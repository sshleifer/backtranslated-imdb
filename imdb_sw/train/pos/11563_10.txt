I saw these years after television series and, at first, I didn't care. Then, as my memory of the series decreased over a period of time, I looked again, and I saw it completely hilarious. According to the action of Neil Simon, it has never been 'much open' to the big screen, and that's one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are as brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and hold the hand is wonderful, especially John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, at some point you can reduce me with tears of laughter - Felix resisted Oscar in the middle of a football game with a dinner request, Oscar blowing and dismissing Felix near the apartment, the concern of "Pigeon Sisters" brought down Felix's seat stories. , and of course, the location of the prestigious restaurant (later broke by Nora Ephron 'at Harry Met Sally'). Talk of a vu-fires too. When boys think Felix has taken overdose, Oscar says: "They can be vitamin! He can be the healthiest one in the room!" Good!
