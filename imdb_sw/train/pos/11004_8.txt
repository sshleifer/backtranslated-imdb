In the near future, a common man on any suspicion from the neighborhood Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is employed by a large organization, Digicorp, given the opportunity to spy and steal secrets from their competitors, Sunways. With his training, Morgan is a brain mix, taken to a new Jack Jacksby identity and goes to interesting teaching. In one of them, Rita Foster is good and wonderful (Lucy Liu), who advises him that nothing is seen. Morgan admits a new fact, where he does not know who can be trusted. Unknown "Cypher" was a great surprise to me. This film has not been removed from Brazil, but the most exciting and exciting story is very complex, with many points of conspiracy, and with great efficiency, leadership and presentations. At the end of the end, I remembered the "Total Note" of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In fact this movie deserves to look more than once, and I did not like the last event, when the independent spy isolate the hogs of quarrel in the sea. Just know the director Vicenzo Natali from the "Cube" amazing, and this second job I see is also amazing. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
