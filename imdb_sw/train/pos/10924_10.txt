I saw this kung fu movie when I was a child, and I thought it was too cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend has on DVD !!! We have a case of alcohol, and we look at this common! Lost NONE's original original kung fu! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... DVD available. I believe this movie is also called "Choose your poison". <br /> <br /> Watching soon!
