This of course was the best of the series "Dirty Harry". From the opening of the opening, you are locked in a retaliatory story that is hard and complicated. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a woman who has been broken up for revenge. Eastwood has many "edges" that do not have a connection to the plot, but to show Harry for the very best. Implemented by non-relentless characters in small tasks, this film begins and should be used as a detective / operating level. This is the evil of the Harry Harry which is raw and without any "fluff". I can look again and again (right, not directly) because it's fun “out of revenge” yarn. The action is fast and dozens of events cannot be remembered. "Go ahead - Make my day ... Do you feel lucky, punk? ...." Eastwood's classic like just Eastwood, and its sad words, of rubber, and whispery, a terrible voice can do it.
