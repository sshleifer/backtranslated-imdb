Since September last year, I have borrowed four to six films every week from the Harold Washington Library, which has a collection of attractive DVDs. (HWL is actually a library around: three-quarters of its films have been made available at any time!) Recently, I enjoyed getting David Lynch Movies. Yesterday, not knowing little about the series of animation, took Dumbland. I'm coming to report that, for David Lynch's fans, watching eight pieces is half an hour well spent. The most wonderful part of these short pieces is their voice sounds. Each section has its own rhythm. Breathing and decreasing systems provide circulation. Scary words ending. Physical violence provides materials. Pull the birds and bags around the round. Many features fill up orchestra. Frequent animation often keeps syncing with sound, but the sound of the voice itself touched me as Lynch's intention to create and distribute this work. By the way, these short are unique Lynchian. <br /> <br /> That said, the situation is odd, ugly, deep, silent and interesting as hell. And there is enough space in them to reflect on how we humans can feel. I can't say that I will look again at the collection, but for anyone who has been revealed in the movement that is the Inland Kingdom, Dumbland has a half hour value of your time.
