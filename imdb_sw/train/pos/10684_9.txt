While looking at the work of DeMille earlier, once again it has been confirmed to me that DeMille earlier is far away than DeMille late. Pay attention to the use of light within the events is amazing. His stimulation is very good, enabling a lot to be told in an hour or more. It is a pity that it was not intuitive about the style of future films as it appeared to be in its silent films. This was the first film I had seen Cleo Ridgely. He was extraordinary, completely prevented and still expressed a great sense of emotions. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing.
