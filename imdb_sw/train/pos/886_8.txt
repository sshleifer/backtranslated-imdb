This was one of the DVDs that I recently bought in six sets called "Frenchfilm" to beat our French before our planned holiday in Provence this year. So far, with the improvement of our French we have added a lot of thanks to the French film. <br /> <br /> It is a breath of fresh air for stale, predictable, unimportant, losing a wallop wall given by Hollywood. It is a good example for screenshots, executives, directors and cinema movies to follow. It was also stimulating to see two known characters in leadership roles without having the newspaper's newspaper green. Another thing I liked about this film was a slow and constructive attitude that made you think how it would all be finished. What? Is there any good in this selfish pig that continues to treat his visible assistant who has the kind of contempt that an old man would show? Does our depressed sex and half of the heroine show herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that eventually gives her? The viewer is fascinated by these questions and artists explain the answers slowly and persuasively when they find events that focus on and create their feelings for each other. You see this film, as I might want you to see again. I still need to do the psychological work of the director for a small plot in the role of a violent officer and some of the subtle elements of camera work have a second value. The program is asking for a little thought when our hero will be given the opportunity to help our heroine caused by the office work. You must also have a wider idea of ​​believing in the brilliant reading of the mouth and how some of that action is done. But if you are going on an exciting journey with this example of French film for better you will be more than satisfied. Four out of five stars for me.
