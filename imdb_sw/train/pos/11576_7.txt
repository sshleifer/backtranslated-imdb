It tries to be an epic adventure of the century. And by casting like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies are a true B-full adventure of all time. In fact it is a good pleasure, an adventure of swashbuckling which, even for its errors, attracts your interest. It must have felt like a great film for people who did it. Even though it has been done in the 90s, it does not feel modern. More has the same feeling that the old Errol Flynn film had it. A great movie of adventure is also a great thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feelings in them will not be the same as these old films. This on the other hand, has a real sense. You can't just hate it. I think it's a good movie of adventure. And I love sound. Damn, I want a theme of the theme.
