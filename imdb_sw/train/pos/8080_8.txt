Yes, I am used after a while to read comments about these movies that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better woman than here in his most popular movies. He was an old man who died, without forgiveness. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role that his villainy is not a kind of way down. The child who played Aryan was on his head while throwing. There I think maybe the director can do well. But, being honest, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. He is a brave heroine, a true past pastor who has been completed for every role given. But I must say I appreciated his contribution as playing wife of Virendra Sahi. He can be given a little to do, but he does everything for general faith. I am sure he climbed transport on the heads of many listeners. So if you have a tendency to deal with the average voice, you can't get a lot from this film. But if you are always looking for something else, then this can give you some of what you have lost.
