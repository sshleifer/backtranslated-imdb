Fully brilliant. Powerful and evocative. A great series of eternal documentation made on war. The voice is very different from the most common gung-ho behavior towards World War 2 which the media shows. Instead of choosing right on the fear of war, it allows the voice of the quietness of Sir Laurence Olivier to take the back seat for true war images: the dead everywhere, the explosion, the people feared the soldiers, the lost men, the politicians, the politicians, the thousands of lives, suffering the innocent. Most of all brings home that human beings can when all the common laws of "citizenship" are removed. There is something known for Hobbesian about a person in real nature, he will return to more than one form of crime that will still be shocking and attractive for 60 years. fear. I feel it's an enormous size that took the event that led to the death of 50 million people to produce a compulsory series and better like this.
