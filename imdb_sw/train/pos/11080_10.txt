First, when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone shares the Ritchie Guy to enter. They do not expect to explore new boundaries. This REVOLVER Movie is different than refusing; it's very dark and it's very hard. The reason I gave the 10th mark is because I have to look 3 stars to understand everything. So this film plays with your head. It's very wise. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was done surprisingly, the movie is beautiful, and you can recognize the touch of Guy Ritchie (the leading style) in it. What conquered me is the difficulty of the main character and how we are left more questions than answers.
