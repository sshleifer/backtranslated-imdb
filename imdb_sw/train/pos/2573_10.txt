When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet on the night of the film, there is one movie emphasizing regular check: You noted, K-911, the third phase in a very successful franchise of K-9 Dad favorite TV, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Folks, I knew it was possible to wear a VHS tape, but a DVD? This has played many times so that it starts flying; no joke! But of course you will have that when you have a beautiful film, it is a brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we deserve to thank one and only Tom Hanks just by introducing us to a variety of Cop-Dog lovers and Turner and Hooch; however, even the film is not available for the best quality shown on all three K-9 movies. Some speakers say Belushi lost steam and this third movie in a row. Poppycock, I say. Although you may criticize the third-party - direct-to-video, so - it may seem like something to watch, you could prove yourself a mistake after watching this high-quality film. <br /> <br /> give away a plot, but I will say Belushi and his girlfriend of panting give their best performance yet - one that will have you How to play with laughter! It is a shame John Belushi is not alive to see what his brother has done in the world of acting. I strongly recommend your daughter's daughter introduces this film to her BFFs on her sleepy party. Don't forget to puppy!
