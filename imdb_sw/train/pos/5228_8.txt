I've got this hilarious film. Spoofs on other popular movies of the time are some of the funniest I saw in this kind of movie. Try. If you have seen movies that this film is going to fall, and when you get humorous, you should enjoy the film. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched the film with me) saw the funniest section in the movie (this is not a spoiler because I will not tell you what is happening) was the scene that has "flashy thingy" from MIB. When you first discover the device and don't know what it is ... and again in the film ... you will understand when you get there. My only complaint about the film is that I never found it on the DVD so I could buy a copy.
