I look at this on the World Star website outside the country that buys America's and Canadian series for one or two season as The Jane Show. I thought how many female leading comedy shows Im really could look at herself, There is Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream Of Jeanie (one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes like an empty I can't think of others, all women support roles guide. So I, The Jane Show is in a very good company. One thing I just thought of. I have looked at some things made in Canada, and I don't remember anything that was done in the usual TV series that shows SNOW! It's all done in the summer, LOL! It is indeed a good place to live in a good climate during the summer but you would think, they would show a little bit of Canada during the winter since that's part of life too. I mean SCTV, Just to Launch coming in mind as two comedy shows that it lasted a long time in Canada with very little or no shot with snow now though they all do a lot of shots shot. I digress but I kind of chuckle in Jane and her open approach to freedom being accused of discrimination to her neighbor, and I like a bald guy and her gentleness, I found it according to the UK series called The IT Conference (I Think) another office pleasing to the female leadership. Not in any way the best comedy ever but for the guy to say he can watch it alone, that say something. If I were with my wife she would be very happy because she talks about sex in the office and things like that so it can be a good comedy of light for a couple looking. 7 out of 10.
