I saw the first "Glass Breaking" in 1980, and I think it would be one of the "Classics Movie". This film is a good look at the music industry and cast to great artists. This is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and anyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can't wait to be available on DVD.
