I have often wondered how much CASPER meant children ... and all the issues around its identity (in this film we lead to believe that he is the spirit of the dead child, if his house is a graveyard), as well as a mixing message brought by this film. Casper probably meant more like playing for ethics, or the popular Training felt like breaking up new ground in 'real' cartoons. <br /> <br /> KIWE TRADE BORA'S BORA is a good-course project there. But, the development of the plot associated with fox (who is a friend of Casper, but meets the end of the horrible) is concerned. <br /> <br /> Giving a popular studios - facing death and honor ... but, it is a picture of the Casper's mourning is instead of stimulating children and frustration (although the denouement provides the end of happiness, but I can't give the end), and The violence is rather a lot, even at 1940 levels. <br /> <br /> This may be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping to describe death for children - but I don't pop into the VCR for breaking a cartoon perky.
