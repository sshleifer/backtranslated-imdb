Breach is a movie that has found me by surprise. The type of layered animations which aims to write a play about his experience of life that happens to him at this time. To be more shorter, he feels that his wife is cheating him, and he employs a private eye to charge. His wife does not know that this happens. At the same time, actors in this game also have a few who are standing on their hands to cheat around each other and for, we'll say, people who are not worried in the world of Israel. The whole thing comes to the theater and all actors now living and predictable (but not true) happens. The director of the piece certainly keeps moving things together with the design of the pieces, and edited the way that makes you look, this is a really enjoyable film, which I didn't have to view and could suggest people to watch.
