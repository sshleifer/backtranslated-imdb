Music of Rene Clair. If you want to see where the songs first moved this story is the place. This is the story of a little starving star who sees that he has won a lottery as his creditors coming to call. Unfortunately his ticket is located in his coat, which is located in his young apartment and is given to a runner who is ... oh but that would be spells. This is a light and red story where a lot of conversations are singing (most people think this did not happen to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's a kind of films that they don't do anymore, and rarely did when they did. It appears films from early days that resemble films from five to six years later. Clair transfers his camera in such a way that even Busby Berkeley was not doing (although being loyal to comparing two filmmakers are right since Berkeley was doing a number of drums closed and Clair was moving the camera through "real world"). It's a wonderful movie. and his charming movie that will make you just smile. It's just a relaxing piece. Sorry, I can't say more. It's just a very good movie and that's all you need to know.
