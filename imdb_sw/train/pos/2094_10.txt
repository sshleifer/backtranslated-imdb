Indeed, 65 years have passed since the last Thalberg production was done. But fellow members of IMDB, come, this movie is certainly one of the best of 30 years! It is 10. This is the first movie I saw at New York's Art Museum, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive look still with the poverty epidemic, with beauty photography, often exciting, and always dedicated, I am MGM making the best decisions. How did the listeners feel when they finished the attack of the locust, the man for the destruction of the house, the terrible poverty and then the glory of wealth. Last week, those who were expecting the Academy Awards had a "senior" view of the Oscar winner, Luise Rainer. It is great to see an actor who actually gave a beautiful, haunting show in the history that chooses to return to the ceremony. Ok, so you should not win a year before (Great Ziegfeld), but do not blame Luise. Talki were only ten years when this was released, and his talks were reduced. But as Olan, its visual and sound use is remembered. <br /> <br /> Great and touch, what is more the movie partner you want!
