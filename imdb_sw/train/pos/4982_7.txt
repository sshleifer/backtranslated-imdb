I like these "Baby Diaper" movies! You can't make a film like this today and it is rich in movie history. It's goofy and the film was made to laugh, which makes it. How they got these children "act" I will never know. I think it is valuable and children make niche but also others who make this film as it shows naivet√© available in the early 30's. give someone a break from the real world. The fact that you can see movies for five cents is more than my knowledge, but then a penny for 25 cents also. It was a different time to set a completely different mind.
