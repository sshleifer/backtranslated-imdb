John (Ben Chaplin) is a swift clerk of the bank who lives in a small town not far from London. Although the Internet, they contact the Russian brides. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman? The boy may have privacy and shame, but he really has a good taste, isn't he?) And when they meet, he knows he doesn't speak English. The relationship between each other is basically limited to sex (again, think, a very bad situation for a boy, just with a kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On his birthday, two Russian friends of his visit. Then, a lot of surprises will happen. I loved this film: first, it is impossible to be 'label'. What is the black comedy, act, exciting movie? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is as good as usual, and I am very curious about her Russian: does she speak Russian with proper proper attention, or just does it? However, I got an enjoyable movie. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Isca Perfeita" ("Bait full")
