I watched this film often through my baby child who even today I can see all the discussions. And when I look now now make me happy and amazing yet laugh. I think it's amazing how they could teach animals especially cats to the extent that they are able to play the main role of the film feature. However I look now I can also unfortunately not be a jewel that I have been thinking about. But I would like to remember how I felt about it when I was a little looking at VHS on my TV fist which would have a cloud in yellow color. And considering it is a children's film, that's why I would like to give it to 10/10.
