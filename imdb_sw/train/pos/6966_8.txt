In general I was very impressed with experiments. The first minute of the fifteen minutes they were worried, as they felt that designers tried to create a false version of OC but this fear was closed when the terrorist event occurred and from the point of view on the landscape and situations that I do not see very much. <br /> <br /> BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but were essentially subtext, there is a viewer to reflect or ignore as they so choose. Here on the other side these lessons are the direction of the show and I found myself dismissing them as Ghost In The Shell and Matrix as reference points when looking and surprised by how well the themes were discussed. I think if you are a fan of two that I mentioned or another film / television show, which relate to the lessons I mentioned, I think you will find something here. According to the beginning of describing how the conditions we recognize in BSG came to believe that they called it in a very interesting way, I loved it especially how they described where Cylon's belief in the same God came from and created Caprica was modernized. The modern and modern technology is thrown to make it look at the future but not quite a stranger to us as viewers. The only real weakest spot I saw was the relationship between Greystone parents and an actor who plays 'Lacy Rand'. While I love Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson alone, with their events seemed to have no chemistry, it can now be less likely to develop their characters, but this is something that I think needs work. I've also got Magda Apanowicz that doesn't know in his role. This can also be subject to experience and time needed to develop, but during that time his work seemed to be compulsory and not entirely. <br /> <br /> According to experiments I am very happy to see where 'Caprica' goes into the future and hopefully it will touch the size that BSG once did.
