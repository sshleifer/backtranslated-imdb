The most satisfactory aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is both important and very good. The release of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as the love of Dan's love was a good decision; he is an exceptionally talented, intelligent, very attractive, and appreciative, good-looking for the part! If this film is made by Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a tragedy. Another amazing thing about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in mature comedy which comes out of three columns of the "frat pack" form: duck, young chicks of the shadow, and the joke of evil. "Dan in True Life" is cautious and happy, mind laughs around. While other comedies include or have close to a joke that scares viewers in laughing, jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more common and smart, and involves thinking for a part of the audience. My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious daughter, in the middle is played very hard by the executive of Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say if this was a personal choice for his part or election by the director. In any way, his behavior is non-genuine and offensive. But, this is just a small part in the film, and it is not recommended away from the general story. <br /> <br /> For all, "Dan in Real Life" is a good film, amazing escape from the decline of refusing and contaminated comedies. The quality of writing, leading, acting, and (especially) movies are excellent. It's just beautiful, comedy light heart.
