Carla is a deaf person who has no hearing aid. When he sees himself full of work, he has the ability to hire Paul to help him. Paul is out of prison, and his past is not back. To say more about the story, which has many changes, it will be done. The most interesting thing about this film is how the voice shows when Carla can hear and when it is not possible - a kind of "hearing point" (like view view). Preliminary events mentioned, along with the development of Carla and Paul's behavior, were more interesting to me than what was happening and coming back, some of which were hard to follow and / or spread a little loyalty. There is also unpleasant abuse. To return to the good side, the movie was very good. <br /> <br /> The film should see, but maybe not looking for. You have seen the San Francisco Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
