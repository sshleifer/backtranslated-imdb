This is one of these movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Hero Hero - which holds the attention of the viewer regularly. Lightweight Movies rarely win Oscars, but anyone who offers for a desk deserves one. Even after someone sees a movie and knows what is coming, it's still a pleasure to look at how different elements of the plot continue. True, the whole festival is melodrama; but that is quite suitable for film and background of the opera sample. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can't I write sh * t like that?" I think it is unfortunate that television and web advertisers insist on this unwanted environment.
