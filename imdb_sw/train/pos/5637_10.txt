I would just say that I have seen this film twice now and I love it! Acting is good and though it is the same plot as "Raising Your Voice" I think that the plot is not available for people who have the same kind. It has good lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything as we try. Amazing film. I am sure that this is one I will look for for a long time to come. Even though Britney Spears writes a book is a real plot, maybe not on the collapse of love section, but part of being different and striving but coming out better at the end is really true for real life. Suffering just a little bit why a great girl in these films is always good? What? Do you really think Holly would meet a perfect man of his dreams if he was bad or average? I urge you.
