I haven't seen this film for years so my skills are limited. I remember admitting that this film is two films of Braveheart. It is more realistic and more reliable. Ridb Roy looks like someone could think Rob Roy looked like, a mess hair and a beard with simple clothes. Also Liam Nesson is looking for Celtic on it, looks like Scot and most importantly looks like Rob Roy. It is a comparison that convinces some people but compares Mel Gibson to William Wallace. Gibson should play a man whose story has been described as a 7-foot-long when Gibson is almost a short leg. Myth has a little romance, plot and story below. Any sound like Braveheart? But instead of the "freedom" film, freedom and nationality we get a film that says respect, love and justice. This makes it the most interesting film. Much like Gladiator. Sent is amazing and Liam Nesson is a very powerful leader in this effort. The story is good and how it deals with courage and humanity. The area where Maria is raped and she walks out of the house that explodes and really look at Scotland is followed by washing semen from her crotch in terrific panic. This is something of the heroine in Braveheart can not do. In general this is stunning and almost watch flawless. Go see it!
