This is one of the first movies that I can remember, or maybe the first. Especially the best kind of film than to introduce a child, sweet, in a violent and violent world we lived. A little bit of Babe, Casino and Constantine, all of these are well mixed on the card, and we get this. I do not know if it is really counted children, but I think it was very cool, very interesting and interesting. I hate when the film (spescially carton) may have a good end and its impairment because all habits must have an end of happiness, even if it looks strange (not a bitter person). But this was the same, he just goes to heaven and they allow it that way. <br /> <br /> All this is a critic, his good movie is something new. very touching and I gotta go
