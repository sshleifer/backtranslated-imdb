Perhaps or, I would like to suspend any plot of formulaic in this film. I have visited many times and is always going on. Little is also delicate for some but I think any opera partner will love him. Norman Jewison, Canada's colleague, takes great opportunities with her movies and her casting and almost always pays in movies that are far away and somehow taste, like this. I have often wondered about the shortage of Cher's work, although she has chosen to reduce this part of her life or have no chance of chewing. I have found that it is a good actor who can get into the role, like in this one or loud and strong and sharp as in "Mask". I got comedic strokes sometimes (a hair salon called "Cinderella") but this was all the intention of the author and director. Nicolas Page shows the surprise of the opera, all the wonderful customer, one time seeking a knife to lose his throat. The Brooklyn exhibition is magical, this is Brooklyn under the best, interesting and exciting, like opera. All in a very satisfactory film is not for everyone's taste for long shooting, I loved the last, everyone brought together as a Greek chorus, all unrelated and mixing with others, a camera connecting away from the hall, leaving players talking. 8 out of 10.
