There are a few films or films that I watch for favorites over the years. The Gospel was one of them. I looked at this as a little boy and I would like a chance to look at it again. My favorite parts are the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was a blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / last evening was a great meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he liked play with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / his death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> Movies may not be political or brass, but it touched my heart at that time. Apart from me is a fan of Johnny's Money and is a brave project. If it comes from a DVD, I will buy it correctly for good reasons.
