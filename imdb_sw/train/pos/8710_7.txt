I remember this show from Sweden's television. I was only seven years old and was afraid of me. I would like to review this series again and see if it's as good as remembering though I see that my taste and needs have changed. br>> <br /> Although this was released before the visitor and other exhibitions of space I suspect that it has its roots in awesome movies from 50: s with the political state of 70: s. When I think, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss science and political questions about who we and what we are. Sci-fi words since then have been strong and became a word for any movie that has a space ship in them.
