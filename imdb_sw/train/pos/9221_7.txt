Once again, I was browsing through a reduced video video and I took this movie for $ 4.88. Thirty percent of the movies I get in bin are dirty dirty (I mean the most frightening of faith) but half when they turn into a really amazing. This movie is better than I expected. I saw it was a lot of participants, though it was obviously made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> Trends are not special, but the story is happy with some good fun. I expected to be the most comedy, but I wasn't very ambitious <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this film is awesome good-nature. No violence, no dirt, no dirt, no sex. Usually, these movies require all four components. Rating of PG deserves - not as "sixteen candle" where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short section free nude. I just love romance between Corey Haim and her love interests can be further developed. The film is a conspiracy, with good things can be moved away. Instead of developing chemistry between two of them, we end up looking at their three-minute montage for their romantic efforts. They live kissing at the end, but there is a little chemistry that seems to be forced. <br /> <br /> "Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. It is easy to forget - especially for the cast to an unknown, except for Haim - but it is also better than you would expect. My score: 7 (out of 10)
