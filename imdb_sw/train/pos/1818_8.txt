I saw this movie when I was 8 years old and I loved it but it never looked again at the age of 13 that I really understood what it was; The cartoon on dog criminals and a real heart of gold "adopt" a little girl to use him to her talent to talk to animals. The dog's star, Charlie B. Barkin, has been killed by his business partner, Carface, (who is quite heaven by way). His soul goes elsewhere except Heaven only to find the golden hour that is true during his life, which Charlie, slick but delightful that he steals and repeats again, permitting him back to the world. Once you return to the earth, Charlie goes closer and revenge on the evil Carface. That is how he comes to young Anne-Marie, the single orphan who can talk to the animals that Charlie struggles to get rid of her talents to return to her enemy Carface. But the scoundrel Charlie comes to take care of Anne-Marie young and her plans are frustrated if she must make her mind to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovered what "her best friend" Charlie has been spending on a new casino and better dog. Now he should save her from the fearful Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. The concept and plot are quite realistic and natural from many other animations. I especially like the idea that the dog has the responsibility of the villain at once. Carface was better than he was in all dogs going to the good heaven. In the picture he appeared to be very concerned with his role of criminals.
