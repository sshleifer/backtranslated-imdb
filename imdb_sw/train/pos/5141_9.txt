I agree, I did not expect to go to this film film in my Japanese film, but this film has hit me off. The director is doing a good job following the head of his film, actually showing a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silently increases the resemblance to madness, and helps the viewer experience the characters in the world rather than the world outside of his mind. This film has increased my feelings about foreign films against the United States, since foreign films do more work on exercising your mind and making you think instead of going to the fluffy film constantly and ending up happy, making little ideas.
