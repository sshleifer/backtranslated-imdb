I took it voluntarily from the library the other night, without the idea of ​​a film of worship, influence, or currently being done as music. (!) Many of the comments here are on target, are moving, funny, sad, and yes, tad effective despite the good goals of the film makers. The extended Chriterion version must be for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in the little Edie fall of class that kind of disappearance, you can hear in the old Jackie O movies too; people don't talk like that again. I think if the document, it would be interesting to get more information about how the house went out, Old Edie at least still seems to know what is going on at a certain level; Did he not see the house of once amazing spread? Yet the film lesson is a life in which two women have built themselves now, real life Tennesse Williams one act. Well value your time.
