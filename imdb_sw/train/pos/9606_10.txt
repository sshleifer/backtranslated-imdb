This was the best movie I had ever seen about Bulimia. It takes a real spot of what Bulimia is true and how not always about having skin and food. It showed how people of Bulimia think of things like their attitude towards life, friends and themselves. The best line and part of the truth with Bulimia, is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This verse showed a lot about the behavior and others with the same problem. It showed that people with Bulimia do not have this problem because of anything related to anyone else. It applies to them and them only. It shows that it is time to talk about someone who has a problem rather than putting all of them on their own. It showed that Beth needed to call for caution at the time and needed her mother's attention at that time.
