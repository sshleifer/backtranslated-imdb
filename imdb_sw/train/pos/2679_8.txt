Interestingly, next to a small piece of mood and more than LSD led by the devil then we need to remember when it is done! When you open SM amazing (which even doesn't seem) we move to a narrow direction and dream or imagination or remember? A lot of literature and movies and this is actually a Franco film which Lang himself praised. Good and measuring the film opens at the speed of independence but has wealth in every passage. A rare film is available inside. Old Jess can do 'em when he tried. Good performances also include Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I have never mentioned the sites of Lisbon - ah!
