Most of the snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your usual dragged out biopic, this fun and fabulous film has a look and feel of the era with the best soundtrack and everything you would like in indie-type film. I think the character would be to show Bettie Page as sex type vixen, like Jayne Mansfield. But if you look carefully at the possibility of Bettie, he always seemed happy. It's not "wish you could get me" looking for pride, neither "I do it just because my work work has not been done" look at the porn star. And so, women linked to this film (three female producers, female writer / director, female participant and Gretchen Mol, who I am sure caused this role and its influence of sugar) actually captured the idea of ​​sweet, small, girl's The south who enjoyed having his picture taken and hoped that a good JC would not be too bitter to him. Gretchen Mol gives a high performance function (he can have a perfect breasts forever), which I am happy about, because he had a curse. A few years ago, he made the cover of Vanity Fair when nobody knew who really was, telling him as a girl. And let's be clear, that was a little boast. I mean unfortunately he has never made it a Gwyneth situation, though it is not for lack of talent. Make a few options for the poor when you are a good blonde in the picture of Fickle lets you forget I am afraid. If this will not allow him on the A list, well I will be a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> For privacy, Bettie has not yet seen the film yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a note about and fell in love with her old fire, Jesus. Anything that flies your boat honey. You were a woman of hell. I hope you are happy wherever you are. Welcome to Mary Harron, you have made the right to our religious image.
