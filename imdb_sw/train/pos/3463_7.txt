I am a great fan of Beatles. My popular beatle is Paul and my favorite favorite is John. I knew quite a bit about the music of Beatles and the truth behind the break, with things like John Lennon's family and the wings of Paul's band. I was eager to see how this film could handle the relationship between John and Paul many years after breaking. It is not broken by this film. Although the story itself is a lie, many of the references that two musicians used were very accurate. These included how Yoko Ono was with John wherever he went, song "Silly Love Songs" that number one hit that year and the festival on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album "Let It Be." <br /> <br /> The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul. These words could have been used perhaps a little more, but they seemed to do more if I learned two-Beatles used as an act. I also liked the discussion between them, which was essentially what the entire film was. At the beginning I was desperate, but the more you think about it, the more you will feel, especially since this was how it was true in real life. It also shows a wonderful skit from “Saturday Night Live” where Beatles supplied $ 3,000 to make on the show. (compared to 220 million others gave them) In general, I was not interested in this film. It really gives you more to feel why the Beatles broke and why they never come back together.
