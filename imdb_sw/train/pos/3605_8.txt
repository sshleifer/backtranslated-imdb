The girlfight is using a special formula as someone said, however, I have seen a lot of movies that do not do it well or that this is not reliable. I believe it is the easiest way for the woman to feel the character and in that way feel more touched by the film. <br /> <br /> The movie encourages both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different, I think the viewer can get a lot to see this. although I took 5 years to start boats and games in general, this is a movie that gave me a spark. <br /> <br /> So the plot is normal / normal. The executives are good. but the ideas that can shine are what makes up the average in my opinion. it made a great impression on me and I know not only me.
